Such an expansive\n                              interpretation is not feasible in light of the rule of `ejusdem\n                              generis&#x27; and the considerations which govern the interpretation\n                              of statutes in relation to scientific advancements. We have also\n                              elaborated how the compulsory administration of any of these\n                              techniques is an unjustified intrusion into the mental privacy of\n                              an individual.

Invocations of a compelling\n                              public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional rights\n                              such as the `right against self-incrimination&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                              223.

Doing so would amount to an unwarranted\n                              intrusion into personal liberty. However, we do leave room for\n                              the voluntary administration of the impugned techniques in the\n                              context of criminal justice, provided that certain safeguards are\n                              in place.

In sensitive matters\n\n                        involving allegations of paternity, such tests cannot be ordered as a\n\n                        matter of course. Unless the Petitioner satisfies the initial burden of\n\n                        proof and establishes a strong prima facie case, such an intrusive test\n\n                        cannot be permitted.

The long and unexplained delay of nearly\n\n                        two decades, absence of any documentary or supporting material, the\n\n                        legal presumption of legitimacy under <a href=\"/doc/20238/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 116</a> of the Bharatiya\n\n                        Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, and the privacy concerns involved all weigh\n\n                        heavily against the claim of the Petitioner.
