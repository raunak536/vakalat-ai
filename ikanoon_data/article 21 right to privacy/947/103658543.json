Oka &amp; M.S. Sonak, JJ.)\n\nin Writ Petition Nos.10835/2018, 9748/2018 &amp; OS Writ Petition\n\n(L) No.3172/2018, decided on 3.4.2019. The Division Bench\n\nconsidered various judgments passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt and discussed many issues. First and foremost, the Division\n\nBench referred to the order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court passed\n\nin Writ Petition (Civil) No.928/2017, wherein it was observed that\n\nsuch cases could be filed in the respective High Courts having\n\nterritorial jurisdiction. In paragraph-116, the Division Bench has\n\nobserved that in such cases Writ Petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India will have to be instituted in this Court if the\n\nPetitioner resides within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court or\n\nif the cause of action arises within the territorial jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt to seek permission for termination of her pregnancy if such\n\ntermination is not immediately necessary to save her life, but,\n\nwhere she alleges that the circumstances set out in clauses (i) &amp;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">(ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act exist.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">16.           The Division Bench also considered whether expression\n\n&#x27;life&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 5</a> of the MTP Act was to be construed narrowly as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                              9 / 15</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/02/2020               ::: Downloaded on - 27/02/2020 22:05:02 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                 10</span>\n                                                                         wp-1677-2020.odt\n\n\nantithesis to death or physical survival or whether it had to be\n\nliberally      interpreted           adopting    the   principles     of     purposive\n\ninterpretation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">17.           In paragraphs-79 and 80, the Division Bench observed\n\nthat in a situation where the continuance of pregnancy poses grave\n\ninjury to the physical or mental health of the mother, if the\n\npregnant mother is forced to continue with her pregnancy merely\n\nbecause the pregnancy had extended beyond the ceiling of 20\n\nweeks, there would arise a serious affront to the fundamental right\n\nof such mother to privacy, to exercise reproductive choices, to\n\nbodily integrity and to her dignity.                 It was further observed that\n\nthe principle of liberal or purposive construction would harmonize\n\nthe provision in <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 5</a> of the MTP Act with the constitutional\n\nprovisions. Based on some Supreme Court judgments, the Division\n\nBench went on to observe that the right to life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article\n\n21</a> included the right to live with human dignity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">18.

It was further held that, this Court, in exercise of its\n\nextraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of\n\nIndia, can permit medical termination of pregnancy the length of\n\nwhich exceeds 20 weeks, in contingencies set out in clauses (i) and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">(ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act.

The Division Bench had further held that if medical\n\ntermination of pregnancy was permitted and inspite of that if the\n\nchild was born alive, then the registered Medical Practitioner and\n\nthe hospital concerned was required to assume full responsibility\n\nto ensure that such child is offered best medical treatment\n\navailable in the circumstances and in such cases if the parents of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                            11 / 15</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/02/2020              ::: Downloaded on - 27/02/2020 22:05:02 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                      12</span>\n                                                              wp-1677-2020.odt\n\n\nsuch child were not willing to or are not in a position to assume\n\nthe responsibility for such child, then, the State and its agencies\n\nwill have to assume full responsibility for such child in the best\n\ninterests of such child and in accordance with the statutory\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_24\">Juvenile Justice Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">21.

The\n\nPetitioner and her parents had expressed desire before the Board\n\nto terminate the pregnancy.
