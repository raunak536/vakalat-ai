Therefore, the change of\n                circumstances pleaded is only that the nominal\n                amount filed by the Court does not serve the purpose\n\n\n\n\n                                          of\n                for which it was fixed, since she is not able to get\n                with the same amount of Rs. 50/- the same quantity\n                of goods as in the year 1976. This is a real change in\n                   rt\n                the circumstances which the Court has necessarily to\n                take into account. It is the duty of the Court to see\n\n                that the amount of maintenance is not only the same\n                in nominal terms but remains the same in real terms.\n                In the case of salaried people, the restoration of the\n                salary to the real terms is achieved by way of grant\n\n\n                of dearness allowance. Enhancement of maintenance\n                on account of rise of cost of living index would serve\n                the same purpose and does not bring about any\n\n\n\n\n                modification of the real amount and does not require\n                any special change in the circumstances of the\n\n\n\n\n\n                person. As pointed out, the simple fact that the\n                nominal amount does not represent the same real\n                amount as granted, is a sufficient change in the\n\n\n\n\n\n                circumstances.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">    16.

It is a matter of\n                discretion of the court whether to allow enhanced\n\n\n                maintenance from the date of the application or from\n                the date of the order. It appears that the initial\n                maintenance was fixed at Rs. 50. 00 for the wife and\n\n\n\n\n                Rs. 100. 00 per month for the son, which was\n                increased to Rs. 175. 00 and Rs. 225. 00 respectively,\n\n\n\n\n\n                presumably because of the increase in the cost of\n                living as well as the fact that the son was old enough\n                to go to school and the wife would have to incur\n\n\n\n\n\n                additional expenses on his education. It appears that\n                the husband had incurred liability to pay instalments\n                by obtaining loans, but that is no reason why the wife\n                and the minor child should be denied maintenance\n                which is just sufficient for keeping body and soul\n                together.

The findings are also not final and the\n                      rt\n                parties can agitate their rights in the Civil Court.

The learned\n                Additional Sessions Judge was very much justified in\n\n\n\n\n\n                setting aside such order of the learned Magistrate. In\n                my considered view, the order passed by the\n                Additional learned Sessions Judge does not suffer\n\n\n\n\n\n                from any illegality and I do not find any reason to\n                interfere with the same.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">    20.

A\n        similar contention as raised in this case was\n        raised before the Apex Court. In the cited case,\n\n\n\n\n\n        the application under <a href=\"/doc/94809/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 125</a> CriP.C. was\n        filed   on   1-9-1995.      The    Magistrate    granted\n        maintenance @ Rs. 350/- per month by his order,\n\n\n\n\n                                   of\n        dated 31-7-1999. The High Court enhanced the\n        quantum awarded to the child from Rs. 350/- to\n        Rs. 500/- with effect from the order passed by\n          rt\n        the Magistrate. The said amount of maintenance\n        was enhanced by the Apex Court. Considering\n\n        the peculiar facts of the case, the Apex Court\n        rejected the contention of the learned Counsel\n        therein that as there was no amendment made to\n        the claim petition for the enhancement the Court\n\n\n        cannot grant more than the amount claimed,\n        observing that such a plea is too technical.\n        Therefore, in view of the cited decision of the Apex\n\n\n\n\n        Court, it cannot be said that the Sessions Judge\n        has got no power to grant maintenance more than\n\n\n\n\n\n        the amount claimed in the petition for the period\n        subsequent     to    the        amendment       of <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n        125</a> Cr.P.C. as <a href=\"/doc/778934/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 127</a> Cr.P.C. empowers the\n\n\n\n\n\n        Court   to   enhance      the     maintenance    granted\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. on proof of a change in\n        the circumstances. <a href=\"/doc/778934/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 127</a> Cr.P.C. does not\n        mandate that an application is required to be filed\n        to enhance the maintenance amount.

The learned Sessions Judge\n        considered     the    evidence       adduced     and    also\n\n\n\n\n\n        admissions made by the petitioner-husband and\n        enhanced the maintenance to Rs. l,000/-.

He also admitted that he is having\n        LIG quarter and he is also getting rents from the\n\n\n        mulgies    constructed in         1000 sq. yards          at\n        Ramachandrapuram. It is, therefore, clear from\n        his evidence that the respondent is having\n\n\n\n\n        substantial properties and getting rents and also\n        drawing his gross salary of Rs. 18.485/-. The\n\n\n\n\n\n        revision petitioner claimed maintenance of Rs.\n        1000/-     per     month      only.     Considering      the\n\n\n\n\n\n        &#x27;standard of life of the respondent, present cost\n        of living and other circumstances, I feel the claim\n        of the revision petitioner for Rs. 1000/- per\n        month towards her maintenance is just and\n        reasonable. The revision petitioner is therefore,\n        entitled to maintenance of Rs. 1,000/- per month\n        with effect from 24-9-2001 &#x27;as prayed for.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                             From the above said order, it is\n         clear that the respondent himself admitted about\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:38:39 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                    18</span>\n\n\n\n        his getting gross salary of Rs. 18,485/- per\n        month, having three storeyed building in Kothi,\n        Hyderabad besides 1000 sq. yards of site in\n\n\n\n\n                                                                .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        which mulgles were constructed and getting\n\n\n\n\n\n        rents from the mulgies besides having one LIG\n        quarter at Ramachandrapuram.

The\n        learned Sessions Judge enhanced the costs from\n        Rs. 500/- to Rs. 5,000/-. As the petitioner\n        approached the several Courts, I do not find that\n        the Sessions Judge is not justified in granting\n        Rs. 5,000/- towards costs.

Preamble     to     the\n        Constitution of India clearly signals that we have\n        chosen the democratic path under rule of law to\n        achieve the goal of securing for all its citizens,\n\n\n        justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. It specifically\n        highlights achieving their social justice. Therefore, it\n        becomes the bounden duty of the Courts to advance\n\n\n\n\n        the cause of          the social justice.

The Court as the interpreter of law is\n\n\n\n\n\n         supposed        to      supply             omissions,            correct\n         uncertainties, and harmonize results with justice\n         through a method of free decision &quot;libre recherch\n         sceintifique&quot; i.e. &quot;free Scientific research&quot;. We are of\n         the   opinion    that        there      is      a     non-rebuttable\n         presumption that the Legislature while making a\n         provision like <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C., to fulfill its\n         Constitutional duty in good faith, had always\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:38:39 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                     22</span>\n\n\n\n        intended to give relief to the woman becoming\n        &quot;wife&quot; under such circumstances.

Thus, while interpreting a statute the\n\n\n\n\n                                   of\n         court may not only take into consideration the\n         purpose for which the statute was enacted, but\n         also the mischief it seeks to suppress. It is this\n          rt\n         mischief rule, first propounded in Heydon Case,\n         1854 3 CoRep.7a,7b which became the historical\n\n         source of purposive interpretation. The court\n         would also invoke the legal maxim construction ut\n         res magis valeat guam pereat, in such cases i.e.\n         where alternative constructions are possible the\n\n\n         Court must give effect to that which will be\n         responsible for the smooth working of the system\n         for which the statute has been enacted rather\n\n\n\n\n         than one which will put a road block in its way. If\n         the choice is between two interpretations, the\n\n\n\n\n\n         narrower of which would fail to achieve the\n         manifest purpose of the legislation should be\n         avoided. We should avoid a construction which\n\n\n\n\n\n         would reduce the legislation to futility and should\n         accept the bolder construction based on the view\n         that Parliament would legislate only for the\n         purpose of bringing about an effective result. If\n         this interpretation is not accepted, it would\n         amount to giving a premium to the husband for\n         defrauding the wife.

Merely      because either      of     the\n                   parties have disputed a factum of paternity does\n                   not mean that the Court should direct DNA test or\n                   such other test to resolve the controversy. The\n                     rt\n                   parties should be directed to lead evidence to prove\n                   or disprove the factum of paternity and only if the\n\n                   Court finds it impossible to draw an inference or\n                   adverse inference on the basis of such evidence on\n                   record or the controversy in issue cannot be\n\n\n                   resolved without DNA test, it may direct DNA test\n                   and not otherwise.           In     other    words, only in\n                   exceptional and deserving cases, where such a test\n\n\n\n\n                   becomes indispensable to resolve the controversy\n                   the Court can direct such test. DNA test, in any\n\n\n\n\n\n                   case, cannot be directed as a matter of routine. The\n                   Courts should record reasons as to how and why\n                   such test in the case is necessary to resolve the\n\n\n\n\n\n                   controversy    and      is     indispensable.        That     is\n                   necessary     since    a     result     of    such   test,    in\n                   matrimonial and succession cases, being negative\n                   will have an effect of branding a child as a bastard\n                   and the mother as an unchaste women as noted\n                   <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_120\">inGoutam Kundu v.
