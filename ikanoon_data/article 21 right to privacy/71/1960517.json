He, therefore submitted that this\ninformation should be provided to him and cannot be denied by the CPIO\nwithout application of mind simply because the third party has an objection to\ndisclosure.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       The grounds of withholding the information in this case can only be\ninvocation of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act 2005 on the basis of invasion of\nprivacy.

We have no equivalent of UK&#x27;s Date Protection Act, 1998,\nSec 2 of which, titled &#x27;Sensitive Personal Data&#x27;, reads as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       &quot;In this Act &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; means personal data\n       consisting of information as to:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       a)     The racial or ethnic origin of the data subject.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">       b)     His political opinions.\n       c)     His religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature.\n       d)     Whether he is a member of a Trade Union.\n       e)     His physical or mental health or condition.\n       f)     His sexual life.\n       g)     The commission or alleged commission by him of any\n              offence.\n       h)     Any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">              have been committed by him, the disposal of such\n              proceedings or the sentence of any court in such\n              proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">       If we were to construe privacy to mean protection of personal data, this\nwould be a suitable starting point to help define the concept. At any rate\nCPIO has under the orders of first appellate authority taken the precaution of\nreferring the matter to Shri Rajender Jaina, third party, as required<a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_12\"> u/s 11 (1)</a>.\nThe US Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts, 652 on the other hand,\ndefines the invasion of Privacy in the following manner:\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       3</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       One, who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon\n      the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or\n      concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his\n      privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable\n      person.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      However, the plea of appellant Shri Prakash Jus Roy is that the larger\npublic interest will warrant disclosure. Therefore, before taking any further\ndecision in this matter we decided that we should give third party Shri\nRajender Jaina the opportunity to be heard.          Therefore the case was\nadjourned to 20th January, 2009 at 12.30 p.m. when Shri Rajender Jaina of\nFlat P, Sagar Apartments, 6, Tilak Marg, New Delhi was also to be asked to\nbe present to determine from him his objection to disclosing the information\nsought.

In light of this the hearing was\nfurther adjourned to 3rd February 2009 at 11.00 AM regarding which parties\nwere informed including the representative of Shri Rajender Jena on &#x27;phone.\nAccordingly, the following appeared before us on 3-2-09:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      Appellants\n      Shri Prakash Jus Roy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      Shri Pranay Jus Roy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      Respondents\n      Shri V.S.

Having heard the arguments over three sessions and examined the record\nwe find that the key issue is whether the information sought is held by the\npublic authority and would, in light of the third party&#x27;s objection given<a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_25\"> u/s 11 (1)</a>\nof the RTI Act, if disclosed constitute an invasion of privacy of Shri Rajinder\nJaina.    Clearly, the information sought, if given, cannot interfere with the\nproceedings of a trial court before which we are given to believe there are\nseveral cases pending between the third party Shri Jaina and appellant Shri\nPrakash Jus Roy. There is also no ground for evoking <a href=\"/doc/1890761/\" id=\"a_26\">sections 52</a> to <a href=\"/doc/785774/\" id=\"a_27\">55</a> of\nthe Indian Evidence Act 1972 since the character of the parties concerned\nhave no bearing on the matter concerning simply the disclosure of information\nheld by a Public Authority. The key issue, therefore, remains whether such\ndisclosure will amount to an invasion of privacy and therefore, qualifies for\nexemption<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_28\"> u/s 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_9\">2. Right of privacy is not expressly guaranteed. However, the Supreme Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_29\">Kharak Singh</a>&#x27;s case (AIR 1963 SC 1295) held that right to privacy is a\nguaranteed right under the Constitution of India.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15059075\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_30\">Rajagopal v.

Union of India</a>, (1997)\nISCC 301 Supreme Court reiterated the law that right to privacy is part of the\nright to &#x27;life&#x27; and &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution. In these decisions, the Supreme Court placed reliance on the\nInternational Treaties to which India is signatory and came to a conclusion\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> read with relevant Article in the International Treaty/Covenant\nwould lead to a conclusion that right to privacy is part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21.</a></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_12\">3.

Whether the right to privacy can be\nclaimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on facts of each\ncase. Describing the origin of the right to privacy. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_35\">Raj Gopal</a>&#x27;s case observed as follows: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       &quot;The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept\n       originated in the field to Tort Law, under which a new cause of\n       action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy\n       was recognised. This right has two aspects which are but two\n       faces of the same coin: (1) the General law of privacy which\n       affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful\n       invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to\n       the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against\n       unlawful governmental invasion. The first aspect of this right\n       must be said to have been violated where, for example, a\n       person&#x27;s name or likeness is used, without his consent, for\n       advertising or non-advertising purposes or for that matter, his\n       life-story is written- whether laudatory or otherwise-and\n       published without his consent as explained hereinafter. In recent\n       times, however, this right has acquired a constitutional status.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">4.     Accordingly, taping of telephone conversation has been held to be\ninfringement of the right of privacy. Similarly, surveillance by police has been\nheld to be an invasion of this right that gives cause of action for tortuous\nliability besides the right to enforce through constitutional courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_14\">5.     The broad principles concerning the law of privacy were summarized\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_36\">Raj Gopal</a>&#x27;s case and accordingly, it was held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">              (1)    A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his\n                     own,     his    family,    marriage,    procreation,\n                     motherhood, childbearing and education among\n                     other matters.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">              (2)    None can publish anything concerning the above\n                     matters without his consent - whether truthful or\n                     otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he\n                     does so, he would be violating the right to privacy\n                     of the person concerned.         But a publication\n                     concerning     the     above    aspects    becomes\n                     unobjectionable, if such publication is based upon\n                     public records including court records. Once\n                     something becomes a matter of public record, the\n                     right of privacy no longer exists.         The only\n                     exception to this could be in the interest of\n                     decency.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                         8</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">               (3)     In the case of public officials, it is obvious that right\n                      of privacy or for that matter, remedy of action for\n                      damages is simply not available with respect to\n                      their acts and conducts relevant to the discharge\n                      of their official duties.

The right of privacy has not been held to be an absolute right. The\nimpact of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_37\">Right to Information Act</a> on the law of privacy has also come up\nfor judicial scrutiny in a few cases. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"251249\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/251249/\" id=\"a_38\">K.J.

The Madras High Court observed that with the advent of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_39\">Right to\nInformation Act</a>, the bank has become obliged to disclose the information to\nthe public. It also observed that <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 3</a> of the Act entitles a citizen to the\nright of information. <a href=\"/doc/342710/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 4(2)</a> of the said Act obliges a Public Authority to\ndisclose information to common people.          Even personal information or an\ninformation, which may otherwise amount to an invasion of privacy, may also\nbe disclosed if the larger public interest so warrants. The Hon&#x27;ble Court in\nfact came to the conclusion that the right to privacy virtually fades out in front\nof the &#x27;Right to Information&#x27; and &#x27;larger public interest.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">7.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160547308\" id=\"span_17\">In &quot;<a href=\"/doc/160547308/\" id=\"a_42\">R.

Therefore, there is nothing secret about the income\n       received by him. Further it also cannot be stated that the\n       disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest.\n       The case of the fourth respondent is, if this information is\n       disclosed it would show that the petitioner&#x27;s wife would not\n       satisfy one of the criteria subject to which the LPG\n       distributorship is allotted. This allotment of distributorship cannot\n       be arbitrary and contrary to rules and if there is some factor,\n       which would vitiate the selection process, then it would definitely\n       be a matter of public interest. In any event, the income received\n       by an individual from a public sector undertaking cannot be\n       private information. Information relating for example as to\n       whether a particular person is tested HIV positive might be a\n       matter which intrudes into the privacy of the individual, but not\n       the monthly income which a person is receiving from a public\n       sector undertaking which is subject to income tax.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"570038\" id=\"span_19\">8.

Hospital ,Mumbai, the medical\nrecords of the writ petitioner. In his application, it was set out that it was in\npublic interest to know why a convict is allowed to stay in an air-conditioned\ncomfort of the hospital and that there has been intensive questioning about\nthis aspect in the media and the people&#x27;s mind. The following observations of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Court in this regard are worth quoting: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">       &quot;The question then is what is the true import of the proviso,\n       which sets out that the information which cannot be denied to\n       Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any\n       person. Are the medical records maintained of a patient in a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                        10</span>\n           public hospital covered by the provisions of the Act? Can this\n          information be withheld to either Parliament or State Legislature\n          as the case may be on the ground that such information is\n          confidential? To our mind generally such information normally\n          cannot be denied to Parliament or the State Legislature unless\n          the person who opposes the release of the information makes\n          out a case that such information is not available to Parliament or\n          the State Legislation under the Act. By its very constitution and\n          the plenary powers, which the Legislature enjoys, such\n          information cannot be denied to Parliament or State Legislature\n          by any public authority. As the preamble notes, the Act is to\n          provide for setting out a practical regime of right to information\n          for citizens, to secure access to information under the control of\n          public authorities as also to promote transparency and\n          accountability in the working of every public authority. These\n          objects of the legislature are to make our society more open and\n          public authorities more accountable. Normally, therefore, all\n          such information must be made readily available to a citizen\n          subject to right of privacy and that information having no\n          relationship to any public authority or entity 1 . In the instant\n          case the respondent No. 2 while granting the application of\n          respondent No. 5, has given as reasons larger public interest\n          and as that the information could not be withheld from\n          Parliament or State Legislature. The learned Associate\n          Advocate General informed us that the State Assembly has not\n          framed any Rules in the matter of receiving information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">          The test always in such matter is between private rights of a\n          citizen and the right of third person to be informed. The third\n          person need not give any reason for his information.\n          Considering that, we must hold that the object of the Act, leans\n          in favour of making available the records in the custody or\n          control of the public authorities.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">9.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"570038\" id=\"span_21\">In <a href=\"/doc/570038/\" id=\"a_46\">the above case</a>, on behalf of the petitioner, it was also contended\nthat the medical records are confidential and considering the Indian Medical\nCouncil (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002\nframed under <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_47\">Indian Medical Council Act, 1956</a>, the information as sought\nshould not be revealed unless the revelation is required by the law of the\nState.
