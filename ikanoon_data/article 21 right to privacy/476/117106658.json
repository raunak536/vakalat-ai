According to the plaintiff, he is the president of the Pattali Makkal\n\n                     Katchi which is registered political party. The founder of Pattali Makkal\n\n                     Katchi is one Dr.S.Ramadoss and his son Dr.Anbumani Ramadoss is the\n\n                     Youth Wing Leader of the said party.

The plaintiff would further allege that the 3rd defendant is the\n\n                     founder leader of the India Jananayaka Katchi and is also the founder of the\n\n                     1st respondent which is running a Television Channel in the name of\n\n                     Pudhiyathalaimurai Television. The 2nd respondent who is the son of the 3rd\n\n                     respondent happens to be the Managing Director of the 1st respondent\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                           5</span>\n\n                     Company. The 3rd respondent is also the founder of SRM University which\n\n                     runs a group of Educational Institutions including a Medical College. During\n\n                     June 2016, there were several allegations against the institutions run by the\n\n                     3rd respondent and parents of the affected students approached the founder\n\n                     leader of the plaintiff’s party Dr.S.Ramadoss. In order to espouse the\n\n                     grievances of the parents, it appears that the founder leader Dr.S.Ramadoss\n\n                     had issued a statement on 22.06.2016 demanding the Government to take\n\n                     action against the 3rd respondent’s institution and also sought for CBI\n\n                     Investigation on the affairs of the institutions. This demand made by the\n\n                     founder leader of the Plaintiff’s party led to the 3rd respondent being arrested\n\n                     and subsequently the entire money collected from the students was paid\n\n                     back and the Criminal proceedings were closed by the Hon’ble Supreme\n\n                     Court. This according to the plaintiff led to the serious misunderstanding\n\n                     between the leaders of the plaintiff’s party, the 3rd respondent and the 2nd\n\n                     respondent who also happens to hold an important post in the University\n\n                     namely, SRM University, run by the 3rd respondent\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">                           4. In view of the fact that the founder leader of the plaintiff’s party was\n\n                     responsible for the investigation being speeded up the 2nd and 3rd\n\n                     respondents nurture malice against the plaintiff’s party and its leaders\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                              6</span>\n\n                     including the founder leader Dr.S.Ramadoss. This led to a vilification\n\n                     campaign being carried out by the 2nd and 3rd respondents using the media\n\n                     namely, Puthiyathalaimurai Television Channel run by the 1st respondent. It\n\n                     is also claimed that right from the date on which the allegations against the\n\n                     University belonging to the 2nd and 3rd respondents were made by the\n\n                     founder leader of the plaintiff’s party, the plaintiff’s party and its leaders were\n\n                     totally blacked out by the Television channel run by the respondents.\n\n                     However, in the recent past, particularly after the plaintiff’s party forged an\n\n                     alliance with ruling parties in the Centre and the State, the respondents have\n\n                     started a campaign with sole aim of maligning the plaintiff’s party and its\n\n                     leaders.

This according to the plaintiff is likely to cause irreparable damage\n\n                     to the reputation of the plaintiff’s party and its leaders apart from having a\n\n                     huge impact on the fortunes of the plaintiff’s party in the upcoming Lok\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                           7</span>\n\n                     Sabha Elections. The plaintiff would further allege that the fact that the 3 rd\n\n                     respondent has been giving out interviews in various news channels as well\n\n                     as social media websites making wild and false allegations against the\n\n                     plaintiff’s party and its leaders would demonstrate that the 3rd respondent is\n\n                     nurturing personal vendata and malice against the plaintiff’s party and its\n\n                     leaders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">                            6.

The Television Channel namely,\n\n                     Puthiyathalaimurai Television run by the 1st respondent is used by the\n\n                     respondents 2 and 3 for their malicious campaign. Therefore, the plaintiff\n\n                     would seek an order of temporary injunction restraining the respondents\n\n                     from publishing or telecasting any interview either defaming or maligning the\n\n                     leaders of the plaintiff’s party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                            8</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">                             7.

The primary contention of the respondents 1 and 2 is that the 3rd\n\n                     respondent has nothing to do with them. The Puthiyathalaimurai Television\n\n                     Channel, according to them, is not run by the SRM Group of Institutions or\n\n                     the 3rd respondent. According to the 2nd respondent, the Television\n\n                     Channel is an independent Company which has nothing to do with the SRM\n\n                     Institutions or the 3rd respondent. Similarly, the political party namely, India\n\n                     Jananayaka Katchi has also nothing to do with the Puthiyathalaimurai\n\n                     Television. According to them, the plaintiff has used the fact that the 2 nd\n\n                     respondent happen to be the son of the 3rd respondent to his own\n\n                     advantage to make it appear that the 1st respondent as well as the 2nd\n\n                     respondent are under the control of the 3rd respondent.

It is also contended\n\n                     that it is the duty of the media to bring out news about different political\n\n                     leaders. Referring to the debate that was telecast on 02.03.2019, it is\n\n                     contended by the 3rd respondent that the views of Mr.Velmurugan cannot be\n\n                     attributed to the channel and at best they amount to fair comments. It is also\n\n                     claimed that the statements made by the leader of the Viduthalai Chruthaikal\n\n                     Katchi Mr.Thol Thirumavalavan, are also his personal views and they have\n\n                     been uploaded on the social media by the 1st respondent which the 1st\n\n                     respondent is entitled to as a media house.

While elaborating on the contentions of the plaintiff Mr.N.L.Rajah,\n\n                     learned Senior Counsel appearing for the plaintiff would strenuously contend\n\n                     that the right to free speech is not an absolute or untrammeled right.\n\n                     According to him, the right to free speech can be subject to the reasonable\n\n                     restrictions. In a civilised society, nobody can claim an absolute right to\n\n                     malign or defame a political opponent or others. Citing malice on the part of\n\n                     the 3rd respondent, Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned Senior Counsel would contend\n\n                     that the respondents 2 and 3, who happened to be father and son have a\n\n                     controlling Authority over the 1st respondent and the television channel run\n\n                     by it. Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned Senior Counsel would also point out that the\n\n                     claim of the respondents that the 1st respondent is an independent entity\n\n                     and the 3rd respondent has nothing to do with the said entity is based on the\n\n                     statutory status of the 1st respondent and not the actual position.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">                           16.

The 2nd respondent also\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                            13</span>\n\n                     happens to be the son of the 3rd respondent.

Citing the above relationships\n\n                     Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned Senior Counsel would contend that the claim of the\n\n                     respondents that these institutions are totally independent of each other\n\n                     cannot be countenanced. It is his further contention of that some of the\n\n                     interviews and statements made by the 3rd respondent would clearly\n\n                     demonstrate that the 3rd respondent has got personal animosity and he\n\n                     nurtures malice against the plaintiff’s party and its leader.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">                           17.

He would also submit that\n\n                     pursuant to the criminal cases that were launched, the 3rd respondent has\n\n                     repaid the entire amount claimed, by the students and their parents, to have\n\n                     been paid to an associate of the 3rd respondent, which led to the scrapping\n\n                     of the Criminal cases and quashing of the First Information Reports.\n\n                     Mr.N.L.Rajah, would strenuously argue that these instances led to the 3rd\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                          14</span>\n\n                     respondent harbouring a personal vendata against the plaintiff’s party and its\n\n                     founder leader.

While these events which led to the\n\n                     arrest of the 3rd respondent are shown as reasons for the 3rd respondent\n\n                     raising a banner of revolt against the plaintiff’s party and its leaders. The\n\n                     following interviews and statements made by the 3rd respondent and the\n\n                     news channel namely Pudhiyathalaimurai Television are projected as\n\n                     grounds for the prayer for injunction. It is claimed that on 26.02.2019, the\n\n                     Pudhiyathalaimurai Television Channel published a new item which claimed\n\n                     that the youth wing leader of the plaintiff’s party namely, Dr.Anbumani\n\n                     Ramadoss had abruptly cancelled the press meet after entering into\n\n                     arguments with the reporters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">                           18.

There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\n\n                            above – indeed, this is not an exception but an independent\n\n                            rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to\n\n                            privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is\n\n                            simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                          19</span>\n\n                           relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so\n\n                           even where the publication is based upon facts and\n\n                           statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\n\n                           that the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\n\n                           disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the\n\n                           defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he\n\n                           acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not\n\n                           necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of\n\n                           course, where the publication is proved to be false and\n\n                           actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant\n\n                           would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is\n\n                           equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge of\n\n                           his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any\n\n                           other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no\n\n                           reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to\n\n                           punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislature\n\n                           protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_8\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_9\">104</a>\n\n                           respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions\n\n                           to this rule.”</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                          23.

The remedy by way of action for defamation in such cases\n\n                     becomes a tooth less remedy. Even in kartar Singh’s case, the Hon’ble\n\n                     Supreme Court had acknowledged that the slogans that were raised during\n\n                     the rally where certainly defamatory of the Transport Minister and the Chief\n\n                     Minister, Punjab. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, however, observed that\n\n                     public men in such positions may as well think it worth their while to ignore\n\n                     such vulgar criticism and abuses hurled against them rather than give\n\n                     importance to the same by prosecuting the persons who are responsible for\n\n                     the same.

In order to strengthen its campaign Greenpeace\n\n                     International launched a game called “Turtle v.

If he does so, he\n                           would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                                           29</span>\n\n                          and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may,\n                          however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself\n                          into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n                          (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n                          publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\n                          unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n                          records including court records. This is for the reason that\n                          once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to\n                          privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject\n                          for comment by press and media among others. We are,\n                          however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_19\">Article\n                          19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a\n                          female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction\n                          or a like offence should not further be subjected to the\n                          indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\n                          press/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                          (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above _\n                          indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the\n                          case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n                          matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not\n                          available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\n                          discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the\n                          publication is based upon facts and statements which are not\n                          true, unless the official establishes that the publication was\n                          made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In\n                          such a case, it would be enough for the defendant ( member\n                          of the press or media) to prove that he acted after a\n                          reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                                             30</span>\n\n                            to prove that what he has written is true.

As pointed out by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in kartar Singh ‘s\n\n                     case as early as in 1956, Public men in such positions may as well think it\n\n                     worth their while to ignore such vulgar criticisms and abuses hurled against\n\n                     them rather than give importance to the same by prosecuting the persons\n\n                     responsible for the same. While deprecating the conduct of the appellants in\n\n                     uttering such slogans, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the prosecution\n\n                     has failed to establish that the appellants were guilty of offences which they\n\n                     have been charged, because the case arose out of prosecution of the\n\n                     appellants for uttering such slogans under <a href=\"/doc/176277436/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 9</a> of the Punjab Security\n\n                     of the State Act, 1953.

Though on paper, the 3rd respondent does not\n\n                     have anything to do with the 1st respondent or the Puthiyathalaimurai\n\n                     Television. The 2nd respondent who is the son of the 3rd respondent is the\n\n                     Managing Director of the 1st respondent Company, which runs the\n\n                     Television channel. The 2nd respondent also occupies an important position\n\n                     in University run by the 3rd respondent. Therefore, Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned\n\n                     Senior Counsel would submit that the 3rd respondent adorns the role of\n\n                     educationist, a political leader as well as the media baron. In such cases\n\n                     when the Court finds the actions of the 1st respondent are impelled by hate\n\n                     or malice or personal vendata that is entertained by the 3rd respondent as\n\n                     against the plaintiff’s party and its leaders, the Court can restrain the 1st\n\n                     respondent and its Television channel from airing the views of the 3rd\n\n                     respondent or similarly placed persons that is the political opponents of the\n\n                     plaintiff&#x27;s political party and its leader, repeatedly so as to defame the\n\n                     plaintiff’s party and its leaders, apart from projecting the leaders of the\n\n                     plaintiff’s party in very bad light in the eyes of the general public, particularly,\n\n                     at the time when the elections have been announced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                                          36</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">                           42.

A reading of the interviews, portions of which have been already\n\n                     extracted, would demonstrate beyond doubt that the 3rd respondent nurtures\n\n                     malice or a grievance as against the plaintiff’s party and its leaders. He had\n\n                     dug into the past and made allegations of corruption against the leaders of\n\n                     the plaintiff’s party regarding events that took place way back in 2010-2011,\n\n                     when he commenced a Medical college. To a pertinent question by the\n\n                     interviewer as to why he did not reveal these facts earlier, the 3rd defendant\n\n                     had replied that they were friendly with me at that point of time, therefore, I\n\n                     did not choose to reveal or make these allegations earlier.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">                           43.

In\n\n                     such cases at least, according to Mr.N.L.Rajah learned Senior Counsel, an\n\n                     interim injunction would be a proper remedy.
