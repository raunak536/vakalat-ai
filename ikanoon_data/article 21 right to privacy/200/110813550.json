NARIMAN, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1.         This batch of writ  petitions  filed  under  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1\">Article  32</a>  of  the\nConstitution of India  raises  very  important  and  far-reaching  questions\nrelatable primarily to the fundamental right of free speech  and  expression\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.  The  immediate\ncause for concern in these petitions  is  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_3\">Section  66A</a>  of  the  Information\nTechnology Act of 2000.  This Section was  not  in  the  Act  as  originally\nenacted, but came into force by virtue of an  Amendment  Act  of  2009  with\neffect from 27.10.2009.  Since all the arguments raised by  several  counsel\nfor the petitioners deal with the unconstitutionality of this Section it  is\nset out hereinbelow:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;66-A. Punishment  for  sending  offensive  messages  through  communication\nservice, etc.-Any person who sends, by means of a  computer  resource  or  a\ncommunication device,-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(a) any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character; or\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(b) any information which he knows to be  false,  but  for  the  purpose  of\ncausing  annoyance,  inconvenience,  danger,  obstruction,  insult,  injury,\ncriminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will,  persistently  by  making\nuse of such computer resource or a communication device; or\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(c) any electronic mail or  electronic  mail  message  for  the  purpose  of\ncausing  annoyance  or  inconvenience  or  to  deceive  or  to  mislead  the\naddressee or recipient about the origin of such messages,\n\n\nshall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend  to  three\nyears and with fine.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">Explanation.- For the purposes of this section, terms &quot;electronic mail&quot;  and\n&quot;electronic  mail  message&quot;  means  a  message  or  information  created  or\ntransmitted or received on a computer, computer  system,  computer  resource\nor communication device including attachments in text, image,  audio,  video\nand  any  other  electronic  record,  which  may  be  transmitted  with  the\nmessage.&quot;[1]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">2.    A related challenge is also made to  <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  69A</a>  introduced  by  the\nsame amendment which reads as follows:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;69-A. Power to issue directions for  blocking  for  public  access  of  any\ninformation through any computer resource.-(1) Where the Central  Government\nor any of its  officers  specially  authorised  by  it  in  this  behalf  is\nsatisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do,  in  the  interest  of\nsovereignty and integrity of  India,  defence  of  India,  security  of  the\nState, friendly relations  with  foreign  States  or  public  order  or  for\npreventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable  offence  relating\nto above, it may subject to the provisions of sub-section (2),  for  reasons\nto be recorded in writing, by order, direct any agency of the Government  or\nintermediary to block for access by the public or cause to  be  blocked  for\naccess by the  public  any  information  generated,  transmitted,  received,\nstored or hosted in any computer resource.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(2) The procedure and safeguards subject to which such blocking  for  access\nby the public may be carried out, shall be such as may be prescribed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(3) The intermediary who fails to comply with  the  direction  issued  under\nsub-section (1) shall be punished with an imprisonment for a term which  may\nextend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">3.    The Statement of Objects  and  Reasons  appended  to  the  Bill  which\nintroduced the Amendment Act stated in paragraph 3 that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;3. A rapid increase in the use of computer and internet has given  rise  to\nnew  forms  of  crimes  like  publishing  sexually  explicit  materials   in\nelectronic form, video voyeurism and breach of confidentiality  and  leakage\nof data by intermediary, e-commerce frauds like personation  commonly  known\nas Phishing, identity theft and  offensive  messages  through  communication\nservices.   So,  penal  provisions  are  required  to  be  included  in  the\n<a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_5\">Information Technology Act</a>, the Indian Penal code, the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_6\">Indian  Evidence  Act</a>\nand the code of Criminal Procedure to prevent such crimes.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.    The petitioners contend that the very basis of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 66A</a> -  that  it\nhas given rise to new forms of crimes - is incorrect, and that <a href=\"/doc/48199014/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections  66B</a>\nto <a href=\"/doc/91763765/\" id=\"a_9\">67C</a> and various  Sections  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">Indian  Penal  Code</a>  (which  will  be\nreferred to hereinafter) are good enough to deal with all these crimes.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">5.    The petitioners&#x27; various counsel raised a large number  of  points  as\nto the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_11\">Section  66A</a>.   According  to  them,  first  and\nforemost <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 66A</a> infringes the fundamental  right  to  free  speech  and\nexpression and is not saved by any of the eight subjects covered in  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_13\">Article\n19(2).</a>  According to them, the causing of annoyance, inconvenience,  danger,\nobstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred  or  ill-\nwill are all outside the purview of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 19(2).</a>  Further, in creating  an\noffence, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 66A</a> suffers from the vice of vagueness because  unlike  the\noffence created by <a href=\"/doc/326206/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 66</a> of the same Act, none of the  aforesaid  terms\nare even attempted to be defined and cannot be  defined,  the  result  being\nthat innocent persons are roped in as  well  as  those  who  are  not.  Such\npersons are not told clearly on which side of the line  they  fall;  and  it\nwould be open to the authorities to be as arbitrary and  whimsical  as  they\nlike in booking such persons under the  said  Section.   In  fact,  a  large\nnumber of innocent persons have been booked and  many  instances  have  been\ngiven in the form of a note to the  Court.   The  enforcement  of  the  said\nSection would really be an insidious form  of  censorship  which  impairs  a\ncore value contained in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  In  addition,  the  said  Section\nhas a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and  expression.   Also,  the\nright of viewers is infringed as such chilling effect would  not  give  them\nthe benefit of many shades of grey in terms of various points of  view  that\ncould be viewed over the internet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">The petitioners also contend that their rights under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">21</a>  are\nbreached inasmuch there is no intelligible  differentia  between  those  who\nuse the internet and those who by words spoken or written use other  mediums\nof communication. To punish somebody because he uses a particular medium  of\ncommunication is itself a discriminatory  object  and  would  fall  foul  of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14</a> in any case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">6.    In reply, Mr.  Tushar  Mehta,  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General\ndefended  the  constitutionality  of  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  66A</a>.  He  argued   that   the\nlegislature is in the best position to understand and appreciate  the  needs\nof the people.  The Court will, therefore, interfere  with  the  legislative\nprocess only when a statute is clearly violative of the rights conferred  on\nthe citizen under Part-III of the Constitution.   There is a presumption  in\nfavour of the constitutionality of an enactment.  Further, the  Court  would\nso construe a statute to make it workable and in doing so can read  into  it\nor read down the provisions that are impugned.  The  Constitution  does  not\nimpose impossible standards of determining validity.   Mere  possibility  of\nabuse of a provision cannot be a ground  to  declare  a  provision  invalid.\nLoose language may have been used in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 66A</a> to deal with novel  methods\nof disturbing other people&#x27;s rights by using the internet as a  tool  to  do\nso.   Further,  vagueness  is  not   a   ground   to   declare   a   statute\nunconstitutional if the statute is  otherwise  legislatively  competent  and\nnon-arbitrary.  He cited a large number of judgments  before  us  both  from\nthis Court and from overseas to buttress his submissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">Freedom of Speech and Expression\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India states as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 19.</a> Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(1) All citizens shall have the right-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(a) to freedom of speech and expression;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">7.    <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19(2)</a> states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 19.</a> Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.-\n(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect  the  operation  of\nany existing law, or prevent the State from making any law,  in  so  far  as\nsuch law imposes reasonable  restrictions  on  the  exercise  of  the  right\nconferred by the said sub-clause in the interests  of  the  sovereignty  and\nintegrity of India, the security  of  the  State,  friendly  relations  with\nforeign States,  public  order,  decency  or  morality  or  in  relation  to\ncontempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">8.    The Preamble of  the  Constitution  of  India  inter  alia  speaks  of\nliberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and  worship.   It  also  says\nthat India is a sovereign democratic republic. It cannot be over  emphasized\nthat when it comes to democracy, liberty of  thought  and  expression  is  a\ncardinal value that is of paramount significance  under  our  constitutional\nscheme.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_1\">9.    Various judgments of this Court have referred  to  the  importance  of\nfreedom of speech and expression both from the point of view of the  liberty\nof the individual and from the point of  view  of  our  democratic  form  of\ngovernment.  For example, in the early case of <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_27\">Romesh Thappar  v.  State  of\nMadras</a>, [1950] S.C.R. 594 at 602, this Court stated that freedom  of  speech\nlay at the foundation of all democratic organizations.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_28\">Sakal Papers  (P)\nLtd. &amp; Ors. v. Union of India</a>, [1962] 3 S.C.R. 842 at  866,  a  Constitution\nBench of this Court said freedom of speech and expression of opinion  is  of\nparamount  importance  under  a  democratic  constitution  which   envisages\nchanges in the composition of  legislatures  and  governments  and  must  be\npreserved.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_3\">In a  separate  concurring  judgment  Beg,J.  said,  in  <a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_29\">Bennett\nColeman &amp; Co. &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a>, [1973] 2 S.C.R. 757  at  829,\nthat the freedom of speech and of the press is the Ark of  the  Covenant  of\nDemocracy because public criticism  is  essential  to  the  working  of  its\ninstitutions.[2]</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1327342\" id=\"span_4\">10.   Equally, in <a href=\"/doc/1327342/\" id=\"a_30\">S. Khushboo v. Kanniamal &amp; Anr.</a>, (2010)  5  SCC  600  this\nCourt stated, in paragraph 45 that the importance of freedom of  speech  and\nexpression though  not  absolute  was  necessary  as  we  need  to  tolerate\nunpopular views. This right requires the free flow  of  opinions  and  ideas\nessential to  sustain  the  collective  life  of  the  citizenry.  While  an\ninformed  citizenry  is  a  pre-condition  for  meaningful  governance,  the\nculture of open dialogue is generally of great societal importance.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">11.   This last judgment is important in  that  it  refers  to  the  &quot;market\nplace of ideas&quot; concept that has permeated American Law.  This  was  put  in\nthe felicitous words of Justice Holmes in his famous dissent  in  Abrams  v.\nUnited States, 250 US 616 (1919), thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting  faiths,  they\nmay come to believe even more than they  believe  the  very  foundations  of\ntheir own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached  by  free\ntrade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of  thought  to  get\nitself accepted in the competition of the market,  and  that  truth  is  the\nonly ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That  at  any\nrate is the theory of our Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">12.   Justice Brandeis in his  famous  concurring  judgment  in  Whitney  v.\nCalifornia, 71 L. Ed. 1095 said:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;Those who won our independence believed that the final  end  of  the  state\nwas to make men free to develop their faculties, and that in its  government\nthe deliberative forces should  prevail  over  the  arbitrary.  They  valued\nliberty both as an end and as a means.  They  believed  liberty  to  be  the\nsecret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty.  They  believed\nthat freedom to think as you will and  to  speak  as  you  think  are  means\nindispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth;  that  without\nfree speech and  assembly  discussion  would  be  futile;  that  with  them,\ndiscussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the  dissemination\nof noxious doctrine; that  the  greatest  menace  to  freedom  is  an  inert\npeople; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should  be\na fundamental principle of the  American  government.  They  recognized  the\nrisks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that  order\ncannot be secured merely through fear  of  punishment  for  its  infraction;\nthat it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that  fear\nbreeds repression; that repression breeds hate;  that  hate  menaces  stable\ngovernment; that the path of safety  lies  in  the  opportunity  to  discuss\nfreely supposed grievances and  proposed  remedies;  and  that  the  fitting\nremedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of  reason  as\napplied through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by  law-the\nargument of force in its worst form. Recognizing  the  occasional  tyrannies\nof governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that  free  speech\nand assembly should be guaranteed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free  speech  and\nassembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function  of  speech\nto free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression  of\nfree speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious  evil  will\nresult if free speech is practiced.  There  must  be  reasonable  ground  to\nbelieve that the danger apprehended is imminent. There  must  be  reasonable\nground to believe that the evil to be prevented  is  a  serious  one.  Every\ndenunciation  of  existing  law  tends  in  some  measure  to  increase  the\nprobability that there will be violation  of  it. Condonation  of  a  breach\nenhances the probability. Expressions of approval add  to  the  probability.\nPropagation of the criminal state of mind by teaching syndicalism  increases\nit. Advocacy of lawbreaking heightens it still further.  But  even  advocacy\nof violation, however reprehensible morally,  is  not  a  justification  for\ndenying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement  and  there\nis nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on.  The\nwide difference between advocacy and  incitement,  between  preparation  and\nattempt, between assembling and conspiracy, must be borne in mind. In  order\nto support a finding of clear and present danger it  must  be  shown  either\nthat immediate serious violence was to be  expected  or  was  advocated,  or\nthat the past conduct furnished reason to believe  that  such  advocacy  was\nthen contemplated.&quot; (at page 1105, 1106)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">13.   This leads  us  to  a  discussion  of  what  is  the  content  of  the\nexpression &quot;freedom of speech and expression&quot;.   There  are  three  concepts\nwhich are fundamental in understanding the  reach  of  this  most  basic  of\nhuman rights.  The first is discussion, the  second  is  advocacy,  and  the\nthird is incitement.  Mere discussion  or  even  advocacy  of  a  particular\ncause howsoever unpopular is at the heart of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  It  is  only\nwhen such discussion or  advocacy  reaches  the  level  of  incitement  that\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 19(2)</a> kicks in.[3]  It is at this stage  that  a  law  may  be  made\ncurtailing the speech or expression that leads inexorably  to  or  tends  to\ncause public disorder or tends to cause or tends to affect  the  sovereignty\n&amp; integrity of India, the security of the  State,  friendly  relations  with\nforeign States, etc. Why it is important to have  these  three  concepts  in\nmind is because most of the arguments of both  petitioners  and  respondents\ntended to veer around the expression &quot;public order&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">14.   It is at this point that a word needs to be  said  about  the  use  of\nAmerican judgments in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  In  virtually  every\nsignificant judgment of this Court, reference has  been  made  to  judgments\nfrom across the Atlantic.  Is it safe to do so?\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">15.   It is significant to notice  first  the  differences  between  the  US\nFirst Amendment and <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> read with  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_35\">Article  19(2).</a>   The  first\nimportant difference is the absoluteness  of  the  U.S.  first  Amendment  -\nCongress shall make no law which abridges the freedom  of  speech.   Second,\nwhereas the U.S. First Amendment speaks of freedom  of  speech  and  of  the\npress, without any reference to &quot;expression&quot;,  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_36\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  speaks  of\nfreedom of speech and expression  without  any  reference  to  &quot;the  press&quot;.\nThird, under the US Constitution, speech may be abridged, whereas under  our\nConstitution, reasonable restrictions may  be  imposed.  Fourth,  under  our\nConstitution  such  restrictions  have  to  be  in  the  interest  of  eight\ndesignated  subject  matters  -  that  is  any  law  seeking  to  impose   a\nrestriction on the  freedom  of  speech  can  only  pass  muster  if  it  is\nproximately related to any of the eight subject matters set out  in  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_37\">Article\n19(2).</a>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">16.   Insofar as the  first  apparent  difference  is  concerned,  the  U.S.\nSupreme Court has  never  given  literal  effect  to  the  declaration  that\nCongress shall make no law abridging the freedom of  speech.   The  approach\nof the Court which is succinctly stated in one of  the  early  U.S.  Supreme\nCourt Judgments, continues even today.  In Chaplinsky v. New  Hampshire,  86\nL. Ed. 1031, Justice Murphy who delivered the opinion of the  Court  put  it\nthus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;Allowing the broadest scope to the language and purpose of  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment, it is well understood that  the  right  of  free  speech  is  not\nabsolute at all times and under all circumstances. There are  certain  well-\ndefined  and  narrowly  limited  classes  of  speech,  the  prevention   and\npunishment of which has never  been  thought  to  raise  any  Constitutional\nproblem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous,  and\nthe insulting or  &#x27;fighting&#x27;  words-those  which  by  their  very  utterance\ninflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of  the  peace. It  has\nbeen well observed that  such  utterances  are  no  essential  part  of  any\nexposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to  truth\nthat any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by  the\nsocial interest in order  and  morality. &#x27;Resort  to  epithets  or  personal\nabuse is not in any proper sense communication  of  information  or  opinion\nsafeguarded by the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act  would\nraise no question under that instrument.&#x27; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310  U.S.\n296, 309, 310, <a href=\"/doc/1408526/\" id=\"a_38\">60</a> S.Ct. 900, 906, 84  L.Ed.1213,  128  A.L.R.  1352.&quot;    (at\npage 1035)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">17.   So far as the second apparent difference is  concerned,  the  American\nSupreme Court has included &quot;expression&quot; as part of  freedom  of  speech  and\nthis  Court  has  included  &quot;the  press&quot;  as  being  covered  under  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_39\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a>, so that, as a matter of judicial interpretation, both the  US  and\nIndia protect the  freedom  of  speech  and  expression  as  well  as  press\nfreedom.  Insofar as abridgement and reasonable restrictions are  concerned,\nboth the U.S. Supreme Court and this Court have held that a  restriction  in\norder to be reasonable must be narrowly tailored or narrowly interpreted  so\nas to abridge or restrict only what is  absolutely  necessary.  It  is  only\nwhen it comes to the eight subject matters that there is a vast  difference.\n In the U.S., if there is a compelling necessity  to  achieve  an  important\ngovernmental or societal goal, a law abridging freedom of  speech  may  pass\nmuster.  But in India, such law cannot pass muster if it is in the  interest\nof the general public.  Such law has to be  covered  by  one  of  the  eight\nsubject matters set out under  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_40\">Article  19(2).</a>   If  it  does  not,  and  is\noutside the pale of 19(2), Indian courts will strike down such law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"687159\" id=\"span_5\">18.   Viewed from the  above  perspective,  American  judgments  have  great\npersuasive value on the content of freedom of speech and expression and  the\ntests laid down for its infringement.  It is only  when  it  comes  to  sub-\nserving  the  general  public  interest  that  there  is  the  world  of   a\ndifference. This is perhaps why in <a href=\"/doc/687159/\" id=\"a_41\">Kameshwar Prasad &amp; Ors. v.

It  will  be  useful  to  note  that  <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  2(v)</a>  of\nInformation Technology Act, 2000 defines information as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">&quot;2.

The  first  is  that  the  definition  is  an\ninclusive one.  Second, the definition does not refer to  what  the  content\nof information can be.  In fact, it refers only to the medium through  which\nsuch  information  is  disseminated.   It  is  clear,  therefore,  that  the\npetitioners are correct in  saying  that  the  public&#x27;s  right  to  know  is\ndirectly affected by <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 66A</a>.  Information of all kinds is  roped  in  -\nsuch information may have scientific, literary or  artistic  value,  it  may\nrefer to  current  events,  it  may  be  obscene  or  seditious.  That  such\ninformation may cause annoyance or inconvenience to some is how the  offence\nis made out.  It is clear that the right of the people to know - the  market\nplace of ideas - which the internet provides to  persons  of  all  kinds  is\nwhat attracts <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 66A</a>.  That the information sent has  to  be  annoying,\ninconvenient, grossly offensive etc., also  shows  that  no  distinction  is\nmade between mere discussion or advocacy  of  a  particular  point  of  view\nwhich may be annoying or inconvenient  or  grossly  offensive  to  some  and\nincitement by which such words lead to an imminent  causal  connection  with\npublic disorder, security of  State  etc.   The  petitioners  are  right  in\nsaying that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 66A</a> in creating an offence against persons who  use  the\ninternet and annoy or cause inconvenience to  others  very  clearly  affects\nthe freedom of speech and expression of the citizenry of India at  large  in\nthat such speech or expression is directly curbed by  the  creation  of  the\noffence contained in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 66A</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">In  this  regard,  the  observations  of   Justice   Jackson   in   American\nCommunications Association v.

Under our constitutional scheme, as stated earlier, it is not open  to\nthe State to curtail  freedom  of  speech  to  promote  the  general  public\ninterest.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_60\">Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors.  v.

Freedom of speech  can\nbe restricted only in the interests of the security of the  State,  friendly\nrelations with foreign State,  public  order,  decency  or  morality  or  in\nrelation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to  an  offence.  It\ncannot, like the freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in the  interest\nof the general public. If a law directly affecting it is challenged,  it  is\nno answer that the restrictions enacted by it are justifiable under  clauses\n(3) to (6). For,  the  scheme  of  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_62\">Article  19</a>  is  to  enumerate  different\nfreedoms separately and then to specify the extent of restrictions to  which\nthey may be subjected and the objects  for  securing  which  this  could  be\ndone. A citizen is entitled to enjoy each and  every  one  of  the  freedoms\ntogether and clause (1) does not prefer one freedom to another. That is  the\nplain meaning of this clause. It follows from this  that  the  State  cannot\nmake a law which directly  restricts  one  freedom  even  for  securing  the\nbetter enjoyment of another freedom. All the greater reason,  therefore  for\nholding that the State cannot directly restrict one freedom  by  placing  an\notherwise permissible restriction on another freedom.&quot; (at page 863)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">22.

The  limitation\nimposed in the interests of public order to  be  a  reasonable  restriction,\nshould be one which has a proximate connection or nexus with  public  order,\nbut not one far-fetched, hypothetical or problematical or too remote in  the\nchain of its relation with the public order..........There is  no  proximate\nor even foreseeable connection  between  such  instigation  and  the  public\norder sought to be protected under section.

It  is  important\nin this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, where  ever\nprescribed, should be applied to each, individual statute  impugned  and  no\nabstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down  as\napplicable to all cases. The nature  of  the  right  alleged  to  have  been\ninfringed, the underlying purpose of the  restriction  imposed,  the  extent\nand urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion  of\nthe imposition, the prevailing conditions at  the  time,  should  all  enter\ninto the judicial verdict. In evaluating such elusive  factors  and  forming\ntheir own conception of what is reasonable, in all the  circumstances  of  a\ngiven case, it is inevitable that the social philosophy  and  the  scale  of\nvalues of the judges participating in the decision should play an  important\npart, and the limit to their interference with legislative judgment in  such\ncases can only be dictated  by  their  sense  of  responsibility  and  self-\nrestraint and the sobering reflection that the  Constitution  is  meant  not\nonly for people of their way of thinking but for all, and that the  majority\nof the elected representatives  of  the  people  have,  in  authorising  the\nimposition of the restrictions, considered them to be reasonable.&quot; (at  page\n606-607)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1849054\" id=\"span_11\">25.

In the case of said mediums, it was  almost  impossible  for  an\nindividual to create and publish an abusive content and  make  it  available\nto trillions of people. Whereas,  in  the  present  internet  age  the  said\ninfrastructural  and  logistical  constrains   have   disappeared   as   any\nindividual using even a smart mobile phone or  a  portable  computer  device\ncan create and publish abusive material on its own, without seeking help  of\nanyone else and make it  available  to  trillions  of  people  by  just  one\nclick.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">28.   As stated, all the above factors may make a  distinction  between  the\nprint and other media as opposed to the internet  and  the  legislature  may\nwell, therefore, provide for separate offences so far as  free  speech  over\nthe  internet  is  concerned.   There   is,   therefore,   an   intelligible\ndifferentia having a rational relation to the object sought to  be  achieved\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">- that there can be creation of offences which are applied  to  free  speech\nover the internet alone  as  opposed  to  other  mediums  of  communication.\nThus, an <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 14</a> challenge has been repelled by us on this  ground  later\nin this judgment.  But we do not find anything in the features  outlined  by\nthe learned Additional Solicitor General to relax the  Court&#x27;s  scrutiny  of\nthe curbing of the content of free speech over the internet.  While  it  may\nbe possible to narrowly draw a Section  creating  a  new  offence,  such  as\n<a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 69A</a> for instance, relatable only to speech over  the  internet,  yet\nthe validity of such a law will have to be tested on the touchstone  of  the\ntests already indicated above.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">29.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_13\">In  fact,  this  aspect  was  considered  in  <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_74\">Secretary  Ministry  of\nInformation &amp; Broadcasting, Government of India v.  Cricket  Association  of\nBengal</a>, (1995) 2 SCC 161 in  para  37,  where  the  following  question  was\nposed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">&quot;The next question which is required to be answered is whether there is  any\ndistinction between  the  freedom  of  the  print  media  and  that  of  the\nelectronic media such as  radio  and  television,  and  if  so,  whether  it\nnecessitates more restrictions on the latter media.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">This question was answered in para 78 thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;There is  no  doubt  that  since  the  airwaves/frequencies  are  a  public\nproperty and are also limited, they have to be used in the best interest  of\nthe society  and  this  can  be  done  either  by  a  central  authority  by\nestablishing its  own  broadcasting  network  or  regulating  the  grant  of\nlicences  to  other  agencies,  including  the  private  agencies.  What  is\nfurther, the electronic media is the most powerful  media  both  because  of\nits audio-visual impact and its widest reach covering  the  section  of  the\nsociety where the print media does not reach. The right to use the  airwaves\nand  the  content  of  the  programmes,  therefore,  needs  regulation   for\nbalancing it and as well as to prevent monopoly  of  information  and  views\nrelayed, which is a potential danger flowing from the concentration  of  the\nright to broadcast/telecast in the hands either of a central  agency  or  of\nfew private affluent broadcasters. That is why the need to  have  a  central\nagency representative of all sections of the society free from control  both\nof the Government and the dominant  influential  sections  of  the  society.\nThis is not disputed. But to contend that on that account  the  restrictions\nto be imposed on the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> should be in  addition  to\nthose permissible under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 19(2)</a> and dictated  by  the  use  of  public\nresources in the best interests of the society at large, is  to  misconceive\nboth the content of the freedom of speech and expression  and  the  problems\nposed by the element of public property in, and  the  alleged  scarcity  of,\nthe frequencies as well as by the wider reach of the media. If the right  to\nfreedom  of  speech  and  expression  includes  the  right  to   disseminate\ninformation to as wide a section of  the  population  as  is  possible,  the\naccess which enables the right to be so exercised is also an  integral  part\nof the said right. The wider range of  circulation  of  information  or  its\ngreater impact cannot restrict the content of the right nor can  it  justify\nits denial. The virtues of the electronic media cannot become  its  enemies.\nIt  may  warrant  a  greater  regulation  over  licensing  and  control  and\nvigilance on the content of the programme telecast.  However,  this  control\ncan only be  exercised  within  the  framework  of  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_77\">Article  19(2)</a>  and  the\ndictates of public interests. To plead for other grounds  is  to  plead  for\nunconstitutional measures.  It  is  further  difficult  to  appreciate  such\ncontention on the part of the Government in this country when  they  have  a\ncomplete control over the frequencies and the content of  the  programme  to\nbe telecast. They control the sole agency  of  telecasting.  They  are  also\narmed with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 19(2)</a> and the powers of  pre-censorship\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_79\">Cinematograph Act</a> and Rules.  The  only  limitation  on  the  said\nright is, therefore, the limitation of resources and the need  to  use  them\nfor the benefit of all.  When,  however,  there  are  surplus  or  unlimited\nresources and the public interests so demand or in any case do  not  prevent\ntelecasting, the validity of the argument based on limitation  of  resources\ndisappears. It is  true  that  to  own  a  frequency  for  the  purposes  of\nbroadcasting is  a  costly  affair  and  even  when  there  are  surplus  or\nunlimited frequencies, only the affluent few will own them and will be in  a\nposition to use it to subserve their own interest by manipulating  news  and\nviews. That also poses a danger to the freedom of speech and  expression  of\nthe have-nots by denying them the truthful information on all  sides  of  an\nissue which is so necessary to form a sound view on  any  subject.  That  is\nwhy the doctrine of fairness has been evolved in the US in  the  context  of\nthe private broadcasters licensed to share the limited frequencies with  the\ncentral  agency  like  the  FCC  to  regulate  the  programming.  But   this\nphenomenon occurs even in the case of the print media of all the  countries.\nHence the body like the  Press  Council  of  India  which  is  empowered  to\nenforce, however imperfectly, the right to reply. The  print  media  further\nenjoys as in our country, freedom from pre-censorship unlike the  electronic\nmedia.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">Public Order\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_14\">30.

Public order  was  said  to\nembrace more of the community than law and order. Public order is  the  even\ntempo of the life of the community taking the country as a whole or  even  a\nspecified locality. Disturbance of public  order  is  to  be  distinguished,\nfrom acts directed against individuals which do not disturb the  society  to\nthe extent of causing a general disturbance of  public  tranquility.  It  is\nthe degree of disturbance and its effect upon the life of the  community  in\na locality which determines  whether  the  disturbance  amounts  only  to  a\nbreach of law and order. Take for instance, a man stabs another. People  may\nbe shocked and even disturbed, but the life of the  community  keeps  moving\nat an even tempo, however much one may dislike the act.  Take  another  case\nof a town where there is communal tension. A  man  stabs  a  member  of  the\nother community. This is an act of a very different sort.  Its  implications\nare deeper and it affects the  even  tempo  of  life  and  public  order  is\njeopardized because the repercussions of the act embrace large  Sections  of\nthe community and incite them to make further breaches of the law and  order\nand to subvert the public order. An act by itself is not determinant of  its\nown gravity. In its quality it may  not  differ  from  another  but  in  its\npotentiality it may be very different. Take the case of assault on girls.  A\nguest at a hotel may kiss or make advances to half a  dozen  chamber  maids.\nHe may annoy them and also the management but he does not cause  disturbance\nof public order. He may even have a fracas with the friends of  one  of  the\ngirls but even then it would be a case of breach  of  law  and  order  only.\nTake another case of a man who molests women in lonely places. As  a  result\nof his activities girls going  to  colleges  and  schools  are  in  constant\ndanger and fear. Women going for  their  ordinary  business  are  afraid  of\nbeing waylaid and assaulted. The activity  of  this  man  in  its  essential\nquality is not  different  from  the  act  of  the  other  man  but  in  its\npotentiality and in its effect upon the public tranquility there is  a  vast\ndifference. The act of the man  who  molests  the  girls  in  lonely  places\ncauses a disturbance in  the  even  tempo  of  living  which  is  the  first\nrequirement of public order. He disturbs the society and the community.  His\nact makes all the women apprehensive of their honour and he can be  said  to\nbe causing disturbance of public order and not merely committing  individual\nactions which may be taken note of by the criminal prosecution agencies.  It\nmeans therefore that the question whether a man has only committed a  breach\nof law and order or has acted in a manner likely to cause a  disturbance  of\nthe public order is a question of degree and the extent of the reach of  the\nact upon the society. The French distinguish law and order and public  order\nby designating the latter as order publique. The latter expression has  been\nrecognised as meaning something more than ordinary maintenance  of  law  and\norder. Justice Ramaswami in Writ Petition No. 179 of 1968  drew  a  line  of\ndemarcation between the serious and aggravated forms of breaches  of  public\norder which affect the community or endanger the public  interest  at  large\nfrom minor breaches of peace which do not affect the  public  at  large.  He\ndrew an analogy between public and private crimes.  The  analogy  is  useful\nbut not to be pushed too far.  A  large  number  of  acts  directed  against\npersons or individuals may total up into a breach of public  order.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1386353\" id=\"span_21\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1386353/\" id=\"a_89\">Dr.\nRam Manohar Lohia</a>&#x27;s case examples were given by  Sarkar,  and  Hidayatullah,\nJJ. They show how similar acts in different contexts affect differently  law\nand order on the one hand and public order on the  other.  It  is  always  a\nquestion of degree of the harm  and  its  effect  upon  the  community.  The\nquestion to ask is: Does it lead to disturbance of the current  of  life  of\nthe community so as to amount to a disturbance of the public order  or  does\nit affect merely an  individual  leaving  the  tranquility  of  the  society\nundisturbed? This question has to be faced in every case on facts. There  is\nno formula by which one case can be distinguished from another.&quot;  (at  pages\n290 and 291).</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">35.   This decision lays down the test that has  to  be  formulated  in  all\nthese cases.  We have to ask ourselves the question: does a  particular  act\nlead to disturbance of the current life of the community or does  it  merely\naffect an individual leaving the tranquility of society undisturbed?   Going\nby this test, it is clear that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 66A</a> is intended to punish any  person\nwho uses the internet to disseminate any information that falls  within  the\nsub-clauses of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  66A</a>.   It  will  be  immediately  noticed  that  the\nrecipient of the written word that is sent by the person who is  accused  of\nthe offence is not of any importance so far as this  Section  is  concerned.\n(Save and except where under sub-clause (c) the addressee  or  recipient  is\ndeceived or misled about the origin of a particular message.) It  is  clear,\ntherefore,  that  the  information  that  is  disseminated  may  be  to  one\nindividual  or  several  individuals.   The  Section  makes  no  distinction\nbetween mass dissemination and dissemination to one  person.   Further,  the\nSection does not require that such message should have a clear  tendency  to\ndisrupt public order. Such message need not have any potential  which  could\ndisturb the community at large.  The nexus between the  message  and  action\nthat may be taken based on the message is conspicuously absent  -  there  is\nno ingredient in this offence of inciting anybody to  do  anything  which  a\nreasonable man would then say would have the tendency of being an  immediate\nthreat to public safety or tranquility.  On all these counts,  it  is  clear\nthat the Section has no proximate relationship to public  order  whatsoever.\nThe example of a guest at a hotel `annoying&#x27; girls is telling -  this  Court\nhas held that mere `annoyance&#x27; need not cause disturbance of  public  order.\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 66A</a>, the offence is complete by  sending  a  message  for  the\npurpose of causing annoyance, either `persistently&#x27; or otherwise without  in\nany manner impacting public order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">Clear and present danger - tendency to affect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">36.   It will be  remembered  that  Justice  Holmes  in  Schenck  v.  United\nStates, 63 L. Ed. 470 enunciated  the  clear  and  present  danger  test  as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">&quot;...The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man  in\nfalsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.  It  does  not  even\nprotect a man from an injunction against uttering words that  may  have  all\nthe effect of force. Gompers v. Buck&#x27;s Stove &amp; Range Co.,  221  U.  S.  418,\n439, <a href=\"/doc/63476/\" id=\"a_93\">31</a> Sup. Ct. 492, 55 L. ed. 797, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874.  The  question\nin every case is whether the words used are used in such  circumstances  and\nare of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they  will\nbring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to  prevent.  It\nis a question of proximity and degree.&quot; (At page 473, 474)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">37.   This was further refined in Abrams  v.

The  test\nof &quot;clear and present danger&quot; has been used by the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  in\nmany varying situations and has been  adjusted  according  to  varying  fact\nsituations.  It appears to have been repeatedly applied,  see-   Terminiello\nv. City of Chicago 93 L. Ed. 1131 (1949) at page 1134-1135,  Brandenburg  v.\nOhio 23 L.

There does  indeed  have  to\nbe a compromise between the interest of freedom of  expression  and  special\ninterests. But we cannot simply balance the two interests as if they are  of\nequal weight. Our commitment  of  freedom  of  expression  demands  that  it\ncannot be suppressed unless the situations created by allowing  the  freedom\nare pressing and the  community  interest  is  endangered.  The  anticipated\ndanger should not be remote, conjectural  or  far-fetched.  It  should  have\nproximate and direct nexus with the expression. The  expression  of  thought\nshould be intrinsically dangerous to the public interest.  In  other  words,\nthe expression should be inseparably locked up with the action  contemplated\nlike the equivalent of a &quot;spark in a powder keg&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"792995\" id=\"span_23\">39.

Viewed at either by the standpoint of the  clear  and  present  danger\ntest or the tendency to create public disorder, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 66A</a> would  not  pass\nmuster as it has no element of any tendency to create public disorder  which\nought to be an essential ingredient of the offence which it creates.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">Defamation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">42.   Defamation is defined in Section 499 of the Penal Code as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">&quot;499. Defamation.-Whoever, by words either spoken or intended  to  be  read,\nor  by  signs  or  by  visible  representations,  makes  or  publishes   any\nimputation concerning any person intending to harm,  or  knowing  or  having\nreason to believe that such imputation will harm,  the  reputation  of  such\nperson, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted,  to  defame  that\nperson.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">Explanation 1.-It may amount to defamation to impute anything to a  deceased\nperson, if the imputation would  harm  the  reputation  of  that  person  if\nliving, and is intended to be hurtful to  the  feelings  of  his  family  or\nother near relatives.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">Explanation 2.-It may amount to defamation to make an imputation  concerning\na company or an association or collection of persons as such.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">Explanation 3.-An imputation in the form  of  an  alternative  or  expressed\nironically, may amount to defamation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">Explanation 4.-No imputation is said to harm a person&#x27;s  reputation,  unless\nthat imputation directly or indirectly, in the estimation of others,  lowers\nthe moral or intellectual character of that person, or lowers the  character\nof that person in respect of his caste or of  his  calling,  or  lowers  the\ncredit of that person, or causes it to be believed that  the  body  of  that\nperson is in a loathsome state,  or  in  a  state  generally  considered  as\ndisgraceful.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">43.   It will be noticed that for something  to  be  defamatory,  injury  to\nreputation is a basic ingredient.  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 66A</a> does not concern itself  with\ninjury to reputation. Something may be grossly offensive and  may  annoy  or\nbe inconvenient to somebody without at all affecting his reputation.  It  is\nclear therefore that the Section is not aimed at  defamatory  statements  at\nall.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">Incitement to an offence:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">44.   Equally, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 66A</a> has no proximate connection  with  incitement  to\ncommit  an  offence.    Firstly,  the  information  disseminated  over   the\ninternet need not be information which &quot;incites&quot; anybody  at  all.   Written\nwords may be sent that may  be  purely  in  the  realm  of  &quot;discussion&quot;  or\n&quot;advocacy&quot; of a &quot;particular point of view&quot;.  Further, the  mere  causing  of\nannoyance, inconvenience, danger etc., or being grossly offensive or  having\na menacing character are not offences under the Penal  Code  at  all.   They\nmay be ingredients of certain offences under the  Penal  Code  but  are  not\noffences in themselves.  For these reasons, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 66A</a> has  nothing  to  do\nwith  &quot;incitement  to  an  offence&quot;.  As  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_110\">Section  66A</a>   severely   curtails\ninformation that may be sent on the internet based on whether it is  grossly\noffensive, annoying, inconvenient, etc. and being unrelated to  any  of  the\neight subject matters under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 19(2)</a>  must,  therefore,  fall  foul  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, and not being saved under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 19(2)</a>,  is  declared  as\nunconstitutional.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">Decency or Morality\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623275\" id=\"span_27\">45.

State of Maharashtra</a>  [1965]  1  S.C.R.\n65 took a rather restrictive view of what would pass  muster  as  not  being\nobscene.</span> The Court followed the test <a href=\"/doc/1623275/\" id=\"a_115\">laid down in</a> the old  English  judgment\nin Hicklin&#x27;s case which was whether the tendency of the  matter  charged  as\nobscene is to deprave and  corrupt  those  whose  minds  are  open  to  such\nimmoral influences and into whose hands  a  publication  of  this  sort  may\nfall. Great strides have been made since this decision  in  the  UK,  United\nStates as well as in our country.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"206282\" id=\"span_28\">Thus, in  <a href=\"/doc/206282/\" id=\"a_116\">Director  General,  Directorate\nGeneral of Doordarshan  v.

What has been said with regard to public order and  incitement  to  an\noffence equally applies here.   <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_118\">Section  66A</a>  cannot  possibly  be  said  to\ncreate an offence which falls within the expression &#x27;decency&#x27; or  &#x27;morality&#x27;\nin that what may be grossly offensive or annoying  under  the  Section  need\nnot be obscene at all - in fact the word &#x27;obscene&#x27;  is  conspicuous  by  its\nabsence in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 66A</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">48.

We  are  afraid  that\nsuch an exercise is not  possible  for  the  simple  reason  that  when  the\nlegislature intended to do so, it provided for some of the  subject  matters\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 19(2)</a> in <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_123\">Section  69A</a>.

The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held in a  series  of  judgments\nthat where no reasonable standards are  laid  down  to  define  guilt  in  a\nSection which creates an offence, and where no clear guidance  is  given  to\neither law abiding citizens or to authorities and courts,  a  Section  which\ncreates an offence  and  which  is  vague  must  be  struck  down  as  being\narbitrary and unreasonable.

The legislative bodies in  draftsmanship  obviously\nhave the same difficulty as do the judicial in interpretation.  Nevertheless\ndespite the difficulties, courts must do their best to determine whether  or\nnot the vagueness is of such a character &#x27;that men  of  common  intelligence\nmust necessarily guess at its meaning.&#x27; Connally  v.  General  Constr.  Co.,\n269 U.S. 385, 391, <a href=\"/doc/1076139/\" id=\"a_132\">46</a> S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322. The entire text  of  the\nstatute or the subjects dealt with may furnish  an  adequate  standard.  The\npresent case as to a  vague  statute  abridging  free  speech  involves  the\ncirculation of only vulgar magazines. The next may call for decision  as  to\nfree expression of political views in the light of  a  statute  intended  to\npunish subversive activities.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">The subsection of the New York Penal Law, as now interpreted  by  the  Court\nof Appeals prohibits distribution of  a  magazine  principally  made  up  of\ncriminal news or stories of deeds of bloodshed, or lust,  so  massed  as  to\nbecome vehicles  for  inciting  violent  and  depraved  crimes  against  the\nperson. But even considering the gloss put upon the literal meaning  by  the\nCourt of Appeals&#x27; restriction of the statute to collections of  stories  &#x27;so\nmassed as to become  vehicles  for  inciting  violent  and  depraved  crimes\nagainst the person * * * not necessarily * * * sexual passion,&#x27; we find  the\nspecification of publications, prohibited from distribution,  too  uncertain\nand indefinite to justify the conviction of  this  petitioner.  Even  though\nall detective tales and treatises on  criminology  are  not  forbidden,  and\nthough  publications  made  up  of  criminal  deeds  not  characterized   by\nbloodshed or lust are omitted  from  the  interpretation  of  the  Court  of\nAppeals, we think fair use of collections of pictures and stories  would  be\ninterdicted because of the utter impossibility of the actor or the trier  to\nknow where this new standard of  guilt  would  draw  the  line  between  the\nallowable and the forbidden publications. No intent or purpose is  required-\nno indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore  known  to  the  law.  &#x27;So\nmassed as to incite  to  crime&#x27;  can  become  meaningful  only  by  concrete\ninstances. This one example is not enough. The  clause  proposes  to  punish\nthe printing and circulation of  publications  that  courts  or  juries  may\nthink influence generally persons to commit crime of  violence  against  the\nperson. No conspiracy to commit a crime is required. See Musser v. State  of\nUtah, 68 S.Ct. 397, this Term. It is not an effective notice of  new  crime.\nThe clause has no technical or common law meaning. Nor can light as  to  the\nmeaning be gained from the section as a whole or the Article  of  the  Penal\nLaw under which it appears. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_33\">As said in the <a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_133\">Cohen Grocery  Co.</a>  case,  supra,\n255 U.S. at page 89, 41 S.Ct. at page 300, 65 L.Ed. 516, 14 A.L.R. 1045:</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">&#x27;It leaves open, therefore, the widest conceivable  inquiry,  the  scope  of\nwhich no one can foresee and the result of which no one  can  foreshadow  or\nadequately guard against.&#x27;\n\n\nThe statute as construed by the Court of Appeals does not  limit  punishment\nto the indecent and obscene, as formerly understood. When stories  of  deeds\nof bloodshed, such as many in the accused magazines, are  massed  so  as  to\nincite to violent crimes, the statute is violated. it does not  seem  to  us\nthat an honest distributor of publications could know when he might be  held\nto have ignored such a prohibition. Collections of  tales  of  war  horrors,\notherwise unexceptionable, might well be found  to  be  &#x27;massed&#x27;  so  as  to\nbecome &#x27;vehicles for inciting violent and depraved crimes.&#x27; Where a  statute\nis so vague as to make criminal an  innocent  act,  a  conviction  under  it\ncannot be sustained.

History  does  not  encourage  reliance  on  the   wisdom   and\nmoderation of the censor as a safeguard in  the  exercise  of  such  drastic\npower over the minds of men. We not only do not know but  cannot  know  what\nis condemnable by &#x27;sacrilegious.&#x27; And if we cannot tell, how  are  those  to\nbe governed by the statute to tell?

Morales et al, 527 U.<a href=\"/doc/1215878/\" id=\"a_135\">S.  41  (1999)</a>,  a  Chicago\nGang Congregation Ordinance prohibited criminal  street  gang  members  from\nloitering with one another or with other persons in any public place for  no\napparent purpose.  The Court referred  to  an  earlier  judgment  in  United\nStates v. Reese 92 U.S. 214 (1875) at 221 in which it was  stated  that  the\nConstitution does not permit a legislature to set  a  net  large  enough  to\ncatch all possible offenders and leave it to the Court to step  in  and  say\nwho could be rightfully detained and who should be set at  liberty.  It  was\nheld that the broad sweep of the Ordinance violated the requirement  that  a\nlegislature needs to meet: to establish minimum  guidelines  to  govern  law\nenforcement. As the impugned Ordinance did not have any such  guidelines,  a\nsubstantial amount of innocent conduct would  also  be  brought  within  its\nnet, leading to its unconstitutionality.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">56.   It was further held that a penal law  is  void  for  vagueness  if  it\nfails to define the criminal offence with sufficient definiteness.  Ordinary\npeople should be able to understand what conduct is prohibited and  what  is\npermitted. Also, those who administer the law must  know  what  offence  has\nbeen committed so that arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of  the  law\ndoes not take place.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">57.   Similarly, in Grayned v. City of  Rockford,  33  L.Ed.  2d.  222,  the\nState of Illinois provided in an anti noise ordinance as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">&quot;&#x27;(N)o person, while on public or private grounds adjacent to  any  building\nin which a school or any class thereof is in session, shall  willfully  make\nor assist in the making of any noise or diversion which  disturbs  or  tends\nto disturb the peace or good order of such school session or class  thereof.\n. . .&#x27; Code of Ordinances, c. 28,  19.2(a).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">The law on the subject of vagueness was clearly stated thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">&quot;It is a basic principle of due  process  that  an  enactment  is  void  for\nvagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly  defined.  Vague  laws  offend\nseveral important values. First, because we  assume  that  man  is  free  to\nsteer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we  insist  that  laws  give  the\nperson of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity  to  know  what  is\nprohibited, so that  he  may  act  accordingly.  Vague  laws  may  trap  the\ninnocent  by  not  providing  fair  warning.  Second,   if   arbitrary   and\ndiscriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws  must  provide  explicit\nstandards for those who apply them.  A  vague  law  impermissibly  delegates\nbasic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution  on  an\nad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant  dangers  of  arbitrary  and\ndiscriminatory  application. Third,  but  related,  where  a  vague  statute\n&#x27;abut(s)  upon  sensitive  areas  of basic  First  Amendment  freedoms,   it\n&#x27;operates to inhibit the exercise of (those) freedoms.&#x27;  Uncertain  meanings\ninevitably lead citizens to &quot;steer far wider of the unlawful  zone&#x27;  .  .  .\nthan if the boundaries of the  forbidden  areas  were  clearly  marked.&#x27;&quot;(at\npage 227-228)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">58.   The anti noise ordinance was upheld on facts in that case  because  it\nfixed the time at which noise disrupts school activity -  while  the  school\nis in session - and at a fixed place - &#x27;adjacent&#x27; to the school.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">59.    Secondly,  there  had  to  be  demonstrated   a   causality   between\ndisturbance that occurs and the noise or diversion.  Thirdly, acts  have  to\nbe willfully done.  It  is  important  to  notice  that  the  Supreme  Court\nspecifically held that &quot;undesirables&quot; or their &quot;annoying  conduct&quot;  may  not\nbe punished. It is only on these limited grounds  that  the  said  Ordinance\nwas considered not to be impermissibly vague.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">60.   In Reno, Attorney General of the United States,  et  al.  v.  American\nCivil Liberties Union et al., 521 U.S. 844 (1997),  two  provisions  of  the\nCommunications Decency Act of 1996  which  sought  to  protect  minors  from\nharmful material on  the  internet  were  adjudged  unconstitutional.   This\njudgment is a little important for two basic reasons - that it deals with  a\npenal offence created for persons who use  the  internet  as  also  for  the\nreason that  the  statute  which  was  adjudged  unconstitutional  uses  the\nexpression  &quot;patently  offensive&quot;  which  comes  extremely  close   to   the\nexpression &quot;grossly offensive&quot; used by the impugned  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_136\">Section  66A</a>.   Section\n223(d), which was adjudged unconstitutional, is set out hereinbelow:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">&quot;223 (d) Whoever-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">&quot;(1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to  a  specific  person  or\npersons under 18 years of age, or\n\n\n(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a  manner  available\nto a person under 18  years  of  age,  &quot;any  comment,  request,  suggestion,\nproposal, image,  or  other  communication  that,  in  context,  depicts  or\ndescribes,  in  terms  patently  offensive  as  measured   by   contemporary\ncommunity standards, sexual or excretory activities  or  organs,  regardless\nof whether the user of  such  service  placed  the  call  or  initiated  the\ncommunication; or\n\n\n(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility  under  such  person&#x27;s\ncontrol to be used for an activity prohibited  by  paragraph  (1)  with  the\nintent that it be used for such activity,\n\n\nshall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not more  than  two  years,  or\nboth.&quot; (at page 860)\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the District Court Judge writing of the internet said:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">&quot;[i]t is no exaggeration to conclude that the  Internet  has  achieved,  and\ncontinues to achieve, the most  participatory  marketplace  of  mass  speech\nthat this country - and indeed the world - as yet seen.  The  plaintiffs  in\nthese actions correctly describe the  &#x27;democratizing&#x27;  effects  of  Internet\ncommunication:  individual  citizens  of  limited  means  can  speak  to   a\nworldwide audience on issues of concern  to  them.   Federalists  and  Anti-\nfederalists may debate the structure of their government nightly, but  these\ndebates occur in newsgroups or chat rooms rather than in pamphlets.  Modern-\nday Luthers still post their theses,  but  to  electronic  bulletins  boards\nrather than the door of the Wittenberg  Schlosskirche.   More  mundane  (but\nfrom  a  constitutional  perspective,  equally  important)  dialogue  occurs\nbetween  aspiring  artists,  or  French  cooks,  or  dog  lovers,   or   fly\nfishermen.&quot; 929 F.

The Supreme Court held that the impugned statute lacked the  precision\nthat the first amendment required when a statute regulates  the  content  of\nspeech.  In order to deny minors access to potentially harmful  speech,  the\nimpugned Act effectively suppresses a large amount  of  speech  that  adults\nhave a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">62.   Such a burden on adult speech  is  unacceptable  if  less  restrictive\nalternatives would be as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose  that\nthe statute was enacted to serve.  It was held that  the  general  undefined\nterm  &quot;patently  offensive&quot;  covers  large  amounts   of    non-pornographic\nmaterial with serious educational or other value  and  was  both  vague  and\nover broad.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">      It was,  thus,  held  that  the  impugned  statute  was  not  narrowly\ntailored and would fall foul of the first amendment.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">63.   In Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television  Stations,  132\nS.Ct. 2307, it was held:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">&quot;A fundamental principle in our legal system is  that  laws  which  regulate\npersons or entities must give fair notice of conduct that  is  forbidden  or\nrequired.  See Connally   v. General  Constr.  Co., 269  U.  S.   385,   391\n(1926) (&quot;[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing  of  an  act\nin terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess  at\nits meaning and differ as to its application, violates the  first  essential\nof due process of law&quot;); Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.  S.  156,  162\n(1972) (&quot;Living under a rule of law entails  various  suppositions,  one  of\nwhich is that &#x27;[all persons] are entitled to be  informed  as  to  what  the\nState commands or forbids&#x27;&quot; (quoting Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S.  451,\n453 (1939) (alteration  in  original))).  This  requirement  of  clarity  in\nregulation is essential to the  protections  provided  by  the  Due  Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment.  See United  States  v. Williams, 553  U.  S.\n285,  304  (2008).  It  requires  the  invalidation   of   laws   that   are\nimpermissibly vague. A conviction or punishment fails  to  comply  with  due\nprocess if the statute or regulation under which it is  obtained  &quot;fails  to\nprovide  a  person  of  ordinary  intelligence  fair  notice  of   what   is\nprohibited,  or  is  so  standardless  that  it  authorizes  or   encourages\nseriously discriminatory enforcement.&quot; Ibid. As this Court has explained,  a\nregulation is not vague because it may at times be  difficult  to  prove  an\nincriminating fact but rather because it is unclear as to what fact must  be\nproved. See id., at 306.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">Even when speech is not at issue, the void for vagueness doctrine  addresses\nat least two connected  but  discrete  due  process  concerns:  first,  that\nregulated parties should know what is required  of  them  so  they  may  act\naccordingly; second, precision and guidance  are  necessary  so  that  those\nenforcing the law  do  not  act  in  an  arbitrary  or  discriminatory  way.\nSee Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-109 (1972). When  speech\nis involved, rigorous  adherence  to  those  requirements  is  necessary  to\nensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech.&quot;(at page 2317)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882909\" id=\"span_34\">64.   Coming to this Court&#x27;s  judgments,  in  <a href=\"/doc/882909/\" id=\"a_137\">State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  v.\nBaldeo Prasad</a>, [1961] 1 S.C.R. 970  an  inclusive  definition  of  the  word\n&quot;goonda&quot; was held to be vague and the offence created by <a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 4A</a>  of  the\nGoondas Act was, therefore, violative of <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 19(1)(d)</a>  and  (e)  of  the\nConstitution.  It was stated:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">&quot;Incidentally it would also be relevant to point out that the definition  of\nthe word &quot;goonda&quot; affords no assistance in deciding  which  citizen  can  be\nput under that category. It is an  inclusive  definition  and  it  does  not\nindicate which tests have to be applied in deciding whether a  person  falls\nin the first part of the definition. Recourse to the dictionary  meaning  of\nthe word would hardly be of any assistance in  this  matter.  After  all  it\nmust be borne in mind that the Act authorises  the  District  Magistrate  to\ndeprive a citizen of his fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_140\">Art. 19(1)(d)</a> and (e),  and\nthough the object of the Act and its purpose would undoubtedly  attract  the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_141\">Art. 19(5)</a> care must always be  taken  in  passing  such  acts\nthat they provide sufficient safeguards against casual, capricious  or  even\nmalicious exercise of the powers conferred by them. It is  well  known  that\nthe relevant provisions of the Act are initially put  in  motion  against  a\nperson at a lower level than the District magistrate, and so  it  is  always\nnecessary that sufficient safeguards  should  be  provided  by  the  Act  to\nprotect the fundamental rights of innocent citizens and to  save  them  from\nunnecessary harassment. That is why we think  the  definition  of  the  word\n&quot;goonda&quot; should have given necessary assistance to the  District  Magistrate\nin deciding whether a particular citizen falls under the category of  goonda\nor not; that is another infirmity in the Act. As  we  have  already  pointed\nout s. 4-A suffers from the same infirmities as<a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_142\"> s. 4</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">Having regard to the two infirmities in <a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_143\">Sections 4</a>,    4-A  respectively  we\ndo not think it would be possible to accede to the argument of  the  Learned\nAdvocate-General that the operative portion of the Act can fall  under  <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_144\">Art.\n19(5)</a> of the Constitution. The person  against  whom  action  can  be  taken\nunder the Act is  not  entitled  to  know  the  source  of  the  information\nreceived by the District Magistrate; he is only told about  his  prejudicial\nactivities on which the satisfaction of the  District  Magistrate  is  based\nthat action should be taken against him under<a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_145\"> s.4</a>  or  s.  4-A.  In  such  a\ncase it is absolutely essential that the Act  must  clearly  indicate  by  a\nproper definition or otherwise when and under what  circumstances  a  person\ncan be called a goonda, and it must impose an  obligation  on  the  District\nMagistrate to apply his mind to  the  question  as  to  whether  the  person\nagainst whom complaints are received is such a goonda or not.  It  has  been\nurged before us that such an obligation is implicit in  <a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_146\">Sections 4</a> and  4-A.\nWe are, however, not impressed by this argument. Where  a  statute  empowers\nthe specified authorities to take preventive action against the citizens  it\nis essential that it should expressly make it a part  of  the  duty  of  the\nsaid authorities to satisfy themselves  about  the  existence  of  what  the\nstatute regards  as  conditions  precedent  to  the  exercise  of  the  said\nauthority. If the statute is silent in respect of  one  of  such  conditions\nprecedent  it  undoubtedly  constitutes  a  serious  infirmity  which  would\ninevitably take it out of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_147\">Art. 19(5).</a> The result  of  this\ninfirmity is that it has left to the unguided and unfettered  discretion  of\nthe authority concerned to treat any citizen as a goonda.  In  other  words,\nthe restrictions which it allows to  be  imposed  on  the  exercise  of  the\nfundamental right of a citizen guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_148\">Art. 19(1)(d)</a> and (e)  must  in\nthe circumstances be held to be unreasonable. That is the view taken by  the\nHigh court and we see no reason to differ from it.&quot; (at pages 979, 980)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1719619\" id=\"span_35\">65.   At one time  this  Court  seemed  to  suggest  that  the  doctrine  of\nvagueness was no  part  of  the  Constitutional  Law  of  India.   That  was\ndispelled in no uncertain terms in <a href=\"/doc/1719619/\" id=\"a_149\">K.A.  Abbas  v.  The  Union  of  India  &amp;\nAnother</a>, [1971] 2 S.C.R. 446:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">&quot;This brings us to the manner of the exercise of control and restriction  by\nthe directions. Here the argument is that most of the regulations are  vague\nand further that they leave no scope for the exercise of creative genius  in\nthe field of art. This poses the first question before us whether the  &#x27;void\nfor vagueness&#x27; doctrine  is  applicable.  Reliance  in  this  connection  is\nplaced on Municipal Committee Amritsar and Anr. v. The State of  Rajasthan .\nIn that case a Division Bench of this Court lays down  that  an  Indian  Act\ncannot be declared invalid on the ground that it violates  the  due  process\nclause or that it is vague......&quot; (at page 469)\n\n&quot;These observations which are clearly obiter are apt  to  be  too  generally\napplied and need to be explained. While  it  is  true  that  the  principles\nevolved by the Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  of  America  in  the\napplication of the Fourteenth Amendment were eschewed  in  our  Constitution\nand instead the limits  of  restrictions  on  each  fundamental  right  were\nindicated in the clauses that follow the  first  clause  of  the  nineteenth\narticle, it cannot be said as an absolute principle  that  no  law  will  be\nconsidered bad for  sheer  vagueness.  There  is  ample  authority  for  the\nproposition that a law affecting fundamental rights may be so considered.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882909\" id=\"span_36\">A\nvery pertinent example is to be found in <a href=\"/doc/882909/\" id=\"a_150\">State of Madhya  Pradesh  and  Anr.\nv. Baldeo Prasad</a>, 1961 (1) SCR 970 where the  Central  Provinces  and  Berar\nGoondas Act 1946 was declared void for uncertainty. The  condition  for  the\napplication of <a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_151\">Sections 4</a> and 4A was that the person sought to be  proceeded\nagainst must be a goonda but the definition of goonda in the  Act  indicated\nno  tests  for  deciding  which  person  fell  within  the  definition.  The\nprovisions were therefore held to be uncertain and vague.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">   The real rule is that if a law is vague or appears to be  so,  the  court\nmust try to construe it, as far as may  be,  and  language  permitting,  the\nconstruction sought to be placed on it,  must  be  in  accordance  with  the\nintention  of  the  legislature.  Thus  if  the  law  is  open  to   diverse\nconstruction, that construction which accords best  with  the  intention  of\nthe  legislature  and  advances  the  purpose  of  legislation,  is  to   be\npreferred. Where however the law admits of  no  such  construction  and  the\npersons applying it are in a boundless sea of uncertainty and the law  prima\nfacie takes away a guaranteed freedom, the law must be held  to  offend  the\nConstitution as was done in  the  case  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_152\">Goonda  Act</a>.  This  is  not\napplication of the doctrine of due process. The invalidity arises  from  the\nprobability of the misuse of the law to the detriment of the individual.  If\npossible, the Court instead of striking down the law  may  itself  draw  the\nline of demarcation where possible but this effort should be sparingly  made\nand only in the clearest of cases.&quot; (at pages 470, 471)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77461\" id=\"span_37\">66.

The  Court\nheld:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">&quot;21. We now come to <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 27</a> of the Act  which  relates  to  licensing  of\ndealers. It was stated on behalf of  the  petitioners  that  the  conditions\nimposed by sub-section (6) of  <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_156\">Section  27</a>  for  the  grant  or  renewal  of\nlicences are uncertain, vague and unintelligible and consequently  wide  and\nunfettered power was conferred upon the statutory authorities in the  matter\nof grant or renewal of licence. In  our  opinion  this  contention  is  well\nfounded and must be accepted as correct. <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_157\">Section  27(6)(a)</a>  states  that  in\nthe matter of issue or renewal of  licences  the  Administrator  shall  have\nregard to &quot;the number of  dealers  existing  in  the  region  in  which  the\napplicant intends to carry on business as a dealer&quot;. But the  word  &quot;region&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">is nowhere defined in the  Act.  Similarly  <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_158\">Section  27(6)(b)</a>  requires  the\nAdministrator to have regard to &quot;the anticipated  demand,  as  estimated  by\nhim, for ornaments in that region.&quot; The expression &quot;anticipated  demand&quot;  is\na vague expression which is not  capable  of  objective  assessment  and  is\nbound to lead to a great  deal  of  uncertainty.  Similarly  the  expression\n&quot;suitability of the applicant&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 27(6)(e)</a> and &quot;public interest&quot;  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 27(6)(g)</a> do not provide any objective standard or norm or  guidance.\nFor these reasons it must be  held  that  clauses  (a),(d),(e)  and  (g)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 27(6)</a> impose unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental  right  of\nthe petitioner to carry on business and  are  constitutionally  invalid.  It\nwas also contended that there was no reason why the conditions  for  renewal\nof licence should be as rigorous as the  conditions  for  initial  grant  of\nlicence. The requirement of strict conditions for  the  renewal  of  licence\nrenders the entire future of  the  business  of  the  dealer  uncertain  and\nsubjects it  to  the  caprice  and  arbitrary  will  of  the  administrative\nauthorities. There is justification for this argument  and  the  requirement\nof <a href=\"/doc/402501/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 26</a> of the Act imposing the same conditions  for  the  renewal  of\nthe licence as for the initial grant appears  to  be  unreasonable.  In  our\nopinion clauses (a), (b), (e) and (g) are inextricably  bound  up  with  the\nother clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 27(6)</a> and form part of a single scheme. The  result\nis that clauses (a), (b), (c), (e) and (g) are not severable and the  entire\n<a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 27(6)</a> of the Act must be held invalid. <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 27(2)(d)</a> of  the  Act\nstates that a valid licence issued by the Administrator  &quot;may  contain  such\nconditions, limitations and restrictions as the Administrator may think  fit\nto impose and different conditions,  limitations  and  restrictions  may  be\nimposed for different classes of dealers&quot;. On the  face  of  it,  this  sub-\nsection confers such wide and vague power upon the Administrator that it  is\ndifficult to limit its scope. In our opinion <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_166\">Section  27(2)(d)</a>  of  the  Act\nmust be struck down as an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental  right\nof the petitioners to carry on business. It appears, however, to us that  if\n<a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 27(2)(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 27(6)</a> of the  Act  are  invalid  the  licensing\nscheme contemplated by the rest of <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 27</a> of the Act  cannot  be  worked\nin practice. It is, therefore,  necessary  for  Parliament  to  enact  fresh\nlegislation imposing appropriate conditions and restrictions for  the  grant\nand  renewal  of  licences  to  dealers.  In  the  alternative  the  Central\nGovernment may make appropriate rules for the same purpose  in  exercise  of\nits rule-making power under <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 114</a> of the Act.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">67.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50294192\" id=\"span_38\">In <a href=\"/doc/50294192/\" id=\"a_171\">A.K. Roy &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a>, [1982] 2  S.C.R.  272,  a\npart of <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 3</a> of the National Security Ordinance was read  down  on  the\nground that  &quot;acting  in  any  manner  prejudicial  to  the  maintenance  of\nsupplies and services essential to the community&quot; is an expression so  vague\nthat it is capable of wanton abuse.   The Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">&quot;What we have said above in regard to the expressions  &#x27;defence  of  India&#x27;,\n&#x27;security of India&#x27;, &#x27;security of the State&#x27; and &#x27;relations  of  India  with\nforeign powers&#x27; cannot  apply  to  the  expression  &quot;acting  in  any  manner\nprejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and  services  essential  to  the\ncommunity&quot; which occurs in <a href=\"/doc/1262152/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 3(2)</a>  of  the  Act.  Which  supplies  and\nservices are essential to  the  community  can  easily  be  defined  by  the\nlegislature  and  indeed,  legislations  which  regulate  the   prices   and\npossession of essential commodities either enumerate  those  commodities  or\nconfer upon the appropriate Government the power to do so.  In  the  absence\nof a definition of &#x27;supplies and services essential to the  community&#x27;,  the\ndetaining authority will be free to extend the application  of  this  clause\nof sub-section (2) to any commodities or services the maintenance of  supply\nof which, according to him, is essential to the community.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">But that is not all.  The  Explanation  to  sub-section  (2)  gives  to  the\nparticular phrase in that sub-section a meaning which is not only  uncertain\nbut which, at any given point of time, will be  difficult  to  ascertain  or\nfasten upon. According to the Explanation, no  order  of  detention  can  be\nmade under the <a href=\"/doc/190229/\" id=\"a_174\">National Security Act</a> on any ground  on  which  an  order  of\ndetention  may  be  made  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/1701160/\" id=\"a_175\">Prevention   of   Blackmarketing   and\nMaintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980</a>. The  reason  for\nthis, which is stated in the Explanation itself, is that  for  the  purposes\nof sub-section (2), &quot;acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance  of\nsupplies essential to the community&quot; does not include &quot;acting in any  manner\nprejudicial to the maintenance of supplies of commodities essential  to  the\ncommunity&quot; as defined in the Explanation to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 3</a>  of\nthe Act of 1980. Clauses (a) and (b) of the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1558162/\" id=\"a_177\">Section  3(1)</a>  of\nthe Act of 1980 exhaust almost the entire range  of  essential  commodities.\nClause (a) relates to committing or instigating any  person  to  commit  any\noffence punishable under the Essential  Commodities  Act,  10  of  1955,  or\nunder any other law for the time being in force relating to the  control  of\nthe production, supply or distribution of, or trade  and  commerce  in,  any\ncommodity essential to the community.  Clause  (b)  of  the  Explanation  to\n<a href=\"/doc/1558162/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act of 1980 relates to dealing in  any  commodity  which\nis an essential commodity as  defined  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/774360/\" id=\"a_179\">Essential  Commodities  Act,\n1955</a>, or with respect to which provisions have been made in any  such  other\nlaw as is referred  to  in  clause  (a).  We  find  it  quite  difficult  to\nunderstand as to which are the remaining commodities outside  the  scope  of\nthe Act of 1980, in respect of which it can be said that the maintenance  of\ntheir supplies is essential to the community. The particular clause in  sub-\nsection (2) of <a href=\"/doc/682299/\" id=\"a_180\">Section  3</a>  of  the  National  Security  Act  is,  therefore,\ncapable of wanton abuse in that, the detaining  authority  can  place  under\ndetention any person for possession of any commodity on the basis  that  the\nauthority is  of  the  opinion  that  the  maintenance  of  supply  of  that\ncommodity is essential to the community. We consider the  particular  clause\nnot only vague and  uncertain  but,  in  the  context  of  the  Explanation,\ncapable of being extended cavalierly to supplies, the maintenance  of  which\nis not essential to the community. To allow  the  personal  liberty  of  the\npeople to be taken away by  the  application  of  that  clause  would  be  a\nflagrant violation of the  fairness  and  justness  of  procedure  which  is\nimplicit in the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_181\">Article 21.&quot;</a> (at page 325-326)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_39\">68.

It is the basic principle of legal jurisprudence that an enactment  is\nvoid for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.  Vague  laws\noffend several important values. It is  insisted  or  emphasized  that  laws\nshould give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity  to\nknow what is prohibited, so that he may  act  accordingly.  Vague  laws  may\ntrap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Such  a  law  impermissibly\ndelegates basic policy matters to policemen and also judges  for  resolution\non an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers  of  arbitrary\nand discriminatory  application.  More  so  uncertain  and  undefined  words\ndeployed inevitably lead citizens to &quot;steer far wider of the  unlawful  zone\n... than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">131. Let us examine clause (i) of <a href=\"/doc/1890726/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 2(1)(a)</a>. This section is shown  to\nbe blissfully and impermissibly vague and imprecise.

Judged by the standards <a href=\"/doc/1813801/\" id=\"a_184\">laid down in</a> the aforesaid  judgments,  it  is\nquite clear that the expressions used in 66A are completely  open-ended  and\nundefined.  <a href=\"/doc/326206/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 66</a> in stark contrast to <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 66A</a> states:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">&quot;66.

It will be clear that  in  all  computer  related  offences  that  are\nspoken of by <a href=\"/doc/326206/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 66</a>, mens  rea  is  an  ingredient  and  the  expression\n&quot;dishonestly&quot;  and  &quot;fraudulently&quot;  are  defined   with   some   degree   of\nspecificity, unlike the expressions used in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 66A</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">71.   The provisions contained in  <a href=\"/doc/48199014/\" id=\"a_192\">Sections  66B</a>  up  to  <a href=\"/doc/176300164/\" id=\"a_193\">Section  67B</a>  also\nprovide for various punishments for offences  that  are  clearly  made  out.\nFor example, under <a href=\"/doc/48199014/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 66B</a>, whoever dishonestly receives or retains  any\nstolen  computer  resource  or  communication  device   is   punished   with\nimprisonment.  Under <a href=\"/doc/118912881/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 66C</a>, whoever fraudulently or dishonestly  makes\nuse of any identification feature of another person is liable to  punishment\nwith  imprisonment.   Under  <a href=\"/doc/121790054/\" id=\"a_196\">Section  66D</a>,  whoever  cheats  by  personating\nbecomes liable to punishment with imprisonment.   Section  66F  again  is  a\nnarrowly drawn  section  which  inflicts  punishment  which  may  extend  to\nimprisonment for  life  for  persons  who  threaten  the  unity,  integrity,\nsecurity or sovereignty of India.  <a href=\"/doc/1318767/\" id=\"a_197\">Sections 67</a> to <a href=\"/doc/176300164/\" id=\"a_198\">67B</a> deal  with  punishment\nfor offences for  publishing  or  transmitting  obscene  material  including\ndepicting children in sexually explicit acts in electronic form.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">72.   In the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_199\">Indian Penal Code</a>, a number of the expressions  that  occur  in\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 66A</a> occur in Section 268.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">&quot;268. Public nuisance.-A person is guilty of a public nuisance who does  any\nact or is guilty of an illegal omission, which  causes  any  common  injury,\ndanger or annoyance to the public or to the people in general who  dwell  or\noccupy property in the vicinity, or which  must  necessarily  cause  injury,\nobstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may  have  occasion  to  use\nany public right.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">A common nuisance  is  not  excused  on  the  ground  that  it  causes  some\nconvenience or advantage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">73.   It is important to notice the distinction  between  the  Sections  268\nand  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_201\">66A</a>.   Whereas,  in  Section  268  the  various  expressions  used  are\ningredients for the offence of a  public  nuisance,  these  ingredients  now\nbecome offences in themselves when it comes to <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 66A</a>.  Further,  under\nSection 268, the person should be guilty of an  act  or  omission  which  is\nillegal in  nature  -  legal  acts  are  not  within  its  net.   A  further\ningredient is that injury, danger or annoyance must  be  to  the  public  in\ngeneral.  Injury,  danger  or  annoyance  are  not  offences  by  themselves\nhowsoever made and to whomsoever made.  The expression  &quot;annoyance&quot;  appears\nalso in <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_203\">Sections 294</a> and <a href=\"/doc/529653/\" id=\"a_204\">510</a> of the IPC:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">&quot;294. Obscene acts and songs.-Whoever, to the annoyance of others,\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">(a) does any obscene act in any public place, or\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">(b) sings, recites or utters any obscene songs, ballad or words, in or  near\nany public place,\n\n\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a  term  which\nmay extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">510. Misconduct in public by  a  drunken  person.-Whoever,  in  a  state  of\nintoxication, appears in any public place, or in any place  which  it  is  a\ntrespass in him to enter, and there conducts himself in such a manner as  to\ncause annoyance to any person, shall be punished  with  simple  imprisonment\nfor a term which may extend to twenty-four hours, or  with  fine  which  may\nextend to ten rupees, or with both.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">74.   If one looks at Section 294,  the  annoyance  that  is  spoken  of  is\nclearly defined - that is, it has to be  caused  by  obscene  utterances  or\nacts.  Equally, under Section 510, the annoyance that is caused to a  person\nmust only be by another person who is in a state  of  intoxication  and  who\nannoys such person only in a public place or in a place for which  it  is  a\ntrespass for him to enter.  Such narrowly and closely  defined  contours  of\noffences made out under the Penal Code are conspicuous by their  absence  in\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 66A</a> which in stark contrast uses completely  open  ended,  undefined\nand vague language.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">75.   Incidentally,  none  of  the  expressions  used  in  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_206\">Section  66A</a>  are\ndefined.  Even &quot;criminal intimidation&quot; is not defined - and  the  definition\nclause of the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_207\">Information Technology Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 2</a> does not say that  words\nand expressions that are defined in the Penal Code will apply to  this  Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">76.    Quite  apart  from  this,  as  has  been  pointed  out  above,  every\nexpression used is nebulous in meaning.  What may be offensive  to  one  may\nnot be offensive to another. What may cause annoyance  or  inconvenience  to\none  may  not  cause  annoyance  or  inconvenience  to  another.   Even  the\nexpression &quot;persistently&quot; is completely imprecise -  suppose  a  message  is\nsent thrice, can it be  said  that  it  was  sent  &quot;persistently&quot;?   Does  a\nmessage have to be sent (say) at least eight times, before it  can  be  said\nthat such message is &quot;persistently&quot; sent?   There  is  no  demarcating  line\nconveyed by any of these expressions - and that is what renders the  Section\nunconstitutionally vague.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1537019\" id=\"span_41\">77.   However, the learned Additional Solicitor  General  argued  before  us\nthat expressions that are used in  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_209\">Section  66A</a>  may  be  incapable  of  any\nprecise definition  but  for  that  reason  they  are  not  constitutionally\nvulnerable.  He cited a  large  number  of  judgments  in  support  of  this\nsubmission.  None of the cited judgments dealt with a  Section  creating  an\noffence which is saved despite  its  being  vague  and  in  capable  of  any\nprecise definition. In fact, most of the judgments cited before us  did  not\ndeal  with  criminal  law  at  all.   The  few  that  did  are  dealt   with\nhereinbelow.  For instance, <a href=\"/doc/1537019/\" id=\"a_210\">Madan Singh v. State of Bihar</a>, (2004) 4 SCC  622\nwas cited before us.  The passage  cited  from  the  aforesaid  judgment  is\ncontained in para 19 of the judgment.  The  cited  passage  is  not  in  the\ncontext of an argument  that  the  word  &quot;terrorism&quot;  not  being  separately\ndefined would, therefore, be struck down on the ground  of  vagueness.   The\ncited passage was only in the context of upholding  the  conviction  of  the\naccused <a href=\"/doc/1537019/\" id=\"a_211\">in that case</a>.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37174\" id=\"span_42\">Similarly, in <a href=\"/doc/37174/\" id=\"a_212\">Zameer Ahmed Latifur Rehman  Sheikh  v.\nState of Maharashtra &amp; Ors.</a>, (2010) 5 SCC 246, the  expression  &quot;insurgency&quot;\nwas said to be undefined and would defy a precise definition, yet  it  could\nbe understood to mean break down of peace and tranquility as  also  a  grave\ndisturbance of public order so as to endanger the security of the State  and\nits sovereignty.  This again was said in the context of a challenge  on  the\nground  of  legislative  competence.   The  provisions  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_213\">Maharashtra\nControl of Organised Crime Act</a> were challenged on the ground that they  were\noutside the expression &quot;public order&quot; contained in Entry 1 of List I of  the\n7th Schedule of the Constitution of India.  This contention was repelled  by\nsaying that the expression &quot;public  order&quot;  was  wide  enough  to  encompass\ncases of &quot;insurgency&quot;.  This case again had nothing to do with  a  challenge\nraised on the ground of vagueness.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"666476\" id=\"span_43\">78.

Kedia Leather &amp; Liquor Limited</a>,  (2003)\n7 SCC 389, paragraph 8 was cited to  show  that  the  expression  &quot;nuisance&quot;\nappearing in <a href=\"/doc/983382/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 133</a> of the Code of  Criminal  Procedure  was  also  not\ncapable of precise definition.  This again was said in  the  context  of  an\nargument that <a href=\"/doc/983382/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 133</a> of the Code of Criminal  Procedure  was  impliedly\nrepealed by the <a href=\"/doc/867156/\" id=\"a_217\">Water (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution)  Act,  1974</a>.\nThis contention was repelled by saying that the areas of  operation  of  the\ntwo provisions were completely different  and  they  existed  side  by  side\nbeing mutually exclusive.  This case again  did  not  contain  any  argument\nthat the provision contained  in  Section  133  was  vague  and,  therefore,\nunconstitutional.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"514077\" id=\"span_44\">Similarly, in <a href=\"/doc/514077/\" id=\"a_218\">State of Karnataka  v.  Appa  Balu  Ingale</a>,\n1995 Supp. (4) SCC 469,  the  word  &quot;untouchability&quot;  was  said  not  to  be\ncapable of precise definition.  Here  again,  there  was  no  constitutional\nchallenge on the ground of vagueness.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">79.   In fact,  two  English  judgments  cited  by  the  learned  Additional\nSolicitor General would demonstrate how vague the words used in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_219\">Section  66A</a>\nare.  In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Collins, (2006) 1 WLR 2223,  the\nvery expression &quot;grossly offensive&quot; is contained  in  Section  127(1)(1)  of\nthe U.K. Communications Act, 2003.  A 61 year  old  man  made  a  number  of\ntelephone calls over two years to the office of a Member of Parliament.   In\nthese telephone calls and recorded messages  Mr.  Collins  who  held  strong\nviews on immigration made a reference to &quot;Wogs&quot;, &quot;Pakis&quot;,  &quot;Black  bastards&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">and &quot;Niggers&quot;.  Mr.  Collins was charged with sending  messages  which  were\ngrossly offensive.  The Leicestershire Justices dismissed the  case  against\nMr. Collins on the ground that the telephone calls were  offensive  but  not\ngrossly offensive.  A reasonable person would not so find the  calls  to  be\ngrossly offensive.  The Queen&#x27;s Bench agreed and dismissed the appeal  filed\nby the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The House  of  Lords  reversed  the\nQueen&#x27;s Bench stating:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">&quot;9. The parties agreed with the rulings of the Divisional Court that  it  is\nfor the Justices to determine as a question of fact  whether  a  message  is\ngrossly offensive, that in  making  this  determination  the  Justices  must\napply the standards of an open and just multi-racial society, and  that  the\nwords must be judged taking  account  of  their  context  and  all  relevant\ncircumstances. I would agree also. Usages and sensitivities may change  over\ntime. Language otherwise insulting may be  used  in  an  unpejorative,  even\naffectionate,  way,  or  may  be  adopted  as  a  badge  of   honour   (&quot;Old\nContemptibles&quot;). There can be no yardstick of gross offensiveness  otherwise\nthan by the application of reasonably enlightened,  but  not  perfectionist,\ncontemporary standards to the particular  message  sent  in  its  particular\ncontext. The test is whether a message is couched in terms liable  to  cause\ngross offence to those to whom it relates. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">10. In contrast with section  127(2)(a)  and  its  predecessor  subsections,\nwhich require proof of an  unlawful  purpose  and  a  degree  of  knowledge,\nsection 127(1)(a) provides no explicit guidance on the state of  mind  which\nmust be proved against a defendant  to  establish  an  offence  against  the\nsubsection.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">80.   Similarly in Chambers v. Director of  Public  Prosecutions,  [2013]  1\nW.L.R. 1833, the Queen&#x27;s Bench was faced with the following facts:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">&quot;Following an alert on the Internet social network, Twitter,  the  defendant\nbecame aware that, due to adverse weather conditions, an airport from  which\nhe was due to travel nine days later was closed.  He  responded  by  posting\nseveral &quot;tweets&quot; on Twitter  in  his  own  name,  including  the  following:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">&quot;Crap1 Robin Hood Airport is closed.  You&#x27;ve got a week and  a  bit  to  get\nyour shit together otherwise I am blowing the airport  sky  high1&quot;  None  of\nthe defendant&#x27;s &quot;followers&quot; who read the posting was alarmed by  it  at  the\ntime.  Some five days after its posting the defendant&#x27;s tweet  was  read  by\nthe duty manager responsible for  security  at  the  airport  on  a  general\nInternet search for tweets relating to the airport.  Though not believed  to\nbe a credible threat the matter was reported to the  police.   In  interview\nthe defendant asserted that the tweet was a joke  and  not  intended  to  be\nmenacing.  The defendant was charged with sending  by  a  public  electronic\ncommunications network  a  message  of  a  menacing  character  contrary  to\nsection 127(1)(a) of the Communications Act 2003.  He  was  convicted  in  a\nmagistrates&#x27; court and, on appeal, the Crown Court  upheld  the  conviction,\nbeing satisfied that  the  message  was  &quot;menacing  per  se&quot;  and  that  the\ndefendant was, at the very least, aware that his message was of  a  menacing\ncharacter.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">81.   The Crown Court  was  satisfied  that  the  message  in  question  was\n&quot;menacing&quot; stating that  an  ordinary  person  seeing  the  tweet  would  be\nalarmed and, therefore, such  message  would  be  &quot;menacing&quot;.   The  Queen&#x27;s\nBench Division reversed the Crown Court stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">&quot;31.  Before concluding that a message is criminal  on  the  basis  that  it\nrepresents a menace, its precise terms, and any inferences to be drawn  from\nits precise terms, need to be examined in the context in and  the  means  by\nwhich the message was sent.  The Crown Court  was  understandably  concerned\nthat this message was sent at a time when, as we all know, there  is  public\nconcern about acts of terrorism and the continuing threat  to  the  security\nof the country from possible further terrorist  attacks.   That  is  plainly\nrelevant to context, but the offence is not directed  to  the  inconvenience\nwhich may be caused by the message.  In any event, the more one reflects  on\nit, the clearer it becomes that this message did not represent  a  terrorist\nthreat, or indeed any other form of threat.  It was posted on &quot;Twitter&quot;  for\nwidespread reading, a conversation  piece  for  the  defendant&#x27;s  followers,\ndrawing attention to himself and his predicament.  Much more  significantly,\nalthough it purports to address &quot;you&quot;, meaning  those  responsible  for  the\nairport, it was not sent to anyone at the airport or anyone responsible  for\nairport security, or indeed any form  of  public  security.   The  grievance\naddressed by the message is that the  airport  is  closed  when  the  writer\nwants it to be open.  The language and  punctuation  are  inconsistent  with\nthe writer intending it to be or it  to  be  taken  as  a  serious  warning.\nMoreover, as Mr. Armson noted, it is unusual for a  threat  of  a  terrorist\nnature to invite the person making it to  be  readily  identified,  as  this\nmessage did.  Finally, although we are accustomed to very brief messages  by\nterrorists to indicate that a bomb or  explosive  device  has  been  put  in\nplace and will detonate shortly,  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  a  serious\nthreat in which  warning  of  it  is  given  to  a  large  number  of  tweet\n&quot;followers&quot; in ample time for the threat to be reported and extinguished.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">82.   These two cases illustrate how judicially trained minds would  find  a\nperson guilty or not guilty depending upon the Judge&#x27;s  notion  of  what  is\n&quot;grossly  offensive&quot;  or   &quot;menacing&quot;.    In   Collins&#x27;   case,   both   the\nLeicestershire Justices and two Judges  of  the  Queen&#x27;s  Bench  would  have\nacquitted Collins whereas the House of Lords convicted him.   Similarly,  in\nthe Chambers case, the Crown Court would  have  convicted  Chambers  whereas\nthe Queen&#x27;s Bench acquitted him.  If judicially trained minds  can  come  to\ndiametrically opposite conclusions on the same set of facts  it  is  obvious\nthat expressions such as &quot;grossly offensive&quot;  or  &quot;menacing&quot;  are  so  vague\nthat there is no manageable standard by which a person can be said  to  have\ncommitted an offence or not to have committed an offence.  Quite  obviously,\na prospective offender of  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_220\">Section  66A</a>  and  the  authorities  who  are  to\nenforce <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 66A</a> have absolutely no manageable standard by which to  book\na person for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 66A</a>.   This  being  the  case,  having\nregard also to the two English precedents cited by  the  learned  Additional\nSolicitor General, it  is  clear  that  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_223\">Section  66A</a>  is  unconstitutionally\nvague.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">Ultimately, applying the tests referred to in Chintaman Rao and  V.G.  Row&#x27;s\ncase, referred to earlier in the judgment, it  is  clear  that  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_224\">Section  66A</a>\narbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately invades the  right  of  free\nspeech and  upsets  the  balance  between  such  right  and  the  reasonable\nrestrictions that may be imposed on such right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">Chilling Effect And Overbreadth\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">83.   Information that may be grossly offensive or  which  causes  annoyance\nor inconvenience are undefined terms which take into the net  a  very  large\namount of protected and innocent  speech.  A  person  may  discuss  or  even\nadvocate by means of writing  disseminated  over  the  internet  information\nthat may be a view or point of view pertaining  to  governmental,  literary,\nscientific or other matters which may be unpalatable to certain sections  of\nsociety. It is obvious that an expression of a view on any matter may  cause\nannoyance, inconvenience or  may  be  grossly  offensive  to  some.   A  few\nexamples will suffice.   A certain section of a particular community may  be\ngrossly offended or annoyed by communications over the internet by  &quot;liberal\nviews&quot; - such as the emancipation of women or the  abolition  of  the  caste\nsystem or whether certain members of a non proselytizing religion should  be\nallowed to bring persons within their fold who  are  otherwise  outside  the\nfold.  Each  one  of  these  things  may  be  grossly  offensive,  annoying,\ninconvenient,  insulting  or  injurious  to  large  sections  of  particular\ncommunities and would fall within the net cast by <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 66A</a>. In  point  of\nfact, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 66A</a> is cast so  widely  that  virtually  any  opinion  on  any\nsubject would be covered by it, as any serious opinion dissenting  with  the\nmores of the day would be caught within its net.  Such is the reach  of  the\nSection and if it  is  to  withstand  the  test  of  constitutionality,  the\nchilling effect on free speech would be total.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">84.   Incidentally, some of our  judgments  have  recognized  this  chilling\neffect of free speech.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_45\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_227\">R.

The principle of Sullivan [376 US 254 : 11 L  Ed  2d  686  (1964)]  was\ncarried forward - and this is relevant to the  second  question  arising  in\nthis case - in Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd. [(1993)  2\nWLR 449 : (1993) 1 All ER 1011, HL] , a decision rendered by  the  House  of\nLords. The plaintiff, a local authority brought an action  for  damages  for\nlibel  against  the  defendants  in  respect  of  two   articles   published\nin Sunday Times questioning  the  propriety  of  investments  made  for  its\nsuperannuation fund. The articles were headed  &quot;Revealed:  Socialist  tycoon\ndeals with Labour Chief&quot; and &quot;Bizarre deals of  a  council  leader  and  the\nmedia tycoon&quot;. A preliminary issue was raised whether the  plaintiff  has  a\ncause of action against the defendant. The trial Judge  held  that  such  an\naction was maintainable but on appeal  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  to  the\ncontrary. When the matter reached  the  House  of  Lords,  it  affirmed  the\ndecision of the Court of Appeal  but  on  a  different  ground.  Lord  Keith\ndelivered the judgment agreed to by all other  learned  Law  Lords.  In  his\nopinion,  Lord   Keith   recalled   that   in Attorney   General v. Guardian\nNewspapers Ltd. (No. 2)[(1990) 1 AC 109 : (1988) 3 All ER  545  :  (1988)  3\nWLR 776, HL] popularly known as &quot;Spycatcher case&quot;, the House  of  Lords  had\nopined  that  &quot;there  are  rights  available  to  private   citizens   which\ninstitutions of... Government are not in a position to exercise unless  they\ncan show that it is in the public interest to  do  so&quot;.  It  was  also  held\ntherein that not only was there no public interest in allowing  governmental\ninstitutions to sue for libel, it  was  &quot;contrary  to  the  public  interest\nbecause to admit such actions would place an undesirable fetter  on  freedom\nof speech&quot; and further that action for defamation or threat of  such  action\n&quot;inevitably have an inhibiting effect on freedom  of  speech&quot;.  The  learned\nLaw Lord referred to the decision of the United States Supreme Court  in New\nYork Times v. Sullivan [376 US 254 : 11 L Ed  2d  686  (1964)]  and  certain\nother decisions of American Courts and observed - and  this  is  significant\nfor our purposes-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">&quot;while these decisions were related most directly to the provisions  of  the\nAmerican Constitution concerned with securing freedom of speech, the  public\ninterest considerations which underlaid them  are  no  less  valid  in  this\ncountry.

The aforesaid rule was challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_235\">Articles 19 (1)(a)</a> and (b)  of\nthe Constitution.

It first  held\nthat demonstrations are a form of speech and then held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">&quot;The approach to the question regarding the constitutionality  of  the  rule\nshould be whether the  ban  that  it  imposes  on  demonstrations  would  be\ncovered by the limitation of the guaranteed rights contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_238\">Art. 19  (2)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1723400/\" id=\"a_239\">19(3).</a> In regard to both these clauses the only relevant criteria  which\nhas been suggested by the respondent-State is that the rule  is  framed  &quot;in\nthe interest of public  order&quot;.  A  demonstration  may  be  defined  as  &quot;an\nexpression of one&#x27;s feelings by outward signs.&quot; A demonstration such  as  is\nprohibited by, the rule may be of the most innocent type - peaceful  orderly\nsuch as the mere wearing of a badge by a Government servant  or  even  by  a\nsilent assembly say outside office hours - demonstrations which could in  no\nsense be suggested to involve any  breach  of  tranquility,  or  of  a  type\ninvolving incitement to or capable of leading to disorder. If the  rule  had\nconfined itself to demonstrations of type which would lead to disorder  then\nthe validity of that rule could have been sustained but what the  rule  does\nis the imposition of a blanket-ban on all demonstrations of whatever type  -\ninnocent as well as otherwise - and in consequence its  validity  cannot  be\nupheld.&quot; (at page 374)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">89.

Finally,\nthe Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">&quot;The vice of the rule, in our opinion, consists in this that it lays  a  ban\non every type of demonstration - be the same however  innocent  and  however\nincapable of causing a breach of public tranquility  and  does  not  confine\nitself to those forms of demonstrations which might lead  to  that  result.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">(at page 384)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">90.

We,  therefore,  hold  that  the  Section   is\nunconstitutional  also  on  the  ground  that  it  takes  within  its  sweep\nprotected speech and speech  that  is  innocent  in  nature  and  is  liable\ntherefore to be used in such a way as to have  a  chilling  effect  on  free\nspeech and would, therefore, have  to  be  struck  down  on  the  ground  of\noverbreadth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">Possibility of an act being abused is not a ground to test its validity:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\">91.

The converse must  also  follow  that  a  statute\nwhich is otherwise invalid as being unreasonable  cannot  be  saved  by  its\nbeing administered in a reasonable manner. The  constitutional  validity  of\nthe statute would have to be determined on the basis of its  provisions  and\non the ambit of its operation as  reasonably  construed.  If  so  judged  it\npasses the test of  reasonableness,  possibility  of  the  powers  conferred\nbeing improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the  law  itself  invalid\nand similarly if the law properly interpreted and tested  in  the  light  of\nthe requirements set out in Part III of the Constitution does not  pass  the\ntest it cannot be pronounced valid merely because it is  administered  in  a\nmanner which might  not  conflict  with  the  constitutional  requirements.&quot;\n(at page 825)\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">92.   In this case, it is the converse proposition which would really  apply\nif the learned Additional Solicitor General&#x27;s argument is  to  be  accepted.\nIf <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 66A</a> is otherwise invalid, it cannot  be  saved  by  an  assurance\nfrom the learned Additional Solicitor General that it will  be  administered\nin a reasonable manner.  Governments may come and  Governments  may  go  but\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 66A</a> goes on forever.  An assurance from the present Government  even\nif carried out faithfully would  not  bind  any  successor  Government.   It\nmust, therefore, be held that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 66A</a> must be judged on its  own  merits\nwithout any reference to how well it may be administered.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">Severability:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_152\">93.

The  State  of  Madras</a>,  [1950]  S.C.R.  594\nrepelled a contention of severability when it came to the  courts  enforcing\nthe fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> in the following terms:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">&quot;It was, however, argued that <a href=\"/doc/1004398/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 9</a>(1-A) could not be considered  wholly\nvoid,  as,  under  <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_254\">Article  13(1)</a>,  an  existing  law  inconsistent  with  a\nfundamental right is void only to the extent of  the  inconsistency  and  no\nmore. Insofar as the securing of the public safety  or  the  maintenance  of\npublic  order  would  include  the  security  of  the  State,  the  impugned\nprovision, as applied to the latter purpose, was covered by  clause  (2)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 19</a> and must, it was said, be held to be  valid.  We  are  unable  to\naccede to this contention. Where a law purports to authorise the  imposition\nof restrictions on a fundamental right in  language  wide  enough  to  cover\nrestrictions  both  within  and  without  the  limits  of   constitutionally\npermissible legislative action affecting such right, it is not  possible  to\nuphold it even so far  as  it  may  be  applied  within  the  constitutional\nlimits, as it is not severable. So long as  the  possibility  of  its  being\napplied for purposes not sanctioned by  the  Constitution  cannot  be  ruled\nout, it must be held to  be  wholly  unconstitutional  and  void.  In  other\nwords,  clause  (2)  of  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_256\">Article  19</a>  having  allowed  the   imposition   of\nrestrictions on the freedom of speech and expression  only  in  cases  where\ndanger to the State is involved, an enactment, which  is  capable  of  being\napplied to cases where no such danger could arise,  cannot  be  held  to  be\nconstitutional and valid to any extent.&quot; (At page 603)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1719619\" id=\"span_55\">95.

The present being a case of  an  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_274\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  violation,  Romesh\nThappar&#x27;s judgment would  apply  on  all  fours.   In  an  <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_275\">Article  19(1)(g)</a>\nchallenge,  there is no question of  a law being applied  for  purposes  not\nsanctioned by the Constitution for the simple reason that the eight  subject\nmatters of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_276\">Article 19(2)</a> are conspicuous by their absence in  <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_277\">Article  19(6)</a>\nwhich only speaks of  reasonable  restrictions  in  the  interests  of   the\ngeneral public.  The present is a  case  where,  as  has  been  held  above,\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_278\">Section 66A</a> does not fall within any of the  subject  matters  contained  in\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 19(2)</a> and the possibility of its being applied for purposes  outside\nthose subject matters is clear.  We therefore hold that no part  of  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_280\">Section\n66A</a>  is  severable  and  the  provision  as  a  whole   must   be   declared\nunconstitutional.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\"><a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 14</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">97.   Counsel for the petitioners  have  argued  that  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_282\">Article  14</a>  is  also\ninfringed in that an offence  whose  ingredients  are  vague  in  nature  is\narbitrary and unreasonable and would result in arbitrary and  discriminatory\napplication  of  the  criminal  law.  Further,  there  is  no   intelligible\ndifferentia between the medium of print, broadcast, and real live speech  as\nopposed to  speech  on  the  internet  and,  therefore,  new  categories  of\ncriminal offences cannot be made on this  ground.   Similar  offences  which\nare committed on the internet have  a  three  year  maximum  sentence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 66A</a> as opposed to defamation which has a two year maximum  sentence.\nAlso, defamation is a non-cognizable offence whereas under <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_284\">Section  66A</a>  the\noffence is cognizable.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">98.   We have already held that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_285\">Section 66A</a>  creates  an  offence  which  is\nvague  and  overbroad,  and,  therefore,  unconstitutional   under   <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_286\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> and not saved by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_287\">Article 19(2).</a>  We have also held that  the  wider\nrange of circulation over the internet cannot restrict the  content  of  the\nright under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_288\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> nor can it justify its denial.   However,  when\nwe come to discrimination under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 14</a>, we  are  unable  to  agree  with\ncounsel for the  petitioners  that  there  is  no  intelligible  differentia\nbetween the medium of print, broadcast and real live speech  as  opposed  to\nspeech on  the  internet.  The  intelligible  differentia  is  clear  -  the\ninternet gives any individual a platform which requires very  little  or  no\npayment through which to air his views.  The  learned  Additional  Solicitor\nGeneral has correctly said that  something  posted  on  a  site  or  website\ntravels like lightning and can  reach  millions  of  persons  all  over  the\nworld.  If the petitioners were right, this <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_290\">Article 14</a> argument would  apply\nequally to all other offences created  by  the  <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_291\">Information  Technology  Act</a>\nwhich are not the subject matter of challenge in these petitions.   We  make\nit clear that there is an intelligible differentia  between  speech  on  the\ninternet and other mediums of communication for which separate offences  can\ncertainly  be  created  by  legislation.   We  find,  therefore,  that   the\nchallenge on the ground of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_292\">Article 14</a> must fail.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">Procedural Unreasonableness\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">99.    One  other  argument  must  now  be  considered.   According  to  the\npetitioners,  <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_293\">Section  66A</a>  also  suffers  from  the  vice   of   procedural\nunreasonableness.   In  that,  if,  for  example,  criminal  defamation   is\nalleged, the safeguards available under <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_294\">Section 199</a>  Cr.P.C.  would  not  be\navailable for a like offence committed under <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_295\">Section 66A</a>.   Such  safeguards\nare that no court shall take cognizance of such an  offence  except  upon  a\ncomplaint made by some  person  aggrieved  by  the  offence  and  that  such\ncomplaint will have to be made within six months from the date on which  the\noffence is alleged to have been committed.  Further, safeguards that are  to\nbe found in <a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_296\">Sections 95</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164912/\" id=\"a_297\">96</a> of the Cr.P.C. are also absent when it  comes\nto <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_298\">Section 66A</a>. For example, where any newspaper book or  document  wherever\nprinted appears to contain matter which  is  obscene,  hurts  the  religious\nfeelings of some community, is seditious in nature, causes enmity or  hatred\nto a certain section of the public,  or  is  against  national  integration,\nsuch book, newspaper or document may be seized  but  under  Section  96  any\nperson having any interest in such newspaper, book or  document  may  within\ntwo months from the date of a publication seizing such documents,  books  or\nnewspapers apply to the High court to  set  aside  such  declaration.   Such\nmatter is to be heard by a Bench consisting of at least three Judges  or  in\nHigh Courts which consist of less than three Judges, such special  Bench  as\nmay be composed of all the Judges of that High Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">100.  It is clear that <a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_299\">Sections 95</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164912/\" id=\"a_300\">96</a> of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code\nreveal a certain degree of sensitivity to  the  fundamental  right  to  free\nspeech and expression.  If matter is to be seized on specific grounds  which\nare relatable to the subject matters contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_301\">Article  19(2)</a>,  it  would\nbe open for persons affected by such seizure to get  a  declaration  from  a\nHigh Court consisting of at least three Judges that in fact  publication  of\nthe so-called offensive matter does  not  in  fact  relate  to  any  of  the\nspecified subjects contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_302\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_162\">Further, <a href=\"/doc/967463/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 196</a> of the Cr.P.C. states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">&quot;196.

In addition, Section 118 would also  fall  within  Entry  1  of\nList II in that as its marginal note tells us it deals  with  penalties  for\ncausing grave violation of public order or danger.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">104.  It is well settled  that  a  statute  cannot  be  dissected  and  then\nexamined as to under what field of legislation each  part  would  separately\nfall.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1057797\" id=\"span_62\">In <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_311\">A.S.

To do that, one must have regard to the enactment as  a  whole,\nto its objects and to the scope and effect of its  provisions.  If  on  such\nexamination it is found that the  legislation  is  in  substance  one  on  a\nmatter assigned to the legislature, then it must be held to be valid in  its\nentirety, even though it might incidentally  trench  on  matters  which  are\nbeyond its competence. It would  be  quite  an  erroneous  approach  to  the\nquestion to view such a statute not as an  organic  whole,  but  as  a  mere\ncollection of sections, then disintegrate it into parts, examine under  what\nheads of legislation those parts would severally fall, and by  that  process\ndetermine what portions thereof are intra vires,  and  what  are  not.&quot;  (at\npage 410)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\">105.  It is, therefore, clear that the <a href=\"/doc/93131343/\" id=\"a_312\">Kerala Police  Act</a>  as  a  whole  and\nSection 118 as part thereof falls in pith and substance within Entry 2  List\nII, notwithstanding any incidental encroachment that it  may  have  made  on\nany other Entry in List I. Even otherwise, the penalty created  for  causing\nannoyance in an indecent manner in pith  and  substance  would  fall  within\nEntry 1 List III which speaks of criminal law and would thus be  within  the\ncompetence of the State Legislature in any case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">106.

Under Rule 5, the Designated Officer  may  on  receiving  any  such\nrequest or complaint from the Nodal Officer of an  Organization  or  from  a\ncompetent  court,  by  order  direct  any  intermediary  or  agency  of  the\nGovernment to  block  any  information  or  part  thereof  for  the  reasons\nspecified in 69A(1). Under Rule 7 thereof, the request/complaint shall  then\nbe examined by a Committee of Government Personnel  who  under  Rule  8  are\nfirst  to  make  all  reasonable  efforts  to  identify  the  originator  or\nintermediary who has hosted the information.  If  so  identified,  a  notice\nshall issue to appear and submit their reply at a specified  date  and  time\nwhich shall not be less than 48 hours from the date and time of  receipt  of\nnotice by such person or intermediary.   The  Committee  then  examines  the\nrequest and is to consider whether the request is covered by 69A(1)  and  is\nthen to give a specific recommendation in writing to the  Nodal  Officer  of\nthe concerned Organization.  It  is  only  thereafter  that  the  Designated\nOfficer is to  submit  the  Committee&#x27;s  recommendation  to  the  Secretary,\nDepartment of Information Technology who is  to  approve  such  requests  or\ncomplaints.  Upon such approval, the Designated Officer  shall  then  direct\nany  agency  of  Government  or  intermediary   to   block   the   offending\ninformation. Rule 9  provides  for  blocking  of  information  in  cases  of\nemergency where delay caused would be fatal in which case the  blocking  may\ntake place without any  opportunity  of  hearing.   The  Designated  Officer\nshall then, not later than 48 hours of the issue of the  interim  direction,\nbring the request before the Committee referred to earlier, and only on  the\nrecommendation of the Committee, is the Secretary Department of  Information\nTechnology to pass the final order.  Under Rule 10, in the case of an  order\nof a competent court in India, the Designated Officer shall, on  receipt  of\na certified copy of a court order, submit it to  the  Secretary,  Department\nof Information Technology and  then  initiate  action  as  directed  by  the\nCourt.  In addition  to  the  above  safeguards,  under  Rule  14  a  Review\nCommittee shall meet at least once in two months and record its findings  as\nto whether directions issued are in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/166979650/\" id=\"a_324\">Section  69A(1)</a>  and  if\nit is of the contrary opinion, the  Review  Committee  may  set  aside  such\ndirections and issue orders to unblock the  said  information.   Under  Rule\n16, strict confidentiality shall be maintained regarding  all  the  requests\nand complaints received and actions taken thereof.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_178\">108.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  assailed  the  constitutional\nvalidity of <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_325\">Section 69A</a>, and  assailed  the  validity  of  the  2009  Rules.\nAccording to learned counsel, there is no  pre-decisional  hearing  afforded\nby the Rules particularly to  the  &quot;originator&quot;  of  information,  which  is\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_326\">Section  2(za)</a>  of  the  Act  to  mean  a  person  who  sends,\ngenerates, stores  or  transmits  any  electronic  message;  or  causes  any\nelectronic message to be sent,  generated,  stored  or  transmitted  to  any\nother person. Further, procedural safeguards  such  as  which  are  provided\nunder <a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_327\">Section 95</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164912/\" id=\"a_328\">96</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not  available\nhere.  Also, the confidentiality provision  was  assailed  stating  that  it\naffects the fundamental rights of the petitioners.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">109.  It will be noticed that <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_329\">Section 69A</a> unlike <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_330\">Section 66A</a> is  a  narrowly\ndrawn provision with several safeguards.  First and foremost,  blocking  can\nonly be resorted to where the Central Government is  satisfied  that  it  is\nnecessary so to do.  Secondly, such necessity is relatable only to  some  of\nthe subjects set  out  in  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_331\">Article  19(2).</a>   Thirdly,  reasons  have  to  be\nrecorded in writing in such blocking order so that they may be  assailed  in\na writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_332\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_180\">110.  The Rules further provide for a hearing before the Committee set up  -\nwhich Committee then looks into whether or not  it  is  necessary  to  block\nsuch information.  It is only when the Committee finds that there is such  a\nnecessity that a  blocking  order  is  made.   It  is  also  clear  from  an\nexamination of Rule 8 that it is not merely  the  intermediary  who  may  be\nheard. If the &quot;person&quot; i.e. the originator is identified he is  also  to  be\nheard before a blocking order is passed. Above all, it is only  after  these\nprocedural safeguards are met that blocking orders  are  made  and  in  case\nthere is a certified copy of a court order,  only  then  can  such  blocking\norder also be made.  It is only an intermediary who finally fails to  comply\nwith the directions issued  who  is  punishable  under  sub-section  (3)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_333\">Section 69A</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">111.  Merely because certain additional safeguards such as  those  found  in\n<a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_334\">Section  95</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1164912/\" id=\"a_335\">96</a>  CrPC  are  not  available  does  not  make  the  Rules\nconstitutionally infirm.

Under the 2011 Rules, by Rule  3  an  intermediary  has  not  only  to\npublish the rules and regulations, privacy policy  and  user  agreement  for\naccess or usage of the intermediary&#x27;s computer resource but he has  also  to\ninform all users of the various matters set out in Rule  3(2).

Further  the  intermediary  shall\npreserve such information and associated records for at  least  ninety  days\nfor investigation purposes.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_187\">114.  Learned counsel for the petitioners assailed Rules 3(2)  and  3(4)  on\ntwo basic grounds.  Firstly, the intermediary is  called  upon  to  exercise\nits own judgment under sub-rule (4) and then disable information that is  in\ncontravention of sub-rule (2), when intermediaries by their very  definition\nare only persons who offer a neutral  platform  through  which  persons  may\ninteract with each other over the  internet.   Further,  no  safeguards  are\nprovided as in the 2009 Rules made under <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 69A</a>.  Also,  for  the  very\nreasons that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_341\">Section 66A</a> is bad, the petitioners assailed  sub-rule  (2)  of\nRule 3 saying that it is vague and over broad and has no relation  with  the\nsubjects specified under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_342\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\">115.  One of the petitioners&#x27; counsel also assailed <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_343\">Section 79(3)(b)</a> to  the\nextent that it  makes  the  intermediary  exercise  its  own  judgment  upon\nreceiving actual knowledge that any information  is  being  used  to  commit\nunlawful acts.  Further,  the  expression  &quot;unlawful  acts&quot;  also  goes  way\nbeyond the specified subjects delineated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_344\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_189\">116.  It  must  first  be  appreciated  that  <a href=\"/doc/844026/\" id=\"a_345\">Section  79</a>  is  an  exemption\nprovision.   Being  an  exemption  provision,  it  is  closely  related   to\nprovisions which provide for offences including <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_346\">Section 69A</a>.  We  have  seen\nhow under <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_347\">Section 69A</a> blocking can take  place  only  by  a  reasoned  order\nafter complying with several procedural safeguards including  a  hearing  to\nthe originator and intermediary.  We have also seen how there are  only  two\nways in which a blocking order  can  be  passed  -  one  by  the  Designated\nOfficer after complying with the 2009 Rules and the other by the  Designated\nOfficer when he has to follow an order passed  by  a  competent  court.  The\nintermediary applying its own mind to whether information should  or  should\nnot be blocked is noticeably absent in <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_348\">Section 69A</a> read with 2009 Rules.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_190\">117.  <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_349\">Section 79(3)(b)</a> has to be read down to  mean  that  the  intermediary\nupon receiving actual knowledge that a court order has  been  passed  asking\nit to expeditiously remove or disable access to certain material  must  then\nfail to expeditiously remove or disable access to that  material.   This  is\nfor the reason that otherwise it would be very difficult for  intermediaries\nlike Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of  requests  are  made  and\nthe intermediary is  then  to  judge  as  to  which  of  such  requests  are\nlegitimate and  which  are  not.   We  have  been  informed  that  in  other\ncountries worldwide this view has gained acceptance, Argentina being in  the\nforefront. Also, the Court order and/or the notification by the  appropriate\nGovernment or its agency must strictly conform to the subject  matters  <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_350\">laid\ndown in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_351\">Article 19(2).</a>  Unlawful acts beyond what is <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_352\">laid  down  in</a>  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_353\">Article\n19(2)</a> obviously cannot  form  any  part  of  <a href=\"/doc/844026/\" id=\"a_354\">Section  79</a>.   With  these  two\ncaveats, we refrain from striking down <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 79(3)(b)</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">118.  The learned Additional Solicitor General informed  us  that  it  is  a\ncommon  practice  worldwide  for  intermediaries  to  have  user  agreements\ncontaining what is stated in Rule 3(2).   However, Rule  3(4)  needs  to  be\nread down in the same manner as <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_356\">Section 79(3)(b)</a>.  The knowledge  spoken  of\nin the said sub-rule must only be through  the  medium  of  a  court  order.\nSubject to this,  the  Information  Technology  (Intermediaries  Guidelines)\nRules, 2011 are valid.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">119.

It\nis at this point, after the interjection of two  citizens  from  the  crowd,\nthat Antony says-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">      &quot;ANTONY- Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\n      To such a sudden flood of mutiny.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">      They that have done this deed are honourable:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">      What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\n      That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,\n      And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">      I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">      I am no orator, as Brutus is;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">      But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\n      That love my friend; and that they know full well\n      That gave me public leave to speak of him:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">      For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\n      Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\n      To stir men&#x27;s blood: I only speak right on;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">      I tell you that which you yourselves do know;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">      Show you sweet Caesar&#x27;s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,\n      And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,\n      And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\n      Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue\n      In every wound of Caesar that should move\n      The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">      ALL- We&#x27;ll mutiny.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">[7]</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">      [8] In its present form the clear and present  danger  test  has  been\nreformulated to say that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">      &quot;The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free  press  do  not\npermit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use  of  force  or  of\nlaw violation  except  where  such  advocacy  is  directed  to  inciting  or\nproducing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite  or  produce  such\naction.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\">       Interestingly,  the  US  Courts  have  gone  on  to  make  a  further\nrefinement. The State may ban what is called  a &quot;true threat&quot;.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">      &quot;&#x27;True threats&#x27; encompass those statements where the speaker means  to\ncommunicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act  of  unlawful\nviolence to a particular individual or group of individuals.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">      &quot;The speaker need  not  actually  intend  to  carry  out  the  threat.\nRather, a prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the fear  of\nviolence and from  the  disruption  that  fear  engenders,  in  addition  to\nprotecting people from the possibility that  the  threatened  violence  will\noccur.  Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the  word\nis a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to  a  person  or\ngroup of persons with the intent of placing the victim  in  fear  of  bodily\nharm or death.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_206\">      See Virginia v.
