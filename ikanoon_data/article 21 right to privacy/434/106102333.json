The above acts\n\nconstituting the offence does not contemplate infliction\n\nof any direct physical harm on the child, except in case\n\nof &#x27;abuse&#x27;. Before addressing &#x27;abuse&#x27;, I would first deal\n\nwith     &#x27;assault&#x27;,          for,       it    is     capable       of    carrying        a\n\nmisconception          that          the       same     would           attract       the\n\nobjectionable conduct of caning. &#x27;Assault&#x27; is not defined\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_64\">J.J.

It        is     committed         whenever     a     well      founded\n\napprehension of immediate peril, from a force already put\n\nin motion - partially or fully - is created. An assault is\n\ncontained       in    every        use   of     criminal       force     (See   the\n\nCommentary on Section 351 of Penal Code - corresponding to\n\nSection     130       of        B.N.S    -    by    Ratanlal     &amp;     Dhirajlal,\n\n33rd Edition, at page no. 2294). So, if a gesture is shown\n\nto the child, so as to create an apprehension of use of\n\ncriminal force against the child, it may be an offence in\n\nterms of Section 130 of the B.N.S. However, to constitute\n\nan offence under <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 75</a> of the J.J.

Now coming to &#x27;abuse&#x27; in the context of Section 75,\n\nit may have to be borne in mind that serious abuse of\n\nchild - say for begging, for giving intoxicating liquor\n\netc. - are to be kept outside the the scope of Section 75,\n\ninasmuch as, those conduct constitute separate offences\n\nunder Sections 76, 77 etc. Therefore, abuse of a lesser\n\ndegree is what would have been meant under Section 75. It\n\nis    therefore    seriously      doubtful,      whether   a   corporal\n\npunishment inflicted on the child with an eye fixed on\n\ndisciplining the child would come within the ambit and\n\nscope of Section 75. Here, this Court is bound to take\n\nstock of the settled law that, when two interpretations\n\nare possible with respect to a penal provision, the one\n\nwhich favours the accused must be preferred (see <a href=\"/doc/1014504/\" id=\"a_66\">Tolaram\n\nRelumal and Another v.

In this regard, it is also worthwhile to note that\n\nthe objectionable conduct, in order to constitute the\n Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">                             -    38 .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">                                                         2025:KER:47533\n\n\noffence under Section 75, should be done in a manner\n\nlikely    to    cause    such    child    &#x27;unnecessary&#x27;       mental    or\n\nphysical suffering. Having regard to the definition of\n\nSection 75, this Court is of the opinion that the suffix\n\n&#x27;in a manner likely to cause such child unnecessary mental\n\nor physical suffering&#x27; is common, in the sense that, it is\n\napplicable to cases where the above-referred acts are done\n\nby the person in charge, as also, in cases where it is\n\ncaused to be done, both. For example, a &#x27;wilfull neglect&#x27;\n\nof the child by a person in-charge of the child will\n\nbecome punishable, only when such neglect is of such a\n\nmanner, which is likely to cause unnecessary mental or\n\nphysical suffering to the child. The words &#x27;wilfull&#x27; and\n\n&#x27;unnecessary&#x27; assume significance herein. It is trite that\n\nevery word in a statute is used with a definite purpose,\n\nwherefore      the   term   &#x27;unnecessary&#x27;        also   has   a   definite\n\npurpose to serve, in the context of an offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 75</a> of the J.J. Act. In other words, if an assault,\n\nabandonment, abuse or neglect of the child is necessary,\n Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">                             -        39 .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">                                                         2025:KER:47533\n\n\nin the sense that, it is justified in the attendant facts\n\nand circumstances, no offence can be read into.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">31.    Coming to the instant facts, the child was caned for\n\nnot    being    attentive        to    the   classes;    or   for     poor\n\nperformance in the dictation; even as per the prosecution\n\ncase. One may have to lift the veil and find out the\n\nbona fides of the teacher in expecting that the child\n\nshould attend the classes and perform well. Thus reckoned,\n\nthe conduct cannot be considered as &#x27;unnecessary&#x27;, unless\n\nsuch    punishment     is   found       to   be   disproportionate;     or\n\nactuated by malafide or ulterior motives.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">32.

All what this Court\n\nhold is that, the said conduct going by the penal statutes\n\nconcerned, as it stands now, is incapable of constituting\n\nan offence. I cannot therefore set and subscribe my hands\n\nto the     proverb &#x27;Spare the         rod,   Spoil the       child&#x27;.

Nor is the above\n\ndiscussion intended to save sadistic tendencies, if any,\n\nexhibited by the teachers, in the matter of infliction of\n\npunishment.

The offences alleged are under\n\nSection 324 of the Penal Code, read with <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 75</a> of the\n\nJ.J. Act. A perusal of Ext.A2 Final Report would reveal\n\nthe allegations as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">The     accused,     being    the    temporary          dance    teacher       of\n\nSt. Aloysius School, North Paravur had beaten the victim\n\nchild, who was studying in the 4th standard, by using a PVC\n\npipe on her thigh repeatedly - for the reason that she\n\ncommitted mistakes during dance practice - so as to cause\n\npain and mental trauma to the child, thus committing the\n\noffences enumerated above.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">36.   Although a serious attempt was made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner to bring this matter also\n Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                              -   44 .\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">                                                          2025:KER:47533\n\n\nwithin the fold of the other two matters and to quash\n\nAnnexure-A2 Final Report, this Court notice the following\n\ndistinguishing factors:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">Firstly, the person, who had beaten the child is not a\n\nregular teacher, but only someone, who used to be invited\n\nfor     training      the   students   for       dance   performance   in\n\nconnection with the annual day celebrations of the school,\n\nwherefore it is doubtful whether the concept of inflicting\n\nreasonable punishment for disciplining or refreshing the\n\nchild      can   be     pressed   into      service.     Secondly,     the\n\ninstrument used for inflicting punishment is not a cane;\n\nbut a PVC pipe, which is used to augment rhythm to the\n\ndance. In this regard, profitable reference can be made to\n\nthe judgment of the England and Wales High Court in Regina\n\nv. Hopley [(1860) 2 F&amp;F 202], wherein the Court spelt out\n\nthe     following       parameters     to    justify      moderate     and\n\nreasonable corporal punishment inflicted on a child.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">      i)    The first, of course, is that such punishment\n\n      should be moderate and reasonable, and not excessive.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\"> Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_132\">                             -    45 .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">                                                      2025:KER:47533\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">    ii) Second, it should not be administered for the\n\n    gratification of passion or of rage. It should not be\n\n    protracted beyond the child&#x27;s power of endurance.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">    iii) It should not be with an instrument unfit for the\n\n    purpose (emphasis supplied); and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">    iv) The punishment should not be calculated to produce\n\n    danger to life and limb.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">37. Out of the above parameters, the present facts will\n\nfall within the one, where it is stipulated that the\n\npunishment     should     not    have    been    inflicted   with   an\n\ninstrument unfit for the purpose. The investigation in the\n\ninstant crime reveals beating of a child by using a PVC\n\npipe, that too by a person, who is invited only during the\n\nschool annual day, for training students for dance. The\n\nsame cannot be readily inferred as an act for disciplining\n\nor reforming the child, from the available records, in the\n\nabsence of evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\"> Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">                             -    46 .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_141\">                                                        2025:KER:47533\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">38.   In such circumstances, the relief sought for in the\n\nCrl.M.C, namely, to quash the crime in question cannot be\n\nallowed. Nevertheless, this Court notice that the offences\n\ncanvassed in the subject crime, that is, Section 324 of\n\nthe Penal Code and <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 75</a> of the J.J Act cannot be\n\nsustained      for    reasons     already        adverted    to,   while\n\ndiscussing the two other Criminal Miscellaneous Cases. As\n\na matter of fact, at the time of registering the F.I.R,\n\nthe offence canvassed was one under Section 323, which\n\nhowever, was altered to Section 324 at the time when the\n\nfinal report was filed, on the premise that incorporation\n\nof offence under Section 323 was a mistake. Although, the\n\nweapon used is different from that of a cane in the\n\ninstant facts, that is to say a P.V.C. pipe, the same also\n\nis not a weapon which is likely to cause death when used\n\nas    a   weapon     of    offence.      None     of   the   parameters\n\nconstituting the offence under Section 324 are answered in\n\nthe given facts. Therefore, the offence under Section 324\n\ncannot be sustained. For            the same set       of reasons as\n Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                             -    47 .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">                                                         2025:KER:47533\n\n\ndiscussed in detail, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 75</a> of the\n\nJ.J Act also cannot be sustained. However, this Court\n\nnotice that the offence under Section 323, as originally\n\ncanvassed in the F.I.R, is prima facie sustainable. In the\n\ncircumstances, the offences canvassed in the final report,\n\nnamely, the one under Section 324 of the Penal Code, and\n\nalso, under <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 75</a> of the J.J Act are hereby quashed.\n\nHowever, it will be open for the Investigating Officer to\n\nfile a fresh final report, or for that matter, incorporate\n\nnecessary changes in the present final report so as to\n\nalter the offence as one under Section 323 of the Penal\n\nCode and to proceed with the matter in accordance with\n\nlaw.   Crl.M.C.No.10077/2024         will   stand      disposed   of    as\n\nindicated above. It is clarified that this Court has not\n\nentered into the merits of the matter and the trial court\n\nwill proceed with the trial of the case, untrammeled by\n\nany    of   the    observations      made        in   this   Order.    The\n\npunishment, if any, will only be based on independent of\n\nanalysis of the evidence adduced.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\"> Crl.M.C.Nos. 8067/2024, 9017/2024 &amp; 10077/2024\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">                             -    48 .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">                                                      2025:KER:47533\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">39.
