Partap respondent no.2-defendant no.1 took birth from the womb of\n\n                   Rajli petitioner -defendant no.2 and is not the son of Gabdu and Ghoghri.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">                   In R.S.A. No. 3282 of 2009, decided on 28.07.2011, it has been held that\n\n                   Rajli @ Rajjo never contracted kareva marriage with Gabdu (brother of\n\n                   deceased husband of petitioner-defendant no.2), so Partap cannot claim\n\n                   himself to be the son of Gabdu. As such, mutation entered on 02.10.1956\n\n                   and attested on 03.08.1957 whereby 1/4th share of the property of Gabdu\n\n                   was given to Partap is illegal, null and void. It is also mentioned in the\n\n                   plaint that Gabdu died on 08.02.1956 leaving behind Bakhtawar, Maidhan\n\n                   and Rohtash as his only male heirs, whereas his property has also\n\n                   devolved upon defendant no.1-Partap by showing Partap to be the son of\n\n                   Gabdu.

The trial Court after considering the submissions\n\n                   of the parties, allowed the application dated 02.04.2012 and directed for\n\n                   conducting DNA test of Partap and Rajli - defendant nos.1 and 2\n\n                   respectively.

This prima facie proves the\n\n                   relationship and to authenticate the same, DNA test is necessary. Learned\n\n                   counsel for the respondents further contended that under <a href=\"/doc/1631819/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 75(e)</a> and\n\n                   Order 26 Rule 10-A <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_10\">CPC</a> scientific investigation can be carried out. There\n\n                   is prima facie strong case that Rajli was not married to Gabdu, hence\n\n                   Partap cannot be said to be born to Rajli from the loins of Gabdu. The\n\n                   Court can issue commission under <a href=\"/doc/1631819/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 75(e)</a> as well as Order 26 Rule\n\n                   10-A <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_12\">CPC</a> to hold a scientific technical expert investigation in the\n\n                   circumstances of a case.       There are clear cut circumstances which\n\n                   necessitate the investigation by way of DNA test which is an accurate test\n\n                   to establish the paternity. Learned counsel for the respondents further\n\n                   contended that just to grab the property, paternity frauds are committed,\n\n                   the same has happened in the present case. Once the paternity of a person\n\n                   is in dispute, in view of the scientific facility available for authenticating\n\n                   the same, to discover fraud such a test is necessary.

Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a\n\n                   pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells\n\n                   divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA\n\n                   present in the old cell.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                   DNA Analysis as Evidence\n\n                                DNA is the fundamental building block of a person&#x27;s entire\n                                genetic make-up.

Thus the Court has\n                                         to reconcile these competing interests by balancing the\n                                         interests involved.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                               xxx xxx xxx xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                               14.

The other view is\n                                    that the court must be reluctant in use of such scientific\n                                    advances and tools which result in invasion of right to\n                                    privacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial\n                                    to the rights of the parties but may have devastating effect\n                                    on the child. Sometimes the result of such scientific test\n                                    may bastardise an innocent child even though his mother\n                                    and her spouse were living together during the time of\n                                    conception.

DNA in a matter\n                                    relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by\n                                    the court as a matter of course or in a routine manner,\n                                    whenever such a request is made.

Obviously, therefore,\n                                      any order for DNA can be given by the court only if a\n                                      strong prima facie case is made out for such a course.\n                                      Insofar as the present case is concerned, we have already\n                                      held that the State Commission has no authority,\n                                      competence or power to order DNA.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                                18.

It was observed thus :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                                  &quot;In reaching its conclusion that in this case, unlike Rochin,\n                                  there is nothing &quot;brutal&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; the Court has not\n                                  kept separate the component parts of the problem.\n                                  Essentially there are two: the character of the invasion of\n                                  the body and the expression of the victim&#x27;s will; the latter\n                                  may be manifested by physical resistance. Of course, one\n                                  may consent to having his blood extracted or his stomach\n                                  pumped and thereby waive any due process objection. In\n                                  that limited sense the expression of the will is significant.\n                                  But where there is no affirmative consent, I cannot see that\n                                  it should make any difference whether one states\n                                  unequivocally that he objects or resorts to physical\n                                  violence in protest or is in such condition that he is unable\n                                  to protest. The Court, however, states that &quot;the absence of\n                                  conscious consent, without more, does not necessarily\n                                  render the taking a violation of constitutional right.&quot; This\n                                  implies that a different result might follow if petitioner had\n                                  been conscious and had voiced his objection.

By its recital of the facts in Rochin-the\n                                  references to a &quot;considerable struggle&quot; and the fact that the\n                                  stomach pump was &quot;forcibly used&quot; - the Court finds\n                                  Rochin distinguishable from this case. I cannot accept an\n                                  analysis that would make physical resistance by a prisoner\n                                  a prerequisite to the existence of his constitutional rights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                                         Apart from the irrelevant factor of physical\n                                  resistance, the techniques used in this case and in Rochin\n                                  are comparable. In each the operation was performed by a\n                                  doctor in a hospital. In each there was an extraction of\n                                  body fluids. Neither operation normally causes any lasting\n                                  ill effects.   The Court denominates a blood test as a\n                                  scientific method for detecting crime and cites the\n                                  frequency of such tests in our everyday life. The stomach\n                                  pump too is a common and accepted way of making tests\n                                  and relieving distress. But it does not follow from the fact\n                                  that a technique is a product of science or is in common,\n                                  consensual use for other purposes that it can be used to\n                                  extract evidence from a criminal defendant without his\n                                  consent. Would the taking of spinal fluid from an\n                                  unconscious person be condoned because such tests are\n                                  commonly made and might be used as a scientific aid to\n                                  law enforcement? Only personal reaction to the stomach\n                                  pump and the blood test can distinguish them. To base the\n                                  restriction which the Due Process Clause imposes on state\n                                  criminal procedures upon such reactions is to build on\n                                  shifting sands.

A blood\n                                   test which involves the insertion of a needle is an assault,\n                                   unless consented to.

If these sections do not authorise\n                                   the court to order an adult to have his blood tested, I do\n                                   not see that they authorise the court to make such an order\n                                   in the case of an infant. A test of the child&#x27;s blood would\n                                   be useless unless there were tests of the adults also. But, I\n                                   would say this. If an adult unreasonably refuses to have a\n                                   blood test, or to allow a child to have one, I think that it\n                                   is open to the court in any civil proceedings (no matter\n                                   whether it be a paternity issue or an affiliation summons,\n                                   or a custody proceeding) to treat his refusal as evidence\n                                   against him, and may draw an inference therefrom\n                                   adverse to him. This is simply common sense. It is in\n                                   keeping with the rule that in a nullity case, if a party\n                                   refuses to be medically examined, the court may infer that\n                                   some impediment exists pointing to incapacity (see <a href=\"/doc/682973/\" id=\"a_68\">W.\n                                   v.

To this it can be said that a forensic test is not\n                                  necessarily conclusive one way or the other, and the\n                                  question might be asked, why not take any steps which\n                                  could in effect exclude.

This\n                                   section, amongst other things, therefore, enables the\n                                   Court to draw an adverse inference against a party who\n                                   refuses to produce a document in his possession.\n                                   Similarly, it enables the Court to draw a presumption\n                                   against a person who can make evidence available to the\n                                   Court but obstructs the availability of such evidence.

One of the circumstances which had weighed\n                               with the court was the lack of consent to the blood test by the\n                               respondents. The Supreme Court held that there was no\n                               illegality in refusing the blood test for the reason that no\n                               consent has been given by any of the respondents. In this\n                               regard, the Supreme Court observed as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                                         &quot;The maximum that can be done where a party refuses\n                                         to have a blood test is to draw an adverse inference\n                                         (see in this connection Subayya Gounder v.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">                                         Bhoppala, AIR 1959 Mad 396) and the\n                                         earlier   decision   of   the    same     court     in\n                                         Venkateshwarlu v.

In the present scenario, extensive use of biological\n\n                   evidence is made in crime investigations and civil proceedings. DNA\n\n                   evidence has assumed great significance and legal recognition. In fact,\n\n                   DNA Profiling Bill, 2007 is pending before the Parliament. The fact that\n\n                   such a bill has been introduced, itself shows the need and importance of\n\n                   DNA evidence. Scientific investigations are the need of the hour and must\n\n                   be carried out. DNA test is a scientific test and its accuracy is 99.99% and\n\n                   as such this must be used as evidence not only in sexual assault and\n\n                   violent crime cases, but also in civil cases involving question of paternity\n\n                   and consequent question of succession. <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 5</a> to <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_85\">9</a> of the Evidence Act\n\n                   relate to relevancy of facts and the outcome of DNA test can certainly be\n\n                   treated as relevant evidence according to these provisions.

It was considered difficult for a woman to mistakenly believe\n\n                   that the child was hers, whereas it was not too difficult for a man to claim\n\n                   or deny parentage. During the subsistence of marriage between the parties\n\n                   under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, presumption is raised that\n\n                   child is from the subsisting relationship of marriage between the husband\n\n                   and wife. In the old days, nothing could be done to prove parentage. Today\n\n                   things have changed; paternity can be proved or disproved conclusively\n\n                   with DNA test. The party can be absolutely sure if the child is his or not\n\n                   and it can also be established by blood test performed to determine the\n\n                   paternity that the man tested was not actually the biological father of the\n\n                   child in question, as a result of which ethical issue arises and it is also not\n\n                   uncommon that to usurp the land of the others, paternity frauds are\n\n                   committed.
