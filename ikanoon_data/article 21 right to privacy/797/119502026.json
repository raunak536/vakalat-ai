Cruelty may be physical or corporeal or may\n                                  be mental. In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and\n                                  direct evidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there\n                                  may not at the same time be direct evidence. In cases\n                                  where there is no direct evidence, Courts are required to\n                                  probe into the mental process and mental effect of\n                                  incidents that are brought out in evidence.

However, there may be\n                                     a case where the conduct complained of itself is bad\n                                     enough and per se unlawful or illegal.

In the case on hand, as already pointed out, the petitioner has\n\n                     mainly alleged mental cruelty, but also alleged that the respondent along\n\n                     with her brother had attacked him physically. Except the above bald\n\n                     averment, the petitioner has not elaborated anything further. The\n\n                     petitioner has not produced any specific evidence to show that the\n\n                     respondent or at her instigation, the petitioner was attacked physically.\n\n                     But, on the other hand, it is the specific contention of the respondent that\n\n                     the petitioner had many times attacked her. The petitioner, in his cross-\n\n                     examination, would admit that the respondent had lodged a complaint\n\n                     before the Sattur All Women Police Station that he had harassed her by\n\n                     beating.

It is evident from the records that\n\n                     when Ex.P8 was attempted to be marked, the respondent&#x27;s side has raised\n\n                     objections that without voice test, the same cannot be admitted in\n\n                     evidence. But, as rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the\n\n                     petitioner, the trial Court as well as the appellate Court have not at all\n\n                     considered Ex.P8 and they have not even stated as to whether the\n\n                     document was admissible / inadmissible in evidence, nor the reasons\n\n                     for rejecting the same. After marking the said exhibit, the respondent has\n\n                     filed an application I.A.No.1 of 2019 in H.M.O.P.No.52 of 2016 for\n\n                     sending Ex.P8 – Compact Disk along with memory card to the Forensic\n\n                     Department to find out the genuineness of the conversation shown\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                    25/36</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                                                           C.M.S.A(MD)No.54 of 2021</span>\n\n                     therein. Since the respondent&#x27;s side had raised objections while\n\n                     exhibiting the same, the learned trial Judge, by observing that since the\n\n                     memory card was produced by the petitioner, it is his duty to prove that\n\n                     the voice found in the memory card was that of the respondent and that\n\n                     as the petitioner has not taken any steps to prove the said exhibit and it\n\n                     would further delay the proceedings, has dismissed the petition. As\n\n                     rightly contended by the learned Counsel for            the respondent, even\n\n                     thereafter, the petitioner has not taken any steps to send the memory card\n\n                     to Forensic Lab to find out the genuineness of the voice.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">                                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"859989\" id=\"span_56\">31.

The main contention of the\n\n                     petitioner is that though the petitioner and her mother had been\n\n                     requesting the respondent to give away her job for the purpose of\n\n                     maintaining their children, the same was not accepted by the respondent.\n\n                     It is pertinent to note that previously the petitioner has filed a divorce\n\n                     petition and due to the subsequent compromise between the parties, the\n\n                     same was withdrawn. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for\n\n                     the respondent, when that is the conduct and behaviour of the petitioner,\n\n                     the respondent cannot be expected to resign her job and depend entirely\n\n                     on the petitioner. Moreover, as rightly pointed out by the learned\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                    33/36</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                                                        C.M.S.A(MD)No.54 of 2021</span>\n\n                     Counsel for the respondent, the above complaint / conduct of the\n\n                     petitioner would only exhibit his male chauvinism.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">                                  39. Though the petitioner has alleged that the respondent had\n\n                     threatened to commit suicide by implicating the petitioner and his\n\n                     parents, it is not his case that he had informed to the parents of the\n\n                     respondent or to some other common friends. The petitioner has not\n\n                     produced any iota of evidence to prove the incidents referred in the main\n\n                     petition. On considering the entire evidence available on record, the\n\n                     finding of the Courts below that the petitioner had miserably failed to\n\n                     prove the ground of cruelty cannot be found fault with. Consequently,\n\n                     this Court concludes that the Civil Miscellaneous Second Appeal is\n\n                     devoid of merits and the same is liable to be dismissed.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">                                  40.
