The need for development of advanced mode of travel is\n\n                     dependent on economic development. Such a need cannot be justified\n\n                     in the absence thereof.\n\n\n                              7.

The chief aspects\n\n                     highlighted therein are that in the year 2018-19 the growth rate (Gross\n\n                     State Domestic Product) was 10.5 percent and with growth across\n\n                     many areas of the economy and that there has been a considerable\n\n                     decline in the incidence of poverty in the state.\n\n\n                              8.

On Urbanization,\n\n  the report said, &quot;In the 2011 census, the level of urbanisation in Bihar\n\n  was very low, only 11.3 percent. But, after the State Government has\n\n  decided to redefine an urban centre, the present level of urbanisation\n\n  in Bihar is 15.3 percent, which indicates an appreciable expansion.\n\n  The expenditure on urban development of the State Government was\n\n  Rs. 1648 crore in 2015-16, which increased by 68 percent in five years\n\n  to reach Rs. 2766 crore in 2019-20. Similarly, the expenditure for\n\n  housing was Rs. 1486 crore in 2015-16, which increased to Rs. 5658\n\n  crore in 2019-20, nearly four times during the same period.\n\n\n   A (a).

The Constitution of India has, in the foresight of the\n\n  Constituent Assembly being set out in a way that it is not static and it\n\n  evolves, within certain parameters and always in favour of the benefit\n\n  of the people of the country. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> is case in point. The expression\n\n  &#x27;Right to life and liberty&#x27; has been interpreted to include within itself a\n\n  vast number of important aspects which come together to guarantee to\n\n  each person such life that is not a mere physical existence, but of\n\n  quality.\n\n\n           19. One such right, is the right to access a road. Hon&#x27;ble the\n\n  Supreme Court in State of H.P. v. Umed Ram Sharma, (1986) 2\n\n  SCC 68, in para 11 speaking through Sabyasachi Mukharji, J., as His\n\n  Lordship then was, observed:-\n\n\n               &quot;11. ... Every person is entitled to life as enjoined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of\n           the Constitution and in the facts of this case read in conjunction with\n           <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the Constitution and in the background of <a href=\"/doc/982915/\" id=\"a_10\">Article\n           38(2)</a> of the Constitution every person has right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 19(1)(d)</a>\n           to move freely throughout the territory of India and he has also the\n           right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> to his life and that right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a>\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4851 of 2022 dt. 04-02-2023\n                                          10/67\n\n\n\n\n           embraces not only physical existence of life but the quality of life and\n           for residents of hilly areas, access to road is access to life itself. These\n           propositions are well settled. We accept the proposition that there\n           should be road for communication in reasonable conditions in view of\n           our constitutional imperatives and denial of that right would be denial\n           of the life as understood in its richness and fullness by the ambit of the\n           Constitution. To the residents of the hilly areas as far as feasible and\n           possible society has constitutional obligation to provide roads for\n           communication.&quot;\n                                                               (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n           20.

Dua, Acting C.J., speaking for the Court, was unable to\n             agree, on a consideration of the language of the Constitution and its\n             scheme. He held that &quot;personal liberty&quot; guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> was\n             not intended to extend to the liberty of going out of India and\n             coming back. He was mainly influenced by the fact that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a>\n             applied to non-citizens also and that the Constitution not having\n             given a limited right to move throughout the territories to non-\n             citizens under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> could not have given a higher right to\n             them under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">              31.

The procedure prescribed by law has to be fair, just and reasonable,\n           not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary.

The above judgments of Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court spell\n\n  out two distinct rights. The right of access to road and the right to\n\n  travel abroad. It is said that the access to a road is access to life itself.\n\n  While the significant import of this statement may not be applicable in\n\n  its entirety to that of access of air travel, the present world order of\n\n  globalization and internationalization makes a somewhat persuasive\n\n  case to provide for the same to those people who can afford it; are in\n\n  urgent need of it; mandatorily required for the economic advancement\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4851 of 2022 dt. 04-02-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                          12/67</span>\n\n\n\n\n  and development of the nation; as also for the overall socio economic\n\n  development of every individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">           22. In the context of Bihar, another important aspect to be\n\n  considered in development of the Air Transport Sector is that the work\n\n  related migration from Bihar to foreign countries is a significant\n\n  number. Also the fact that Bihar being one of the highest populated\n\n  States of India- for one tenth of the population is living here- and it\n\n  has geographical locational advantage of international borders in close\n\n  proximity, is a relevant consideration. At the same time, the\n\n  observations of this Court may not be construed to mean that the\n\n  difference between the right to travel abroad and the potential right of\n\n  access to an airport is being blurred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n   C.

Despite these advantages, the Indian aviation sector has not\n               achieved the position it should have and at present it is ranked 10th in\n               the world in terms of number of passengers.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           1.2 The Government has proposed to promote the growth of Indian\n              aviation sector in a significant manner as the development of this\n              sector has a multiplier effect on the economy. As per an International\n              Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) study, the output multiplier and\n              employment multiplier are 3.25 and 6.10 respectively. The aim of the\n              Government is to provide an ecosystem for the harmonised growth of\n              various aviation subsectors, i.e Airlines, Airports, Cargo, Maintenance\n              Repairs and Overhaul services (MRO), General Aviation, Aerospace\n              Manufacturing, Skill Development, etc.\n\n           1.3 The Government has proposed to take flying to the masses by making\n               it affordable and convenient. For example, if every Indian in middle\n               class income bracket takes just one flight in a year, it would result in a\n               sale of 35 crore tickets, a big jump from 7 crore domestic tickets sold\n               in 2014-15. This will be possible if the air-fares, especially on the\n               regional routes, are brought down to an affordable level. The reduction\n               in costs will require concessions by the Central and State Governments\n               and Airport Operators.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           1.4 Systems and processes which affect this sector will need to be\n              simplified and made more transparent with greater use of technology\n              without compromising on safety and security. The growth in aviation\n              will create a large multiplier effect in terms of investments, tourism\n              and employment generation, especially for unskilled and semi-skilled\n              worker.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">                                                                  (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">           27.

He identified certain limitations, which he\n\n  suggests, blurs the difference between the Patna and Bihta Airports in\n\n  terms of the issues hindering operations, significant at that. The\n\n  operative portion of the letter reads as under (Page 600 to 601):-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">                   &quot;To my understanding the following limitations which make\n         reinvestment at Bihta Airport no different from those existing at Patna are as\n         follows:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">           · Bihta Airport does not have the provision of Parallel Taxi way which is\n             essential for bringing it into the international standard Code E-aircrafts.\n             For this the Air Force has to give permission for land use change,\n             which has not been agreed so far and some land has to be additionally\n             acquired by the State Government. So far only 108 acres of land has\n             been acquired by the State Government which has been handed over to\n             AAI but this does not cater for the runway length extension. The land\n             provided by the State Government of Bihar only caters to the proposed\n             new terminal building, utility building and parking space for airport\n             staff etc. In both places at Patna and Bihta only major expense is being\n             done on the passenger terminal but the upgrade of an Airport primarily\n             also requires the upgradation of tarmac side i.e. extension of the main\n             runway length, parallel taxi track, land in the funnel for approach\n             landing system, navigational instruments etc.\n\n           · If I understand that AAI has suggested an additional requirement of 165\n              Acres + 8 Acres for runway extension for CODE-E i.e. for\n              (Boeing777), A-330/350- Dreamliner etc., along with approach\n              lighting system etc. additional land is required on the city side for\n              Runway 28 for operational reasons. Since Runway 28 would have the\n              instrument approach as ILS- RW28, this would require extension of\n              runway approach and would necessary entail land to be acquired on the\n              Runway 28 approach side which has a Kabragah and a Mosque and is\n              densely populated.

To\n               acquire the additional land, the Government of Bihar has not taken any\n               step so far and would be rather unwilling as land acquisition in this part\n               of the town has been a real contentious issue.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">           ·    Moreso, the length of the NHAI elevated Highway proposed for 26\n               Kms is around 2600 crores which is going to the additional expenditure\n               by the Government of India for a self limiting airport which does not\n               cater to an international standard and it is just a slightly improved\n               replication of Patna Airport without any major advantage as compared\n               to any green field project.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">           45.

In the present factual matrix the location, land\n\n  acquisition, building etc.- the manner in which it is to be done and the\n\n  pace at which it is to be done could entirely be within the purview of\n\n  Government&#x27;s own policies and, changes or shift therein may affect\n\n  certain interested parties. However, at present, given that the\n\n  disagreement between the various parties was not soon to be resolved\n\n  (the process for building a Greenfield Airport within the State has\n\n  been ongoing for 17 years), it is only then upon the urging of the\n\n  petitioner and in view of the benefit for the people of the State that the\n\n  Court chose to entertain the present PIL to further this discussion to a\n\n  constructive and logical conclusion.

The story of mankind is punctuated by progress and\n           retrogression. Empires have risen and crashed into the dust of history.\n           Civilizations have nourished, reached their peak and passed away. In the\n           year 1625, Carew, C.J., while delivering the opinion of the House of Lords\n           in Re the Earldom of Oxford [(1625) W Jo 96, 101 : (1626) 82 ER 50, 53]\n           in a dispute relating to the descent of that Earldom, said:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">               &quot;... and yet time hath his revolution, there must be a period and an end\n           of all temporal things, finis rerum, an end of names and dignities, and\n           whatsoever is terrene....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\">           The cycle of change and experiment, rise and fall, growth and decay, and\n           of progress and retrogression recurs endlessly in the history of man and the\n           history of civilization. T.S.

The law exists to serve the needs of the society which is governed\n           by it. If the law is to play its allotted role of serving the needs of the\n           society, it must reflect the ideas and ideologies of that society. It must keep\n           time with the heartbeats of the society and with the needs and aspirations\n           of the people. As the society changes, the law cannot remain immutable.\n           The early nineteenth century essayist and wit, Sydney Smith, said: &quot;When\n           I hear any man talk of an unalterable law, I am convinced that he is an\n           unalterable fool.&quot; The law must, therefore, in a changing society march in\n           tune with the changed ideas and ideologies. Legislatures are, however, not\n           best fitted for the role of adapting the law to the necessities of the time, for\n           the legislative process is too slow and the legislatures often divided by\n           politics, slowed down by periodic elections and overburdened with myriad\n           other legislative activities. A constitutional document is even less suited to\n           this task, for the philosophy and the ideologies underlying it must of\n           necessity be expressed in broad and general terms and the process of\n           amending a Constitution is too cumbersome and time-consuming to meet\n           the immediate needs. This task must, therefore, of necessity fall upon the\n           courts because the courts can by the process of judicial interpretation adapt\n           the law to suit the needs of the society.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"102852\" id=\"span_62\">and then further referred to <a href=\"/doc/102852/\" id=\"a_63\">M.

(2017) 10 SCC 1.\n\n  In regards to interpretation of the Constitution, Dr. Chandrachud, J. as\n\n  His Lordship then was, observed:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_187\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                &quot;259. The Constitution has evolved over time, as judicial\n           interpretation, led to the recognition of specific interests and entitlements.\n           These have been subsumed within the freedoms and liberties guaranteed\n           by the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 21</a> has been interpreted by this Court to mean\n           that life does not mean merely a physical existence. It includes all those\n           faculties by which life is enjoyed. The ambit of &quot;the procedure established\n           by law&quot; has been interpreted to mean that the procedure must be fair, just\n           and reasonable. The coalescence of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_65\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_66\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">21</a> has brought into\n           being a jurisprudence which recognises the interrelationship between\n           rights. That is how the requirements of fairness and non-discrimination\n           animate both the substantive and procedural aspects of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 21.</a> These\n           constitutional developments have taken place as the words of the\n           Constitution have been interpreted to deal with new exigencies requiring\n           an expansive reading of liberties and freedoms to preserve human rights\n           under the Rule of Law. India&#x27;s brush with a regime of the suspension of life\n           and personal liberty in the not too distant past is a grim reminder of how\n           tenuous liberty can be, if the judiciary is not vigilant. The interpretation of\n           the Constitution cannot be frozen by its original understanding. The\n           Constitution has evolved and must continuously evolve to meet the\n           aspirations and challenges of the present and the future. Nor can Judges\n           foresee every challenge and contingency which may arise in the future.\n           This is particularly of relevance in an age where technology reshapes our\n           fundamental understanding of information, knowledge and human\n           relationships that was unknown even in the recent past. Hence as Judges\n           interpreting the Constitution today, the Court must leave open the path for\n           succeeding generations to meet the challenges to privacy that may be\n           unknown today.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">                262. Technology, as we experience it today is far different from what it\n           was in the lives of the generation which drafted the Constitution.\n           Information technology together with the internet and the social media and\n           all their attendant applications have rapidly altered the course of life in the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4851 of 2022 dt. 04-02-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                          54/67</span>\n\n\n\n\n           last decade. Today&#x27;s technology renders models of application of a few\n           years ago obsolescent. Hence, it would be an injustice both to the\n           draftsmen of the Constitution as well as to the document which they\n           sanctified to constrict its interpretation to an originalist interpretation.\n           Today&#x27;s problems have to be adjudged by a vibrant application of\n           constitutional doctrine and cannot be frozen by a vision suited to a\n           radically different society. We describe the Constitution as a living\n           instrument simply for the reason that while it is a document which\n           enunciates eternal values for Indian society, it possesses the resilience\n           necessary to ensure its continued relevance. Its continued relevance lies\n           precisely in its ability to allow succeeding generations to apply the\n           principles on which it has been founded to find innovative solutions to\n           intractable problems of their times. In doing so, we must equally\n           understand that our solutions must continuously undergo a process of re-\n           engineering.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\">           90.

How the Constitution should be read and interpreted is best\n           found in the words of Khanna, J., in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of\n           Kerala [Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225] as\n           follows : (SCC pp. 770-71, para 1437)\n                      &quot;1437. ... A Constitution is essentially different from pleadings\n                 filed in Court of litigating parties. Pleadings contain claim and\n                 counterclaim of private parties engaged in litigation, while a\n                 Constitution provides for the framework of the different organs of\n                 the State viz. the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. A\n                 Constitution also reflects the hopes and aspirations of a people.\n                 Besides laying down the norms for the functioning of different\n                 organs a Constitution encompasses within itself the broad\n                 indications as to how the nation is to march forward in times to\n                 come. A Constitution cannot be regarded as a mere legal document\n                 to be read as a will or an agreement nor is Constitution like a plaint\n                 or written statement filed in a suit between two litigants. A\n                 Constitution must of necessity be the vehicle of the life of a nation.\n                 It has also to be borne in mind that a Constitution is not a gate but a\n                 road. Beneath the drafting of a Constitution is the awareness that\n                 things do not stand still but move on, that life of a progressive\n                 nation, as of an individual, is not static and stagnant but dynamic\n                 and dashful. A Constitution must therefore contain ample provision\n                 for experiment and trial in the task of administration. A\n                 Constitution, it needs to be emphasised, is not a document for\n                 fastidious dialectics but the means of ordering the life of a people. It\n                 had (sic) its roots in the past, its continuity is reflected in the\n                 present and it is intended for the unknown future .

This argument ignores the adverb &quot;freely&quot; in\n           clause (d).

It may be argued, from the material produced on record\n\n  that the a risky nature and placement of the Patna Airport (short\n\n  runway, placement within the city limits etc.) as also the various\n\n  reports classifying the Airport as critical would constitute sufficient\n\n  threat of breach, as somewhat alluded to by the petitioner, however,\n\n  this Court stops short of making any such observation as the\n\n  singular purpose of entertaining the present writ petition is to\n\n  ensure the safety of the people of the State and not to cast aspersion\n\n  of dereliction of duty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_225\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">           108.

It is not for this Court\n\n  to direct the construction of an Airport at a particular location since\n\n  that falls squarely within the domain of public policy. However,\n\n  considering the essentiality of such Airport, we direct that upon\n\n  such fresh consideration, a decision thereupon be arrived at within a\n\n  reasonable time and not later than three months.
