The petitioner was the President of Dayankhanpalli Handloom\n\nWeavers Co-operative Society Limited between 2005-06 and 2007-08\n\nwhich is a primary society under APCO.          Later, he became the\n\nChairman of APCO and continued till August, 2019.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      (a) While so, the C.I.D on the complaint of one Konda Ramana\n\nReddy, a resident of Proddutur, registered Crime No.1 of 2020 against\n\npetitioner and others, on the allegations that the petitioner and other\n\nmembers in conspiracy committed the offences of criminal breach of\n\ntrust, cheating and forgery and caused loss to the public money and\n\ngovernment fund to a tune of Rs.1200 Crores. The petitioner filed\n\nW.P.No.922 of 2020 seeking to quash the F.I.R. In I.A.No.1 of 2020,\n\nthis Court passed interim order directing respondents not to arrest the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    4</span>\n                                                                 UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                       WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\npetitioner and not to take any coercive steps under the guise of\n\ninvestigation which would infringe his fundamental rights guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      (b) While so, the respondents/C.I.D obtained search warrants\n\nfrom I Addl. Judicial Magistrate of I Class, Kadapa and conducted\n\nsearches over the residential houses of petitioner at Khazipet and\n\nHimayathnagar and also two garment godowns of the petitioner and\n\nhis mother at Khazipet and seized huge cash, gold and silver\n\nornaments and some documents in contravention of the orders in\n\nI.A.No.1 of 2020 and the provisions relating to search and seizure.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">The alleged offences have nothing to do with the search and seizure\n\noperations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">      Hence, the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.    The 2nd respondent filed counter opposing the writ petition\n\ninter alia contending that the search and seizure operations were\n\nconducted after obtaining search warrants from the Judicial Magistrate\n\nand by following due procedure. It is contended that the order in\n\nI.A.No.1 of 2020 was not violated as the said order did not interdict\n\nthe respondents from proceeding with the investigation. As per the\n\nF.I.R, the accused conspired together and misappropriated about\n\nRs.1200 Crores of various Co-operative Societies over ten years and\n\nestablished benami and bogus Weaver&#x27;s Societies in Kadapa District.\n\nThe ill-gotten money was fraudulently diverted for their personal gain.\n\nThe petitioner has no legal sources to amass huge amount and\n\nproperties seized. Since huge public money was misappropriated, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   5</span>\n                                                                 UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                       WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nrespondents obtained warrants and conducted searches and seized the\n\navailable incriminatory material and properties.     Hence, the writ\n\npetition is not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.    Heard the arguments of the learned Senior Counsel Sri Vedula\n\nVenkataramana representing Sri M.Balaga Srinivas, counsel for\n\npetitioner, and learned Government Pleader for Home representing the\n\nrespondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"774810\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1861858\" id=\"span_6\">5.    Severely remonstrating the search and seizure operations\n\nconducted by the respondent officers, learned Senior Counsel\n\nSri Vedula Venkataramana would firstly argue that both the warrant\n\nand consequential acts were in utter disdain to the order dated\n\n17.01.2020 in I.A.No.1/2020 in W.P.No.922/2020 wherein this Court\n\nwhile granting interim direction to the present respondents not to\n\narrest the petitioner in connection with Cr.No.1/2020, further directed\n\nnot to take any coercive steps under the guise of investigation which\n\ncould infringe the fundamental rights guaranteed under the provisions\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Despite, he would\n\nlament, without informing about the said order, the respondents\n\nobtained search warrant and conducted searches at different places\n\nbelonging to the petitioner and his family members and seized cash,\n\ngold and silver ornaments and articles and bank passbooks and cheque\n\nbooks. Hence, such highhanded acts are violative of personal liberty\n\nand right of privacy enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nbesides being contemptuous. He would also incidentally argue that\n\nprocuring of the self-incriminating material from the possession of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                          6</span>\n                                                                     UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                           WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\naccused also amounts to violation of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution. He placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1861858/\" id=\"a_5\">Shyamlal Mohanlal v. State of\n\nGujarat1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/774810/\" id=\"a_6\">Dhulipala Veeraiah Chowdary v. Kurra Veeraiah2</a>.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"68260\" id=\"span_9\">Secondly, he argued that learned Magistrate has not passed any\n\nreasoned order except issuing warrant on mere asking. He would\n\ncontend that the Magistrate ought to have given cogent reasons for his\n\nsatisfaction to issue search warrant.          He relied upon the citation\n\n<a href=\"/doc/68260/\" id=\"a_7\">V.S.Kuttan Pillai v. Ramakrishnan3</a> to contend that clear\n\napplication of mind and according reasons is the hallmark for issuing\n\na search warrant.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1936485\" id=\"span_10\">He also relied upon the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1936485/\" id=\"a_8\">The New\n\nSwadesi Mills of Ahmedabad Ltd. V. S.K.Rattan4</a>.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">       Thirdly, he argued that having regard to the nature of offences\n\ni.e., Section 420, 406, 409, 468 &amp; 471 and 120-B r/w 34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a>\n\nattributed in Cr.No.1/2020, seizure of cash, gold, silver, passbooks\n\nand cheque books is of no relevancy to establish the crime. Further,\n\nWarrants were sought and issued for search and seizure of\n\nincriminating documents and records only and thereby the seizure of\n\nother valuables per se is unjust and illegal. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"187828010\" id=\"span_11\">In this regard he cited a\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/187828010/\" id=\"a_10\">M.T.Enrica Lexie v. Doramma5</a>. He further argued,\n\nwithout obtaining any warrant the police have searched the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s another house situated at Himayatnagar, Hyderabad and\n\nseized valuables. Such an invidious act is highly reprehensible for,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">1</span>\n  1965 Crl l J 256 = MANU/SC/0092/1964\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">2</span>\n  1987 (2) APLJ (HC) 426 = MANU/AP/0017/1987\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">3</span>\n  1980(1) SCC 264 = MANU/SC/0285/1979\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">4</span>\n  (1968) 9 GLR 364 = MANU/GJ/0152/1967\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">5</span>\n  AIR 2012 SC 2134 = MANU/SC/0409/2012\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                     7</span>\n                                                                   UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                         WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nthe search was without warrant and the place of search is beyond the\n\njurisdiction of learned Magistrate. He thus prayed to allow the writ\n\npetition.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">6.    Per contra, learned Government Pleader for Home argued that\n\nthere is no violation of order in I.A.No.1 of 2020, for, the said order\n\nprohibited the respondent/Police only from arresting the petitioner and\n\ntaking any coercive steps infringing his fundamental rights guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India. He strenuously argued that\n\nobtaining warrant and conducting search and seizure would by no\n\nmeans amount to invading the life and personal liberty of the\n\npetitioner. It is only for furtherance of investigation and for collection\n\nof incriminating material which will advance the cause of justice, that\n\nthe respondent/Police have conducted search and seizure by following\n\ndue procedure after obtaining the warrant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">      Nextly, refuting the contention of the petitioner that the seizure\n\nof gold, silver and cash is not relevant to establish the guilt of the\n\npetitioner, learned Government Pleader argued that the huge cash,\n\ngold and silver ornaments were acquired by the petitioner with the\n\nill-gotten money by misappropriating the funds of the Co-operative\n\nSociety, as otherwise, he had no other lawful resources to amass\n\nwealth of such magnitude. Therefore, the seized cash and valuable\n\narticles will certainly help Prosecution to establish his complicity. He\n\nwould request that as the investigation is at the peripheral stage this\n\nCourt may not make any observations on the relevancy or otherwise\n\nof the seized property which may have bearing on the investigation.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                    8</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">                                                                  UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                        WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nHe further argued that if the petitioner is aggrieved by the seizure of\n\nthe properties he can have the recourse by filing an appropriate\n\napplication under relevant statute before the Trial Court and in view\n\nof availability of alternative and efficacious remedy, this writ petition\n\nis not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">      Refuting the petitioner&#x27;s contention that the search warrants\n\nwere issued without passing any speaking order and assigning\n\nreasons, learned Government Pleader argued that having regard to the\n\nmisappropriation of huge amount running into crores, on the request\n\nof the respondent/Police that a general search in the requisition\n\nmentioned places belonging to the petitioner will help unearth\n\nincriminating evidence, the Court was satisfied and accordingly,\n\nissued search warrants under <a href=\"/doc/983956/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 93</a> of Cr.P.C and the said order\n\nis perfectly legal and valid. He, however fairly admitted that the\n\nPolice have not obtained search warrants to search petitioner&#x27;s house\n\nsituated at Himayathnagar in Hyderabad and the respondents will\n\nabide by Court&#x27;s order in that regard. He thus prayed to dismiss the\n\nwrit petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">7.

Point No.1: The sub-points categorized in the main point are\n\nthe attributes of violation of different rights of the petitioner inflicted\n\nthrough the search and seizure in this case.

The\n\ncommon law in Medieval period regarded &quot;An Englishman&#x27;s home as\n\nhis castle&quot; and attached sanctity to the privacy of a man&#x27;s home and\n\neven refused to recognize the power of search and seizure. Perhaps,\n\nthe foremost common law case on protection of privacy is of Peter\n\nSemayne vs. Richard Gresham6. Gresham and Beresford were joint\n\ntenants of a house in England where Beresford kept his goods and\n\nlater Semayne brought a suit for money against him and succeeded\n\nbut in the meanwhile Beresford died. His goods were in the tenement\n\nwhere Gresham continued. The Sheriff of London went to the said\n\nhouse to execute the warrant and seize the goods but Gresham shut the\n\ndoors before the Sheriff could enter and would not allow him access.\n\nAs a result, Semayne sued Gresham for obstruction of execution and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">6</span>\n    77 ER 194 (1604)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                             10</span>\n                                                                              UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                    WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nthe suit was dismissed by majority of 2:1. The majority judges upheld\n\nthe privacy of the defendant observing that before entering of Sheriff\n\nit was lawful for him to shut the door unless it was upon the Queen&#x27;s\n\nsuit for the contempt of the party.                The minority view was that\n\nbecause by that means, justice was hindered. Later, Edward Coke, the\n\nJurist and Judge in his book &quot;The Institute of the Law of England&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(1628) carved out from the Semayne&#x27;s judgment, the phrase &quot;the\n\nhouse of everyone is to him is his castle and fortress, as well for his\n\ndefence against injury and violence, as for his repose&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">           b) In John Entick v. Nathan Carrington7, on 11.11.1762 the\n\nKing&#x27;s messengers entered the home of the plaintiff John Entick, a\n\nWriter, with force and arms, broke open locks and doors, searched and\n\nseized some charts and pamphlets on the allegation of his\n\ndisseminating seditious writings. In the trial before Lord Camden, CJ,\n\nthe defence of the King&#x27;s messengers was that they were acting on the\n\nwarrant of Lord Halifax, the Secretary of State. However, Camden\n\nheld, Halifax had no right under statute or under precedent to issue\n\nsuch warrant and allowed Entick&#x27;s claim. In his famous passage,\n\nCamden stated__\n\n                   &quot;................ By the laws of England, every invasion of\n           private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass. No man can set\n           his foot upon my ground without my licence, but he is liable to an\n           action, though the damage be nothing; which is proved by every\n           declaration in trespass, where the defendant is called upon to\n           answer for bruising the grass and even treading upon the soil. If he\n           admits the fact, he is bound to show by way of justification, that\n           some positive law has empowered or excused him. The\n           justification is submitted to the judges, who are to look into the\n           books; and if such a justification can be maintained by the text of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">7</span>\n    All ER Rep 41 = 1765 (19) St.Tr 1030\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                           11</span>\n                                                                            UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                  WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n          the statute law, or by the principles of common law.

So far so good with regard to the judicial pronouncements on\n\nthe right of personal liberty, privacy against the unreasonable searches\n\nand seizures under the guise of &#x27;writ of assistance&#x27;. However, with\n\nthe passage of time, the crimes have increased abnormally in the\n\nentire globe necessitating the Investigating Agencies to invariably\n\nadopt search and seizure operations for exhuming the incriminating\n\nmaterial and evidence to bring the perpetrators of the crime to book\n\nand safeguard the interest of the society. There occurred a clash\n\nbetween the societal interest and individual rights. A situation had\n\ncome that if the Officer had unleashed unauthorized power to ignore\n\npersonal liberties, the product was Police State; if he was barred from\n\nany interference with private rights, the result was criminal anarchy.\n\nTherefore, to strike a balance and to establish rule of law, it became\n\ninevitable that the individual relinquishes a portion of his personal\n\nprerogatives through the legislative process in order to see that\n\nhimself and his fellow citizens are free from criminal activities.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                           13</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                                                                 UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                       WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">10.

It observed that neither the search nor the seizure are the\n\nacts of the occupier of the searched premises, but they are the acts of\n\nanother to whom he is obliged to submit and therefore, searches are\n\nnot testimonial acts in any sense.

Nor is it legitimate to assume that the constitutional\n          protection under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_37\">article 20(3)</a> would be defeated by the statutory\n          provisions for searches.

Therefore, issue of a search warrant\n          is normally the judicial function of the Magistrate. When such\n          judicial function is interposed between the individual and the\n          officer&#x27;s authority for search, no circumvention thereby of the\n          fundamental right is to be assumed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_56\">d) It must be quickly added that the Apex Court in its judgment\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_39\">Justice K.S.

In I.ANo.1/2020 a learned\n\nsingle Judge of this Court passed an order dated 17.01.2020 directing\n\nthe respondents not to arrest the petitioner in connection with\n\nCr.No.1/2020 and not to take any coercive steps under the guise of\n\ninvestigation which could infringe the fundamental right guaranteed\n\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

Firstly, the respondent police were\n\ndirected not to arrest the petitioner in Cr.No.1/2020, which is not the\n\ngrievance of the petitioner.      The second direction is that the\n\nrespondent shall not take any coercive steps under the guise of\n\ninvestigation to infringe fundamental right guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21.</a> This Article lays down that no person shall be deprived of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                    20</span>\n                                                                   UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                         WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nhis life or personal liberty except according to the procedure\n\nestablished by law. It is true that the dimensions of life and personal\n\nliberty have been expanded to new horizons by the judicial\n\npronouncements. For instance, it was held that right to life means not\n\na mere survival or animal existence but live with dignity and all that\n\ngoes with it, such as, basic necessities of life like nutrition, clothing,\n\nshelter etc. (vide <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_61\">Francis Coralie Mullin v. The Administrator,\n\nUnion Territory of Delhi19</a>).        So also right to personal liberty\n\nprimarily means freedom from physical restraint by incarceration or\n\notherwise. It also includes right of locomotion, right to travel abroad\n\netc.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1747577\" id=\"span_68\">(vide <a href=\"/doc/1747577/\" id=\"a_62\">Satwant Singh Sawhni v. Assistant Passport Officer20</a>).\n\nEven if the aforesaid vibrant facets of life and personal liberty\n\nenveloped in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 21</a> are taken into consideration, it by no means\n\ncan be harped that the search and seizure operations conducted at the\n\npresent instance on the judicial order of a Magistrate, in any way\n\nviolated the order of this Court and consequently <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 21.</a> It must\n\nbe noted that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 21</a>, for that matter any fundamental right, is not\n\nan unbridled right but circumscribed by certain limitations meaning\n\nthereby, the life and personal liberty are subject to procedure\n\nestablished by law. Hence, this Court&#x27;s order in I.ANo.1/2020 cannot\n\nbe construed to shun the respondent police from proceeding with\n\ninvestigation.

Point No.2: It has now to be seen whether the search and\n\nseizure are otherwise hit by:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      (a) non-manifestation of reasons for issuing warrant by the\n\nMagistrate : One of the arguments is that the Magistrate issued\n\nwarrant on mere asking but without recording reasons which is prime\n\nessential. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68260\" id=\"span_78\">In <a href=\"/doc/68260/\" id=\"a_80\">V.S.Kuttan Pillai</a> (3 supra) the Apex Court observed\n\nthat the Magistrate has to give reasons which swayed his discretion to\n\nissue warrant. In this context, when perused the record, the FIR\n\nallegations are that the petitioner and other accused in pursuance of a\n\nconspiracy, committed criminal breach of trust and cheating to a tune\n\nof Rs.1200 Crores of the public money during the span of ten years by\n\nestablishing Benami Handloom Weavers Societies and by diverting\n\nthe funds released for the benefit of weaker sections of Weavers\n\nSocieties. Consequently Cr.No.1/2020 was registered by CID police.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">During the course of investigation, requisition was filed before\n\nlearned Additional Junior Civil Judge, Kadapa stating that searches\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                    23</span>\n                                                                  UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                        WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nhave to be conducted in the requisition mentioned six places to seize\n\nthe incriminating documents and other records pertaining to\n\nDayankhan Palli Weakers Cooperative Production and Sale Society\n\nLimited. The order in Crl.M.No.1405/2020 shows that the learned\n\nMagistrate having perused the FIR and other relevant material\n\nexpressed his satisfaction to issue search warrants as the places of\n\nsearches are located within his jurisdiction and thus issued search\n\nwarrants under <a href=\"/doc/983956/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 93</a> of Cr.P.C., 1973. The impugned order\n\nshows that upon perusal of the relevant material only the Magistrate\n\nwas pleased to issue the search warrants. As stated supra, in the FIR a\n\ngrave allegation of misappropriation of huge amount is made and\n\nupon perusal of FIR, it appears the Magistrate was satisfied that\n\nincriminating materials have to be unearthed and accordingly, issued a\n\ngeneral search warrants. I find no manifest illegality or irregularity in\n\nthe order impugned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">17.   (b) Irrelevancy of the property seized with the offences\n\nalleged in FIR : It is argued that the offences alleged against the\n\npetitioner and others are mainly the criminal breach of trust and\n\ncheating. In that view, the police filed requisition to issue warrants to\n\nsearch and seize only the documents and other records pertaining to\n\nthe Dayankhan Palli Weavers Cooperative Society and the warrants\n\nwere also issued for that purpose. However, without seizing any\n\nrecords and documents if found during search, the respondent police\n\nhave seized cash, gold and silver ornaments and FDRs and passbooks\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                     24</span>\n                                                                  UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                        WP.No.14861 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\nwhich have nothing to do with the alleged offence.       Hence, on that\n\ncount the search and seizure became illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">         Per contra, the contention of the learned Government Pleader is\n\nthat the raid party, apart from some agreements, Xerox copy of the\n\ndocuments, letter pads etc. also seized gold &amp; silver ornaments and\n\ncash. He would argue that those valuable properties were amassed by\n\nthe accused with the ill-gotten money and therefore, the prosecution\n\nbelieves to establish the guilt of the accused with the help of not only\n\nthe documents seized but also those valuable properties. His further\n\ncontention is that since the investigation of the crime is at the\n\nthreshold, this Court may not make any observation with regard to the\n\nnexus of those valuable properties with the crime. He would further\n\nsubmit that the petitioner can move an application before the\n\nMagistrate seeking interim custody of those valuables, if he is so\n\nadvised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">         I find some force in the submission of the learned Government\n\nPleader. It is true that the impugned order of the Magistrate shows\n\nthat requisition was made for search warrants to trace/seize the\n\nincriminating documents and records pertaining to the crime. The\n\nCourt passed the order permitting the investigating agency to conduct\n\nsearches in the order mentioned places and if any alleged\n\nincriminating material was found, to produce the same before the\n\nCourt.      It appears the raid party has seized, apart from some\n\ndocuments the other valuable properties also.          Admittedly, the\n\ninvestigation is in the peripheral stage.
