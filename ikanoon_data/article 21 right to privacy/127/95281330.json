There is\n             no manner of doubt that the court having\n             regard to the facts and circumstances of\n             the case can impose necessary, just and\n             efficacious conditions while enlarging an\n             accused on bail under Section 438 of the\n             Code.

A broader meaning cannot be assigned to the words\n“interest of justice” in Section 437(3) of Cr. PC. By borrowing\nthe language used by this Court in the above decisions, we\ncan say that the bail conditions cannot be fanciful, arbitrary\nor freakish. The object of imposing conditions of bail is to\nensure that the accused does not interfere or obstruct the\ninvestigation in any manner, remains available for the\ninvestigation, does not tamper with or destroy evidence, does\nnot commit any offence, remains regularly present before the\nTrial Court, and does not create obstacles in the expeditious\nconclusion of the trial.

Cooperating with the investigation does not\nmean that the accused must confess.                            The conditions\nincorporated in the order granting bail must be within the\nfour corners of Section 437(3). The bail conditions must be\nconsistent with the object of imposing conditions.                       While\nimposing bail conditions, the Constitutional rights of an\naccused, who is ordered to be released on bail, can be\ncurtailed only to the minimum extent required.                       Even an\naccused convicted by a competent Court and undergoing a\nsentence in prison is not deprived of all his rights guaranteed\nby <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. This Court, in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/731194/\" id=\"a_37\">State of A.P. v. Challa Ramkrishna Reddy,4</a> reiterated the\nsettled position by holding as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">             “22. Right to life is one of the basic human\n             rights. It is guaranteed to every person by\n             <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and not even\n             the State has the authority to violate that\n             right. A prisoner, be he a convict or\n             undertrial or a detenu, does not cease to\n             be a human being.

On being convicted of\n             crime and deprived of their liberty in\n             accordance        with     the     procedure\n             established by law, prisoners still\n             retain the residue of constitutional\n             rights.”\n                                         (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_13\">4 (2000) 5 SCC 712\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">              Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023         Page 10 of 25</span>\n\f7.1. We are dealing with a case of the accused whose guilt is\nyet to be established. So long as he is not held guilty, the\npresumption of innocence is applicable. He cannot be\ndeprived of all his rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21.</a> The\nCourts must show restraint while imposing bail conditions.\nTherefore, while granting bail, the Courts can curtail the\nfreedom of the accused only to the extent required for\nimposing the bail conditions warranted by law.                                   Bail\nconditions cannot be so onerous as to frustrate the order of\nbail itself. For example, the Court may impose a condition of\nperiodically reporting to the police station/Court or not\ntravelling    abroad         without          prior       permission.       Where\ncircumstances require, the Court may impose a condition\nrestraining an accused from entering a particular area to\nprotect the prosecution witnesses or the victims.                         But the\nCourt cannot impose a condition on the accused to keep the\nPolice constantly informed about his movement from one\nplace to another. The object of the bail condition cannot be to\nkeep a constant vigil on the movements of the accused\nenlarged     on   bail.     The      investigating             agency   cannot     be\npermitted to continuously peep into the private life of the\naccused enlarged on bail, by imposing arbitrary conditions\nsince that will violate the right of privacy of the accused, as\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21.</a> If a constant vigil is kept on every\nmovement of the accused released on bail by the use of\ntechnology or otherwise, it will infringe the rights of the\naccused guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a>, including the right to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">              Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023              Page 11 of 25</span>\n\fprivacy. The reason is that the effect of keeping such constant\nvigil on the accused by imposing drastic bail conditions will\namount to keeping the accused in some kind of confinement\neven after he is released on bail. Such a condition cannot be a\ncondition of bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">8.      In view of sub­section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1135354/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 441</a> of the CrPC, the\nconditions imposed by the Court while granting bail always\nstand incorporated in the bail bond executed by the accused.\nTherefore, the accused is bound by the conditions imposed\nwhile granting bail. If the accused, after being enlarged on\nbail, commits a breach of bail conditions or commits any\noffence, the Courts always have the power to cancel the bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">9.      A condition cannot be imposed while granting bail\nwhich is impossible for the accused to comply with. If such a\ncondition is imposed, it will deprive an accused of bail,\nthough he is otherwise entitled to it.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">CONDITION OF DROPPING PIN ON GOOGLE MAP\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">10.     Firstly, we will deal with the issue of the condition of\ndropping a PIN on Google Maps. The condition imposed on the\nappellant of dropping a PIN on Google Map gives an\nimpression that the condition will enable the first respondent\nNarcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to monitor the movements of\nthe accused on a real­time basis, which will be violative of the\nright    to   privacy      guaranteed           under           <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article   21</a>     of    the\nConstitution of India.

Accordingly, Shri R. Suresh\nBabu, authorised signatory of Google LLC, has filed an\naffidavit. Paragraphs 5 to 10 of his affidavit read thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           “5. Google Maps is a web and app­\n           based service that enables users to search\n           for and navigate to local places. It inter\n           alia offers real­time traffic conditions, and\n           route planning for travelling by foot, car,\n           bike, air, and public transportation.\n           Google Maps can be accessed through the\n           Google Maps application available on\n           mobiles or through a web browser at\n           www.google.com/maps.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           6.    One of the features available to\n           users on Google Maps is the ability of\n           users to drop a ‘PIN’ on a location of\n           their choosing on the map. Dropping a\n           PIN, allows the user to mark or identify\n           a location on the map without\n           necessarily requiring access to the\n           user’s location data. Users may drop a\n           PIN either on the mobile application or on\n           the web browser. To drop a PIN, a user\n           may either:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                  a. press and hold the desired\n                  location where the PIN is to be\n                  dropped on the map on the mobile\n                  application; or\n\n                  b. click on the desired location on\n                  the map on a web browser.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           7.    Upon dropping the PIN, the user\n           dropping the PIN can identify the specific\n           coordinates of the location on the map.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">            Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023   Page 13 of 25</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\fThrough the Google Maps app or through\na web browser, the user dropping the PIN\nmay opt to get directions to the location,\nmark the location with a label, add a\nbusiness address to the location, or share\nthe location with another user.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">8.    The PIN identifies and marks a\nspecific location of the user’s choosing on\nGoogle Maps.       The PIN need not be\ndropped at the location where the\nuser/the user’s device is located at the\ntime of sharing the PIN. The PIN dropped\nand shared need not be the real­time\nlocation of the user sharing the PIN.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">9.    Google Maps allows users to share\ninformation, such as the PIN, with third\nparties.   This is explained in Google’s\nprivacy policy, which is available at\nhttps:policies.google.com/privacy?hI=en­\nUS, and shares as follows: “Many of our\nservices let you share information with\nother people, and you have control over\nhow you share [emphasis supplied]”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">Users consent to the privacy policy when\nthey create a Google Account. In this\ncase, if a user wants to share a PIN, they\ncan do so by clicking on the ‘share’\nbutton. This generates a link to Google\nMaps that the user can share with others\nthrough messaging platforms or other\nmodes of online communication. When\nclicked, the link directs users (having\naccess to the link) to the location where\nthe PIN was dropped on the map.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">10. The Google Maps PIN feature, which\nincludes the creation of a PIN or the\nsharing of such a PIN with another user,\ndoes not impinge on the user’s privacy as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023   Page 14 of 25</span>\n\f           the user has full control over sharing of\n           such information. The user with access to\n           the link can only access the static location\n           pinned and shared on Google Maps. The\n           pinned location does not enable real­\n           time tracking of the user or their\n           device. Even if the PIN were to coincide\n           with a user’s location at a given time, this\n           would (a) be the static location pinned by\n           the user; and (b) only be accessible to\n           others when a user affirmatively shares\n           the PIN with them by clicking on the share\n           button.”\n\n                                                   (emphasis added)\n\n10.1. In paragraph 10 of the affidavit, Google LLC stated that\nthe user has full control over sharing PINs with other users.\nMoreover, it does not impinge on the user’s privacy, as the\nuser retains full control. Most importantly, it is stated that\nthe PIN location does not enable real­time tracking of the user\nor the user’s device. Therefore, the condition of the accused\ndropping a pin on Google Maps, as it stands, is completely\nredundant as the same does not help the first respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">10.2.   Imposing        any      bail     condition        which    enables     the\nPolice/Investigation Agency to track every movement of the\naccused released on bail by using any technology or otherwise\nwould undoubtedly violate the right to privacy guaranteed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21.</a> In this case, the condition of dropping a PIN\non   Google    Maps        has      been      incorporated         without    even\nconsidering the technical effect of dropping a PIN and the\nrelevance of the said condition as a condition of bail.                       This\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">              Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023            Page 15 of 25</span>\n\fcannot be a condition of bail. The condition deserves to be\ndeleted and ordered accordingly.                In some cases, this Court\nmay have imposed a similar condition.                        But in those cases,\nthis Court was not called upon to decide the issue of the effect\nand legality of such a condition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">THE CONDITION OF FURNISHING CERTIFICATE OF THE\nEMBASSY\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">11.   Now, we come to the decision of the Supreme Court\n\nLegal Aid Committee1 relied upon by the High Court. In the\nfirst part of paragraph 15, the prayers made in the petition\nfiled before this Court have been set out. We are quoting the\nrelevant part of paragraph 15, which reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">           “15. But the main reason which\n           motivated the Supreme Court Legal\n           Aid Society to file this petition under\n           <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution was the\n           delay in the disposal of cases under\n           the Act involving foreigners.

The\n            Special Court will, notwithstanding the\n            directions, be free to cancel bail if the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">           Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023   Page 21 of 25</span>\n\f               accused is found to be misusing it and\n               grounds for cancellation of bail exist.\n               Lastly, we grant liberty to apply in case\n               of any difficulty in the implementation of\n               this order.”\n                                         (emphasis added)\n\n11.1.     The directions contained in paragraph 15 were to\noperate as one­time directions applicable only to the pending\ncases of the accused who were in jail on the date of the\njudgment. These conditions were required to be incorporated\nin the order while releasing an accused on bail as a one­time\nmeasure. Paragraph 16 clarifies that if a bail application is\nmade to the Special Court with a grievance regarding\ninordinate delay in the disposal of pending cases, the Special\nCourt will be empowered to exercise power to grant bail in\nlight of what is held in paragraph 15.                         Therefore, it is not\nnecessary that in every case where bail is granted to an\naccused in an NDPS case who is a foreign national on the\nground of long incarceration of more than 50% of the\nminimum sentence, the condition of obtaining a ‘certificate of\nassurance’ from the Embassy/High Commission should be\nincorporated. It will depend on the facts of each case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">12.     Even if such a condition is incorporated, on an\napplication     made          by      the       accused,          the   concerned\nEmbassy/High Commission declines or fails to issue the\ncertificate within a reasonable time, say within a period of\nseven days, the Court always has the power to dispense with\nthe said condition. Grant of such a certificate by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">              Criminal Appeal @ SLP (Crl) No.6339­40 of 2023              Page 22 of 25</span>\n\fEmbassy/High Commission is beyond the control of the\naccused to whom bail is granted.                            Therefore, when the\nEmbassy/High Commission does not grant such a certificate\nwithin a reasonable time, as explained above, the accused,\nwho is otherwise held entitled to bail, cannot be denied bail on\nthe ground that such a condition, which is impossible for the\naccused to comply with, has not been complied with. Hence,\nthe     Court    will     have       to    delete       the      condition.     If    the\nEmbassy/High Commission records reasons for denying the\ncertificate and the reasons are based on the adverse conduct\nof the accused based on material, the Court can always\nconsider       the    reasons         recorded          while      considering         an\napplication for dispensing with the condition. However, the\nCourts must remember that the accused has no right to\ncompel the Embassy/High Commission to issue such a\ncertificate.    There can be very many reasons for recording\nadversely which again cannot be the basis to deny bail already\ngranted. In such a case, instead of the condition of obtaining\nsuch a certificate, the condition of surrendering the passport\nand regularly reporting to the local police station/Trial Court\ncan always be imposed, depending upon the facts of each\ncase.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"143202244\" id=\"span_31\">13.
