According to a &quot;time-use&quot; survey conducted by the Organisation for\n             Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), women in India\n             currently spend upto 352 minutes per day on unpaid work, 577% more\n             than the time spent by men. Time spent in unpaid work includes\n             childcare. In this context, the support of care work through benefits such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                               6</span>\n                                                             2025:HHC:17166\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                     CWPOA No. 7185 of 2020</span>\n\n\nas maternity leave, paternity leave, or child care leave (availed by both\nparents) by the state and other employers is essential. Although certain\nprovisions of the Rules of 1972 have enabled women to enter the paid\nworkforce, women continue to bear the primary responsibility for\nchildcare. The grant of childcare leave to the appellant cannot be used to\ndisentitle her to maternity leave under Rule 43 of the 1972 Rules.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">25. Unless a purposive interpretation were to be adopted in the present\ncase, the object and intent of the grant of maternity leave would simply be\ndefeated. The grant of maternity leave under Rules of 1972 is intended to\nfacilitate the continuance of women in the workplace. It is a harsh reality\nthat but for such provisions, many women would be compelled by social\ncircumstances to give up work on the birth of a child, if they are not\ngranted leave and other facilitative measures. No employer can perceive\nchild birth as detracting from the purpose of employment. Child birth has\nto be construed in the context of employment as a natural incident of life\nand hence, the provisions for maternity leave must be construed in that\nperspective.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">26. The predominant understanding of the concept of a &quot;family&quot; both in\nthe law and in society is that it consists of a single, unchanging unit with a\nmother and a father (who remain constant over time) and their children.\nThis assumption ignores both, the many circumstances which may lead to\na change in one‟s familial structure, and the fact that many families do not\nconform to this expectation to begin with. Familial relationships may take\nthe form of domestic, unmarried partnerships or queer relationships. A\nhousehold may be a single parent household for any number of reasons,\nincluding the death of a spouse, separation, or divorce. Similarly, the\nguardians and caretakers (who traditionally occupy the roles of the\n&quot;mother&quot; and the &quot;father&quot;) of children may change with remarriage,\nadoption, or fostering. These manifestations of love and of families may\nnot be typical but they are as real as their traditional counterparts. Such\natypical manifestations of the family unit are equally deserving not only of\nprotection under law but also of the benefits available under social\nwelfare legislation. The black letter of the law must not be relied upon to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                           7</span>\n                                                                           2025:HHC:17166\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                 CWPOA No. 7185 of 2020</span>\n\n\n             disadvantage families which are different from traditional ones.

It is important to recognise that reproductive choices\n               can be exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from\n               procreating. The crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s\n               right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be\n               respected. This means that there should be no restriction\n               whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such as\n               a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\n               alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive\n               methods.

Taken to their logical conclusion, reproductive\n               rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy\n               to its full term, to give birth and to subsequently raise\n               children.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">                                      *** *** *** ***\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28938556\" id=\"span_38\">30.

Elaborating on the contours of reproductive rights, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_47\">X Vs.\nPrincipal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Govt. of NCT\nof Delhi</a> observed that the ambit of reproductive rights is not restricted to\nthe right of women to have or not to have children.

This\nCourt observed that although human dignity inheres in every individual, it\nis susceptible to violation by external conditions and treatment imposed\nby the State. The right of every woman to make reproductive choices\nwithout undue interference from the State is central to the idea of human\ndignity. Deprivation of access to reproductive healthcare or emotional and\nphysical well-being also injures the dignity of women. This Court referred\nto <a href=\"/doc/854952/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 51</a> of the Constitution which urges the State to foster respect for\ninternational law and treaty obligations.

In a recent decision, Delhi High Court in Commissioner of Police Vs.\n            Raveena Yadav6 explained the purpose of maternity benefit. It is to\n            ensure that a working lady may overcome the state of motherhood\n            honourably, peaceably and undeterred by the fear of being victimized for\n            forced absence from work during pre and post natal periods. Women now\n            constituting a sizable portion of the work force in our country, must be\n            treated with honour and dignity at places where they work to earn their\n            livelihood. The High Court went on to explain the impact of pregnancy on\n            the physiological and psychological state of a woman employee\n            undergoing pregnancy. It is not just motherhood but also childhood that\n            require special attention. Health issues of both mother as well as that of\n            the child are to be kept in consideration while providing maternity leave.\n            Concept of maternity leave is a matter of not just fair play and social\n            justice but is also a constitutional guarantee to the women employees of\n            this country towards fulfillment whereof the State is bound to act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_71\">            33. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_47\">In <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_50\">Deepika Singh</a> (supra), appellant at the material time was working\n            as a nursing officer in the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education\n            and Research, Chandigarh (PGIMER). Her spouse had two children from\n            his first marriage. After his first wife passed away he married the\n            appellant. In official record she declared the two children of her spouse\n            from the first marriage as her children. On 04.06.2019 she had her first\n            biological child from her marriage. She applied for maternity leave in\n            terms of Rule 43 of the Central Services (Leave) Rules, 1972 (&#x27;1972\n            Rules&#x27; hereinafter) which rules are applicable to PGIMER. Request of the\n            appellant for grant of maternity leave was rejected on the ground that she\n            had two surviving children and had availed of child care leave earlier for\n            the two children born from the first marriage of her spouse. Her first\n            biological child was considered as the third child. Therefore her request\n            for grant of maternity leave was found to be inadmissible in terms of the\n            1972 Rules.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">17.

As observed by the Supreme Court, motherhood is\n\nFundamental Constitutional right covered under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and is also an essential &#x27;human right&#x27; to perform the\n\nduty assigned to a women by nature, without which existence of human\n\nrace is not possible. Such denial definitely, shall be a reason for compelling\n\na female employee to continue on duty during pregnancy forcibly, if she\n\nwants to avail monetary benefits, despite the fact that for that she will be\n\notherwise entitled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">18.           Denial of monetary benefits during maternity leave shall be\n\namounting to exclusion of period of maternity leave from service tenure and\n\nit will be an act against social justice being discriminative in character as\n\ncruel on the part of Employer amounting to punishing a women for her\n\nwomen-hood by depriving her from motherhood or compelling her to join\n\nduty during such period when she is entitled for maternity benefits.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">19.           Meaning of Section 43 (2) of CCS (Leave) Rules as\n\ninterpreted by the respondents, would be amounting             to abuse the\n\nprovision, which has been framed for benefit of a women availing maternity\n\nleave.   <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_52\">Maternity Benefit Act</a> as well as provisions of maternity leave are\n\nbeneficial legislation. Therefore, real intention of provisions of Rule 43 of\n\nCCS (Leave) Rules, especially sub-rule 2 thereof, is that it has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                      21</span>\n                                                                2025:HHC:17166\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                         CWPOA No. 7185 of 2020</span>\n\n\nprovided in it to ensure that during maternity leave a women is not deprived\n\nfrom the payment of salary. In fact, this provision has been made to ensure\n\npayment of salary to women equal to the pay drawn monthly before\n\nproceeding on leave so that she is not pushed to a disadvantageous\n\nposition by providing less salary during her maternity leave.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">20.           No Rule provides that during maternity leave no increment\n\nshall be granted to the women employee who is on maternity leave.\n\nPetitioner   otherwise would have been entitled for higher pay scale if she\n\nwould not have availed maternity leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">21.           It is also apt to notice a situation where a female employee\n\nlike petitioner, proceeded on maternity leave immediately after her\n\nregularisation and joined her duty before completion of 2 years. In such a\n\nsituation on due date of completion of 2 years, such female employee\n\nwould be on duty. There is no provision for exclusion of maternity leave\n\nperiod from the service, such female employee would have been granted\n\nhigher pay scale from the due date on actual basis.                Therefore,\n\ninterpretation of Rule 43 of CCS (Leave) Rules by the respondents is\n\nerroneous and contrary to the purpose of incorporation of such Rules in\n\nCCS (Leave) Rules and is also in conflict not only with provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_53\">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, but also the Constitution of India, Universal\n\nDeclarations, Conventions and Treaties, to which India is also signatory.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                      22</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">                                                               2025:HHC:17166\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                        CWPOA No. 7185 of 2020</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">22.          For the beneficial nature of provisions related to maternity\n\nleave and <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_54\">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, during the maternity leave period, a female\n\nemployee shall have to be considered on duty for all purposes. It shall be\n\ntaken into consideration by counting such period, for completing period of\n\nregular service. Benefit of maternity leave period of service has to be\n\ncounted as a regular service.       Motherhood should not be a curse.\n\nMaternity leave is not a leave availed for ailment or enjoyment holidays or\n\nleave taken for other purpose which can be managed otherwise without\n\ngoing on leave. Duty of giving birth can only be performed by female only,\n\nthat too after undergoing a difficult time with due care and caution. Post\n\nbirth duty is also not easy or less cumbersome.       Depriving or denying\n\nfemale employee from any benefit of service during the period of maternity\n\nleave, is irrational, unreasonable, discriminatory and arbitrary and also\n\nviolative of not only Constitution of India, but also violates essence of\n\nUniversal Declaration, Conventions and Treaties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">23.          Female employee avails maternity leave under compulsion to\n\nperform her duty as a women which is equivalent to Creator. It is not a\n\nleave availed by her for her pleasure or to do any other work which could\n\nhave been performed by anybody else in her place. Therefore, general\n\nprinciple of depriving grant of increment till joining of an employee after\n\navailing any kind of leave, is not to be applied in case of maternity leave.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                       23</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">                                                                 2025:HHC:17166\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                          CWPOA No. 7185 of 2020</span>\n\n\nSuch act on the part of employer is definitely in conflict with the\n\nfundamental Constitutional right, human right and right of motherhood\n\npromised under the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_55\">Constitution, Maternity Benefit Act</a>,              Universal\n\nDeclaration, Conventions and Treaties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">24.          Omission and commission on the part of respondents denying\n\nthe maternity benefits, by refusing to grant higher pay scale to the petitioner\n\nfrom the due date during her maternity leave period, is not sustainable.\n\nFemale employee carrying a child, during crucial period, cannot manage or\n\nadjust to remain on duty on due date of annual increment or for getting any\n\nother service benefits.    Relevant period of maternity leave cannot be\n\npreponed or postponed by female employee, rather female employee is\n\ncompelled to avail maternity leave at relevant point when such leave is\n\nwarranted to perform her duty for which, because of natural biological\n\nhuman anatomy she only is capable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">25.
