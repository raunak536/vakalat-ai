The\n\naforesaid Sh. Dharam Suhag is at Serial No.2 and the petitioner, namely, Sh.\n\nKashik Mann, is at Serial No.3. The petitioner has challenged the present\n\nimpugned order dated 24.01.2024 and this Court while issuing notice of motion\n\nhad also passed interim order by which the operation of the aforesaid transfer\n\norder was directed to be stayed till the next date of hearing.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.           The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted\n\nthat the aforesaid impugned transfer order dated 24.01.2024 (Annexure P-2) was\n\nnot only violative of Transfer Policy dated 13.09.2012 which has been attached\n\nalong with the present petition as Annexure P-1 but apart from the above, the\n\ntransfer of the petitioner was effected as a result of malice in order to\n\naccommodate respondent No.3 in the same District where he was earlier\n\nworking as an Executive Engineer and was promoted and he got his first posting\n\nas a Superintending Engineer in Karnal and since respondent No.3 was to be\n\naccommodated, the petitioner was transferred out from Karnal and was directed\n\nto be posted at Panchkula Headquarter notwithstanding the Transfer Policy to\n\nthe contrary and notwithstanding that about few months ago he was rather\n\ntransferred to Karnal because of his family difficulties and the request of the\n\npetitioner was accepted by the Nigam and on the basis of acceptance of the\n\nrequest of the petitioner, he was posted at that particular place and now when he\n\nwas scheduled to retire in about 9 months time, he has been uprooted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">6.           Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that transfer is\n\nan incident of service and also submitted that there is no dispute on the\n\nproposition of law that in administrative exigencies the power can be exercised\n\nby the competent authority to transfer any of the employees but the exercise of\n\n\n\n                                        4 of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 22-03-2024 23:11:34 :::</span>\n                                          Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:034381\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2024:PHHC:034381\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">CWP-2237-2024                                                                     -5-</span>\n\npower cannot be arbitrary and due to extraneous reasons. He submitted that the\n\nTransfer Policy although may not be having a statutory force, but once it has\n\nbeen framed by the respondent-Nigam and it was being given effect to in various\n\nother transfers then there was no reason for making a departure from the\n\naforesaid Transfer Policy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.           He also submitted that the petitioner has not disputed the power of\n\nthe respondent-Nigam to transfer any employee due to administrative exigencies\n\nbut he has raised challenge to the exercise of power which is tainted by legal\n\nmalice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.           To substantiate his arguments, he referred to Para No.8 of the\n\npetition in which he specifically pleaded that as per Clause 5 of the Transfer\n\nPolicy, on promotion every officer/official will be transferred to another station\n\nand in the present case, respondent No.3 was posted at Karnal as an XEN and on\n\nhis first promotion itself he was promoted on the same station and there is no\n\njustifiable reason for that for making a departure from the Transfer Policy\n\n(Annexure P-1). It was further specifically pleaded in Para No.8 that instead of\n\ntransferring the respondent No.3 at another place, the official respondents have\n\ntransferred the petitioner despite the fact that the petitioner has served only for 9\n\nmonths at Karnal and less than one year was left for his retirement as he was due\n\nto retire on 30.11.2024 and it was also specifically pleaded in Para No.8 that it\n\nwas a violation of the Transfer Policy of 2012. Learned counsel further\n\nsubmitted that the respondent-Nigam has filed a reply to the present petition and\n\nwhile replying to Para No.8 of the petition, it has been only stated that the\n\nTransfer Policy of 12.10.2021 is now in vogue and as per Clause 11 of the\n\nPolicy, the Nigam retains the right, to transfer any officer at any time in the\n\ninterest of the Nigam on the administrative grounds. He also submitted that the\n\naforesaid Transfer Policy which now the respondent-Nigam has stated in the\n\n\n\n                                        5 of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 22-03-2024 23:11:34 :::</span>\n                                         Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:034381\n\n\n\n\n                                                           2024:PHHC:034381\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">CWP-2237-2024                                                                   -6-</span>\n\nreply dated 12.02.2024 has been appended by the respondents in their reply as\n\nAnnexure R-1/7 and the aforesaid Clause 11 is also reflected in the Transfer\n\nPolicy of 12.10.2021. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that\n\nthe respondent-Nigam has given a factually incorrect position while filing reply\n\nto Para No.8 of the petition and in this way, the respondent-Nigam has filed a\n\nfalse reply before this Court and for that purpose, the officer who has filed the\n\nreply has committed perjury by so stating in Para No.8 of the reply that the\n\nTransfer Policy of 12.10.2021 is now in vogue. He submitted that a bare perusal\n\nof Notification dated 12.10.2021 (Annexure R-1/7) would show that the\n\naforesaid policy applies only to the officers of the rank of AE/AEE/XEN and\n\nthis policy does not apply to the post of Superintending Engineer the post which\n\nthe petitioner was holding and therefore, the officer, who has filed the present\n\nreply has to be prosecuted for the offence of perjury and also for the contempt of\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">9.           Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the malice\n\non the part of the respondent-Nigam is further substantiated from the fact that\n\nrespondent No.3 was serving at Karnal for about last 15 years which has been so\n\nspecifically pleaded in Para No.8 of the petition and in the reply which has been\n\nfiled by the respondents there is no denial with regard to the same and therefore,\n\nthere is no dispute with regard to the same. In this regard, he referred to another\n\nClause of the Transfer Policy (Annexure P-1) and as per Clause 3 of the Policy,\n\nthe maximum period for serving in one District in the entire career shall be 8\n\nyears and the submissions which he had made that it was only to accommodate\n\nrespondent No.3 that the petitioner has been uprooted at the fag end of his\n\ncareer, would get substantiated from this fact that the respondent No.3 has been\n\nworking in District Karnal from the last 15 years preceding the present transfer\n\norder in different capacities.

To substantiate his arguments, he submitted\n\nthat when the petitioner was posted at Kaithal in the year 2021-2022, he was\n\nasked by the Head Office to process and forward a show-cause notice which was\n\nto be issued to two officers but he delayed the aforesaid forwarding of the show-\n\ncause notice for 48 days with the result that the aforesaid two officers, against\n\nwhom the show-cause notice was to be issued, were promoted and had the show-\n\ncause notice been forwarded by the petitioner in due course of time and had not\n\nbeen delayed for 48 days, then the aforesaid two employees would not have been\n\npromoted and in this way loss has been caused to the Nigam in this regard.\n\nAnother administrative exigency which has been so stated in the reply was that\n\nwhen the petitioner was posted at Karnal then he had conducted an inquiry and\n\nhe was asked to send inquiry report within 15 days but he caused delay with\n\nregard to the same and therefore, due to this administrative exigency as well the\n\npetitioner was shifted to Panchkula by way of impugned order dated 24.01.2024\n\n(Annexure P-2).

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">15.          The issue involved in the present case is pertaining to the exercise\n\nof powers by the respondent-Nigam in transferring the petitioner.

The proposition of law with regard to the enforceability of a\n\nTransfer Policy is no longer res integra. The judgments which have been\n\nreferred to by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent-Nigam are\n\npertaining to the law that it is the prerogative of an employer to transfer an\n\nemployee at any place on administrative exigencies and normally the Court\n\nshould not interfere except in the cases where there is a violation of any statutory\n\nprovision of law or when the order is without the authority of law or when it is\n\nbagged by mala fide. However, in the present case, it has to be seen and\n\nconsidered as to whether the present impugned order (Annexure P-2) by which\n\nthe petitioner has been transferred was a result of any malice or not.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60630796\" id=\"span_25\">17.          Before adverting to the facts and circumstances of the present case,\n\nit has to be noted that malice/mala fide can be of two types. Firstly, a mala fide\n\ncan be a personal mala fide and secondly, mala fide can be a legal mala fide. In\n\nthe present case, even if it may not be a case of personal mala fide but\n\nconsidering the facts and circumstances of the present case, it has to be seen as\n\nto whether there was any malice in law or not. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n\n&quot;<a href=\"/doc/60630796/\" id=\"a_9\">Ms. X Vs. The Registrar General, High</a> Court of Madhya Pradesh and\n\nanother&quot;, 2022(14) SCC 187 discussed this issue in detail pertaining to the\n\nconcept of malice in law. The malice in law is to be deduced from the facts and\n\n\n\n                                       10 of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 22-03-2024 23:11:34 :::</span>\n                                         Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:034381\n\n\n\n\n                                                            2024:PHHC:034381\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">CWP-2237-2024                                                               -11-</span>\n\ncircumstances of the present case and it is the duty of the Court to go into the\n\ndepth of the facts and circumstances as to whether there is any malice in law or\n\nnot.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">18.          In the present case, the petitioner was posted initially at Kaithal and\n\nvide Annexure R-1/3 on his own request, he was transferred to Karnal which is\n\nhis home District on the ground that his father is 90 years old and his wife\n\ngenerally remains ill and there is nobody to look after them and the aforesaid\n\nrequest was accepted by the Nigam itself which was only few months before the\n\npresent impugned order was passed. However, while the petitioner was still in\n\nKarnal, respondent No.3 was due to be promoted as Superintending Engineer\n\nbecause he was working in Karnal as XEN and after his promotion on his first\n\nposting, he was given the posting at Karnal as Superintending Engineer and\n\nconsequently the petitioner was displaced and uprooted and he was transferred to\n\nPanchkula, notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner was due to retire within a\n\nperiod of about 9/10 months. In other words, even for the sake of arguments, the\n\nTransfer Policy is not to be seen to be having any statutory force of law but there\n\nis no justification which has comeforth as to what compelled the respondents-\n\nNigam to transfer the petitioner at the fag end of his career. The only reason\n\nwhich has been given by the respondent-Nigam in the reply is that because of\n\nthe administrative exigencies the petitioner had to be transferred and the\n\nadministrative exigency is based upon two factors. The first factor is that while\n\nhe was posted at Kaithal, he did not forward the file pertaining to a show-cause\n\nnotice to the Head Office and he caused a delay of 48 days and second reason is\n\nthat while he was posted at Karnal, he was asked to submit an inquiry report\n\nwithin 15 days which he did not submit. The question that would arise would be\n\nthat whether the aforesaid two reasons would be the cogent reasons for\n\ntransferring an employee in contradiction to the terms and conditions of the\n\n\n\n                                      11 of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 22-03-2024 23:11:34 :::</span>\n                                          Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:034381\n\n\n\n\n                                                            2024:PHHC:034381\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">CWP-2237-2024                                                               -12-</span>\n\ntransfer policy itself. When this Court had issued notice of motion and\n\npassed an interim order then after a few days a charge-sheet was served upon the\n\npetitioner vide Annexure R-1/9 pertaining to the aforesaid delay of 48 days. On\n\nthe otherhand, it is undisputed that while the petitioner is in service for 34 long\n\nyears, he is having unblemished record and there is not even a single inquiry or\n\ncomplaint or FIR against the petitioner and now when this Court was seized of\n\nthe matter, it appears that in order to justify their own action, the respondent-\n\nNigam has issued a charge-sheet which was issued for the first time in his career.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">19.          Even if the Transfer Policy is not having any statutory force of law,\n\nbut the same has been followed by the Nigam from time to time and as per\n\nClause 5 of the Transfer Policy on promotion every officer/official will be\n\ntransferred to another station whereas respondent No.3 who was posted at\n\nKarnal for 15 long years at different capacities on promotion was given the\n\nposting at the same District. The relevant portion of the aforesaid Transfer\n\nPolicy is reproduced as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                    &quot;5. On promotion, every officer/official will be\n\n              transferred to another station.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">20.          Therefore, a situation has arisen whereby for accommodating the\n\nrespondent No.3, Clause-5 has been violated and for transferring the petitioner\n\nwho was scheduled to retire within one year and as per the policy, when an\n\nofficer is to retire and the tenure is less than one year, he is not to be displaced\n\nand transferred vide Clause 12, the same has also been violated.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">21.          In Para No.8 of the petition, it was specifically pleaded by the\n\npetitioner that respondent No.3 has been given the place where the petitioner\n\nwas posted and the petitioner has been uprooted despite the fact that less than\n\nyear was left for his retirement and there has been a violation of the aforesaid\n\nTransfer Policy. When a reply was filed by the respondent-Nigam, then the\n\n\n\n                                       12 of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 22-03-2024 23:11:34 :::</span>\n                                         Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:034381\n\n\n\n\n                                                               2024:PHHC:034381\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">CWP-2237-2024                                                                  -13-</span>\n\naforesaid averments have not been denied by them and rather it has been so\n\nspecifically stated in Para No.8 of the reply that another Policy of 12.10.2021 is\n\nin vouge.

The\n\nlearned Senior Counsel has stated that he has sought instructions to state that\n\nthe Transfer Policy of 12.10.2021 does not apply to the petitioner and which\n\nis so evident from the bare language of the aforesaid Policy which states that\n\nthe policy shall apply only to the officers of the rank of AE/AEE/XEN.\n\nTherefore, it is absolutely clear that when the respondent-Nigam has filed\n\nreply to the present petition in Para No.8 factually incorrect position has\n\nbeen reflected and reply of Para No.8 is absolutely misleading. When a\n\nquestion arises with regard to the allegation that as to whether the transfer of\n\nthe petitioner was a result of malice in law or not, the aforesaid stand now\n\ntaken by the respondent-Nigam in the reply wherein false and incorrect\n\nposition has been reflected, this Court would have no option but to come to\n\nthe conclusion that the aforesaid impugned transfer order dated 24.01.2024\n\n(Annexure P-2) was a result of malice in law. Legal mala fide were also\n\nattributable towards respondent No.3 besides the Nigam. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79553902\" id=\"span_34\">However,\n\nrespondent No.3 has chosen not to file reply to the present petition. The\n\nNigam has also not categorically denied the allegation in reply to Para 8 of\n\nthe petition. Therefore they would be deemed to have been admitted.\n\nReference in this regard may be made to a judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in &quot;<a href=\"/doc/79553902/\" id=\"a_10\">Daljeet Singh Grewal Vs. State of Punjab and others</a>&quot;, (2015) 9\n\nSCC 680, the relevant portion is reproduced as under:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                   &quot;39. Further, the adverse remarks for the period\n             1999-2000    were    conveyed       to     the   appellant    vide\n             communication dated 28-06-2000 by the D.G.P-cum-\n             Commandant      General.      The        representations     dated\n             18.08.2000 and 25.08.2000 made by the appellant against\n             the same were submitted to Respondent 4. The said\n\n\n\n                                     14 of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 22-03-2024 23:11:34 :::</span>\n                                     Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:034381\n\n\n\n\n                                                       2024:PHHC:034381\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">CWP-2237-2024                                                          -15-</span>\n\n         representations were rejected on 07-05-2001. The\n         appellant had challenged the same by filing Civil Suit No.\n         70 of 2001, wherein Respondent 4 was impleaded as\n         Defendant 3. The civil suit was decreed on 15-03-2002 in\n         favour of the appellant. The said judgment and decree\n         passed in favour of the appellant has not been\n         implemented by Respondent 4 and 5, despite having\n         attained finality, which clearly reflects the fact that\n         Respondent 4 was not fair in considering him for\n         promotion to the post of Battalion Commander as\n         provided under Rule 8(2) of the Rules. According to the\n         Rules, the appointment to the promotional post shall be\n         made on seniority-cum-merit basis. As per the ACRs\n         placed on record, the appellant has fulfilled the aforesaid\n         requirement of seniority-cum-merit by securing 14 marks,\n         as per the instructions in relation to all aspects entered in\n         the ACR. The strong reliance placed upon the adverse\n         remarks made by Respondent 4, who has made the same\n         without assigning any reasons, has resulted in the\n         appellant being denied of the promotional benefit, even\n         though the order of Respondent 4 was set aside by the\n         judgment and decree in Civil Suit No. 70 of 2001. The\n         action of Respondent 4 in denying the promotional benefit\n         to the appellant is tainted with malafides. It can further be\n         observed from the record that it was Respondent 7 who\n         had filed the reply on behalf of all the respondents in the\n         writ petition proceedings before the High Court. It is\n         important to note at this stage that Respondent 7 happens\n         to be an officer junior to the appellant, who was promoted\n         to the post in question. The non-filing of written statement\n         by Respondent 4 traversing the allegations of mala fide\n         against him proves the mala fide intention on part of\n         Respondent 4. Therefore, there was no justification for\n         Respondent 4 in denying the promotional benefit to the\n         post of Battalion Commander to the appellant.

It was held that if the ACR of the\n             officer concerned is to be used for the purpose of denying\n             promotion, then all such ACRs were required to be\n             communicated to him, to enable him to make a\n             representation against his adverse entries made in the\n             ACRs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">23.
