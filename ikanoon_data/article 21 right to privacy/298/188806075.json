The first petitioner\n\n                      Shri.Arunkumar got married to the second petitioner Ms.Srija on\n\n                      31.10.2018 at Arulmighu Sankara Rameswara Temple, Tuticorin as\n\n                      per Hindu rites and customs. The village administrative officer has\n\n                      certified that this marriage was in fact performed and that it was not a\n\n                      bigamous one for either. The temple authorities though permitted the\n\n                      performance of the marriage declined to vouch for it.        When the\n\n                      parties submitted a memorandum for registration of marriage under\n\n                      Rule 5 (1) (a) of the Tamil Nadu Registration of Marriages Rules in\n\n                      Form I before the third respondent, the third respondent refused to\n\n                      register the same. Questioning the said decision taken by the third\n\n                      respondent vide proceedings dated 16.11.2018, the petitioners\n\n                      herein filed an appeal before the second respondent.

He could do so if he is satisfied that\n\n                      the marriage between the parties was not performed in accordance\n\n                      with the personal laws of the parties, any custom or usage or\n\n                      tradition.

In this\n\n                      case, the authorities of the temple, where the marriage between the\n\n                      parties was said to have been solemnized, had not issued any\n\n                      certificate indicating the performance of the marriage.      He further\n\n                      contended that as per <a href=\"/doc/635068/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 5</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, the\n\n                      bridegroom must have completed the age of 21 years while the bride\n\n                      must have completed the age of 18 years at the time of marriage.

Thus the statutory\n\n                      requirement set out in <a href=\"/doc/635068/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 5</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 has\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                         5</span>\n\n                      not been fulfilled.

According to the\n\n                      renowned writer Devdutt Pattanaik in his book &#x27;Jaya&#x27;, in the great\n\n                      Mahabharata war, Aravan came forward to sacrifice himself to ensure\n\n                      the victory of Dharma. But, he insisted that he must have a wife who\n\n                      will weep for him when he died.          In keeping with the rules of the\n\n                      ritual, it was mandatory to fulfil the last wish of the sacrificial victim.\n\n                      The Pandavas were obliged to get Aravan married but no woman\n\n                      was willing to be his wife. Who would want to marry a man doomed\n\n                      to die at sunrise?.    When all attempts to get Aravan a wife failed,\n\n                      Krishna rose to the occasion and transitioned himself into a female\n\n                      form known as Mohini and married Aravan.            The next day when\n\n                      Aravan was beheaded at dawn, Krishna wept for him as a widow.\n\n                      This tale of Aravan&#x27;s human sacrifice comes from north Tamil Nadu&#x27;s\n\n                      oral traditions where Aravan is worshipped as Kuthandavar, a form of\n\n                      Shiva.   Aravan&#x27;s sacrifice is re-enacted each year ritually where he\n\n                      becomes the divine husband of all men who have womanly feelings.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                           7</span>\n\n                      Through Aravan&#x27;s mythology the existence of those who call\n\n                      themselves Transgender is acknowledged, explained and validated.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">                            6.Shikhandi is another important character in Mahabharata.\n\n                      She was born as a female but grew up to be a male.
