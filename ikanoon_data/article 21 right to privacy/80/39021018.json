The present batch of Writ Petitions raise an Orwellian\n\nconcern, about the alleged possibility of utilizing modern\n\ntechnology to hear what you hear, see what you see and to know\n\nwhat you do. In this context, this Court is called upon to\n\nexamine an allegation of the use of such a technology, its utility,\n\nneed and alleged abuse. We make it clear that our effort is to\n\nuphold the constitutional aspirations and rule of law, without\n\nallowing ourselves to be consumed in the political rhetoric. This\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 2</span>\n\fCourt has always been conscious of not entering the political\n\nthicket. However, at the same time, it has never cowered from\n\nprotecting all from the abuses of fundamental rights. All that we\n\nwould like to observe in this regard is a reiteration of what had\n\nalready been said by this Court in Kesavananda Bharati v.\n\nState of Kerala, (Opinion of Justice Khanna) AIR 1973 SC 1461:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     “1535…. Judicial review is not intended to create what\n     is sometimes called judicial oligarchy, the aristrocracy\n     (sic) of the robe, covert legislation, or Judge­made law.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">     The proper forum to fight for the wise use of the\n     legislative authority is that of public opinion and\n     legislative assemblies. Such contest cannot be\n     transferred to the judicial arena. That all\n     constitutional      interpretations       have   political\n     consequences should not obliterate the fact that the\n     decision has to be arrived at in the calm and\n     dispassionate atmosphere of the court room, that\n     Judges in order to give legitimacy to their decision\n     have to keep aloof from the din and controversy of\n     politics and that the fluctuating fortunes of rival\n     political parties can have for them only academic\n     interest. Their primary duty is to uphold the\n     Constitution and the laws without fear or favour and\n     in doing so, they cannot allow any political ideology or\n     economic theory, which may have caught their fancy,\n     to colour the decision…”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.   A short conspectus of the events leading up to the present\n\nbatch of petitions would not be misplaced to highlight the scope\n\nof the issues at hand. In September 2018, Citizen Lab, which is a\n\nlaboratory based out of the University of Toronto, Canada,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 3</span>\n\freleased a report detailing the software capabilities of a “spyware\n\nsuite” called Pegasus that was being produced by an Israeli\n\nTechnology firm, viz., the NSO Group. The report indicated that\n\nindividuals from nearly 45 countries were suspected to have been\n\naffected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">3.   The Pegasus suite of spywares can allegedly be used to\n\ncompromise the digital devices of an individual through zero click\n\nvulnerabilities, i.e., without requiring any action on the part of\n\nthe target of the software. Once the software infiltrates an\n\nindividual’s device, it allegedly has the capacity to access the\n\nentire stored data on the device, and has real time access to\n\nemails, texts, phone calls, as well as the camera and sound\n\nrecording capabilities of the device. Once the device is infiltrated\n\nusing Pegasus, the entire control over the device is allegedly\n\nhanded over to the Pegasus user who can then remotely control\n\nall the functionalities of the device and switch different features\n\non or off. The NSO Group purportedly sells this extremely\n\npowerful software only to certain undisclosed Governments and\n\nthe end user of its products are “exclusively government\n\nintelligence and law enforcement agencies” as per its own\n\nwebsite.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 4</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\f4.   In May 2019, the global messaging giant WhatsApp Inc.\n\nidentified a vulnerability in its software that enabled Pegasus\n\nspyware to infiltrate the devices of WhatsApp’s users. This news\n\nwas followed by a disclosure that the devices of certain Indians\n\nwere also affected, which fact was acknowledged by the then\n\nHon’ble Minister of Law and Electronics and Information\n\nTechnology in a statement made in the Parliament on 20 th\n\nNovember 2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.   On 15th June 2020, Citizen Lab, in collaboration with the\n\ninternational human rights organization, Amnesty International\n\nuncovered another spyware campaign which allegedly targeted\n\nnine individuals in India, some of whom were already suspected\n\ntargets in the first spyware attack.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.   On 18th July 2021, a consortium of nearly 17 journalistic\n\norganizations from around the world, including one Indian\n\norganization, released the results of a long investigative effort\n\nindicating the alleged use of the Pegasus software on several\n\nprivate individuals. This investigative effort was based on a list of\n\nsome 50,000 leaked numbers which were allegedly under\n\nsurveillance by clients of the NSO Group through the Pegasus\n\nsoftware. Initially, it was discovered that nearly 300 of these\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  5</span>\n\fnumbers belonged to Indians, many of whom are senior\n\njournalists, doctors, political persons, and even some Court staff.\n\nAt the time of filing of the Writ Petitions, nearly 10 Indians’\n\ndevices were allegedly forensically analyzed to confirm the\n\npresence of the Pegasus software.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.   The above reports resulted in largescale action across the\n\nglobe, with certain foreign governments even diplomatically\n\nengaging with the Israeli Government to determine the veracity of\n\nthe allegations raised, while other governments have initiated\n\nproceedings internally to determine the truth of the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">8.   Respondent­Union of India, through the Hon’ble Minister of\n\nRailways, Communications and Electronics and Information\n\nTechnology, took the stand in Parliament on 18 th July 2021,\n\nwhen asked about the alleged cyberattack and spyware use, that\n\nthe reports published had no factual basis. The Minister also\n\nstated that the Amnesty report itself indicated that the mere\n\nmention of a particular number in the list did not confirm\n\nwhether the same was infected by Pegasus or not. Further, the\n\nMinister stated that NSO had itself factually contradicted many\n\nof the claims made in the Amnesty report. Finally, he stated that\n\nthe Indian statutory and legal regime relating to surveillance and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 6</span>\n\finterception of communication is extremely rigorous, and no\n\nillegal surveillance could take place.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">9.    Some of the Writ Petitioners before this Court allege to be\n\ndirect victims of the Pegasus attack, while others are Public\n\nInterest Litigants. They raise the issue of the inaction on the part\n\nof the Respondent­Union of India to seriously consider the\n\nallegations raised, relating to the purported cyberattack on\n\ncitizens of this country. Additionally, the apprehension expressed\n\nby some Petitioners relates to the fact that, keeping in mind the\n\nNSO Group disclosure that it sold its Pegasus software only to\n\nvetted Governments, either some foreign government or certain\n\nagencies of the Respondent­Union of India are using the said\n\nsoftware on citizens of the country without following the due\n\nprocedure established under law. Therefore, to ensure credibility\n\nof   the   process,   most   of   the   Petitioners   are   seeking   an\n\nindependent investigation into the allegations.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">10. Before considering the issues at hand on merits, it is\n\nnecessary for this Court to summarize the events that transpired\n\nin the Courtroom proceedings, to give some context to the order\n\nbeing passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">11. On 10th August 2021, it was recorded by this Court that a\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    7</span>\n\fcopy of some of the petitions in this batch had been served on\n\nthe learned Solicitor General. The learned Solicitor General took\n\nan adjournment at that time to get instructions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">12. On 16th August 2021, a “limited affidavit” was placed on\n\nrecord by the learned Solicitor General that was filed by the\n\nAdditional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information\n\nTechnology, Union of India. The relevant parts of the limited\n\naffidavit filed by the Respondent­ Union of India are as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     “2. I state and submit that due to the limited time at\n     the disposal of the deponent/respondents, it is not\n     possible to deal with all the facts stated and the\n     contentions raised in the batch of petitions before\n     this Hon’ble Court. I am therefore, filing this\n     limited affidavit at this stage while reserving\n     liberty to file further affidavit hereafter in detail.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           I, however, respectfully submit that my not\n     dealing with any of the petitions para wise may not be\n     treated as my having admitted the truthfulness or\n     otherwise of any of the contents thereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     3. At the outset, it is submitted that I hereby\n     unequivocally deny any and all of the allegations made\n     against the Respondents in the captioned petition and\n     other connected petitions. A bare perusal of the\n     captioned petition and other connected petitions\n     makes it clear that the same are based on conjectures\n     and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media\n     reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material. It is\n     submitted that the same cannot be the basis for\n     invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     4. It is submitted that this question stands already\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 8</span>\n\f     clarified on the floor of the Parliament by the Hon’ble\n     Minister of Railways, Communications and Electronics\n     &amp; Information Technology of India, Government of\n     India. A copy of the statement of the Hon’ble Minister\n     is attached herewith and marked as Annexure R­1. In\n     that view of the matter, in the respectful submission of\n     the deponent, nothing further needs to be done at the\n     behest of the Petitioner, more particularly when they\n     have not made out any case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     5. It is, however, submitted that with a view to dispel\n     any wrong narrative spread by certain vested\n     interests and with an object of examining the issue\n     raised, the Union of India will constitute a\n     Committee of Experts in the field which will go in\n     to all aspects of the issue.”\n\nOn that day, we heard learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Petitioners and the learned Solicitor General at\n\nsome length and adjourned the matter for further hearing.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">13. On the next date of hearing, on 17 th August 2021, this\n\nCourt indicated to the learned Solicitor General, while issuing\n\nnotice to the Respondent­Union of India, that the limited affidavit\n\nfiled by them was insufficient for the Court to come to any\n\nconclusion regarding the stand of the Respondent­Union of India\n\nwith respect to the allegations raised by the Petitioners. As the\n\nlimited affidavit itself recorded that the detailed facts were not\n\nadverted to due to a paucity of time, we indicated to the learned\n\nSolicitor General that we were willing to give them further time to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 9</span>\n\fenable the Respondent­Union of India to file a more detailed\n\naffidavit.   The   learned   Solicitor   General   indicated   his\n\napprehension that the disclosure of certain facts might affect the\n\nnational security and defense of the nation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">14. This Court clarified at that juncture that it was not\n\ninterested in any information that may have a deleterious impact\n\non the security of the country. However, the Respondent­Union\n\nof India could still place on record facts pertaining to the events\n\nhighlighted by the Petitioners, without disclosing information\n\nadjudged to be sensitive by the relevant authorities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">15. Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\nPetitioners in Writ Petition (C) Nos. 826 and 851 of 2021, fairly\n\nstated that the Petitioners were also concerned about the\n\nnational interest and would not press for any such information.\n\nThe learned Solicitor General again took some time to seek\n\ninstructions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">16. When the matter was next listed on 07th September 2021,\n\nthe learned Solicitor General requested an adjournment, and we\n\ndirected that the matter be listed on 13th September 2021.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">17. On 13th September 2021, we were again informed by the\n\nlearned Solicitor General that placing the information sought by\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                10</span>\n\fthe Petitioners on an affidavit would be detrimental to the\n\nsecurity interests of the nation. The learned Solicitor General\n\nsubmitted that such information could not be made a matter of\n\npublic debate as the same could be used by terror groups to\n\nhamper national security. He reiterated the statement dated 18 th\n\nJuly   2021   made    by   the   Hon’ble   Minister   of   Railways,\n\nCommunications and Electronics and Information Technology on\n\nthe floor of the Parliament regarding the statutory mechanism\n\nsurrounding surveillance and interception in the country which\n\nensures that unauthorized surveillance does not take place. He\n\nfinally submitted that, to assuage the concerns of the public and\n\nto dispel any wrong narratives, considering the technical nature\n\nof the issues, the Respondent­Union of India would be willing to\n\nconstitute an Expert Committee which will go into all aspects\n\nand file a report before this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">18. Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the Petitioners in Writ Petition (C) Nos. 826 and 851 of 2021,\n\nsubmitted that the Respondent­Union of India should not act in\n\na manner that would prevent the Court from rendering justice\n\nand should not withhold information from the Court in a matter\n\nconcerning the alleged violation of fundamental rights of citizens.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 11</span>\n\fHe submitted that in the year 2019, when certain reports of\n\nPegasus hacking WhatsApp came to light, the then Hon’ble\n\nMinister of Law and Information Technology and Communication\n\nhad acknowledged the reports of hacking in Parliament, but the\n\nRespondent­Union of India had not indicated what actions were\n\ntaken subsequently, which information they could have disclosed\n\non affidavit. Learned senior counsel submitted that such inaction\n\nby the Respondent­ Union was a matter of grave concern,\n\nparticularly when reputed international organizations with no\n\nreason for bias against the nation had also accepted the fact of\n\nsuch an attack having been made. Mr. Sibal finally submitted\n\nthat an independent probe into the alleged incident required to\n\ntake place under the supervision of retired Judges of this Court,\n\nas was ordered by this Court in the Jain Hawala case. He\n\nobjected to the suggestion of the learned Solicitor General that\n\nthe Respondent­Union of India itself be allowed to form a\n\nCommittee on the ground that any Committee formed to probe\n\nthe allegations raised by the Petitioners should be completely\n\nindependent from the Respondent­Union of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">19. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Petitioner in Writ Petition (C) No. 849 of 2021 who\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               12</span>\n\fclaims to be one of the parties whose phone was directly affected\n\nby Pegasus, submitted that Pegasus enabled an entity to not only\n\nsurveil or spy on an individual, but also allowed them to implant\n\nfalse documents and evidence in a device. He relied on affidavits\n\nfiled by two experts in the field of cyber security to buttress his\n\nsubmission regarding the nature and function of the software.\n\nMr. Divan submitted that once such a largescale cyberattack and\n\nthreat had been made public and brought to the knowledge of\n\nthe Respondent­Union of India, it was the State’s responsibility\n\nto take necessary action to protect the interests and fundamental\n\nrights of the citizens, particularly when there existed the risk\n\nthat such an attack was made by a foreign entity. Mr. Divan\n\npressed for the interim relief sought in Writ Petition (C) No. 849\n\nof 2021, whereby a response was sought on affidavit from the\n\nCabinet Secretary. Mr. Divan also supported the prayer made by\n\nMr. Sibal regarding the constitution of a special Committee or\n\nSpecial Investigation Team to probe the allegations.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">20. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Petitioners in Writ Petition (C) No. 853 of 2021\n\nsubmitted that the Petitioners are senior journalists who are\n\nvictims of the Pegasus attack. He submitted that if the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                13</span>\n\fRespondent­Union of India had made a statement on affidavit\n\nthat it had not used a malware or spied on the Petitioners in an\n\nunauthorized manner, that would have been the end of the\n\nmatter. Instead, the Respondent­Union of India had not provided\n\nany information on affidavit. He therefore urged the Court to\n\nconstitute an independent Committee under its supervision\n\nrather than allowing the Respondent­Union of India to constitute\n\na Committee, as suggested by the learned Solicitor General, to\n\navoid any credibility issues. He further submitted that requiring\n\nthe Petitioners to hand over their phones to a Committee\n\nappointed by the Respondent­Union of India, when certain\n\nallegations had been raised against the Respondent­Union of\n\nIndia, would amount to a secret exercise whose results would not\n\nbe trusted by the Petitioners or the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">21. Mr. Dinesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Petitioner in Writ Petition (C) No. 848 of 2021\n\nsubmitted that his client is a respected journalist whose device\n\nhad been infected with the Pegasus malware. The main thrust of\n\nhis submission was that if any pleading was not specifically\n\ndenied, it would be deemed to have been admitted. As the\n\nRespondent­Union of India had not specifically denied the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                 14</span>\n\fPetitioner’s allegation, the same should therefore be deemed to be\n\nadmitted by the Respondent­Union of India.

Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Petitioners in Writ Petition (C) No. 909 of 2021,\n\nwherein Petitioner No. 1 is a journalist, lawyer and human rights\n\nactivist who is an affected party, while Petitioner No. 2 is a\n\nregistered society which works on the promotion and protection\n\nof digital rights and digital freedom in India, submitted that a\n\nnumber of such digital interceptions were being conducted by the\n\nStates and the Respondent­Union of India. He submitted that, in\n\nlight of the allegations raised against the Respondent­Union of\n\nIndia in the present matter, it would not be appropriate to allow\n\nthe   Respondent­Union    of   India   to   form   a   Committee   to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 15</span>\n\finvestigate the present allegations.

He submitted that\n\nthe software could be used to plant false evidence into an\n\nindividual’s device, which could then be used to implicate the\n\nsaid person. He therefore submitted that the alleged use of\n\nPegasus on the citizens of the country, was of grave concern.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">25.

At the outset, certain nuances of the right to privacy in\n\nIndia­ its facets and importance, need to be discussed.\n\nHistorically, privacy rights have been ‘property centric’ rather\n\nthan people centric. This approach was seen in both the United\n\nStates of America as well as in England. In 1604, in the historical\n\nSemayne’s case, 77 ER 194 (KB) it was famously held that\n\n“every man’s house is his castle”. This marked the beginning of\n\nthe development of the law protecting people against unlawful\n\nwarrants and searches.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">28. As William Pitt, the Earl of Chatham stated in March 1763 1:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        “The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all\n        the force of the Crown. It may be frail—its roof may\n        shake—the wind may blow through it—the storm may\n        enter, the rain may enter—but the King of England\n        cannot enter!—all his force dares not cross the\n        threshold of the ruined tenement!”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">1</span>\n Lord Brougham, Historical Sketches of Statesmen who Flourished in the Time of George III First Series,\nVol. 1 (1845).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                   17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\f29. As long back as in 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis\n\nBrandeis observed in their celebrated article ‘The Right to\n\nPrivacy’2:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        “Recent inventions and business methods call\n        attention to the next step which must be taken for the\n        protection of the person, and for securing to the\n        individual what Judge Cooley calls the right “to be let\n        alone.”…numerous mechanical devices threaten to\n        make good the prediction that “what is whispered in\n        the closet shall be proclaimed from the house­tops.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">30. However, unlike the ‘property centric’ origin of privacy\n\nrights in England and under the Fourth Amendment in the\n\nConstitution of the United States of America, in India, privacy\n\nrights may be traced to the ‘right to life’ enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution. When this Court expounded on the\n\nmeaning of “life” under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a>, it did not restrict the same in a\n\npedantic manner. An expanded meaning has been given to the\n\nright to life in India, which accepts that “life” does not refer to\n\nmere animal existence but encapsulates a certain assured\n\nquality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">31. It is in this context that we must contextualize the issues\n\nthat are being raised in this batch of petitions.

We must recognize that\n\nwhile technology is a useful tool for improving the lives of the\n\npeople, at the same time, it can also be used to breach that\n\nsacred private space of an individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">32. Members of a civilized democratic society have a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy. Privacy is not the singular concern of\n\njournalists or social activists. Every citizen of India ought to be\n\nprotected against violations of privacy. It is this expectation\n\nwhich enables us to exercise our choices, liberties, and freedom.\n\nThis Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy­9J.) v. Union of India,\n\n(2017) 10 SCC 1, has recognized that the right to privacy is as\n\nsacrosanct as human existence and is inalienable to human\n\ndignity and autonomy. This Court held that:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     “320. Privacy is a constitutionally protected right\n     which emerges primarily from the guarantee of life\n     and personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the\n     Constitution. Elements of privacy also arise in\n     varying contexts from the other facets of freedom and\n     dignity recognised and guaranteed by the fundamental\n     rights contained in Part III.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     …\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     325. Like other rights which form part of the\n     fundamental freedoms protected by Part III, including\n     the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a>,\n     privacy is not an absolute right. A law which\n     encroaches upon privacy will have to withstand the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                19</span>\n\f      touchstone    of    permissible    restrictions  on\n      fundamental rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> an\n      invasion of privacy must be justified on the basis\n      of a law which stipulates a procedure which is fair,\n      just and reasonable. The law must also be valid\n      with reference to the encroachment on life and\n      personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21.</a> An invasion of\n      life or personal liberty must meet the threefold\n      requirement of (i) legality, which postulates the\n      existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\n      legitimate State aim; and (iii) proportionality\n      which ensures a rational nexus between the objects\n      and the means adopted to achieve them.”\n                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">33. Although declared to be inalienable, the right to privacy of\n\ncourse cannot be said to be an absolute, as the Indian\n\nConstitution does not provide for such a right without reasonable\n\nrestrictions. As with all the other fundamental rights, this Court\n\ntherefore must recognize that certain limitations exist when it\n\ncomes to the right to privacy as well. However, any restrictions\n\nimposed must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">34.    In K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy­9J.) (supra), this Court\n\nconsidered the need to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nwhile furthering legitimate State interests. This Court therefore\n\ndirected the State to embark upon the exercise of balancing of\n\ncompeting interests. This Court observed as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      “310.While it intervenes to protect legitimate\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                20</span>\n\fState interests, the State must nevertheless put\ninto place a robust regime that ensures the\nfulfilment of a threefold requirement. These three\nrequirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not\njust informational privacy). They emanate from the\nprocedural and content­based mandate of Article\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">21. The first requirement that there must be a law in\nexistence to justify an encroachment on privacy is an\nexpress requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21.</a> For, no person can\nbe deprived of his life or personal liberty except in\naccordance with the procedure established by law. The\nexistence of law is an essential requirement. Second,\nthe requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate\nState aim, ensures that the nature and content of the\nlaw which imposes the restriction falls within the zone\nof reasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 14</a>, which is a\nguarantee against arbitrary State action. The pursuit\nof a legitimate State aim ensures that the law does not\nsuffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a\npostulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial review\ndoes not reappreciate or second guess the value\njudgment of the legislature but is for deciding whether\nthe aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from\npalpable or manifest arbitrariness. The third\nrequirement ensures that the means which are\nadopted by the legislature are proportional to the\nobject and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">Proportionality is an essential facet of the\nguarantee against arbitrary State action because it\nensures that the nature and quality of the\nencroachment on the right is not disproportionate\nto the purpose of the law. Hence, the threefold\nrequirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual\ninterdependence        between     the     fundamental\nguarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand\nand the protection of life and personal liberty, on\nthe other. The right to privacy, which is an\nintrinsic part of the right to life and liberty, and\nthe freedoms embodied in Part III is subject to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                          21</span>\n\f          same restraints which apply to those freedoms.”\n                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">35. The right to privacy is directly infringed when there is\n\nsurveillance or spying done on an individual, either by the State\n\nor by any external agency. Ellen Alderman and Caroline\n\nKennedy, in ‘Right to Privacy’, 3 foresaw this threat to privacy in\n\n1995, while referring to governmental eavesdropping in the\n\nUnited States of America, in the following words:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">          “Perhaps the scariest threat to privacy comes in the\n          area known as “informational privacy”. Information\n          about all of us is now collected not only by the old\n          standbys, the IRS and FBI, but also by the MTB, MIB,\n          NCOA, and NCIC, as well as credit bureaus, credit\n          unions, and credit card companies. We now have\n          cellular phones, which are different from cordless\n          phones, which are different from what we used to\n          think of as phones. We worry about e­mail, voice mail,\n          and junk mail. And something with the perky name\n          Clipper Chip ­ developed specifically to allow\n          governmental eavesdropping on coded electronic\n          communications – is apparently the biggest threat of\n          all.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">36. Of course, if done by the State, the same must be justified\n\non constitutional grounds. This Court is cognizant of the State’s\n\ninterest to ensure that life and liberty is preserved and must\n\nbalance the same. For instance, in today’s world, information\n\ngathered           by     intelligence         agencies         through      surveillance   is\n\nessential for the fight against violence and terror. To access this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">3</span>\n    Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy, THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY, 223 (1995).\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                    22</span>\n\finformation, a need may arise to interfere with the right to\n\nprivacy of an individual, provided it is carried out only when it is\n\nabsolutely necessary for protecting national security/interest and\n\nis proportional. The considerations for usage of such alleged\n\ntechnology, ought to be evidence based. In a democratic country\n\ngoverned by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals\n\ncannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by\n\nfollowing      the     procedure            established         by      law       under        the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">37. This trade­off between the right to privacy of an individual\n\nand the security interests of the State, has been recognized world\n\nover with the renowned scholar Daniel Solove4 commenting on\n\nthe same as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">       “The debate between privacy and security has been\n       framed incorrectly, with the trade­off between these\n       values understood as an all­or­nothing proposition.\n       But protecting privacy need not be fatal to security\n       measures; it merely demands oversight and\n       regulation. We can’t progress in the debate\n       between privacy and security because the debate\n       itself is flawed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">       The law suffers from related problems. It seeks to\n       balance privacy and security, but systematic problems\n       plague the way the balancing takes place….\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">4</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">  Daniel J.

We can reach a\n     better balance between privacy and security.

Somewhat allied to the concerns of privacy, is the freedom\n\nof the press. Certain observations made by this Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/223504/\" id=\"a_9\">Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Private Limited v.\n\nUnion of India</a>, (1985) 1 SCC 641 may be extracted:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     “25. The freedom of press, as one of the members of\n     the Constituent Assembly said, is one of the items\n     around which the greatest and the bitterest of\n     constitutional struggles have been waged in all\n     countries where liberal constitutions prevail. The said\n     freedom is attained at considerable sacrifice and\n     suffering and ultimately it has come to be incorporated\n     in the various written constitutions…”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82461587\" id=\"span_28\">39. It is undeniable that surveillance and the knowledge that\n\none is under the threat of being spied on can affect the way an\n\nindividual decides to exercise his or her rights. Such a scenario\n\nmight result in self­censorship. This is of particular concern\n\nwhen it relates to the freedom of the press, which is an important\n\npillar of democracy. Such chilling effect on the freedom of speech\n\nis an assault on the vital public­watchdog role of the press,\n\nwhich may undermine the ability of the press to provide accurate\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                24</span>\n\fand reliable information. Recently, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/82461587/\" id=\"a_10\">Anuradha\n\nBhasin v. Union of India</a>, (2020) 3 SCC 637, this Court\n\nhighlighted the importance of freedom of the press in a modern\n\ndemocracy in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     “159. In this context, one possible test of chilling\n     effect is comparative harm. In this framework, the\n     Court is required to see whether the impugned\n     restrictions, due to their broad­based nature, have\n     had a restrictive effect on similarly placed\n     individuals during the period. It is the contention of\n     the petitioner that she was not able to publish her\n     newspaper from 6­8­2019 to 11­10­2019. However, no\n     evidence was put forth to establish that such other\n     individuals were also restricted in publishing\n     newspapers in the area. Without such evidence having\n     been placed on record, it would be impossible to\n     distinguish a legitimate claim of chilling effect from a\n     mere emotive argument for a self­serving purpose. On\n     the other hand, the learned Solicitor General has\n     submitted that there were other newspapers which\n     were running during the aforesaid time period. In view\n     of these facts, and considering that the aforesaid\n     petitioner has now resumed publication, we do not\n     deem it fit to indulge more in the issue than to state\n     that responsible Governments are required to respect\n     the freedom of the press at all times. Journalists are\n     to be accommodated in reporting and there is no\n     justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to\n     hang over the press indefinitely.”\n                                       (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">40. An important and necessary corollary of such a right is to\n\nensure the protection of sources of information. Protection of\n\njournalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                25</span>\n\fof the press. Without such protection, sources may be deterred\n\nfrom assisting the press in informing the public on matters of\n\npublic interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">41. Having regard to the importance of the protection of\n\njournalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society\n\nand the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may\n\nhave, this Court’s task in the present matter, where certain grave\n\nallegations of infringement of the rights of the citizens of the\n\ncountry have been raised, assumes great significance. In this\n\nlight, this Court is compelled to take up the cause to determine\n\nthe truth and get to the bottom of the allegations made herein.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">42. Initially, this Court was not satisfied with the Writ Petitions\n\nthat were filed as the same were completely reliant only upon\n\ncertain newspaper reports. This Court has generally attempted to\n\ndiscourage Writ Petitions, particularly Public Interest Litigations,\n\nwhich are based entirely on newspaper reports without any\n\nadditional steps taken by the Petitioner. In this respect, it may be\n\nrelevant to quote the observations of this Court in the case of\n\nRohit Pandey v. Union of India, (2005) 13 SCC 702, which are\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     “1. …The only basis for the petitioner coming to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 26</span>\n\f     this Court are two newspaper reports dated\n     25­1­2004, and the other dated 12­2­2004. This\n     petition was immediately filed on 16­2­2004 after the\n     aforesaid second newspaper report appeared….\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     2. We expect that when such a petition is filed in\n     public interest and particularly by a member of the\n     legal profession, it would be filed with all\n     seriousness and after doing the necessary\n     homework and enquiry. If the petitioner is so public­\n     spirited at such a young age as is so professed, the\n     least one would expect is that an enquiry would be\n     made from the authorities concerned as to the nature\n     of investigation which may be going on before filing a\n     petition that the investigation be conducted by the\n     Central Bureau of Investigation. Admittedly, no such\n     measures were taken by the petitioner. There is\n     nothing in the petition as to what, in fact, prompted\n     the petitioner to approach this Court within two­three\n     days of the second publication dated 12­2­2004, in the\n     newspaper Amar Ujala. Further, the State of Uttar\n     Pradesh had filed its affidavit a year earlier i.e. on 7­\n     10­2004, placing on record the steps taken against the\n     accused persons, including the submission of the\n     charge­sheet before the appropriate court. Despite one\n     year having elapsed after the filing of the affidavit by\n     the Special Secretary to the Home Department of the\n     Government of Uttar Pradesh, nothing seems to have\n     been done by the petitioner. The petitioner has not\n     even controverted what is stated in the affidavit.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">     Ordinarily, we would have dismissed such a\n     misconceived petition with exemplary costs but\n     considering that the petitioner is a young advocate, we\n     feel that the ends of justice would be met and the\n     necessary message conveyed if a token cost of rupees\n     one thousand is imposed on the petitioner.”\n                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">43.

Such\n\nan exercise, far from helping the cause espoused by the\n\nindividual filing the petition, is often detrimental to the cause\n\nitself. This is because the Court will not have proper assistance\n\nin the matter, with the burden to even determine preliminary\n\nfacts being left to the Court. It is for this reason that trigger\n\nhappy filing of such petitions in Courts, and more particularly in\n\nthis Court which is to be the final adjudicatory body in the\n\ncountry, needs to be discouraged. This should not be taken to\n\nmean that the news agencies are not trusted by the Court, but to\n\nemphasize the role that each pillar of democracy occupies in the\n\npolity. News agencies report facts and bring to light issues which\n\nmight otherwise not be publicly known. These may then become\n\nthe basis for further action taken by an active and concerned\n\ncivil society, as well as for any subsequent filings made in\n\nCourts. But newspaper reports, in and of themselves, should not\n\nin the ordinary course be taken to be ready­made pleadings that\n\nmay be filed in Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                28</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">\f44. That said, after we indicated our reservations to the\n\nPetitioners regarding the lack of material, various other petitions\n\nhave been filed in Court, including by individuals who were\n\npurportedly victims of the alleged Pegasus spyware attack. These\n\nsubsequently filed petitions, as well as additional documents\n\nfiled by others, have brought on record certain materials that\n\ncannot be brushed aside, such as the reports of reputed\n\norganizations     like   Citizen        Lab    and   affidavits   of   experts.\n\nAdditionally, the sheer volume of cross­referenced and cross­\n\nverified reports from various reputable news organizations across\n\nthe world along with the reactions of foreign governments and\n\nlegal institutions also moved us to consider that this is a case\n\nwhere the jurisdiction of the Court may be exercised. Of course,\n\nthe learned Solicitor General suggested that many of these\n\nreports are motivated and self­serving. However, such an\n\nomnibus    oral    allegation      is    not    sufficient   to   desist   from\n\ninterference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">45. It is for this reason that this Court issued notice to the\n\nRespondent­Union of India and sought information from them.\n\nWe would like to re­emphasize what is already apparent from the\n\nrecord of proceedings. This Court gave ample opportunity to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                         29</span>\n\fRespondent­Union of India to clarify its stand regarding the\n\nallegations raised, and to provide information to assist the Court\n\nregarding the various actions taken by it over the past two years,\n\nsince the first disclosed alleged Pegasus spyware attack. We had\n\nmade it clear to the learned Solicitor General on many occasions\n\nthat we would not push the Respondent­Union of India to provide\n\nany information that may affect the national security concerns of\n\nthe country. However, despite the repeated assurances and\n\nopportunities given, ultimately the Respondent­Union of India\n\nhas placed on record what they call a “limited affidavit”, which\n\ndoes not shed any light on their stand or provide any clarity as to\n\nthe facts of the matter at hand. If the Respondent­Union of India\n\nhad made their stand clear it would have been a different\n\nsituation, and the burden on us would have been different.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_35\">46. Such a course of action taken by the Respondent­Union of\n\nIndia, especially in proceedings of the present nature which\n\ntouches upon the fundamental rights of the citizens of the\n\ncountry, cannot be accepted. As held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_11\">Ram\n\nJethmalani    v.   Union   of   India</a>,   (2011)   8   SCC   1,   the\n\nRespondent­Union of India should not take an adversarial\n\nposition when the fundamental rights of citizens are at threat.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                30</span>\n\fThis Court <a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_12\">in that case</a> observed as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     “75. In order that the right guaranteed by clause (1) of\n     <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 32</a> be meaningful, and particularly because\n     such petitions seek the protection of fundamental\n     rights, it is imperative that in such proceedings the\n     petitioners are not denied the information necessary\n     for them to properly articulate the case and be heard,\n     especially where such information is in the possession\n     of the State. To deny access to such information,\n     without citing any constitutional principle or\n     enumerated grounds of constitutional prohibition,\n     would be to thwart the right granted by clause (1) of\n     <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 32.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">     76. Further, inasmuch as, by history and tradition of\n     common law, judicial proceedings are substantively,\n     though not necessarily fully, adversarial, both\n     parties bear the responsibility of placing all the\n     relevant information, analyses, and facts before\n     this Court as completely as possible. In most\n     situations, it is the State which may have more\n     comprehensive information that is relevant to the\n     matters at hand in such proceedings...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     77. It is necessary for us to note that the burden of\n     asserting, and proving, by relevant evidence a claim\n     in judicial proceedings would ordinarily be placed\n     upon the proponent of such a claim; however, the\n     burden of protection of fundamental rights is\n     primarily the duty of the State. Consequently,\n     unless constitutional grounds exist, the State\n     may not act in a manner that hinders this Court\n     from rendering complete justice in such\n     proceedings. Withholding of information from the\n     petitioners, or seeking to cast the relevant events and\n     facts in a light favourable to the State in the context\n     of the proceedings, even though ultimately\n     detrimental to the essential task of protecting\n     fundamental rights, would be destructive to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                31</span>\n\f     guarantee in clause (1) of Article 32…\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">     78. In the task of upholding of fundamental\n     rights, the State cannot be an adversary. The\n     State has the duty, generally, to reveal all the\n     facts and information in its possession to the\n     Court, and also provide the same to the\n     petitioners. This is so, because the petitioners would\n     also then be enabled to bring to light facts and the\n     law that may be relevant for the Court in rendering\n     its decision. In proceedings such as those under\n     <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 32</a>, both the petitioner and the State, have to\n     necessarily be the eyes and ears of the Court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">     Blinding the petitioner would substantially detract\n     from the integrity of the process of judicial decision­\n     making in <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 32</a> proceedings, especially where\n     the issue is of upholding of fundamental rights.”\n                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82461587\" id=\"span_38\">47. This free flow of information from the Petitioners and the\n\nState, in a writ proceeding before the Court, is an important step\n\ntowards Governmental transparency and openness, which are\n\ncelebrated values under our Constitution, as recognized by this\n\nCourt recently in the <a href=\"/doc/82461587/\" id=\"a_17\">Anuradha Bhasin</a> (supra) judgment.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_39\">48. Of course, there may be circumstances where the State has\n\na constitutionally defensible reason for denying access to certain\n\ninformation or divulging certain information as was recognized by\n\nthis Court in the <a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_18\">Ram Jethmalani</a> (supra) case, as extracted\n\nbelow:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">     “80.   Withholding     of   information    from    the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                 32</span>\n\f     petitioners by the State, thereby constraining their\n     freedom of speech and expression before this Court,\n     may be premised only on the exceptions carved\n     out, in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19</a>, “in the interests of\n     the sovereignty and integrity of India, the\n     security of the State, friendly relations with\n     foreign States, public order, decency or morality,\n     or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or\n     incitement to an offence” or by law that\n     demarcate exceptions, provided that such a law\n     comports with the enumerated grounds in clause\n     (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19</a>, or that may be provided for\n     elsewhere in the Constitution.”\n                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">49. It is on the strength of the above exception carved out that\n\nthe Respondent­Union of India has justified its non­submission\n\nof a detailed counter affidavit, viz., by citing security concerns. It\n\nis a settled position of law that in matters pertaining to national\n\nsecurity, the scope of judicial review is limited. However, this\n\ndoes not mean that the State gets a free pass every time the\n\nspectre of “national security” is raised. National security cannot\n\nbe the bugbear that the judiciary shies away from, by virtue of its\n\nmere mentioning. Although this Court should be circumspect in\n\nencroaching upon the domain of national security, no omnibus\n\nprohibition can be called for against judicial review.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">50. Of course, the Respondent­Union of India may decline to\n\nprovide information when constitutional considerations exist,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                  33</span>\n\fsuch as those pertaining to the security of the State, or when\n\nthere is a specific immunity under a specific statute. However, it\n\nis incumbent on the State to not only specifically plead such\n\nconstitutional concern or statutory immunity but they must also\n\nprove and justify the same in Court on affidavit. The Respondent­\n\nUnion of India must necessarily plead and prove the facts which\n\nindicate that the information sought must be kept secret as their\n\ndivulgence would affect national security concerns. They must\n\njustify the stand that they take before a Court. The mere\n\ninvocation of national security by the State does not render the\n\nCourt a mute spectator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">51. In the present matter, as we have indicated above, the\n\nPetitioners have placed on record certain material that prima\n\nfacie merits consideration by this Court. There has been no\n\nspecific denial of any of the facts averred by the Petitioners by\n\nthe Respondent­Union of India. There has only been an omnibus\n\nand   vague   denial   in   the   “limited   affidavit”   filed   by   the\n\nRespondent­Union of India, which cannot be sufficient. In such\n\ncircumstances, we have no option but to accept the prima facie\n\ncase made out by the Petitioners to examine the allegations\n\nmade.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                  34</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">\f52. Different forms of surveillance and data gathering by\n\nintelligence agencies to fight terrorism, crime and corruption in\n\nnational interest and/or for national security, are accepted\n\nnorms all over the world. The Petitioners do not contend that the\n\nState should not resort to surveillance/collection of data in\n\nmatters of national security. The complaint of the Petitioners is\n\nabout the misuse or likely misuse of spyware in violation of the\n\nright to privacy of citizens. The Respondent­Union of India also\n\ndoes   not   contend     that   its    agencies     can   resort    to\n\nsurveillance/collection of data relating to its citizens where\n\nnational security and national interest are not involved. The\n\napprehension of the Respondent­Union of India is that any\n\ninquiry in this behalf should not jeopardize national security and\n\nthe steps taken by it to protect national security. There is thus a\n\nbroad consensus that unauthorized surveillance/accessing of\n\nstored data from the phones and other devices of citizens for\n\nreasons   other   than   nation’s     security    would   be   illegal,\n\nobjectionable and a matter of concern.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_66\">53. The only question that remains then is what the appropriate\n\nremedy in this case would be. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner in Writ Petition (C)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                35</span>\n\fNo. 849 of 2021 sought an interim order from this Court\n\ndirecting the Cabinet Secretary to put certain facts on an\n\naffidavit. On the other hand, most of the other senior counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the other Writ Petitioners sought an\n\nindependent   investigation   or        inquiry   into   the   allegations\n\npertaining to the use of Pegasus software either by constituting a\n\nSpecial Investigation Team headed by a retired judge or by a\n\nJudges’ Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">54. We are of the opinion that in the circumstances of the\n\npresent case, when the Respondent­Union of India has already\n\nbeen given multiple opportunities to file an affidavit on record,\n\nand looking to the conduct of the Respondent­Union of India in\n\nnot placing on record any facts through their reliance on the\n\n“national security” defense, no useful purpose would be served\n\nby issuing directions of the nature sought by Mr. Shyam Divan,\n\napart from causing a further delay in proceedings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"65295726\" id=\"span_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"5616782\" id=\"span_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_46\">55. Instead, we are inclined to pass an order appointing an\n\nExpert Committee whose functioning will be overseen by a retired\n\nJudge of the Supreme Court.

It is for reason (vi) above that we decline the Respondent­\n\nUnion of India’s plea to allow them to appoint an Expert\n\nCommittee for the purposes of investigating the allegations, as\n\nsuch a course of action would violate the settled judicial principle\n\nagainst bias, i.e., that ‘justice must not only be done, but also be\n\nseen to be done’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">58.
