The petitioner is father of one Mohd Amir Magrey who was amongst\n\nfour persons who were killed in an encounter between the Police and\n\nMilitants that took place on 15.11.2021 at Hyderpora area of District\n\nBudgam. As per the version of the respondents, Police Station Saddar\n\nreceived a written report along with seizure memo of arms/ammunitions from\n\n2 RR Army Camp, Zainkote Srinagar through HC Chain Singh to the effect\n\nthat at 5.15 P.M Army 2 RR received reliable information that some terrorists\n\nare hiding in a building within the jurisdiction of Police Station Saddar and\n\nhave planned to attack security forces. Upon said information, Army\n\ncordoned the area and started search operation to nab the terrorists. During\n\nsearch operation, the terrorists hiding in the building opened indiscriminate\n\nfiring upon the search party, which was retaliated and in the ensuing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         2</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                 WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nencounter two terrorists and their two associates were killed. Some arms and\n\nammunition was also recovered from the encounter site. On the basis of the\n\naforesaid information, Police Station Saddar registered FIR No. 193/2021\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_2\">120-B</a> IPC, 7/27 <a href=\"/doc/172687242/\" id=\"a_3\">Arms Act, 16</a>, 18, 20 ULA(P) Act and\n\nthe investigation entrusted to SDPO Saddar Srinagar. During the course of\n\ninvestigation the Investigating Officer visited the site of encounter and\n\nrecovered four bullet ridden unidentified dead bodies and the dead bodies\n\nwere shifted to Police Hospital Srinagar for medico legal formalities. After\n\nconducting postmortem etc. the dead bodies were identified as a foreign\n\nterrorist Bilal Bhai @ Hyder @ Saqlain R/O Pakistan, Aamir Latief Magrey\n\nS/O Mohammad Lateef Magrey R/O Seeripora Tehsil Gool Ramban, Altaf\n\nAhmad Bhat S/O Abdul Rehman Bhat R/O Old Barzulla Srinagar and Dr.\n\nMudasir Gull S/O Ghulam Mohammad Rather R/O Parraypora Srinagar. All\n\nthe four dead bodies were shifted to Handwara Zachaldara for burial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">2.    It is the case of the respondents that the investigation conducted later\n\non by Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by DIG CKR Srinagar has\n\ncollected sufficient evidence with regard to the active involvement of the son\n\nof the petitioner, Amir Latief Magrey in terrorist activities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">3.    It is also not in dispute that the last rites of the son of the petitioner\n\nalong with three others were performed through Auqaf Committee Wadder\n\nPayeen as per religious obligations. It also transpires from material on record\n\nthat the bodies of the two of the four persons killed in the encounter were\n\nlater on exhumed and handed over to their relatives for performing their last\n\nrites at the place of their choice. It appears that the parents of deceased Altaf\n\nAhmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul approached the Deputy Commissioner\n\nSrinagar for handing over bodies of the deceased for performing their last\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       3</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                            WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nrites. The District Magistrate Srinagar vide his communication Nos.\n\nDMS/JUD/Misc/2840-2844/2021          and    DMS/JUD/Misc/2845-2849/2021\n\ndated 18.11.2021 recommended to the District Magistrate Kupwara to\n\nconsider the request of the family members of the deceased Mohd Altaf Bhat\n\nand Dr. Mudasir Gul for handing over the dead bodies. The District\n\nMagistrate Kupwara vide his Order No. DCK/Ps/2021/232/9328-38 dated\n\n18.11.2021 directed the Superintendent of Police Handwara to arrange\n\nexhumation of the bodies after proper identification and hand over the same\n\nto their legal heirs for performing their last rites as prayed by them. In\n\ncompliance to the direction of the District Magistrate, Kupwara, the bodies of\n\nMohd Altaf Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul were exhumed and after proper\n\nidentification handed over to their legal heirs for performing last rites. The\n\nbodies of other two persons killed in the encounter i.e. Bilal Bhai, a foreign\n\nterrorist and son of the petitioner, who were buried through Auqaf\n\nCommittee Wadder Payeen along with Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir\n\nGull, were not exhumed and handed over to their legal heirs. With regard to\n\ndeceased Bilal Bhai, a resident of Pakistan, nobody owned his body nor was\n\nthere any demand for handing over of the dead body from any quarter.\n\nHowever, with regard to Amir Lateef Magrey, the petitioner claims that he\n\napproached all authorities for handing over the body of his deceased son but\n\nnobody listened to him and body of his deceased son was, without his\n\npresence, buried at Wadder Payeen graveyard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.    It is submitted by the petitioner that it was only on 16.11.2021 he was\n\ninformed by Police Station Gool that his son Amir Latief Magrey had been\n\nkilled in an encounter in Kashmir and that he should go to Kashmir to\n\nidentify the body. On 16.11.2021 the petitioner along with his family\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        4</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                             WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nmembers reached Police Station Saddar where he was told that Amir was a\n\nmilitant and was killed along with two other associates at Hyderpora and that\n\nthe dead body of Amir has been buried. The petitioner claims that he was\n\ntotally unconvinced with the respondentsâ€Ÿ claim that Amir was a militant and\n\nwas killed in an encounter and, therefore, approached the authorities for\n\nintervention.    Following relentless protests, the Jammu and Kashmir\n\nLieutenant Governor ordered probe into the matter on 18.11.2021. It is on\n\nthe same day, the petitioner claims, the dead bodies of two other persons,\n\nnamely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gull were exhumed and handed\n\nover to their families.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.    It is claimed by the petitioner that his entire family has all along\n\nremained associated with Indian Army and other security agencies and were\n\ninstrumental in elimination of militants in his area. The petitioner relies upon\n\ncertificate of commendation issued in his favour by the General Officer\n\nCommanding In Chief, Head Quarter CIF (U) C/O 56 APO dated 23.01.2006\n\nand State award for bravery for the year 2012 conferred by the State\n\nGovernment upon the petitioner for having shown exemplary courage of\n\nkilling a militant on spot who had attacked and shot dead one Abdul\n\nQayoom. The petitioner has also placed on record other citations and\n\ncommendation certificates to make good his point that the petitioner being a\n\nnationalist and loyal to army and security forces, was even deprived to have\n\nand bury the dead body of his son as per traditions, religious obligations and\n\nreligious faith, which the deceased professed during his life time. There was\n\neven deprivation of giving burial to his son in the native graveyard. It is the\n\ngrievance of the petitioner that the respondents have very conveniently put\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                          5</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                               WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nthe tag of terrorist on his son and have denied even decent burial to the dead\n\nbody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">6.      The petitioner claims to have approached Deputy Commissioner\n\nSrinagar, who was heading the magisterial enquiry as also the Lieutenant\n\nGovernor of the State for expediting the probe and handing over the dead\n\nbody of his son Amir so that he could perform his last rites as per his belief\n\nand traditions. Having faced reluctance from every quarter, the petitioner\n\ndecided to knock the doors of this Court and therefore this writ petition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">7.      In this petition, the petitioner, claiming his right to give decent burial\n\nto the dead body of his son, has prayed for a direction to the respondents to\n\nexhume and handover the body of late Amir Latief Magrey killed in an\n\nencounter with the police on 15.11.2021 at Hyderpora area of District\n\nBudgam.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.      The writ petition is resisted by the respondents. It is submitted by the\n\nrespondents that the demand of return of the dead body in the instant case is\n\nnot a demand for a dead body of an ordinary citizen killed in an action of\n\nsecurity forces but it is a dead body of a terrorist, who has been killed during\n\nencounter. If, for any reason, the return of dead body of terrorist like the son\n\nof the petitioner, is considered, not only it will send wrong message in the\n\nsociety but it would also lead to greater law and order and security concerns.\n\nIt is thus submitted that the SIT, which conducted the investigation in the\n\ninstant case, has firmly established the role of late Amir Latief Magrey in the\n\nterrorist related activities and conspiracies. Thus in terms of previous practice\n\nand procedure and also to avoid adverse effect upon law and order situation,\n\nthe respondents shifted the dead body of the son of the petitioner and three\n\nothers and buried at Wadder Payeen graveyard with all religious obligations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         6</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                              WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nperformed by Auqaf Committee in the presence of Executive Magistrate\n\nZechaldara. It is thus urged by the respondents that though they do not deny\n\nthat right to life with human dignity extends even beyond death, yet such\n\nright does not come without restrictions. It is thus contended that right of the\n\npetitioner to have the dead body of his son to accord decent burial at his\n\nnative graveyard must yield to larger public interest and the public interest\n\ndemands that the dead body of the deceased son of the petitioner, which has\n\nbeen laid to rest at Wadder payeen Graveyard, is not exhumed and handed\n\nover to the petitioner at this stage, for doing so may incite violence and create\n\nlaw and order problem. The respondents have shared certain documents with\n\nthis Court in a sealed cover, perusal whereof indicates that all the four dead\n\nbodies of the persons killed in the encounter were buried on 15.11.2021 at\n\nWadder Payeen graveyard with all religious obligations performed through\n\nAuqaf Committee of the area in presence of the Executive Magistrate\n\nZechaldara. It further comes out from the documents submitted in a sealed\n\ncover that the bodies of two, namely, Mohd Altaf Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul\n\nwere exhumed after two days on the directions of District Magistrate\n\nKupwara and handed over to their next of kin for performing burial and last\n\nrites in their own way.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">9.    From the reply of the respondents as also from the documents\n\nsubmitted in sealed cover it is not coming forth as to why the request of the\n\npetitioner for return of body of his son Amir Latief Magrey was not conceded\n\nand his body exhumed along with Mohd Altaf Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">10.   Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record, it\n\nis necessary to advert briefly to the legal position with regard to right of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                             7</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                      WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\ndeceased person to have his body cremated or buried according to the\n\nreligious belief that he professed during his life time.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"273832\" id=\"span_13\">11.   The issue has been dealt with by the Madras High Court in <a href=\"/doc/273832/\" id=\"a_4\">S. Sethu\n\nRaja v. The Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu and ors</a>, WP\n\n(MD) No. 3888/2007 decided on 28.08.2007. Relying upon the judgments of\n\nHonâ€Ÿble the Supreme Court and having regard to the right to life and liberty\n\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the Bench of Madras\n\nHigh Court in paragraph nos. 18 and 19 of the judgment held thus:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1446279\" id=\"span_14\">18.The fundamental right to life and personal liberty guaranteed\n                 under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has been given an expanded\n                 meaning by Judicial pronouncements. The right to life has been held to\n                 include the right to live with human dignity. By our tradition and\n                 culture, the same human dignity (if not more), with which a living\n                 human being is expected to be treated, should also be extended to a\n                 person who is dead. The right to accord a decent burial or cremation to\n                 the dead body of a person, should be taken to be part of the right to\n                 such human dignity. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court held in\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1446279/\" id=\"a_7\">Ram Sharan Autyanuprasi Vs. Union of India</a> (AIR 1989 Supreme\n                 Court 549) that the right to life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the\n                 Constitution would include all that gives meaning to a manâ€Ÿs life\n                 namely, his tradition, culture, heritage and protection of that heritage in\n                 its full measure. The relevant portion of the judgment of the Supreme\n                 Court in para 13 of <a href=\"/doc/1446279/\" id=\"a_9\">the said judgment</a> reads as follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                     &quot;13........It is true that life in its expanded horizons today includes\n                    all that give meaning to a man&#x27;s life including his tradition, culture\n                    and heritage and protection of that heritage in its full measure\n                    would certainly come within the encompass of an expanded concept\n                    of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Art.21</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                 19.That the right to human dignity is not restricted to a living human\n                 being but available even after death, appears to have been recognised\n                 by the Apex Court, first in a public interest litigation filed by an\n                 Advocate in 1995. An Advocate by name Pandit Parmanand Katara\n                 filed a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution in public\n                 interest challenging the method of execution of death sentence by\n                 hanging under the Punjab Jail Manual as inhuman and violative\n                 of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. He also assailed para 873 of the Jail\n                 Manual which required the body of a condemned convict to remain\n                 suspended for a period of half an hour, (after hanging) as offending the\n                 right to dignity. Though the Supreme Court rejected the challenge to\n                 the method of execution of death sentence by hanging, the contention\n                 of the petitioner in the said case regarding para 873 of the Jail Manual\n                 was upheld. While doing so, the Supreme Court held in the said case\n                 namely, Pt.Parmanand Katara Vs.

There are lot of rights which are\n                   included in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> such as right to privacy, right against solitary\n                   confinement, right to legal aid, right to speedy trial etc. The Hon&#x27;ble\n                   Supreme Court in many cases has also observed and interpreted that\n                   right to have a decent burial is also included in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the\n                   Constitution of India. The right to human dignity is not restricted to\n                   living human being but is available even after the death also.

Later in many cases, the\n                   Court held that the right to human dignity is also a right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article\n                   21</a> of the Constitution of India.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                   17. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"361011\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/361011/\" id=\"a_19\">Ashray Adhikar Abhiyan vs. Union of India</a> reported in 2002 (2)\n                   SCC 227, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that it is the obligation of the\n                   State to give a decent burial to a deceased person as per their Religious\n                   beliefs.</span> The Madras High Court in the case of S.Sethuraja vs. Chief\n                   Secretary (W.P.MD.No.3885 of 2007) delivered on 28.10.2007 has\n                   also held that in our tradition and culture, the same human dignity (if\n                   not more) with which a living human being is expected to be treated is\n                   also extended to a person who is dead.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"361011\" id=\"span_19\">13.

The parents and\n\nclose relations of the deceased are well within their right to demand the dead\n\nbody of their dear one to be cremated or buried as per their traditions,\n\nreligious obligations and religious belief. This right would also include the\n\nchoice of the relatives to have the dead body cremated or buried at his native\n\nplace.

Without dilating much on the issue, it can be said to be well settled that\n\nright to life and liberty guaranteed to a citizen by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India includes right of the citizen to live with human dignity\n\nand this right to live with human dignity even extends after death though in a\n\nlimited extent. Viewed thus, the right of the petitioner to claim the dead body\n\nof his son for performing last rites in his own way and in accordance with\n\nlocal traditions, religious obligations and religious faith, which the deceased\n\nprofessed during his life time, cannot be disputed. But the question that needs\n\nto be addressed in the context of present controversy is whether the State can\n\ndeny this right in the name of preventing law and order situation going out of\n\nhand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">17.     It is vehemently contended by the respondents that the decision not to\n\nhand over the body of the deceased to the petitioner for performing his last\n\nrites, was taken in the larger public interest and to prevent the situation of law\n\nand order going out of hand. It is submitted that respondents have witnessed\n\nsuch situations in the past and, therefore, have decided not to handover the\n\ndead bodies of the terrorists killed in encounters to their next of kin for\n\ncremation or burial to prevent the law and order situation getting worsened.\n\nThe respondents, however, have not come clear as to why the dead bodies of\n\ntwo of the four killed in the encounter, namely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr.\n\nMudasir Gul were exhumed and handed over to their relatives for their last\n\nrites in the graveyards of their choice and why the similar right claimed by\n\nthe petitioner was denied. The respondents have tried to draw distinction by\n\nsubmitting that as per the investigation conducted by the SIT, the deceased\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                          11</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nson of the petitioner was a confirmed terrorist whereas the other two killed,\n\nnamely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul were only associates of the\n\nterrorists. I do not find any logic or sense in distinction so made by the\n\nrespondents. It transpires that due to public pressure and demand by the\n\nrelatives of the two deceased namely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir\n\nGul, the respondents relented and permitted their dead bodies to be exhumed\n\nand handed over to their relatives. Since the petitioner was a resident of Gool,\n\na remote village in Jammu Province and did not much say in the Valley and,\n\ntherefore, his request was arbitrarily turned down. The action of the\n\nrespondents is not traceable to any procedure established by law which is\n\njust, fair and equitable. At least none was brought to the notice of this Court.\n\nThe decision of the respondents not to allow the petitioner to take away dead\n\nbody of his son to his native village for last rites was per-se arbitrary and falls\n\nfoul of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">18.   Much has been said by the respondents with regard to the status of the\n\nbody lying buried since 15.11.2021. While it cannot be disputed that the body\n\nof Amir Latief Magrey buried on 15.11.2021 in Wadder Payeen Graveyard\n\nmay have putrefied by now but that alone cannot be a reason not to handover\n\nthe remains of the dead body to the petitioner who is clamoring at the top of\n\nhis voice to get even the remains of the dead body of his son so that he could\n\nbury him in his native graveyard in the presence of relatives and after\n\nfollowing all religious obligations. The apprehension of law and order getting\n\nvitiated at this point of time also appears to be illusory. When the\n\nrespondents could maintain the law and order situation when the dead bodies\n\nof two, namely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul were exhumed and\n\nhanded over to their relatives for last rites on 18.11.2021, it is not difficult for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                        12</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                             WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nthe respondents to make necessary arrangements for exhumation of the dead\n\nbody of Amir Latief Magrey, the son of the petitioner and transport the same\n\nin proper escort to Village Thatharka Seripora Tehsil Gool District Ramban.\n\nThe respondents can make appropriate arrangements to ensure that law and\n\norder situation does not get vitiated in any manner. The petitioner, as is\n\nfervently contended by his counsel, is even ready to undertake that he will\n\nabide by all the terms and conditions that may be imposed by the respondents\n\nwith regard to exhumation, transportation and according of burial to the dead\n\nbody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">19.     For the foregoing reasons, I am inclined to allow this petition of the\n\nfather of the deceased Amir Latief Magrey and direct the respondents to\n\nmake arrangements for exhumation of the body/remains of the deceased\n\nAmir Latief Magrey from the Wadder Payeen graveyard in presence of the\n\npetitioner. The respondents shall also make appropriate arrangement for\n\ntransportation of the dead body to the village of the petitioner for according\n\nburial in his native graveyard in accordance with the traditions, religious\n\nobligations and religious faith which the deceased professed during his life\n\ntime provided it is in deliverable state. The respondents are free to impose\n\nany reasonable terms and conditions in respect of exhumation, transportation\n\nand burial of the dead body of Amir Latief Magrey, the son of the petitioner.\n\nSince the dead body of the deceased must be in advance stage of putrefaction,\n\nas such, it would be desirable that the respondents act with promptitude and\n\ndo not waste any further time. However, if the body is highly putrefied and is\n\nnot in deliverable state or is likely to pose risk to public health and hygiene,\n\nthe petitioner and his close relatives shall be allowed to perform last rites as\n\nper their tradition and religious belief in the Wadder Payeen graveyard itself.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                          13</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                WP(C ) No. 11/2022</span>\n\n\nIn that situation, the State shall pay to the petitioner a compensation of Rs. 5\n\nlakhs for deprivation of his right to have the dead body of his son and give\n\nhim decent burial as per family traditions, religious obligations and faith\n\nwhich the deceased professed when he was alive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">                                                     (SANJEEV KUMAR)\n                                                             JUDGE\nSRINAGAR:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">27.05.2022\nAnil Raina, Addl.
