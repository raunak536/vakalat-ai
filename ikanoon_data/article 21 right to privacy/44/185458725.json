Thus, the pivotal purpose of the said writ is to see that no one\n            is deprived of his/her liberty without sanction of law. It is the\n            primary duty of the State to see that the said right is not sullied in\n            any manner whatsoever and its sanctity is not affected by any kind\n            of subterfuge. The role of the Court is to see that the detenue is\n            produced before it, find out about his/her independent choice and\n            see to it that the person is released from illegal restraint. The issue\n            will be a different one when the detention is not illegal. What is\n            seminal is to remember that the song of liberty is sung with sincerity\n            and the choice of an individual is appositely respected and\n            conferred its esteemed status as the Constitution guarantees. It is so\n            as the expression of choice is a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_22\">Articles 19</a>\n            and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">21</a> of the Constitution, if the said choice does not transgress any\n            valid legal framework. Once that aspect is clear, the enquiry and\n            determination have to come to an end.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_46\">            28. In the instant case, the High Court, as is noticeable from the\n            impugned verdict, has been erroneously guided by some kind of\n            social phenomenon that was frescoed before it. The writ court has\n            taken exception to the marriage of Respondent 9 herein with the\n            appellant. It felt perturbed. As we see, there was nothing to be taken\n            exception to. Initially, Hadiya had declined to go with her father\n            and expressed her desire to stay with Respondent 7 before the High\n            Court and in the first writ it had so directed. The adamantine\n            attitude of the father, possibly impelled by obsessive parental love,\n            compelled him to knock at the doors of the High Court in another\n            habeas corpus petition whereupon the High Court directed the\n            production of Hadiya who appeared on the given date along with\n            the appellant herein whom the High Court calls a stranger. But\n            Hadiya would insist that she had entered into marriage with him.\n            True it is, she had gone with Respondent 7 before the High Court\n            but that does not mean and can never mean that she, as a major,\n                                 9 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -10-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            could not enter into a marital relationship. But, the High Court\n            unwarrantably took exception to the same forgetting that parental\n            love or concern cannot be allowed to fluster the right of choice of\n            an adult in choosing a man to whom she gets married. And, that is\n            where the error has crept in. The High Court should have, after an\n            interaction as regards her choice, directed that she was free to go\n            where she wished to.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">            29. The High Court further erred by reflecting upon the social\n            radicalisation and certain other aspects. In a writ of habeas corpus,\n            especially in the instant case, it was absolutely unnecessary. If there\n            was any criminality in any sphere, it is for the law-enforcing agency\n            to do the needful but as long as the detenue has not been booked\n            under law to justify the detention which is under challenge, the\n            obligation of the Court is to exercise the celebrated writ that\n            breathes life into our constitutional guarantee of freedom. The\n            approach of the High Court on the said score is wholly fallacious.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_48\">            30.      The High Court has been swayed away by the strategy, as it\n            thought, adopted by Respondent 7 before it in connivance with the\n            present appellant and others to move Hadiya out of the country.\n            That is not within the ambit of the writ of habeas corpus. The future\n            activity, if any, is required to be governed and controlled by the\n            State in accordance with law. The apprehension was not within the\n            arena of jurisdiction regard being had to the lis before it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">            52.      It is obligatory to state here that expression of choice in\n            accord with law is acceptance of individual identity. Curtailment of\n            that expression and the ultimate action emanating therefrom on the\n            conceptual structuralism of obeisance to the societal will destroy\n            the individualistic entity of a person. The social values and morals\n            have their space but they are not above the constitutionally\n            guaranteed freedom. The said freedom is both a constitutional and a\n            human right. Deprivation of that freedom which is ingrained in\n            choice on the plea of faith is impermissible. Faith of a person is\n            intrinsic to his/her meaningful existence. To have the freedom of\n            faith is essential to his/her autonomy; and it strengthens the core\n            norms of the Constitution. Choosing a faith is the substratum of\n            individuality and sans it, the right of choice becomes a shadow. It\n\n                                10 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                               Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">CRWP-4660-2021                    -11-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            has to be remembered that the realisation of a right is more\n            important than the conferment of the right. Such actualisation\n            indeed ostracises any kind of societal notoriety and keeps at bay the\n            patriarchal supremacy. It is so because the individualistic faith and\n            expression of choice are fundamental for the fructification of the\n            right. Thus, we would like to call it indispensable preliminary\n            condition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">            53. Non-acceptance of her choice would simply mean creating\n            discomfort to the constitutional right by a constitutional court which\n            is meant to be the protector of fundamental rights. Such a situation\n            cannot remotely be conceived. The duty of the court is to uphold the\n            right and not to abridge the sphere of the right unless there is a\n            valid authority of law. Sans lawful sanction, the centripodal value of\n            liberty should allow an individual to write his/her script.

Over the last four decades, our constitutional jurisprudence\n                 has recognised the inseparable relationship between protection of\n                 life and liberty with dignity. Dignity as a constitutional value finds\n                 expression in the Preamble. The constitutional vision seeks the\n                 realisation of justice (social, economic and political); liberty (of\n                 thought, expression, belief, faith and worship); equality (as a\n                 guarantee (2017) 10 SCC 1 against arbitrary treatment of\n                 individuals) and fraternity (which assures a life of dignity to every\n                 individual). These constitutional precepts exist in unity to facilitate\n                 a humane and compassionate society. The individual is the focal\n                 point of the Constitution because it is in the realisation of\n                 individual rights that the collective well-being of the community is\n                 determined. Human dignity is an integral part of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">                 Reflections of dignity are found in the guarantee against\n                 arbitrariness (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 14</a>), the lamps of freedom (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19</a>) and in\n                 the right to life and personal liberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a>).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">                                      xxx xxxx xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">                 119. To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of the\n                 Constitution defined their vision of the society in which\n                 constitutional values would be attained by emphasising, among\n                 other freedoms, liberty and dignity. So fundamental is dignity that\n                 it permeates the core of the rights guaranteed to the individual by\n                 Part III. Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights\n                 because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual\n                 the dignity of existence...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_64\">                                      xxx xxx xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">                     298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity.\n                 Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an\n                 intrinsic   value,       human     dignity   is   an   entitlement   or   a\n\n                                  13 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">CRWP-4660-2021                        -14-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n                 constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet,\n                 dignity and freedom are inseparably inter-twined, each being a\n                 facilitative tool to achieve the other. The ability of the individual to\n                 protect a zone of privacy enables the realization of the full value of\n                 life and liberty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">                 Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is a subset. All\n                 liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled\n                 only within a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain\n                 the autonomy of the body and mind. The autonomy of the individual\n                 is the ability to make decisions on vital matters of concern to life.\n                 Privacy has not been couched as an independent fundamental\n                 right. But that does not detract from the constitutional protection\n                 afforded to it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship\n                 with those fundamental rights which are expressly protected is\n                 understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected\n                 freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against\n                 arbitrary state action. It prevents the state from discriminating\n                 between individuals. The destruction by the state of a sanctified\n                 personal space whether of the body or of the mind is violative of the\n                 guarantee against arbitrary state action. Privacy of the body\n                 entitles an individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of\n                 personhood. The intersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity and\n                 privacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought, the freedom to\n                 believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-determination\n                                xxx           xxx          xxx\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">                 525. But most important of all is the cardinal value of fraternity\n                 which assures the dignity of the individual. The dignity of the\n                 individual encompasses the right of the individual to develop to the\n                 full extent of his potential. And this development can only be if an\n                 individual has autonomy over fundamental personal choices and\n                 control over dissemination of personal information which may be\n                 infringed through an unauthorized use of such information. It is\n                 clear that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a>, more than any of the other Articles in the\n                 fundamental rights chapter, reflects each of these constitutional\n                 values in full, and is to be read in consonance with these values\n                 and with the international covenants that we have referred to. In\n                 the ultimate analysis, the fundamental right of privacy, which has\n\n                                 14 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                 Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">CRWP-4660-2021                      -15-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n                  so many developing facets, can only be developed on a case to case\n                  basis. Depending upon the particular facet that is relied upon,\n                  either Article 21by itself or in conjunction with other fundamental\n                  rights would get attracted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">            x        x      x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">            48. From the aforesaid analysis, it is discernible that the Court, with\n            the passage of time, has recognized the conceptual equality of woman\n            and the essential dignity which a woman is entitled to have. There can\n            be no curtailment of the same. But, <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 497</a> IPC effectively does\n            the same by creating invidious distinctions based on gender\n            stereotypes which creates a dent in the individual dignity of women.\n            Besides, the emphasis on the element of connivance or consent of the\n            husband tantamounts to subordination of women. Therefore, we have\n            no hesitation in holding that the same offends <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the\n            Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">            49.      Another aspect needs to be addressed. The question we intend to\n            pose is whether adultery should be treated as a criminal offence. Even\n            assuming that the new definition of adultery encapsules within its\n            scope sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman or a widow,\n            adultery is basically associated with the institution of marriage. There\n            is no denial of the fact that marriage is treated as a social institution\n            and regard being had to various aspects that social history has\n            witnessed in this country, the Parliament has always made efforts to\n            maintain the rights of women. For instance, <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 498-A</a> IPC deals\n            with husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\n            cruelty. The Parliament has also brought in the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_36\">Protection of Women\n            from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</a>. This enactment protects women. It\n            also enters into the matrimonial sphere. The offences under the\n            provisions of the said enactment are different from the provision that\n            has been conceived of under <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 497</a> IPC or, for that matter,\n            concerning bringing of adultery within the net of a criminal offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">            50.      There can be no shadow of doubt that adultery can be a ground\n            for any kind of civil wrong including dissolution of marriage. But the\n            pivotal question is whether it should be treated as a criminal offence.\n            When we say so, it is not to be understood that there can be any kind of\n            social licence that destroys the matrimonial home. It is an ideal\n            condition when the wife and husband maintain their loyalty. We are\n            not commenting on any kind of ideal situation but, in fact, focusing on\n\n                                 15 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -16-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            whether the act of adultery should be treated as a criminal offence. In\n            this context, we are reminded of what Edmund Burke, a famous\n            thinker, had said, ―a good legislation should be fit and equitable so\n            that it can have a right to command obedience. Burke would like to put\n            it in two compartments, namely, &quot;equity&quot; and &quot;utility&quot;. If the principle\n            of Burke is properly understood, it conveys that laws and legislations\n            are necessary to serve and promote a good life.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">            57.      We have referred to the aforesaid theories and authorities to\n            understand whether adultery that enters into the matrimonial realm\n            should be treated as a criminal offence. There can be many a situation\n            and we do not intend to get into the same. Suffice it to say, it is\n            different from an offence committed under Section 498-A or any\n            violation of the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_38\">Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,\n            2005</a> or, for that matter, the protection conceived of under <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\n            125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure or Sections 306 or 304B or\n            494 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_40\">IPC</a>. These offences are meant to sub-serve various other purposes\n            relating to a matrimonial relationship and extinction of life of a\n            married woman during subsistence of marriage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">            58.      Treating adultery an offence, we are disposed to think, would\n            tantamount to the State entering into a real private realm. Under the\n            existing provision, the husband is treated as an aggrieved person and\n            the wife is ignored as a victim. Presently, the provision is reflective of\n            a tripartite labyrinth. A situation may be conceived of where equality\n            of status and the right to file a case may be conferred on the wife. In\n            either situation, the whole scenario is extremely private. It stands in\n            contradistinction to the demand for dowry, domestic violence, sending\n            someone to jail for non-grant of maintenance or filing a complaint for\n            second marriage. Adultery stands on a different footing from the\n            aforesaid offences. We are absolutely conscious that the Parliament\n            has the law making power. We make it very clear that we are not\n            making law or legislating but only stating that a particular act, i.e.,\n            adultery does not fit into the concept of a crime. We may repeat at the\n            cost of repetition that if it is treated as a crime, there would be\n            immense intrusion into the extreme privacy of the matrimonial sphere.\n            It is better to be left as a ground for divorce. For any other purpose as\n            the Parliament has perceived or may, at any time, perceive, to treat it\n            as a criminal offence will offend the two facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n                                16 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -17-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            Constitution, namely, dignity of husband and wife, as the case may be,\n            and the privacy attached to a relationship between the two.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">            59.      Let it be clearly stated, by no stretch of imagination, one can\n            say, that Section 498-A or any other provision, as mentioned\n            hereinbefore, also enters into the private realm of matrimonial\n            relationship. In case of the said offences, there is no third party\n            involved. It is the husband and his relatives. There has been correct\n            imposition by law not to demand dowry or to treat women with cruelty\n            so as to compel her to commit suicide. The said activities deserve to be\n            punished and the law has rightly provided so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">            63.      In case of adultery, the law expects the parties to remain loyal\n            and maintain fidelity throughout and also makes the adulterer the\n            culprit. This expectation by law is a command which gets into the core\n            of privacy. That apart, it is a discriminatory command and also a\n            socio-moral one. Two individuals may part on the said ground but to\n            attach criminality to the same is inapposite.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">            64. We may also usefully note here that adultery as a crime is no more\n            prevalent in People&#x27;s Republic of China, Japan, Australia, Brazil and\n            many western European countries. The diversity of culture in those\n            countries can be judicially taken note of. Non-criminalisation of\n            adultery, apart from what we have stated hereinabove, can be proved\n            from certain other facets. When the parties to a marriage lose their\n            moral commitment of the relationship, it creates a dent in the marriage\n            and it will depend upon the parties how they deal with the situation.\n            Some may exonerate and live together and some may seek divorce. It is\n            absolutely a matter of privacy at its pinnacle. The theories of\n            punishment, whether deterrent or reformative, would not save the\n            situation. A punishment is unlikely to establish commitment, if\n            punishment is meted out to either of them or a third party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">            65.      Adultery, in certain situations, may not be the cause of an\n            unhappy marriage. It can be the result. It is difficult to conceive of\n            such situations in absolute terms. The issue that requires to be\n            determined is whether the said &quot;act&quot; should be made a criminal\n            offence especially when on certain occasions, it can be the cause and\n            in certain situations, it can be the result. If the act is treated as an\n            offence and punishment is provided, it would tantamount to punishing\n            people who are unhappy in marital relationships and any law that\n                                17 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -18-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            would make adultery a crime would have to punish indiscriminately\n            both the persons whose marriages have been broken down as well as\n            those persons whose marriages are not. A law punishing adultery as a\n            crime cannot make distinction between these two types of marriages. It\n            is bound to become a law which would fall within the sphere of\n            manifest arbitrariness.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">            &quot;x       x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">            98.      International trends worldwide also indicate that very few\n            nations continue to treat adultery as a crime, though most nations\n            retain adultery for the purposes of divorce laws. Thus, adultery\n            continues to be a criminal offence in Afghanistan, Bangladesh,\n            Indonesia, Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, United Arab\n            Emirates, some states of the United States of America, Algeria,\n            Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Morocco, and some parts of\n            Nigeria. On the other hand, a number of jurisdictions have done away\n            with adultery as a crime. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, Japan,\n            Brazil, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland, the Netherlands, Denmark,\n            France, Germany, Austria, the Republic of Ireland, Barbados,\n            Bermuda, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Seychelles etc. are some of\n            the jurisdictions in which it has been done away with. In South Korea\n            and Guatemala, provisions similar to Section 497 have been struck\n            down by the constitutional courts of those nations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_57\">106.

Over the last four decades, our constitutional jurisprudence\n                has recognised the inseparable relationship between protection of\n                life and liberty with dignity. Dignity as a constitutional value finds\n                expression in the Preamble. The constitutional vision seeks the\n                realisation of justice (social, economic and political); liberty (of\n                thought, expression, belief, faith and worship); equality (as a\n                guarantee against arbitrary treatment of individuals) and fraternity\n                (which assures a life of dignity to every individual). These\n                constitutional precepts exist in unity to facilitate a humane and\n                compassionate society. The individual is the focal point of the\n                Constitution because it is in the realisation of individual rights that\n                the collective well-being of the community is determined. Human\n                                18 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                              Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">CRWP-4660-2021                    -19-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n              dignity is an integral part of the Constitution. Reflections of dignity\n              are found in the guarantee against arbitrariness (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 14</a>), the\n              lamps of freedom (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 19</a>) and in the right to life and personal\n              liberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21</a>).&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">              xxx xxx xxx\n              &quot;298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity.\n              Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic\n              value, human dignity is an entitlement or a constitutionally\n              protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and\n              freedom are inseparably intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to\n              achieve the other. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of\n              privacy enables the realisation of the full value of life and liberty.\n              Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is a subset. All\n              liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled\n              only within a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain\n              the autonomy of the body and mind. The autonomy of the individual\n              is the ability to make decisions on vital matters of concern to life.\n              Privacy has not been couched as an independent fundamental right.\n              But that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded\n              to it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with those\n              fundamental rights which are expressly protected is understood.\n              Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected freedoms. The\n              guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary State action.\n              It prevents the State from discriminating between individuals. The\n              destruction by the State of a sanctified personal space whether of the\n              body or of the mind is violative of the guarantee against arbitrary\n              State action. Privacy of the body entitles an individual to the\n              integrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The intersection\n              between one&#x27;s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to\n              freedom of thought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the\n              freedom of self-determination. When these guarantees intersect with\n              gender, they create a private space which protects all those elements\n              which are crucial to gender identity. The family, marriage,\n              procreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of\n              the individual. Above all, the privacy of the individual recognises an\n              inviolable right to determine how freedom shall be exercised. An\n              individual may perceive that the best form of expression is to remain\n              silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An artist finds\n\n                               19 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                             Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">CRWP-4660-2021                    -20-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n              reflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the\n              outcome of a process of thought. A musician contemplates upon\n              notes which musically lead to silence. The silence, which lies within,\n              reflects on the ability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas or\n              interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood. The\n              freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is\n              entitled to decide upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction\n              with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have a choice of\n              preferences on various facets of life including what and how one will\n              eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad\n              other matters on which autonomy and self-determination require a\n              choice to be made within the privacy of the mind. The constitutional\n              right to the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 25</a> has implicit within\n              it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not\n              express those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of\n              the manner in which privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to\n              the exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not contain a separate\n              article telling us that privacy has been declared to be a fundamental\n              right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with an alpha-\n              suffixed right to privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting.\n              Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the\n              inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution\n              has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of\n              the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the\n              spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a\n              zone of choice and self-determination.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">              xxx xxx xxx\n              &quot;482. Shri Sundaram has argued that rights have to be traced\n              directly to those expressly stated in the fundamental rights chapter\n              of the Constitution for such rights to receive protection, and privacy\n              is not one of them. It will be noticed that the dignity of the individual\n              is a cardinal value, which is expressed in the Preamble to the\n              Constitution. Such dignity is not expressly stated as a right in the\n              fundamental rights chapter, but has been read into the right to life\n              and personal liberty.

As will be pointed out later\n              in this judgment, a Constitution has to be read in such a way that\n              words deliver up principles that are to be followed and if this is kept\n              in mind, it is clear that the concept of privacy is contained not\n              merely in personal liberty, but also in the dignity of the individual.&quot;\n              xxx xxx xxx\n              &quot;525.

In addition, the provision at\n            Issue also restricts the right to privacy protected under <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 17</a> of\n            the Constitution in that it restricts activities arising out of sexual life\n            belonging to the intimate private domain.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">                     The Court used the test of least restrictiveness, and began by\n            acknowledging that there no longer existed public consensus on the\n            criminalization of adultery, with the societal structure having changed\n            from holding traditional family values and a typeset role of family\n            members to sexual views driven by liberal thought and individualism.\n            While recognizing that marital infidelity is immoral and unethical, the\n            Court stated that love and sexual life were intimate concerns, and they\n            should not be made subject to criminal law. Commenting on the\n            balance between an individual&#x27;s sexual autonomy vis-a-vis societal\n            morality, the Court remarked:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">            &quot;...the society is changing into one where the private interest of sexual\n            autonomy is put before the social interest of sexual morality and\n            families from the perspective of dignity and happiness of individuals.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">                     Next, the Court analysed the appropriateness and effectiveness\n            of criminal punishment in curbing the offence of adultery. Addressing\n            the question of whether adultery should be regulated, the Court stated\n            that modern criminal law dictated that the State should not seek to\n            interfere in an act that is not socially harmful or deleterious to legal\n            interests, simply because it is repugnant to morality. Moreover, it held\n            that the State had no business in seeking to control an individual&#x27;s\n            actions which were within the sphere of his or her constitutionally\n            protected rights of privacy and self-determination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">            148. Addressing the concern that an abolition of a penal\n            consequence would result in &quot;chaos in sexual morality&quot; or an increase\n            of divorce due to adultery, the Court concluded that there was no data\n            at all to support these claims in countries where adultery is repealed,\n                                23 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -24-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            stating:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                     &quot;Rather, the degree of social condemnation for adultery has\n                been reduced due to the social trend to value the right to sexual self-\n                determination and the changed recognition on sex, despite of the\n                punishment of adultery. Accordingly, it is hard to anticipate a\n                general and special deterrence effect for adultery from the\n                perspective of criminal policy as it loses the function of regulating\n                behaviour.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">            The Court also analysed the argument that adultery provisions\n            protected women:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                &quot;It is true that the existence of adultery crimes in the past Korean\n                society served to protect women. Women were socially and\n                economically underprivileged, and acts of adultery were mainly\n                committed by men. Therefore, the existence of an adultery crime\n                acted as psychological deterrence for men, and, furthermore,\n                enabled female spouses to receive payment of compensation for grief\n                or divided assets from the male spouse on the condition of\n                cancelling the adultery accusation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                However, the changes of our society diluted the justification of\n                criminal punishment of adultery. Above all, as women&#x27;s earning\n                power and economic capabilities have improved with more active\n                social and economic activities, the premise that women are the\n                economically disadvantaged does not apply to all married couples.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">                     Finally, the Court concluded its analysis by holding that the\n            interests of enforcing monogamy, protecting marriage and promoting\n            marital fidelity, balanced against the interference of the State in the\n            rights to privacy and sexual autonomy were clearly excessive and\n            therefore failed the test of least restrictiveness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">            168. The hypothesis which forms the basis of the law on adultery is\n            the subsistence of a patriarchal order. Section 497 is based on a notion\n            of morality which fails to accord with the values on which the\n            Constitution is founded. The freedoms which the Constitution\n            guarantees inhere in men and women alike. In enacting Section 497,\n            the legislature made an ostensible effort to protect the institution of\n            marriage. &#x27;Ostensible&#x27; it is, because the provision postulates a notion\n            of marriage which subverts the equality of spouses. Marriage in a\n            constitutional regime is founded on the equality of and between\n                                24 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                             Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">CRWP-4660-2021                   -25-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            spouses. Each of them is entitled to the same liberty which Part III\n            guarantees. Each of them is entitled to take decisions in accordance\n            with his and her conscience and each must have the ability to pursue\n            the human desire for fulfilment. Section 497 is based on the\n            understanding that marriage submerges the identity of the woman. It is\n            based on a notion of marital subordination. In recognising, accepting\n            and enforcing these notions, Section 497 is inconsistent with the ethos\n            of the Constitution. treats a woman as but a possession of her spouse.\n            The essential values on which the Constitution is founded - liberty,\n            dignity and equality - cannot allow such a view of marriage. Section\n            497 suffers from manifest arbitrariness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">            169. While engrafting the provision into Chapter XX of the Penal\n            Code - &quot;of offences relating to marriage&quot; - the legislature has based\n            the offence on an implicit assumption about marriage. The notion\n            which the law propounds and to which it imposes the sanctions of\n            penal law is that the marital tie subordinates the role and position of\n            the woman. In that view of marriage, the woman is bereft of the ability\n            to decide, to make choices and give free expression to her personality.\n            Human sexuality is an essential aspect of identity. Choices in matters\n            of sexuality are reflective of the human desire for expression. Sexuality\n            cannot be construed purely as a physiological attribute. In its\n            associational attributes, it links up with the human desire to be\n            intimate with a person of one&#x27;s choice. Sharing of physical intimacies\n            is a reflection of choice. In allowing individuals to make those choices\n            in a consensual sphere, the Constitution acknowledges that even in the\n            most private of zones, the individual must have the ability to make\n            essential decisions. Sexuality cannot be dis-associated from the human\n            personality. For, to be human involves the ability to fulfil sexual\n            desires in the pursuit of happiness. Autonomy in matters of sexuality is\n            thus intrinsic to a dignified human existence. Human dignity both\n            recognises and protects the autonomy of the individual in making\n            sexual choices. The sexual choices of an individual cannot obviously\n            be imposed on others in society and are premised on a voluntary\n            acceptance by consenting parties. Section 497 denudes the woman of\n            the ability to make these fundamental choices, in postulating that it is\n            only the man in a marital relationship who can consent to his spouse\n            having sexual intercourse with another. Section 497 disregards the\n            sexual autonomy which every woman possesses as a necessary\n\n                              25 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                               Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">CRWP-4660-2021                    -26-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            condition of her existence. Far from being an equal partner in an\n            equal relationship, she is subjugated entirely to the will of her spouse.\n            The provision is proffered by the legislature as an effort to protect the\n            institution of marriage. But it proceeds on a notion of marriage which\n            is one sided and which denies agency to the woman in a marital tie.\n            The ability to make choices within marriage and on every aspect\n            concerning it is a facet of human liberty and dignity which the\n            Constitution protects. In depriving the woman of that ability and\n            recognising it in the man alone, Section 497 fails to meet the essence\n            of substantive equality in its application to marriage. Equality of rights\n            and entitlements between parties to a marriage is crucial to preserve\n            the values of the Constitution. Section 497 offends that substantive\n            sense of equality and is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 14.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">            x        x    x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">            181. Underlying Section 497 is a gender stereotype that the infidelity\n            of men is normal, but that of a woman is impermissible. In condemning\n            the sexual agency of the woman, only the husband, as the &#x27;aggrieved&#x27;\n            party is given the right to initiate prosecution. The proceedings once\n            initiated, would be geared against the person who committed an act of\n            &#x27;theft&#x27; or &#x27;trespass&#x27; upon his spouse. Sexual relations by a man with\n            another man&#x27;s wife is therefore considered as theft of the husband&#x27;s\n            property. Ensuring a man&#x27;s control over the sexuality of his wife was\n            the true purpose of Section 497.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">            182. Implicit in seeking to privilege the fidelity of women in a\n            marriage, is the assumption that a woman contracts away her sexual\n            agency when entering a marriage. That a woman, by marriage,\n            consents in advance to sexual relations with her husband or to refrain\n            from sexual relations outside marriage without the permission of her\n            husband is offensive to liberty and dignity. Such a notion has no place\n            in the constitutional order. Sexual autonomy constitutes an inviolable\n            core of the dignity of every individual. At the heart of the constitutional\n            rights guaranteed to every individual is a primacy of choice and the\n            freedom to determine one&#x27;s actions. Curtailing the sexual autonomy of\n            a woman or presuming the lack of consent once she enters a marriage\n            is antithetical to constitutional values.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">            x        x    x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">            186. Section 497 rests on and perpetuates stereotypes about women\n            and sexual fidelity.

It perpetuates the notion that\n            a woman is passive and incapable of exercising sexual freedom. In\n            doing so, it offers her &#x27;protection&#x27; from prosecution. Section 497\n            denudes a woman of her sexual autonomy in making its free exercise\n            conditional on the consent of her spouse. In doing so, it perpetuates\n            the notion that a woman consents to a limited autonomy on entering\n            marriage. The provision is grounded in and has a deep social effect on\n            how society perceives the sexual agency of women. In reinforcing the\n            patriarchal structure which demands her controlled sexuality, Section\n            497 purports to serve as a provision envisaged for the protection of the\n            sanctity of marriage. In the context of a constitutional vision\n            characterized by the struggle to break through the shackles of gender\n            stereotypes and guarantee an equal citizenship, Section 497 entrenches\n            stereotypes and existing structures of discrimination and has no place\n            in a constitutional order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">            x        x    x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">            192. The right to privacy depends on the exercise of autonomy and\n            agency by individuals. In situations where citizens are disabled from\n            exercising these essential attributes, Courts must step in to ensure that\n            dignity is realised in the fullest sense.

Control over women&#x27;s sexuality is the key patriarchal\n            assumption that underlies family and marriage. When it shifts to the\n            &#x27;public&#x27; as opposed to the &#x27;private&#x27;, the misogyny becomes even more\n            pronounced. Section 497 embodies this. By the operation of the\n            provision, women&#x27;s sexuality is sought to be controlled in a number of\n            ways. First, the husband and he alone is enabled to prosecute the man\n            with whom his wife has sexual relations. Even in cases where the\n            relationship is based on the consent of the woman, the law treats it as\n            an offence, denying a woman who has voluntarily entered into a\n            consensual relationship of her sexual agency. Second, such a\n            relationship would be beyond the reach of penal law if her husband\n            consents to it. The second condition is a telling reflection of the\n            patriarchal assumption underlying the criminal provision: that the\n            husband is the owner of the wife&#x27;s sexual agency.</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">\n\n                               27 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -28-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n            x        x     x       x\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">            202.

Control over sexuality attaches to the human\n            element in each individual.

There is a fundamental reason which militates against\n            criminalization of adultery. Its genesis lies in the fact that\n            criminalizing an act is not a valid constitutional response to a sexual\n            relationship outside the fold of marriage. Adultery in the course of a\n            subsisting marital relationship may, and very often does question the\n            commitment of the spouse to the relationship. In many cases, a sexual\n            relationship of one of the spouses outside of the marriage may lead to\n            the end of the marital relationship. But in other cases, such a\n            relationship may not be the cause but the consequence of a pre-\n            existing disruption of the marital tie. All too often, spouses who have\n            drifted apart irrevocably may be compelled for reasons personal to\n            them to continue with the veneer of a marriage which has ended for all\n            intents and purposes. The interminably long delay of the law in the\n            resolution of matrimonial conflicts is an aspect which cannot be\n            ignored. The realities of human existence are too complex to place\n            them in closed categories of right and wrong and to subject all that is\n            considered wrong with the sanctions of penal law. Just as all conduct\n            which is not criminal may not necessarily be ethically just, all conduct\n            which is inappropriate does not justify being elevated to a criminal\n            wrongdoing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">            x        x     x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">            218. This Court has recognised sexual privacy as a natural right,\n            protected under the Constitution. To shackle the sexual freedom of a\n            woman and allow the criminalization of consensual relationships is a\n            denial of this right. Section 497 denudes a married woman of her\n            agency and identity, employing the force of law to preserve a\n            patriarchal conception of marriage which is at odds with\n            constitutional morality:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                &quot;Infidelity was born on the day that natural flows of sexual desire\n                were bound into the legal and formal permanence of marriage; in\n                the process of ensuring male control over progeny and property,\n                women were chained within the fetters of fidelity.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">            Constitutional protections and freedoms permeate every aspect of a\n            citizen&#x27;s life - the delineation of private or public spheres become\n            irrelevant as far as the enforcement of constitutional rights is\n            concerned. Therefore, even the intimate personal sphere of marital\n            relations is not exempt from constitutional scrutiny. The enforcement\n            of forced female fidelity by curtailing sexual autonomy is an affront to\n\n                                29 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:34 :::</span>\n                                 Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">CRWP-4660-2021                      -30-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n             the fundamental right to dignity and equality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">             219.

Being\n             antithetical to the constitutional guarantees of liberty, dignity and\n             equality, Section 497 does not pass constitutional muster.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">             x       x      x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">             278.

The right to privacy and personal\n             liberty is, however, not an absolute one; it is subject to reasonable\n             restrictions when legitimate public interest is involved. It is true that\n             the boundaries of personal liberty are difficult to be identified in black\n             and white; however, such liberty must accommodate public interest.\n             The freedom to have a consensual sexual relationship outside\n             marriage by a married person, does not warrant protection under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 21.&quot;</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">17.

Moreover, though thereins it has been stated that adultery may\n\nbe a ground for any kind of civil wrong including dissolution of marriage,\n\nbut yet to treat adultery, as an offence but would tantamount to the State\n\nentering into a real private realm, inasmuch as, therebys the command of\n\nlaw, to the marital partners to remain loyal and to throughout maintain\n\nfidelity, wherebys the adulterers are made culprits, rather becomes declared\n\nto be making ill-intrusions to the core of privacy, besides becomes declared\n\nto be a discriminatory command, and, also only a socio-moral one.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">20.          While further dwelling upon <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 497</a> IPC, the Apex Court\n\nin the verdict (supra) has declared that to make adultery punishable would\n\ntantamount to punishing the people who are unhappy in a marital\n\nrelationship, and, therebys would lead to punishments being made both in\n\nrespect of those marital couples whose marriages have been broken down as\n\nwell as qua those persons whose marriages are not broken down.

The expressions of\n\nfreedom are distinct to every individual and such expressions of freedom are\n\nsacrosanctly endeared constitutional values. Therefore, if freedom of a\n\nmarried man or a married woman is expressed through either one or both\n\noutside the respective valid marriages, rather entering into a live-in\n\nrelationship, therebys the said live-in relationship partakes the rubric of well\n\nexpressions qua the right to sexual autonomy rather therethrough becoming\n\nechoed, besides therebys the constitutionally granted right to privacy also\n\nbecoming enlivened.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">22.          The Apex Court also while addressing that though on abolition\n\nof any penal consequence may result in &quot;chaos in sexual morality&quot; or an\n\nincrease in divorce petitions arising from adultery becoming filed, but the\n\nCourt concluded that there was no data at all to support these claims in\n\ncountries where adultery is repealed, while stating-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">             &quot;Rather, the degree of social condemnation for adultery has\n\n             been reduced due to the social trend to value the right to sexual\n\n             self-determination and the changed recognition on sex, despite\n\n             of the punishment of adultery. Accordingly, it is hard to\n\n             anticipate a general and special deterrence effect for adultery\n\n             from the perspective of criminal policy as it loses the function\n\n             of regulating behaviour.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">23.

While\n            there can be no doubt that in India, marriage is an important social\n            institution, we must also keep our minds open to the fact that there\n            are certain individuals or groups who do not hold the same view. To\n            be sure, there are some indigenous groups within our country\n            wherein sexual relations outside the marital setting are accepted as\n            a normal occurrence. Even in the societal mainstream, there are a\n            significant number of people who see nothing wrong in engaging in\n            premarital sex. Notions of social morality are inherently subjective\n            and the criminal law cannot be used as a means to unduly interfere\n            with the domain of personal autonomy. Morality and Criminality\n            are not co-extensive.&quot;</p><pre id=\"pre_7\">\n\n            (2)      Nandakumar and another versus State of Karala and others\n            (2018) 16 Supreme Court Cases 602\n            x        x     x       x\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\">            10.

A marriage can be dissolved at the behest of parties to it, by a\n            competent court of law. Marital status is conferred through\n            legislation or, as the case may be, custom. Deprivation of marital\n            status is a matter of serious import and must be strictly in\n            accordance with law. The High Court in the exercise of its\n            jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 226</a> ought not to have embarked on the\n            course of annulling the marriage. The Constitution recognises the\n            liberty and autonomy which inheres in each individual. This\n            includes the ability to take decisions on aspects which define one&#x27;s\n            personhood and identity. The choice of a partner whether within or\n            outside marriage lies within the exclusive domain of each\n            individual. Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy,\n            which is inviolable. The absolute right of an individual to choose a\n            life partner is not in the least affected by matters of faith. The\n            Constitution guarantees to each individual the right freely to\n            practise, profess and propagate religion. Choices of faith and belief\n            as indeed choices in matters of marriage lie within an area where\n            individual autonomy is supreme. The law prescribes conditions for\n            a valid marriage. It provides remedies when relationships run\n            aground. Neither the State nor the law can dictate a choice of\n            partners or limit the free ability of every person to decide on these\n            matters. They form the essence of personal liberty under the\n            Constitution. In deciding whether Shafin Jahan is a fit person for\n            Hadiya to marry, the High Court has entered into prohibited\n            terrain. Our choices are respected because they are ours. Social\n            approval for intimate personal decisions is not the basis for\n            recognising them. Indeed, the Constitution protects personal liberty\n            from disapproving audiences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">            x        x      x       x\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_182\">            86.      The right to marry a person of one&#x27;s choice is integral to\n            <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The Constitution guarantees the\n            right to life. This right cannot be taken away except through a\n\n                                 42 of 50\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">           ::: Downloaded on - 21-09-2024 16:32:35 :::</span>\n                                Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:118245-DB\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">CRWP-4660-2021                     -43-</span>\nCRWP-149-2024 &amp;\nLPA-968-2021 (O&amp;M)\n\n\n             law which is substantively and procedurally fair, just and\n             reasonable. Intrinsic to the liberty which the Constitution\n             guarantees as a fundamental right is the ability of each\n             individual to take decisions on matters central to the pursuit of\n             happiness. Matters of belief and faith, including whether to\n             believe are at the core of constitutional liberty. The\n             Constitution exists for believers as well as for agnostics. The\n             Constitution protects the ability of each individual to pursue a\n             way of life or faith to which she or he seeks to adhere. Matters\n             of dress and of food, of ideas and ideologies, of love and\n             partnership are within the central aspects of identity. The law\n             may regulate (subject to constitutional compliance) the\n             conditions of a valid marriage, as it may regulate the situations\n             in which a marital tie can be ended or annulled. These\n             remedies are available to parties to a marriage for it is they\n             who decide best on whether they should accept each other into\n             a marital tie or continue in that relationship.

The Court is thus required to ensure protection of a\n             minor/child as per the different statutes while also ensuring the\n             safety and security of such person. The aim and object of the\n             provisions enshrined under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_114\">Juvenile Justice (Care and\n             Protection of Children) Act</a> 2015 and <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_115\">Protection of Children from\n             Sexual Offences Act</a> 2012 is intended to protect the person of a\n             minor from being subjected to any such act, which is deemed penal\n             by law. <a href=\"/doc/76168618/\" id=\"a_116\">The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act,1956</a> declares\n             the guardian of a minor Hindu and their duties, obligations viz-a-viz\n             the minor.

Protection of life and liberty guaranteed to a\n             citizen necessarily ensures that the Court of law, when approached,\n             would step into the shoes as a guardian of such minor and take all\n             such steps as are essential to protect the life and liberty of such a\n             minor.

The said Acts are intended to ensure\n            advancement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 21.</a> The Court of law, while issuing any\n            directions to follow the procedure provided for under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_123\">Juvenile\n            Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act</a> 2015, does so with an\n            object to ensure safety and protection of a minor, who the law does\n            not recognise as having acquired the wisdom and knowledge to take\n            best decisions for himself/herself. The decision so taken by the\n            competent authority with respect to the minor as per the procedure\n            prescribed in law, cannot be deemed as violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 21</a> of the\n            Constitution of India with on a ground that such a decision will not\n            be in conformity with the interest which such a minor conceives to\n            be in his/her best interest. The Court cannot be oblivious to the duty\n            cast upon it as a repository of the best interest of the minor and\n            there can be no presumption that once a minor conveys his/her\n            desire to stay with any person and that such person claims to be the\n            next friend/de facto guardian, the same would actually and in\n            reality be in furtherance of the best interest of the minor.\n            Determination of what would be in the best interest of the minor has\n            to be done by the Court as per the procedure known to law. 25. The\n            Court, thus, has to take upon itself the responsibility to ensure that\n            the fundamental right of such a minor to claim protection of his/her\n            life and liberty is made available and also to ensure that in the said\n            process, the protection of the statute is not violated.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167835442\" id=\"span_151\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125463920\" id=\"span_152\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84518623\" id=\"span_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"65294096\" id=\"span_154\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"67631048\" id=\"span_155\">41.

A minor in a live-in relationship with an adult or where the live-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_205\">in relationship is partnered only by minors, thereby the concerned cannot\n\nseek the protection from Courts of law. The reason for making the said\n\nconclusion becomes firmly embedded in the factum, that a minor belonging\n\nto any religious denomination, thus is incompetent to contract. If so, he/she\n\nhas no capacity even to make choices or to express his/her freedom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">Contrarily the freedom to make choices by the minors are ably fettered, by\n\nthe statutes respectively nomenclatured as <a href=\"/doc/76168618/\" id=\"a_130\">The Hindu Minority and\n\nGuardianship Act, 1956</a>, and, as nomenclatured as <a href=\"/doc/1874830/\" id=\"a_131\">Guardians and Wards\n\nAct, 1890</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">43.          Furthermore, in respect of religious communities other than the\n\nHindus, the Indian Majority Act, thus prescribing the age of majority,\n\ntherebys becomes the regimen wherebys, there is a bar against a minor\n\nentering into a contract. The effect thereof, is that, the said disability\n\nencumbered upon a minor belonging to a religious denomination other than\n\nthe Hindus, thus therebys also concomitantly preempting the minor from\n\nmaking any choices, disability whereof also covers the makings of ill\n\nchoices qua the entering into a live-in relationship either with a minor or\n\nwith an adult.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">44.          If protection is provided to minor partners, who are in a live-in\n\nrelationship where only one of them is a minor, or where both are minors,\n\ntherebys the granting of the espoused protection, rather would run counter,\n\nvis-a-vis, well statutory crampings of discretions of a minor. Moreover\n\ntherebys this Court would be avoiding to perform its duty as a parens\n\npatriae towards the minors wherebys rather this Court is required to be\n\nensuring the welfare of the minor concerned.
