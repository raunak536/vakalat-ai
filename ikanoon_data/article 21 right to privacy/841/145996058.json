The appellants, Delhi Nagrik Sehkari Bank Ltd. and Nav Jeevan\nCooperative Bank Ltd. submitted that the information sought by the original RTI\napplicant regarding Inspection Report(s) for the years 2017 to 2021 are not the\ninformation/ document which can be provided under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">RTI Act,\n2005</a>. It is a privilege document and without written permission from RBI, the\nsame cannot be provided to any Third party. The appellant further submitted that\nthe respondent has dismissed the First Appeal on merits and without providing\nopportunity of personal hearing to the appellant. The Appellant strongly believes\nthat Respondent(s) have arbitrarily and without considering the relevant laws\nallowed the application of the applicant. The appellant bank further submitted\nthat the respondent did not consider the materials on record as referred in relevant\nparas of the First Appeal which clearly shows the lackadaisical approach of\nRespondent(s)in implementing the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.     The appellant, UCO Bank submitted that providing the inspection report\nof the Bank might hamper the Bank&#x27;s competitive position and would cause\nprejudice to Bank&#x27;s commercial interest, hence, the disclosure thereof was\nexempted under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_4\">section 8 (1) (d)</a> of the RTI Act. The appellant bank further\ncontended that RAR and Inspection Report contained third party/customer\ninformation, held by the bank in fiduciary capacity and disclosure of information\nto the RTI applicant might jeopardize the banker-customer relation and might\namount to infringement of their fiduciary relation hence the same was exempted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_5\">section 8 (1) (e)</a> &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">RTI Act</a>.

The appellant, Laxmi Vilas Bank Ltd. submitted that the order of the FAA\nand CPIO are erroneous in law, which resulted in miscarriage of justice. The\nLearned FAA and CPIO has failed to analyze the nature of the case and facts\ninvolved in the case and ill motive of the applicant. The Learned FAA &amp; CPIO\nfailed to note that M/s. Strategic Credit Capital Pvt. Ltd, M/s. Participation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                         Page 3 of 16</span>\n Finance and Holdings (India) and M/s Loancore services solutions Pvt.

Meanwhile,\nappellant has received various threatening mails from various persons including\nfrom the applicant related company i.e. M/s&#x27;Emppel&#x27;. The various\ncommunications received from them clearly establish the ill motives of the\napplicant to put the bank under pressure to extract huge money. Hence, bank has\nlodged criminal complaint against them with the commissioner of police, Chennai\nand also private complaint before the Metropolitan Magistrate court, Egmore,\nChennai. The cases filed against the bank and filed by the bank are subjudice in\nthe respective court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_3\">10. The appellant, HDFC Bank Ltd. submitted that the CPIO without\nappreciating the contentions / objections raised by the Appellant and rights of the\nAppellant, its customers and employees, passed an unreasoned and non speaking\ndecision and communicated its intent to disclose the details of the said Reports\nby the impugned Order. Pertinently, the CPIO did not deal with any objection\nraised by the Appellant in its reply with respect to <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> Notice and hence,\nthe decision arrived by the CPIO was issued in gross transgression of the\nprinciples of natural justice. He, further, submitted that while the Ld. FAA had\nrelied upon the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s Judgment in Transferred Case <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_8\">No.91 of\n2015 Reserve Bank of India V. Jayantilal N.

Thus, the issue pertaining to\ndisclosure of inspection reports under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI Act</a> was sub-judice before the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the said Writ Petition filed by several banks.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">11. The appellants, YES Bank and Indian Bank referred the reply provided by\nCPIO and order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO, RBI and FAA\nhad violated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to the Appellant Bank before passing their decisions in the matter. No\nreasons were given for not offering personal hearing in the first appeal. The\ncounsel for the appellant prayed before the Commission that the FAA orders in\nthe above mentioned cases should be set-aside for want of reasons. He further\nsubmitted that the information related to the bank as a whole should not be\ndisclosed to the RTI applicant.

Aggrieved with the same, the bank\nfiled a first appeal, but the FAA has also dismissed their appeal. He also submitted\nthat their bank had filed a Miscellaneous Application vide M.A. No. 1046/2020\nin the T.C. No. 91/2015 (RBI vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry) and vide order dated\n28.04.2021, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has dismissed all the M.As on the ground\nof maintainability, with the liberty to pursue other remedies available. Subsequent\nto the above developments, on 25.06.2021, their bank has filed a Writ Petition\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, seeking quashing of the similar dismissal\norders passed by the FAA of the RBI in respect of objections of the Bank under\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_11\">section 11</a> of the RTI Act and further prayer to direct the RBI, not to disclose\nwithout concurrence of Banks, any information/ data collected by RBI in course\nof inspections, audit or specific directions in exercise of its powers as regulator\nof Banks, including information about customers, management of the banks,\nbusiness plans, trade secrets, risk ratings and other regulatory information and\nunpublished price sensitive information. the said Writ Petition has been registered\nand numbered as W.

The representative for the appellant Bank i.e. Bank of Baroda submitted\nthat providing the Inspection Reports made by the RBI post completing the\ninspection of commercial banks and NBFCs/HFCs might hamper the Bank&#x27;s\ncompetitive position and would cause prejudice to Bank&#x27;s commercial interest,\nhence, the disclosure thereof was exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_12\">section 8 (1) (d)</a> of the RTI\nAct. The appellant bank further contended that Inspection Report contained third\nparty/customer information, held by the bank in fiduciary capacity and disclosure\nof information to the RTI applicant might jeopardize the banker-customer relation\nand might amount to infringement of their fiduciary relation hence the same was\nexempted under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_13\">section 8 (1) (e)</a> &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_14\">RTI Act</a>.

The Supreme Court had\nissued notice in the matter and tagged the matter along with the concerned writ\npetitions. They further stated that since the matter was pending before the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court and other banks had preferred similar writ petitions (tagged), the\nmatter was sub-judice and order if any passed by the Hon&#x27;ble CIC, there may be\nan irreparable injury to the appellant bank.

The Commission, after hearing the submissions of the parties and after\nperusal of records, observes that the original applicants has sought detail of\nInspection Reports made by Reserve Bank post completing the inspection, inter\nalia, pertaining to Union Bank of India i.e. appellant herein and 13 other banks\n(as mentioned in RTI Application) from the year as mentioned in the above RTI\napplications. The CPIO, Reserve Bank of India issued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 11(1)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_30\">11(3)</a> to the respecting banks mentioned above intending to disclose the\ninformation. Aggrieved by the decision of the CPIO, the said banks had filed first\nappeals with the First Appellate Authority. The FAA had also dismissed the first\nappeals of the banks summarily. Being aggrieved with the order of the FAA,\nbanks had filed second appeals before this Commission.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_10\">18. The Commission observes that the RTI applicants had insisted for\ndisclosure of information as per <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_31\">Jayantilal N. Mistry</a>&#x27;s case. The Appellant Banks\ncontested that the information sought as a whole is exempted from disclosure\nunder <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 8 (1) (b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_33\">8(1)(d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_34\">8(1)(e)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_35\">8 (1) (h)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_36\">8(1) (j)</a>of the RTI Act and\nthat the CPIO/FAA has not passed any reasoned order settling their objections\nnor gave any opportunity of hearing to them.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">19. The Commission further observes that the CPIO while issuing notice under\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Banks to file their\nobjections, if any, against disclosure of Inspection Reports/Audit Reports, etc. but\nhas not found it necessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While not doing\nso, the CPIO has not passed any reasoned order covering his deliberations on their\nobjections, his understanding of law or jurisprudence in deciding specific\nobjections, in favor of disclosure or redaction etc. Orders passed by the CPIO in\nall the cases are cryptic, almost identical without any reference to objections\nraised by the Banks which are definitely not identical. Similarly, the FAA instead\nof passing a speaking order has also given cryptic, almost identical orders to the\nappellant banks. The CPIO and the FAA are expected to apply their mind before\nissuing the order of intent of disclosing the information. Further, no opportunity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                         Page 8 of 16</span>\n of personal hearing was given to the appellant nor speaking order have been\npassed by FAA for not giving opportunity of hearing or elaborating reasons for\naccepting /not accepting their objections in his decisions in these appeals. The\nCommission is of the view that every objection should be dealt and\nrejected/accepted with a reason and reasons for not giving opportunity of personal\nhearing should be well reasoned too in view of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">20. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicants has to\nbe adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institution, various\njudicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts providing\nguidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should generally be provided\nand orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise if denied or not given be\nreasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, order by CPIO should\nenumerate the principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of inspection reports or\npart thereof which may include personal information, commercially sensitive\ninformation of clients or institution and hence specifically excluded disclosures\nunder various Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">21. In light of the above observations and considering all the facts and\ncircumstances of the above mentioned cases, the Commission is of the view that\ncontour of the arguments are identical as held in the Full Bench judgment of this\nHon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors. vide\norder dated 05.05.2022. It has been observed that there are minor variations in\nthe matters in hand when compared with the matters already decided by the\nCommission as above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_12\">22.

Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make it\nclear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right to\ninformation are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has held that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks may be allowed taking into account the\ncircumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a blanket manner.\nThe Commission advised the CPIO to consider taking the relevant references\nfrom the said order while deciding the above mentioned cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_13\">23. Further, the Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct\nof the CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due\ncare has to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                         Page 9 of 16</span>\n reasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and later\nin the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be required\nto adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of the\nCommission afresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take view\non various objections filed by the Appellant and submissions made by applicant\nto reach the decision in favor or against on case to case basis. He has to factor the\nobservation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_40\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case, Commission&#x27;s\njudgment dated 05.05.2022 and other relevant judgments, some of which have\nbeen referred in this order as well. Hence, with these observations the order\npassed by the CPIO and FAA in these matters is set aside and the case is being\nremanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh in line with the Commission full\nbench decision passed in file nos. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated\n05.05.2022.
