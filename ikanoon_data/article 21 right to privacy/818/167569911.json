The factual matrix of the case, in brief, is that\n\n        the State authorities, while granting sand sairats on\n\n        lease to different lessees by making public auctions for\n\n        different periods, are allowing the lessees to operate the\n\n        lease in violation of the terms and conditions of the lease\n\n        deed executed between the parties. Though the lease\n\n        conditions stipulate that the lessee has to operate the\n\n        mining manually as far as practicable, but the lessees\n                                  // 3 //\n\n\nare using the machinery in a mechanized manner for\n\nextraction of sand from the sand sairats, which is a great\n\nconcern in the present writ petition.           There is also\n\nunorganized movement of vehicles transporting the sand\n\nin the school and habitable areas in day time. Similarly,\n\nuncontrolled extraction of sand from the leasehold areas\n\nin a mechanized manner is not only causing threat to\n\nthe environment but also causing threat to the river\n\nembankment      affecting   larger     public   interest.    The\n\npetitioner has received information that the lessees, who\n\nhave been allotted with sand sairats by the Tahasildars\n\nof the various Tahasils, are utilizing the machines to\n\nextract sand in their leasehold areas. That itself\n\ncontravenes the conditions stipulated in the lease deed\n\nexecuted between the parties. Aggrieved by such action,\n\nthough the petitioner approached the authorities on\n\nseveral occasions, no action was taken, for which the\n\npetitioner has filed this writ petition in the nature of\n\npublic   interest   litigation    alleging   inaction   of   the\n\nauthorities and also bringing to the notice of this Court\n\nthe violation of conditions stipulated in sand sairat lease\n\ndeeds by the lessees. The lessees, while extracting sand,\n                            // 4 //\n\n\nare violating the conditions stipulated by the Pollution\n\nControl   Board,   more    particularly,   the   provisions\n\ncontained under Section 25 of the Air (PCP) Act, 1981.\n\nInaction on the part of the authorities has occasioned\n\nrampant mis-utilization of the source and it so happened\n\nthat the lessees are extracting more than the quantum\n\nallotted in their favour causing huge loss to the State\n\nexchequer. Earlier, one public interest litigation bearing\n\nWP(C) No. 35452 of 2022 had been filed and vide order\n\ndated 22.11.2022 this Court directed for consideration of\n\nthe representation, but no action was taken by the\n\nopposite parties to curb such sand mafias. As a result\n\nthereof, such sand lessees are causing pollution to the\n\nenvironment and acting contrary to the provisions of law\n\nby extracting sand more than the quantity to be\n\nextracted in a mechanized manner, by which also they\n\nare causing loss of revenue to the State. Though sand\n\nsairats are leased out to augment revenue for the State\n\nto be utilized for the development of the public, such\n\nsairats having been mis-utilized, the State&#x27;s revenue is\n\nbeing siphoned to the so called land mafias causing\n\nhardship to the general public, due to uncontrolled\n                              // 5 //\n\n\nextraction of sand and movement of sand carrying\n\nvehicles as per their sweet will. Hence, this writ petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">3.         Mr. S.K. Dalai, learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe petitioner vehemently contended that in the State of\n\nOdisha auction of the sand queries, selection of lessees\n\nand extraction of sand in mechanized manner are all\n\nbeing done detrimental to the interest of the public at\n\nlarge. Consequentially, he prays for interference of this\n\nCourt to make a uniform policy to be applicable to all the\n\nsand sairat holders of the State so that pilferage of sand\n\nby the lessees can be prevented and extraction of sand\n\nmore than the quantity allotted can be avoided.\n\n\n3.1        It is further contended that the movement of\n\nvehicles carrying sand during the school hour as well as\n\noffice hour at day time, is causing immense difficulties\n\nfor the general public. The same should be prevented\n\nand the lessees should not be allowed to have extraction\n\nof sand and movement thereof during day time, when\n\ntraffic is in force. Apart from the same, it is further\n\ncontended that there is no dispute that the State should\n\nutilize all its larges for the public, but that should be\n                              // 6 //\n\n\ndone in the manner it is required to be done in\n\naccordance with law. But, without following the same, if\n\nany larges of the State is utilized detrimental to the\n\ninterest of the public, the same should be curbed down.\n\nAttention of the Court has been drawn to the situation of\n\nCuttack Town, so far as sand sairats of Kathajodi and\n\nMahanadi are concerned. Though some instances are\n\nplaced on record, it is contended that similar state of\n\naffairs is going on throughout the State. Therefore,\n\nstringent action has been sought for as against the\n\nerring officials, who are indulged in such type of\n\nactivities   and   not   discharging   the   responsibilities\n\nassigned to them, and also against the lessees, who are\n\nviolating or exceeding the conditions of lease, so that\n\nthey   can    be   handled   with   care   and   no   further\n\nmishandling of sources can be done by any of the\n\nlessees. It is further contended that unless those lessees\n\nare dealt with very strong hands, the sources cannot be\n\npreserved for the future generation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.           Mr. Ashok Parija, learned Advocate General\n\nappearing for the State-opposite parties contended that\n                            // 7 //\n\n\nconsidering the gravity of the situation and looking at\n\nthe policy framed by the Ministry of Forest and\n\nEnvironment of the Union of India and the consequential\n\nguidelines issued thereof, the Government has framed a\n\nfresh guidelines on 21.12.2023 and the same has been\n\nplaced on record for consideration. He contended that\n\nadhering to the fresh policy, if leases are granted, then\n\nthe grievance of the petitioner can be redressed. The\n\nGovernment is now very much serious about the issue\n\nrelating pilferage of sand by the lessees who are\n\nextracting beyond the permissible limit. Therefore, the\n\nState has also decided to take necessary steps against\n\nthe lessees, who are not adhering to the terms and\n\nconditions of the lease deed. However, so far as\n\nprotection of the environment is concerned, it is also\n\ncontended that the Environment Department will take\n\ncare of the issue and necessary statutory permission has\n\nto be obtained by the lessees. The Government will also\n\nlook into the issue, if any of the lessees contravenes the\n\nconditions of environmental clearance, and deal him/her\n\nin accordance with law. Thereby, it is contended that\n\nsince a new policy has to be formulated for the entire\n                            // 8 //\n\n\nState   and   even   though   said   policy   will   apply\n\nprospectively, but the lessees, who are already in\n\noperation and their term has not been over, will also be\n\nintimated about the said policy, so that they will adhere\n\nto the terms and conditions mentioned therein in\n\naddition to the terms and conditions already existed in\n\nthe lease deed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\n4.1       It is also further contended that if any of the\n\nlessees contravenes any of the conditions stipulated in\n\nthe lease deed or in the policy of the Government, then,\n\nit shall be open to the petitioner to approach the\n\nappropriate forum alleging violation of such condition(s)\n\nby the lessee, so that the law will take its own course\n\nand the violator can be dealt with in accordance with\n\nlaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.        Mr. H.S. Mishra, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor opposite party no. 17 vehemently contended that the\n\npetitioner has no locus standi to file this writ petition\n\nmaking bald allegations. Learned counsel also drew our\n\nattention to the prayer made in the writ petition and\n\ncontended that the relief, which has been sought by the\n                            // 9 //\n\n\npetitioner, is no more subsisting after the new policy has\n\nbeen formulated, therefore, the writ petition has to be\n\ndismissed in limini by imposing cost. It is further\n\ncontended that if the petitioner has got any grievance as\n\nagainst any of the lessees, he has other remedies\n\navailable instead of filing the present public interest\n\nlitigation before this Court. In any case, since the\n\nGovernment has formulated a new policy and new\n\nguidelines, certainly the same will be adhered to by the\n\nlessees and any contravention thereof will be taken care\n\nof by the authorities in accordance with law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">6.        Mr. Sanjay Das-2, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the opposite parties no. 18 and 19 also accepted the\n\nargument advanced by Mr. H.S. Mishra, learned counsel\n\nfor opposite party no.17, and contended that whatever\n\nprinciple will be laid down by this Court in the present\n\nproceeding that will be adhered to and in case of any\n\nviolation that may be dealt with in accordance with law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.        Mr. S.P. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for opposite party no.20 also accepted the\n\ncontention advanced by Mr. H.S. Mishra, learned\n                                 // 10 //\n\n\ncounsel   appearing       for   opposite   party   no.17,    and\n\ncontended that law provides that if there will be\n\ncontravention of any of the conditions by the lessee, the\n\nsame is to be dealt with in conformity with the provisions\n\nof law. If the Government framed a new policy, that will\n\nbe adhered to by all the lessees. Meaning thereby, the\n\nlessees will definitely adhere to such conditions and in\n\nthe event of any contravention thereof, action will be\n\ntaken in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">8.          Mr.    P.K.     Mohapatra,      learned    counsel\n\nappearing    for   the    intervener   contended      that   the\n\nintervener has filed an application for intervention since\n\nhe is a public spirited person and supports the case of\n\nthe present petitioner. Even though intervention petition\n\nhas not been allowed, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nintervener has been given opportunity of hearing in this\n\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">9.

On   being   noticed,   all   the   parties   have\n\nappeared. It is made clear that since this Court raised\n\nconcern over the mechanized manner of extracting sand\n\nfrom the river bed, on 06.12.2023, Special Secretary to\n\nthe Government in Steel &amp; Mines Department directed\n\nall the Collectors to be vigilant and monitor regularly to\n\ncurb illegal sand mining from river bed and see that the\n\nsame shall be in consonance with the Odisha Sand\n\nPolicy, 2021, which was issued by the Revenue &amp;\n\nDisaster Management Department vide resolution No.\n\n26723 dated 02.09.2021. Thereafter, a meeting regarding\n                           // 12 //\n\n\nthe sand mining guidelines and policy was convened, on\n\n18.12.2023, under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary,\n\nGovernment of Odisha. In the said meeting a decision\n\nwas   taken   to   formulate   revised   guidelines   in\n\nsupersession of the existing guidelines of Revenue &amp;\n\nDisaster Management Department for implementation of\n\nthe Odisha Sand Policy, 2021. Another meeting was held\n\non 19.12.2023 under the chairmanship of Addl. Chief\n\nSecretary to Government, Steel and Mines Department to\n\nimplement the decisions taken in the meeting held on\n\n18.12.2023. Since the amended sand policy had not\n\nbeen effectively implemented at various places in the\n\nState, it was decided that revised guidelines may be\n\nissued to provide a procedural framework and modality\n\nfor the implementation of the components of Odisha\n\nSand Policy, 2021. The said guidelines are in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of Sustainable Sand Management\n\nGuidelines, 2016; the Enforcement and Monitoring\n\nGuidelines for Sand Mining, 2020 and directives issued\n\nby the National Green Tribunal from time to time as well\n\nas the judgment of the apex Court relating to sand\n\nmining. The said revised guidelines were put up for\n                            // 13 //\n\n\napproval of the Minister, Steel &amp; Mines Department on\n\n21.12.2023 and the same was approved and published\n\non 21.12.2023. Therefore, revised guidelines has been\n\nissued on 21.12.2023 in order to implement the sand\n\npolicy, which was existing since 2021, and further to\n\nregulate sand mining activities for the betterment of the\n\npublic at large and, as such, it is in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of law. The same has also been issued by way\n\nof resolution dated 21.12.2023, wherein the entire\n\nmechanism has been prescribed. Under Clause-4(g)\n\nthereof, it has been prescribed that quarry operation\n\nshall be carried out strictly in accordance with the\n\napproved mining plan duly adhering to the provisions of\n\nOdisha Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2016 and\n\nterms and conditions of respective statutory clearances\n\nand approvals. The mining plan shall be prepared by\n\nfollowing the guidelines of MoEF &amp; CC, Government of\n\nIndia, formulated in the Sustainable Sand Mining\n\nGuidelines, 2016 and the said guidelines prescribed\n\nstandard environmental condition for sand mining at SI\n\nNo. 19 which clearly envisages &quot;Depending upon the\n\nlocation, thickness of sand, deposition, agricultural\n                               // 14 //\n\n\nland/riverbed, the method of mining may be manual,\n\nsemi-mechanized      or   mechanized;       however,      manual\n\nmethod of mining shall be preferred over any other\n\nmethod. Thereby, it is contended that semi-mechanized\n\nand mechanized way of mining is permissible in the\n\nSand Mining Guidelines, 2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">11.       Mr. Dalai, learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioner brings to the notice of this Court the\n\nSustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines, 2016,\n\nmore particularly, Page-51 thereof, wherein under the\n\nheading &quot;About river sand mining it says that&quot; it has been\n\nprovided as follows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           &quot;(iii) No river sand mining project, with mine\n        lease area less than 5 ha, may be considered for\n        granting EC. The river sand mining projects with\n        lease area more than equal to 5 ha but less than 25\n        ha will be categorized as &#x27;B2&#x27;. In addition to the\n        requirement of documents, as brought out above\n        under sub-para (ii) above for appraisal, such projects\n        will be considered subject to the following\n        stipulations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">         (a) The mining activity shall be done manually. The\n             depth of mining shall be restricted to 3 m\n             /water level, whichever is less.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">         (b) For carrying out mining in proximity to any\n             bridge and / or embankment, appropriate\n             safety zone shall be worked out on case to case\n             basis to the satisfaction of SEAC / SEIAA,\n             taking into account the structural parameters,\n             locational aspects, flow rate etc., and no mining\n             shall be carried out in the safety zone so\n                               // 15 //\n\n\n                worked out.
