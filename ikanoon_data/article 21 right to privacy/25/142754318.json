D.B.P.No.13 of 2021 has been registered suo motu\n\nbased on the direction issued on 01.07.2021 by the Division\n\nBench dealing with Devaswom matters. The Division Bench\n\nnoticed that, based on S.M.Report No.3 of 2021 of the Special\n\nCommissioner, Sabarimala, regarding underutilisation of the\n\npermitted number of 5,000 pilgrims per day under Virtual-Q\n\nsystem, causing loss of opportunity to devotees desirous to\n\nundertake pilgrimage, this Court registered SSCR No.3 of\n\n2021. On 05.03.2021, an order was passed in SSCR No.3 of\n\n2021. Taking note of the report that Virtual-Q slots are being\n\nput through the website sabarimalaonline.org, which is an\n\ninitiative of the Kerala Police, and the fact that despite the\n\nbooking of all Virtual-Q slots within hours of opening of the\n\nsite, almost all days, when the shrine remains open, only less\n\nthan 50% of devotees thus registered are turning up for\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">21812 of 2021                    7</span>\n\n\ndarshan, this Court suo motu impleaded the State Police Chief\n\nas additional 3rd respondent, who was directed by the order\n\ndated 05.03.2021, to file an affidavit as to whether such\n\nsituations occur due to any deceitful action from the part of\n\nanyone. Thereafter, an affidavit was filed by an officer\n\nauthorised by the State Police Chief, wherein it is stated that\n\nthe aforesaid initiative of the Kerala Police is a successful tool\n\nto   identify the     pilgrims   and   to   manage   the   crowd   at\n\nSabarimala during Mandala Makaravilakku Festival season. It\n\nwas also stated that the restriction regarding the number of\n\npilgrims is due to Covid-19 pandemic and that necessary\n\nprobe will be done to find out whether there is any illegal\n\nactivity by anyone for the shortage in the number of pilgrims\n\nturning up for darshan. Later, as per the order dated\n\n12.03.2021 in SSCR No.3 of 2021, the number of pilgrims was\n\nenhanced from 5,000 to 10,000. The issue whether such\n\nshortage in the number of pilgrims occur due to any deceitful\n\naction on the part of anyone was not looked into while passing\n\nthe said order. But, despite the increase of the number of\n\npilgrims as above, there was considerable decrease in the\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">21812 of 2021                      8</span>\n\n\nnumber of pilgrims turning up for darshan, going by the\n\ninformation     passed      on     by    the   Special     Commissioner,\n\nSabarimala. As per the order dated 12.03.2021, this Court\n\npermitted to insist for production of Covid-19 negative\n\ncertificate after RT-PCR test taken within 48 hours of reaching\n\nNilakkal, from NABL accredited ICMR approved laboratories\n\nand such other laboratories approved by the Government. This\n\nCourt noticed that, each day, when the shrine remains open,\n\nabout 10 hours are available for darshan. Taking note of the\n\navailable   space     and    the       available   facilities   for   crowd\n\nmanagement there can be no difficulty at all for facilitating\n\ndarshan for the devotees, even if the entire permitted number\n\nof pilgrims are turning up for darshan, in terms of the time\n\nslot allotted to each of them. Since Sabarimala pilgrimage is\n\nnow    permissible    only   with       Covid-19    negative     certificate\n\nobtained in the aforesaid manner, the risk matter is very\n\nminimal. Unlike the other temples in Kerala, Sabarimala shrine\n\nopens only for Mandala Makaravilakku Festival, masa poojas\n\nand on specific festive days.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">      2.1. In the direction issued on 01.07.2021, the Division\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">21812 of 2021                     9</span>\n\n\nBench noticed that, in other temples in Kerala where darshan\n\nis permitted only after registration in Virtual-Q system, such\n\nsystems are managed by the Devaswoms concerned. In the\n\nstatement filed in SSCR No.3 of 2021 by the State Police Chief,\n\nthough it was stated that necessary probe would be done to\n\nfind out any illegal activity being done resulting in shortage in\n\nthe number of pilgrims turning up for darshan, so far nothing\n\nby way of a report is forthcoming. Taking into account all such\n\ncircumstances, the Division Bench noticed that, the question is\n\nwhether     the   computer    managed         Virtual-Q      system   for\n\nSabarimala     pilgrimage    be       entrusted   to   the    Travancore\n\nDevaswom Board (for brevity, &#x27;the TDB&#x27;), as has been done in\n\nother Devaswoms, for regulating the number of pilgrims\n\nturning up for darshan and at the same time to ensure the\n\nmaximum number of pilgrims, within the permissible number.\n\nNo doubt that, even in case of such an arrangement, taking\n\nnote of the fact that Sabarimala is a security vulnerable\n\ntemple and that effective crowd management is required, the\n\nact of regulating the devotees turning up for darshan and the\n\nsecurity aspects are to be retained with Police, as usual.\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">21812 of 2021                      10</span>\n\n\n      2.2. By the order dated 02.09.2021 in D.B.P.No.13 of\n\n2021, we have directed the Special Commissioner, Sabarimala,\n\nto submit a comprehensive report on the functioning of\n\nVirtual-Q system at Sabarimala, along with his suggestions.\n\nPursuant to the said order, a report dated 04.10.2021 of the\n\nSpecial Commissioner, Sabarimala, is placed on record. As per\n\nthat report, in the home page of the web portal, i.e.,\n\nsabarimalaonline.org, the emblem of the Kerala Police is\n\nexhibited on the top and the emblem of the TDB is exhibited\n\nbelow on the left-hand corner. When bookings are open,\n\ncertain   advertisements      of    ambulance   services,    &#x27;punyam\n\npoongavanam&#x27; and a ghee company are seen published by the\n\nKerala Police. The web application is hosted in the Amazon\n\nWeb Services Cloud Server owned by Kerala Police. The\n\nadvertisements in the web page are displayed as per the\n\nrequest of the Kerala Police. There is a discretionary quota of\n\ncoupons which is managed by Kerala Police by communicating\n\nwith the Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (for brevity, &#x27;the TCS\n\nLtd.&#x27;). The Kerala Police has separate URL and login for the\n\ndiscretionary    quota   of    coupons,    which   are      used   for\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">21812 of 2021                11</span>\n\n\nGovernment guests, guests of TDB and VIPs. The Special\n\nCommissioner pointed out that the domain name, i.e.,\n\nsabarimalaonline.org, which provides Virtual-Q booking facility\n\nto millions of devotees and the online web portal where\n\nadvertisements are displayed are all intellectual properties of\n\nthe minor deity, which are controlled by the Kerala Police and\n\nthe TDB has no control over the same. The Kerala Police is\n\nrendering yeoman service to millions of devotees of lord\n\nAyyappa by crowd control management and providing secure\n\nand orderly darshan to the devotees. However, the crowd\n\ncontrol management functions discharged by the Kerala Police,\n\nas part of its duty as a Department of the State, will not\n\nconfer it the right to own or exercise control over the property\n\nof the minor deity. Even without having control over the web\n\nportal, the Kerala Police can discharge crowd control functions\n\nby verifying the Virtual-Q coupons produced by the devotees\n\nat Nilakkal and Pamba, by getting the requisite data from the\n\nTCS Ltd. or the TDB. At Sabarimala, constant surveillance by\n\npolice personnel and by using CCTV cameras in access points\n\nand routes is being done in the police control rooms, in order\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">21812 of 2021                    12</span>\n\n\nto eliminate security threats. The security threat at Sabarimala\n\nis not a valid reason for the Kerala Police to exercise control\n\nover the system, which is the intellectual property of the minor\n\ndeity. The discretionary quota of Virtual-Q system has to be\n\nbrought under the direct control of the TDB. The TDB may be\n\ndirected to purchase online cloud storage server facility to host\n\nthe online web portal/web application and the TCS Ltd. may be\n\ndirected to operate the web portal/application for online\n\nbooking of Virtual-Q system for Sabarimala darshan, as per\n\nthe directions of the TDB. The TCS Ltd. and the TDB may be\n\ndirected to share the requisite data of pilgrims, as required by\n\nthe   Kerala   Police   for   effective   crowd   management   and\n\nverification of Virtual-Q coupons. The TDB may be directed to\n\ntake steps to register the trademark/obtain patent of the\n\nintellectual properties of the deity and Devaswom and to\n\nprevent its misuse and usurpation of revenue by third parties.\n\nTherefore, in the report, the Special Commissioner has prayed\n\nthat the TDB may be entrusted with Virtual-Q System and the\n\nsoftware developed by the TCS Ltd. and also the domain\n\nname, sabarimalaonline.org.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\"> DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">21812 of 2021                     13</span>\n\n\n      2.3. An affidavit dated 10.08.2021 has been filed on\n\nbehalf of the 2nd respondent State and the Additional Director\n\nGeneral of Police (Crime Branch) and the Chief Police Co-\n\nordinator,   Sabarimala,    has    sworn    to   an   affidavit   dated\n\n17.07.2021 on behalf of the 3rd respondent State Police Chief,\n\nwherein it is stated that, for avoiding unexpected pilgrim\n\ninflow surges during festival seasons, which may lead to\n\nsituations like stamped, Kerala Police had started Virtual-Q\n\nsystem during the year 2011, as per the directions of the\n\nState Government, using an in-house application developed by\n\nKerala Police. In the next year, the application was refurbished\n\nwith the help of the Kerala State Electronics Development\n\nCorporation     (KELTRON)    and       shifted   to   Amazon      Cloud\n\nEnvironment for improving performance and to ensure 100%\n\napplication availability during maximum number of concurrent\n\nusers. That system continued during 2012-13 to 2016-17. The\n\nVirtual-Q system provided by the Kerala Police as part of\n\ncrowd management saved precious time of the pilgrims. This\n\nfacility is provided absolutely free of cost to the pilgrims as it\n\nwas funded by the revenue generated from advertisements, as\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">21812 of 2021                       14</span>\n\n\npermitted by the State Government. The Kerala Police has also\n\nlaunched a mobile application on 18.11.2016 for Virtual-Q\n\nbooking, for knowing the status of the queue at Sannidhanam,\n\navailability   of     vehicle    parking   slots   at   various   parking\n\nlocations, weather at Pampa and Sannidhanam, etc. In the\n\nyear 2019, with the help of the TCS Ltd., Hyderabad,\n\nSabarimala Pilgrim Management System (for brevity &quot;SPMS&quot;)\n\nwas     introduced,       with     Devaswom        functionalities   like\n\nAppam/Aravana booking, Manjal, Kunkumam and Vibhoothi\n\nbooking, as a separate module. Virtual-Q system is a\n\nsuccessful tool to identify the pilgrims and to manage the\n\ncrowd at Sabarimala during Mandala-Makaravilakku Festival\n\nseason and monthly poojas. Till 2019-20 festival season,\n\npilgrims could have their pilgrimage either through Virtual-Q\n\nsystem or through conventional queue without online booking.\n\nOn account of Covid-19 pandemic situation, the number of\n\npilgrims was restricted during 2020-21 festival season and\n\nmonthly poojas. Entry to the temple was allowed only through\n\nVirtual-Q booking and that was approved by this Court as an\n\neffective way to regulate the number of pilgrims per day,\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">21812 of 2021                   15</span>\n\n\naccording to the norms fixed. The booking requires Aadhaar\n\ncard or election ID card number, photo and other details.\n\nHence, no bogus bookings could be made. The Kerala Police\n\noperates Virtual-Q verification counters at Pamba and verifies\n\nonline the genuinity of Virtual-Q coupons presented by the\n\npilgrims and allows entry. Depending upon the crowd situation\n\nat Sannidhanam, pilgrim entry at Pamaba is regulated. A\n\nregulated entry with details of pilgrims is imperative for crowd\n\nmanagement and for dealing with specific situations like the\n\nthreat   of   Covid-19   and   also   for   ensuring   security   for\n\nSabarimala. Unlike other temples in Kerala, the Kerala Police is\n\nresponsible for crowd management and maintenance of law\n\nand order in Sabarimala during pilgrimage season and monthly\n\npoojas. In temples like Guruvayur, where queue regulation is\n\nmanaged by the temple authorities, the online system can also\n\nbe   managed      by   them.   However,     in   Sabarimala,   crowd\n\nmanagement during pilgrim seasons is a challenging task and\n\nregulated by the Kerala Police. Since Sabarimala is situated in\n\na difficult forest terrain prone to natural disasters, it is\n\nimperative that the ownership of the Virtual-Q system is\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">21812 of 2021                16</span>\n\n\nvested with the Kerala Police for better co-ordination on the\n\nfield and for efficiency. For effecting crowd control during\n\nfestival seasons, it is imperative to know the number of\n\npilgrims expected to arrive and regulate their approximate\n\ndistribution, so that, appropriate crowd control measures can\n\nbe instituted. In SPMS, Virtual-Q system and the Devaswom\n\nfunctionalities like Appam/Aravana booking, etc. are separate\n\nmodules, which are independently controlled by the TDB and\n\npayment for prasadham bookings, etc., are credited to the\n\nTDB account. In addition to the present stakeholders, viz., the\n\nKerala Police and the TDB, the software architecture is capable\n\nof accommodating more stakeholders like the KSRTC and the\n\nForest Department. New services like e-kanikka, e-sewa, e-\n\nannadhanam, etc., can also be incorporated on demand from\n\nthe TDB. The Kerala Police distributes booking slots in SPMS\n\nwith the help of TCS Ltd., after getting confirmation from the\n\nExecutive Officer, Sabarimala, regarding the temple opening\n\nand closing schedule. At present, the stakeholders, namely,\n\nthe Kerala Police and the TDB jointly own SPMS and the TDB\n\ndirectly communicates with TCS Ltd. for making changes in\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">21812 of 2021                 17</span>\n\n\nthe Devaswom functionalities like Appam/Aravana booking,\n\netc. in SPMS. In Sabarimala, where the crowd management\n\nduring festival season is a challenging task and regulated by\n\nthe Kerala Police and the temple being situated in difficult\n\nforest terrain prone to natural disasters, it is imperative that\n\nthe ownership of Virtual-Q system is vested with the Kerala\n\nPolice for better co-ordination on the field and efficiency.\n\nManaging such huge crowd without access to the database\n\nand the ability to regulate the pilgrim flow would seriously\n\nhamper the efficiency of the Kerala Police in managing the\n\ncrowd. When specific threat inputs have been received on\n\nSabarimala Temple, preventive actions were initiated from the\n\nside of the Kerala Police. In case of any such threat inputs, the\n\ndatabase has to be screened and verified and the Kerala Police\n\nhas to take urgent preventive actions. This is possible only if\n\nthe Kerala Police has the access and ownership of Virtual-Q\n\nbooking system to act immediately to avert any adverse\n\nsituation. The database of criminal records is available only\n\nwith the Kerala Police in case any immediate verification has to\n\nbe made or action to be taken. In cases of a high alert\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">21812 of 2021                   18</span>\n\n\nsituation, if the situation warrants, Virtual-Q tickets can be\n\nissued after verifying the antecedents with the criminal\n\ndatabase. This is possible only if the ownership of Virtual-Q is\n\nwith   the   Kerala   Police   as    the   data    base   for    criminal\n\nantecedents is available only with the Kerala Police and not\n\nwith the TDB or other agencies. Taking away the ownership of\n\nVirtual-Q system from the Kerala Police would jeopardize the\n\nsecurity of Sabarimala Temple. The Kerala Police is able to\n\nstreamline the crowd at Sabarimala using Virtual-Q system.\n\nThe database of pilgrims can be used for analytical purposes\n\nand for investigation/ evidence collection in cases of untoward\n\nincidents    reported,   the    latter     being    more        important\n\nconsidering the sensitivity of a pilgrim place like Sabarimala.\n\nIn the future using Artificial Intelligence, offenders and\n\nextremist elements can be identified and culled out for the\n\nsafety and security of pilgrims. Pursuant to the observations\n\nmade by this Court, an enquiry was conducted by the Deputy\n\nInspector General of Police, Police Headquarters, to find the\n\nreasons for the default by pilgrims for darshan after reserving\n\nVirtual-Q slots. In the enquiry, it was revealed that, Covid and\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">21812 of 2021                19</span>\n\n\nCovid related factors were major reasons for the pilgrims not\n\narriving for darshan after booking. The subsequent change in\n\ntravel plans after booking was another reason. On enquiry it is\n\nrevealed that many of them have visited Sabarimala at a later\n\ndate. However, they have not cancelled the slot which they\n\nhave booked for darshan, despite the option being available.\n\nThis has led to a large number of booked slots (26.6%)\n\nremaining unutilised. Annexure R2(a) is a copy of the report\n\ndated 05.08.2021 of the Deputy Inspector General of Police,\n\nPolice Headquarters. For the last ten Sabarimala Festival\n\nseasons, Kerala Police has effectively used Virtual-Q system\n\nfor crowd management and for maintaining law and order and\n\nsecurity at Sabarimala. The existing SPMS, which is in the\n\ncombined ownership of the Kerala Police and the TDB, may be\n\npermitted to be maintained, as it is a time-tested system that\n\nworked well during normal times as well as during difficult\n\ntimes like that prevailing on account of Covid-19 pandemic.

The Deputy Secretary to Government Home (SSA)\n\nDepartment, Government of Kerala, has filed an objection\n\ndated 25.10.2021 on behalf of the 2nd respondent State,\n\nraising   similar     objections   to    the   report     of     the   Special\n\nCommissioner, Sabarimala, wherein it is stated that, on\n\n14.01.2011        there   occurred      stampede     at        Pulmedu   near\n\nSabarimala which took the life of 52 pilgrims. In the wake of\n\nthat tragic incident, this Court directed the Government as\n\nwell as the State Police Chief to effectively regulate the\n\npilgrims. Therefore, Virtual-Q system was introduced by the\n\nState and the Kerala Police with the approval of this Court. It\n\nwas found to be very effective in regulating the crowd at\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">21812 of 2021                   24</span>\n\n\nSannidhanam and also helpful to pilgrims all over the world, as\n\nthey   could    select   the   time   and   date   for   joining   the\n\nconventional queue at Sannidhanam, subject to availability of\n\naccommodation on first come first serve basis. In long queue\n\nformed in front of Pathinettampadi, the pilgrims will have to\n\nstand for 14 to 16 hours. There were also instances of aged\n\npilgrims returning from Sabaripeedam without having darshan,\n\nas they could not take the ordeal of standing in the queue for\n\nsuch long hours. In order to mitigate the above sufferings,\n\nVirtual-Q system was introduced. The existing SPMS in the\n\ncombined ownership of the Kerala Police and the TDB may be\n\npermitted to be maintained, as it is a time-tested system,\n\nwhich has worked well during normal times as well as during\n\ndifficult times like Covid-19 pandemic. As there is effective co-\n\nordination between the Kerala Police and the TDB, it would be\n\nappropriate to maintain status quo in the matter. The\n\nGovernment is of the view that Virtual-Q system has to be\n\noperated by the Kerala Police with active support of the TDB,\n\nas being done for the past so many years.

In W.P.(C)No.21609 of 2021, the\n\nSecretary of the TDB has sworn to a counter affidavit dated\n\n20.10.2021, wherein it is stated that, Virtual-Q booking for\n\nSabarimala darshan was introduced in the year 2011 as a\n\nproject of the Kerala Police, which is looking after crowd\n\nmanagement in Sabarimala and as such, the TDB does not\n\nhave ownership or control over Virtual-Q system managed by\n\nthe Kerala Police. Till the year 2020 Virtual-Q system was\n\noptional. Due to Covid-19 restrictions enforced in Sabarimala\n\nin the year 2020, it was made mandatory for all the devotees.\n\nThe TDB has its own devotee portal for online booking of\n\nVazhipadu/accommodation and also counter billing system at\n\nSabarimala.

One S. Jayaraj Kumar has filed I.A.No.1 of 2021,\n\nseeking an order to get himself impleaded as additional 4 th\n\nrespondent. That application was allowed by the order dated\n\n08.10.2021. In the affidavit filed in support of I.A.No.1 of\n\n2021, it is stated that, there has been a huge decline in the\n\nnumber of pilgrims visiting Sabarimala Temple after the\n\nintroduction of compulsory Virtual-Q system. Virtual-Q system\n\nin other major temples like Guruvayur is managed efficiently\n\nby the Devaswom Board. However, in Sabarimala, Virtual-Q\n\nsystem is managed by the Kerala Police. Over the past more\n\nthan eight years, out of 14,95,718 Virtual-Q bookings in\n\nSPMS, only 8,32,391 materialised, i.e., only 55.66% of the\n\ndevotees     availed   that   facility   after   registration.   The\n\nmanagement of Virtual-Q system by the Kerala Police is not\n\nconducive to proper utilisation of the permitted number of\n\npilgrims per day, especially because of strict adherence to the\n\ntime slots, which is a difficult task to accomplish in view of the\n\nlocation of the temple and the ascent through the rocky\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">21812 of 2021                      27</span>\n\n\npathway. Secondly, most of the pilgrims are from distant\n\nplaces and the mandatory requirement to report at the\n\nspecified time also makes it difficult for the pilgrims to utilise\n\ntheir Virtual-Q booking slots. Since pooja and ceremonies\n\nduring festival days are not properly reflected in Virtual-Q\n\nsystem managed by the Kerala Police, the pilgrims are put to\n\nmuch    difficulty.   Therefore,    it   is    better   to   entrust   the\n\nmanagement of Virtual-Q system to the TDB to ensure proper\n\nutilisation of the permitted number of pilgrims per day.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">      2.9.

The powers of the Commissioner and of\n\nthe other authorities under him, have been enumerated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/190188500/\" id=\"a_62\">Chapter II of the Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/170395798/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 21</a> gives the Commissioner, the\n\nDeputy and Assistant Commissioners and such other officers\n\nas may be authorised in this behalf, the power to enter the\n\npremises of any religious institution or any place of worship for\n\nthe purpose of exercising any power conferred, or discharging\n\nany duty imposed, by or under the Act.

In Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Shirur\n\nMutt the Apex Court noticed that our Constitution makers\n\nhave embodied the limitations which have been evolved by\n\njudicial    pronouncements   in America or Australia in the\n\nConstitution itself and the language of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_66\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_67\">26</a> is\n\nsufficiently clear to enable us to determine without the aid of\n\nforeign authorities as to what matters come within the purview\n\nof religion and what do not. Freedom of religion in our\n\nConstitution is not confined to religious beliefs only; it extends\n\nto religious practices as well subject to the restrictions which\n\nthe Constitution itself has laid down. Under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 26(b)</a>,\n\ntherefore, a religious denomination or organization enjoys\n\ncomplete autonomy in the matter of deciding as to what rites\n\nand ceremonies are essential according to the tenets of the\n\nreligion they hold and no outside authority has any jurisdiction\n\nto interfere with their decision in such matters. The Apex\n\nCourt agreed with the High Court in the view taken by it about\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">21812 of 2021                  53</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170395798/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 21</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/170395798/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 21</a> empowers the Commissioner\n\nand his subordinate officers and also persons authorised by\n\nthem to enter the premises of any religious institution or place\n\nof worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred\n\nor any duty imposed by or under the Act. It is well known that\n\nthere could be no such thing as            an unregulated and\n\nunrestricted right of entry in a public temple or other religious\n\ninstitutions, for persons who are not connected with the\n\nspiritual functions thereof. It is a traditional custom universally\n\nobserved not to allow access to any outsider to the particularly\n\nsacred parts of a temple as for example, the place where the\n\ndeity is located. There are also fixed hours of worship and rest\n\nfor the idol when no disturbance by any member of the public\n\nis allowed. The Apex Court found that, as <a href=\"/doc/170395798/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 21</a> stands, it\n\ninterferes with the fundamental rights of the Mathadhipati and\n\nthe denomination of which he is head guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_72\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_73\">26</a> of the Constitution.

As    observed      by    the    Apex    Court    in\n\nLakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Shirur Mutt [AIR 1954\n\nSC 282], matters of religion embrace not merely matters of\n\ndoctrine but also the practice of it, or to put in terms of Hindu\n\ntheology, not merely its Gnana but also its Bhakthi and Karma\n\nKandas. In Venkataramana Devam v. State of Mysore\n\n[AIR 1958 SC 255], it had been unequivocally held by a\n\nConstitution    Bench      of   the    Apex    Court   that   under    the\n\nceremonial law pertaining to temples, who are entitled to\n\nenter into for worship and where they are entitled to stand\n\nand worship and how the worship is to be conducted are all\n\nmatters of religion which conclusion their Lordships say is\n\nimplicit in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 25</a> which after declaring that all persons are\n\nentitled freely to profess, practise and propagate religion\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">21812 of 2021                 57</span>\n\n\nenacts that this should not affect the operation of any law\n\nthrowing open Hindu religious institutions of a public character\n\nto all classes and sections of Hindus. In E.R.J. Swamy v.\n\nState of Tamil Nadu [AIR 1972 SC 1586], it is stated that\n\nprotection of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_83\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_84\">26</a> is not limited to the matters of\n\ndoctrine or belief but extends also to acts done in the\n\nperformance of religion and therefore, contain a guarantee for\n\nrituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship\n\nwhich are integral parts of religion. If any action of the Board\n\namounts to intrusion into any matter of religion as such, then\n\ncertainly a worshipper could seek this court&#x27;s jurisdiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">      29.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1915943\" id=\"span_54\">In <a href=\"/doc/1915943/\" id=\"a_86\">S.

The\n\ntemples in Travancore were thrown open to all Hindus without\n\nany restriction being imposed on any Hindu either due to birth,\n\ncaste or community. That historical proclamation was made by\n\nthe   Maharaja        of   Travancore   on   27th   Thulam   1112\n\ncorresponding 12th of November, 1936.

After the integration of the Princely States of\n\nTravancore and Cochin, an ordinance was promulgated by the\n\nRajapramukh          as    Ordinance        4/1124   in   respect    of   the\n\nadministration of the Padmanabhaswami temple and the\n\nDevaswoms,       both           incorporated   and   unincorporated.      The\n\nOrdinance provides that the management of the Devaswom\n\nshall continue to be carried on as heretobefore. Another\n\nordinance was promulgated by the Rajapramukh on the 1 st day\n\nof August, 1949, which is called &quot;The Hindu Religious\n\nInstitutions Ordinance, 1124&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/10862103/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 31</a> of that Ordinance\n\nalso directs the Devaswom Board to arrange for the conduct of\n\nthe daily worship and ceremonies and festivals in every temple\n\naccording to its usage. A duty is therefore cast on the\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board to arrange for the conduct of the\n\ndaily worship and ceremonies in accordance with its usage. In\n\nother words, the Board has a statutory duty to enforce the\n\nusage prevalent in the temple. The Board has no right to alter\n\nor     modify   the       same.      The    Travancore-Cochin       Religious\n\nEndowments Act and its precursors had consistently enjoined\n\nthis    duty    on        the     Travancore    Devaswom      Board.

The counter\n\naffidavit filed by the Chief Secretary on behalf of the 3 rd\n\nrespondent states that it is the Board which shall manage and\n\narrange for the conduct of daily worship and ceremonies and\n\nfestivals in every temple according to its usages. It is further\n\naverred that the scheme of the Act has made it clear that the\n\nBoard is entrusted with the administration as well as the\n\nmaking of rules. It is therefore clear that Government have no\n\npower or authority to issue any order or direction in this\n\nmatter and the management is within the prerogative of the\n\nDevaswom Board subject to the provisions of the Travancore-\n\nCochin Hindu Religious Endowments Act.</span> The Division Bench\n\nmade special mention of the above fact in view of the stand\n\ntaken by the learned Government Pleader that the State can\n\ntake remedial measures including amendment of relevant\n\nrules to see that the Board does not deviate from the powers\n\nconferred on it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1307370\" id=\"span_58\">30.

The Apex Court had in\n\nunmistakable terms held in <a href=\"/doc/1307370/\" id=\"a_90\">Ratilal Panachand Gandhi and\n\nothers v. State of Bombay and others</a> [AIR 1954 SC\n\n388] that in regard to affairs in matters of religion the right of\n\nmanagement given to a religious body is a guaranteed\n\nfundamental right which no legislature can take away. The\n\nDivision Bench        doubted   whether   the     State    can impose\n\nrestrictions on the powers of the Travancore Devaswom Board\n\nin the matter of regulating its affairs. The Division Bench found\n\nthat this contention of the Government Pleader is contrary to\n\nthe averment in the counter affidavit of the 3 rd respondent\n\nwherein, after referring to Section 31 of the Travancore-Cochin\n\nReligious Endowments Act, it is stated that the Devaswom\n\nBoard shall manage and arrange for the conduct of daily\n\nworship    and    ceremonies    and   festivals    in     every   temple\n\naccording to its usages. There is a further averment that it is\n\nthe Board which is entrusted with the administration as well as\n\nthe making of rules. There is a statutory duty cast on the\n\nBoard under <a href=\"/doc/10862103/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 31</a> of the Act to arrange worship in the\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">21812 of 2021                     62</span>\n\n\ntemples in accordance with the usage. That statutory duty had\n\nbeen cast on the Board even earlier. In other words, the\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board can arrange worship in the\n\ntemples under their control only in accordance with the\n\nprevailing usages.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">      31.    As     already    noticed   hereinbefore,    under   the\n\nprovisions     of     the     <a href=\"/doc/190188500/\" id=\"a_92\">Travancore-Cochin   Hindu     Religious\n\nInstitutions Act</a>, the TDB is duty bound to see that the regular\n\ntraditional rites and ceremonies according to the practice\n\nprevalent in Sabarimala are performed promptly; and to\n\nestablish and maintain proper facilities in Sabarimala for the\n\ndevotees.

Sabarimala is situated in a difficult forest terrain\n\nprone to natural disasters. Unlike other temples in Kerala, the\n\nKerala Police is responsible for crowd management and\n\nmaintenance of law and order in Sabarimala during festival\n\nseasons and monthly poojas. In temples like Guruvayur, where\n\nqueue regulation is managed by the temple authorities, the\n\nonline system can also be managed by them. However, in\n\nSabarimala, crowd management during festival seasons is a\n\nchallenging task, which is regulated by the Kerala Police. Their\n\npresence is even necessary at Pathinettampadi to render\n\nnecessary assistance to the devotees, especially children,\n\nsenior citizens and also persons with disabilities. Crowd\n\nManagement       at   Sabarimala      during    festival   seasons   and\n\nmonthly poojas cannot be handled with the limited number of\n\nemployees of the TDB, who are deputed on special duty.

However, in the\n\ncounter affidavit filed on behalf of the TDB in W.P.(C)No.21609\n\nof 2021, it is stated that, Virtual-Q system for Sabarimala\n\ndarshan was introduced in the year 2011 as a project of the\n\nKerala Police, which is looking after crowd management in\n\nSabarimala. The TDB does not have ownership or control over\n\nVirtual-Q system managed by the Kerala Police. Though, in the\n\naffidavit filed on behalf of the 2 nd respondent State and that\n\nfiled on behalf of the 3rd respondent State Police Chief, it is\n\nstated that,     in SPMS    booking for Prasadams, etc. are\n\nindependently controlled by the TDB, the specific stand taken\n\nby the TDB in the counter affidavit filed in W.P.(C)No.21609 of\n\n2021 is that, the Board is having its own devotee portal for\n\nonline booking of Vazhipadu/accommodation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">      35.

When\n\nbookings are open certain advertisements are seen published\n\nby the Kerala Police relating to ambulance services, &#x27;punyam\n\npoongavanam&#x27; and an advertisement of a ghee company.

In the objection filed on behalf of the 3 rd respondent\n\nState Police Chief to the report of the Special Commissioner,\n\nSabarimala,      it   is   stated     that,   the   domain   name\n\nsabarimalaonline.org is renewed yearly by the Kerala Police.\n\nAs per the order dated 24.07.2021, the Government accorded\n\nsanction to the Kerala Police to accept advertisements in\n\nVirtual-Q   system,    to meet       the   expenditure towards   its\n\nmaintenance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">      36.

That web portal should be\n\nowned and managed by the TDB. Similarly, the State\n\nGovernment has absolutely no authority to accord sanction to\n\nthe Kerala Police to accept advertisements in Virtual-Q system,\n\nto meet the expenditure towards its maintenance. As in the\n\ncase of other temples like Guruvayur, Virtual-Q system for\n\nSabarimala darshan should be owned and managed by the\n\nTDB. During the course of arguments, the learned counsel for\n\nthe 5th respondent TCS Ltd. submitted that, the TCS Ltd. is\n\nprepared to extend technical support to Virtual-Q system for\n\nSabarimala darshan, in case it is taken over by the TDB based\n\non the orders of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">      37.

During the festival season\n\n2020-21 the number of pilgrims was restricted and the entry\n\nto Sabarimala was allowed only through Virtual-Q booking.\n\nThat was approved by this Court as an effective measure to\n\nregulate the number of pilgrims per day, as per the norms\n\nfixed on account of the restrictions imposed in connection with\n\nthe spread of Covid-19 pandemic in the State. A regulated\n\nentry    with   details   of   pilgrims   is   imperative   for   crowd\n\nmanagement at Sabarimala, when restrictions have been\n\nimposed on the number of pilgrims permitted to have darshan\n\nper day, on account of the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">21812 of 2021                    69</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">      39.

Kharak Singh has correctly held that the content\n      of the expression &#x27;life&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 21</a> means not\n      merely the right to a person&#x27;s &quot;animal existence&quot; and\n      that the expression &quot;personal liberty&quot; is a guarantee\n      against invasion into the sanctity of a person&#x27;s home or\n      an intrusion into personal security.

Judicial    recognition     of    the   existence     of    a\n      constitutional right of privacy is not an exercise in the\n      nature of amending the Constitution nor is the court\n      embarking on a constitutional function of that nature\n      which is entrusted to Parliament.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">      322. Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity.\n      Privacy has both a normative and descriptive function.\n      At a normative level privacy sub-serves those eternal\n      values upon which the guarantees of life, liberty and\n      freedom are founded. At a descriptive level, privacy\n      postulates a bundle of entitlements and interests which\n      lie at the foundation of ordered liberty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">      323. Privacy includes at its core the preservation of\n      personal    intimacies,    the     sanctity    of   family    life,\n      marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation.\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">21812 of 2021                            76</span>\n\n\n      Privacy also connotes a right to be let alone. Privacy\n      safeguards individual autonomy and recognises the\n      ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or\n      her life. Personal choices governing a way of life are\n      intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and\n      recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture.\n      While the legitimate expectation of privacy may vary\n      from the intimate zone to the private zone and from the\n      private      to   the     public     arenas,    it   is   important    to\n      underscore that privacy is not lost or surrendered\n      merely because the individual is in a public place.\n      Privacy attaches to the person since it is an essential\n      facet of the dignity of the human being.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">      324. This Court has not embarked upon an exhaustive\n      enumeration or a catalogue of entitlements or interests\n      comprised in the right to privacy. The Constitution must\n      evolve with the felt necessities of time to meet the\n      challenges thrown up in a democratic order governed\n      by the rule of law. The meaning of the Constitution\n      cannot be frozen on the perspectives present when it\n      was adopted. Technological change has given rise to\n      concerns which were not present seven decades ago\n      and    the    rapid     growth       of   technology      may render\n      obsolescent many notions of the present. Hence the\n      interpretation of the Constitution must be resilient and\n      flexible to allow future generations to adapt its content\n      bearing in mind its basic or essential features.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">      325.

A law which encroaches\n      upon privacy will have to withstand the touchstone of\n      permissible restrictions on fundamental rights. In the\n      context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 21</a> an invasion of privacy must be\n      justified on the basis of a law which stipulates a\n      procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law\n      must also be valid with reference to the encroachment\n      on life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 21.</a> An invasion\n      of life or personal liberty must meet the threefold\n      requirement     of    (i)   legality,   which   postulates    the\n      existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\n      legitimate State aim; and (iii) proportionality which\n      ensures a rational nexus between the objects and the\n      means adopted to achieve them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">      326.

The creation of such\n      a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance\n      between individual interests and legitimate concerns of\n      the state. The legitimate aims of the State would\n      include    for    instance     protecting       national   security,\n      preventing       and    investigating     crime,       encouraging\n      innovation       and    the    spread    of      knowledge,     and\n      preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits.\n      These are matters of policy to be considered by the\n      Union     Government          while    designing       a   carefully\n      structured regime for the protection of the data. Since\n      the Union Government has informed the Court that it\n      has constituted a Committee chaired by Hon&#x27;ble Shri\n      Justice B.N.

In K.S. Puttaswamy, at Paras.297 and 298 of the\n\nmain judgment authored by D.Y. Chandrachud, J., the Apex\n\nCourt noticed that, privacy postulates the reservation of a\n\nprivate space for the individual, described as the right to be let\n\nalone. The concept is founded on the autonomy of the\n\nindividual. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n\nmatters which can be kept private. These are concerns over\n\nwhich there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. Privacy is a\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">21812 of 2021                  79</span>\n\n\npostulate    of   human   dignity   itself.   Privacy   protects   the\n\nindividual from the searching glare of publicity in matters\n\nwhich are personal to his or her life.        Privacy constitutes the\n\nfoundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that the\n\nindividual can decide how liberty is best exercised. Privacy of\n\nthe individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both\n\nan intrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value,\n\nhuman dignity is an entitlement or a constitutionally protected\n\ninterest in itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and freedom\n\nare inseparably intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to\n\nachieve the other. The ability of the individual to protect a\n\nzone of privacy enables the realisation of the full value of life\n\nand liberty. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected\n\nfreedoms. The family, marriage, procreation and sexual\n\norientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual.\n\nAbove all, the privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable\n\nright to determine how freedom shall be exercised. An\n\nindividual may perceive that the best form of expression is to\n\nremain silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. Paras.297\n\nand 298 of <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_120\">the said judgment</a> read thus;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\"> DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">21812 of 2021                        80</span>\n\n\n      &quot;297.   What,    then,   does        privacy    postulate?   Privacy\n      postulates the reservation of a private space for the\n      individual, described as the right to be let alone. The\n      concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual.\n      The ability of an individual to make choices lies at the\n      core of the human personality. The notion of privacy\n      enables the individual to assert and control the human\n      element which is inseparable from the personality of the\n      individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality\n      is manifested in the ability to make decisions on matters\n      intimate to human life. The autonomy of the individual is\n      associated over matters which can be kept private. These\n      are concerns over which there is a legitimate expectation\n      of privacy. The body and the mind are inseparable\n      elements of the human personality. The integrity of the\n      body and the sanctity of the mind can exist on the\n      foundation that each individual possesses an inalienable\n      ability and right to preserve a private space in which the\n      human personality can develop. Without the ability to\n      make choices, the inviolability of the personality would be\n      in doubt. Recognising a zone of privacy is but an\n      acknowledgment that each individual must be entitled to\n      chart   and     pursue   the        course     of   development   of\n      personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human dignity\n      itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which are\n      intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy\n      where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of\n      privacy, an individual is not judged by others. Privacy\n      enables each individual to take crucial decisions which\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">21812 of 2021                    81</span>\n\n\n      find expression in the human personality. It enables\n      individuals     to   preserve    their   beliefs,   thoughts,\n      expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices\n      against societal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an\n      intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of the right of the\n      individual to be different and to stand against the tide of\n      conformity in creating a zone of solitude. Privacy protects\n      the individual from the searching glare of publicity in\n      matters which are personal to his or her life. Privacy\n      attaches to the person and not to the place where it is\n      associated. Privacy constitutes the foundation of all\n      liberty because it is in privacy that the individual can\n      decide how liberty is best exercised. Individual dignity\n      and privacy are inextricably linked in a pattern woven out\n      of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">      298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of\n      dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental\n      value.   As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an\n      entitlement or a constitutionally protected interest in\n      itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are\n      inseparably intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to\n      achieve the other. The ability of the individual to protect a\n      zone of privacy enables the realisation of the full value of\n      life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which\n      privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised in\n      privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a private\n      space. Privacy enables the individual to retain the\n      autonomy of the body and mind. The autonomy of the\n      individual is the ability to make decisions on vital matters\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">21812 of 2021                    82</span>\n\n\n      of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an\n      independent fundamental right. But that does not detract\n      from the constitutional protection afforded to it, once the\n      true nature of privacy and its relationship with those\n      fundamental rights which are expressly protected is\n      understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected\n      freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee\n      against arbitrary State action. It prevents the State from\n      discriminating between individuals. The destruction by\n      the State of a sanctified personal space whether of the\n      body or of the mind is violative of the guarantee against\n      arbitrary State action. Privacy of the body entitles an\n      individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of\n      personhood.     The intersection between one&#x27;s        mental\n      integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of\n      thought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the\n      freedom of self-determination. When these guarantees\n      intersect with gender, they create a private space which\n      protects all those elements which are crucial to gender\n      identity. The family, marriage, procreation and sexual\n      orientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual.\n      Above all, the privacy of the individual recognises an\n      inviolable right to determine how freedom shall be\n      exercised. An individual may perceive that the best form\n      of expression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a\n      realm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul in a\n      creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a\n      process of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes\n      which musically lead to silence. The silence, which lies\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">21812 of 2021                   83</span>\n\n\n      within, reflects on the ability to choose how to convey\n      thoughts and ideas or interact with others. These are\n      crucial aspects of personhood. The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_121\">Article\n      19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to\n      decide upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction\n      with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have a\n      choice of preferences on various facets of life including\n      what and how one will eat, the way one will dress, the\n      faith one will espouse and a myriad other matters on\n      which autonomy and self-determination require a choice\n      to be made within the privacy of the mind. The\n      constitutional right to the freedom of religion under\n      <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the ability to choose a\n      faith and the freedom to express or not express those\n      choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the\n      manner in which privacy facilitates freedom and is\n      intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The Constitution does\n      not contain a separate article telling us that privacy has\n      been declared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we\n      tagged the provisions of Part III with an alpha-suffixed\n      right to privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting.\n      Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within\n      the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which\n      the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate\n      expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a\n      constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum\n      of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a\n      zone of choice and self-determination.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">      48.

The Court in Rajagopal held that neither the State\n      nor can its officials impose prior restrictions on the\n      publication of an autobiography of a convict.

A citizen has a right to safeguard the\n          privacy     of    his    own,         his   family,     marriage,\n          procreation,       motherhood,              child-bearing        and\n          education        among    other         matters.      None       can\n          publish anything concerning the above matters\n          without     his    consent        -    whether        truthful    or\n          otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he\n          does so, he would be violating the right to\n          privacy of the person concerned and would be\n          liable in an action for damages. Position may,\n          however, be different, if a person voluntarily\n          thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily\n          invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">          (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception,\n          that any publication concerning the aforesaid\n          aspects      becomes       unobjectionable               if   such\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">21812 of 2021                              88</span>\n\n\n          publication is based upon public records including\n          court records. This is for the reason that once a\n          matter becomes a matter of public record, the\n          right      to    privacy    no    longer       subsists   and    it\n          becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\n          press and media among others. We are, however,\n          of the opinion that in the interests of decency\n          [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out\n          to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a\n          sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like\n          offence should not further be subjected to the\n          indignity of her name and the incident being\n          publicised in press/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">          (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in\n          (1) above - indeed, this is not an exception but\n          an independent rule. In the case of public\n          officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n          matter, the remedy of action for damages is\n          simply not available with respect to their acts\n          and conduct relevant to the discharge of their\n          official    duties.       This   is   so    even     where      the\n          publication is based upon facts and statements\n          which are not true, unless the official establishes\n          that       the     publication        was   made      (by       the\n          defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In\n          such a case, it would be enough for the\n          defendant (member of the press or media) to\n          prove       that     he     acted      after     a   reasonable\n          verification of the facts; it is not necessary for\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">21812 of 2021                         89</span>\n\n\n          him to prove that what he has written is true. Of\n          course, where the publication is proved to be\n          false   and    actuated      by     malice      or    personal\n          animosity, the defendant would have no defence\n          and would be liable for damages. It is equally\n          obvious that in matters not relevant to the\n          discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys\n          the same protection as any other citizen, as\n          explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no\n          reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by\n          the power to punish for contempt of court and\n          Parliament and legislatures protected as their\n          privileges     are    by     <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_135\">Articles    105</a>         and     <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_136\">104</a>\n          respectively     of   the        Constitution        of    India,\n          represent exceptions to this rule.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">      63.

In the former case, the claim for misuse\n\nof private information can survive even when information is in\n\nthe public domain as its repetitive use itself leads to violation\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">21812 of 2021                 100</span>\n\n\nof the said right. The right to privacy gets the benefit of both\n\nthe quantitative and the qualitative protection. The former\n\nrefers to the disclosure already made and what is yet\n\nundisclosed, whereas the latter refers to the privateness of the\n\nmaterial, invasion of which is an illegal intrusion into the right\n\nto privacy. Claim for confidentiality would generally fail when\n\nthe information is in public domain. The law of privacy is,\n\ntherefore, not solely concerned with the information, but more\n\nconcerned with the intrusion and violation of private rights.\n\nCiting an instance of how publishing of defamatory material\n\ncan be remedied by a trial establishing the falsity of such\n\nmaterial and award of damages, whereas invasion of privacy\n\ncannot be similarly redressed, the court had highlighted the\n\nreason why truth or falsity of an allegation or information may\n\nbe irrelevant when it comes to invasion of privacy. Therefore,\n\nclaims for protection against invasion of private and family life\n\ndo not depend upon confidentiality alone.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">      56.

The   judgment   recognises   that\n\neveryone has a right to the protection of laws against such\n\ninterference or attack. In K.S. Puttaswamy (main judgment\n\nauthored by D.Y.

Therefore,\n\nindividuals have the need to preserve an intrusion-free zone\n\nfor their personality and family. This facilitates individual\n\nfreedom. Privacy and confidentiality encompass a bundle of\n\nrights including the right to protect identity and anonymity.\n\nAnonymity      is     where    an   individual   seeks   freedom      from\n\nidentification, even when and despite being in a public space.\n\nAfter referring to various judicial precedents, the Five-Judges\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">21812 of 2021                    103</span>\n\n\nBench opined that, personal records, including name, address,\n\nphysical, mental and psychological status, marks obtained,\n\ngrades and answer sheets, are all treated as personal\n\ninformation.

In   Distribution    of   Essential   Supplies    and\n\nServices during Pandemic, In re, [(2021) 7 SCC 772], a\n\ndecision relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner in\n\nW.P.(C)No.21609 of 2021, a Three-Judge Bench of the Apex\n\nCourt noticed its earlier order dated 30.04.2021-Distribution\n\nof Essential Supplies and Services During Pandemic, In\n\nre, [(2021) 18 SCC 201], wherein the Court had highlighted\n\nthe concerns relating to the ability of the marginalised\n\nmembers of society to avail of vaccination, exclusively through\n\na digital portal in the face of a digital divide. A survey on\n\n&#x27;Household Social Consumption: Education&quot; was conducted by\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">21812 of 2021                  112</span>\n\n\nNational Statistics Office (July 2017-June 2018), in which it\n\nwas revealed that, around 4% of the rural households and\n\n23% of the urban households possessed a computer. In the\n\nage group of 15-29 years, around 24% in rural households\n\nand 56% in urban areas were able to operate a computer.\n\nNearly 24% of the households in the country had internet\n\naccess during the survey year 2017-18. The proportion was\n\n15% in rural households and 42% in urban households.\n\nAround 35% of persons in the age group of 15-29 years\n\nreported use of internet during the 30 days prior to the date of\n\nsurvey. The proportions were 25% in rural areas and 58% in\n\nurban areas. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in its\n\nreport titled &#x27;Wireless Data Services in India&#x27; noted that, out of\n\nthe total population of 1.3 billion, only 578 million people in\n\nIndia (less than 50%) have subscription to wireless data\n\nservices. The wireless teledensity in rural areas is 57.13% as\n\ncompared to 155.49% in urban areas as on 31.03.2019. In\n\nthe report, it is stated that, this reflects the rural-urban divide\n\nin terms of telecom services&#x27; penetration. Since the number of\n\nwireless data subscribers are less than 50% of the total\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">21812 of 2021                113</span>\n\n\nwireless access subscribers, the number of wireless data\n\nsubscribers in rural areas would be much lower. The report\n\nalso noted that in a few Indian States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh\n\nand Assam the teledensity is less than 75%. The monthly\n\nincome of persons living below the poverty line in urban areas\n\nand rural areas is Rs.1,316/- and Rs.896/-, respectively.\n\nHowever, to access internet data services, a minimum tariff\n\nplan would cost around Rs.49/-, which includes 1 GB of data\n\nevery 28 days. This would constitute 4-5% of the month&#x27;s\n\nincome of such persons accessing data. As such, the report\n\nnotes that this would bear a considerable cost for persons\n\nliving below the poverty line. The Apex Court noticed that,\n\naccording to the Annual Report of Common Services Centres\n\n(CSC) for 2019-20, published by the Ministry of Electronics\n\nand Information Technology, while there are 2,53,134 Gram\n\nPanchayats in India, as on 31.03.2020 only 2,40,792 Gram\n\nPanchayats are covered with at least one registered CSC.\n\nHence, approximately 13,000 Gram Panchayats in India do not\n\nhave a CSC. It is clear from the above statistics that there\n\nexists a digital divide in India, particularly between the rural\n DBP No.13 of 2021 &amp;\nW.P.(C)Nos.21609 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">21812 of 2021                 114</span>\n\n\nand urban areas. The extent of the advances made in\n\nimproving digital literacy and digital access falls short of\n\npenetrating the majority of the population in the country.\n\nSerious issues of the availability of bandwidth and connectivity\n\npose further challenges to digital penetration. The Apex Court\n\nfound that a vaccination policy exclusively relying on a digital\n\nportal for vaccinating a significant population of this country\n\nbetween the ages of 18-44 years would be unable to meet its\n\ntarget of universal immunisation owing to such a digital divide.\n\nIt is the marginalised sections of the society who would bear\n\nthe brunt of this accessibility barrier. This could have serious\n\nimplications on the fundamental right to equality and the right\n\nto health of persons within the above age group.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">      69.

In the year\n\n2020, in connection with the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, it\n\nwas made mandatory for all pilgrims.                During Covid-19\n\npandemic, the State Disaster Management Authority will have\n\nthe power to impose restrictions regarding entry of pilgrims to\n\nSabarimala, by prescribing the number of devotees permitted\n\nto have darshan per day.
