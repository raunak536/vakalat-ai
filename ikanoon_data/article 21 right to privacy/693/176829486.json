This certainly\nproves that there was some kind of sexual assault on the child &#x27;M&#x27; but\ncertainly this act cannot be brought within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 375</a>\nIndian Penal Code or even attempt thereof.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                Eightly the child at the time of her medical examination\nthe prosecutrix was not wearing any undergarments and was wearing\nonly skirt and shirt and it is evident that she had washed herself.

I have considered the\nsubmissions made by the accused in this regard. I may observe that\nboth DW1 Prakash and DW2 Ashok Kumar are closely related to the\naccused, DW1 Prakash being related to the accused through his\ncousin Chacha in the village and DW2 Ashok having admitted that he\nis related to the accused. The said witness have clearly stated that\nthey did not make any complaint to the senior police officers or any\nauthority that the accused has been falsely implicated at the instance\nof Veer Pal and it is for the first time that they have raised such a\ndefence. Further, in so far as the factum of death of Veer Pal is\nconcerned, they have admitted in their cross-examination that there\nwas no police complaint between the accused and Smt. Laxmi to\nshow that they had previous animosity nor any case was registered\nagainst Smt. Laxmi (mother of the prosecutrix) in respect of death of\nwitness Veer Pal. In fact DW2 has deposed that Veer Pal has gone\naway from Delhi and he does not know the cause of his death but has\nadmitted that this is his assessment that Veer Pal must have felt\nrepentance for falsely implicating the accused Munna in the present\ncase and had committed suicide about two years ago.

The MLC of the prosecutrix &#x27;M&#x27; Ex.PW8/A\nreveals that the doctor who had examined the prosecutrix had after\nreporting on the external injuries, state of sexual organs of the victim\nand the samples collected, conducted the following tests on the\nprosecutrix &#x27;M&#x27; aged about 5 years:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">1.    The Hymen Test\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">2.    The PV Test.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">                In so far as the Hymen Test is concerned, it has been\nreported by the doctor on the MLC of the prosecutrix that the Hymen\ntorn old.

In this\ninformation it is also transcribed as &quot;habituated to sex&quot; or &quot;used to\nsex&quot;. The category of habituated is used against raped women to\nsuggest they lie about rape and this extends to child sexual abuse\ncases too.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">                It is this test which is the cause of concern. It is being\nroutinely conducted by the doctors on the victims of sexual abuse and\nrape be it a minor (as in the present case), unmarried girl or married\nwoman, without having any regards to the fact that the opinion of the\ndoctors rendered after conducting such a test has no bearing with\nregard to the guilt or otherwise of the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                I may observe, that in case of sexual assault the doctor is\nonly required to look into signs of violence or resistance if any upon\nthe body of the victim for which the doctor would make a note of it\nby visible external examination. The doctor is further required to\nreport on the state of sexual organs of the victim to include\ninformation regarding puberty and attaining of sexual maturity of the\nvictim and in case of assault or pregnancy the abdominal and vaginal\nexaminations and thereafter to collect the samples from the clothes of\nthe victim and the alleged attacker and the vagina of the victim so as\nto establishing the nature of assault and the identity of the attacker.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">                In case if the victim is unmarried, the Hymen Test is\nconducted to check if the hymen cord is intact and in case of use of\nforce any signs of tearing or bruising off or near the vagina is noted.\nHaving conducted the aforesaid test no further examination is\nrequired. Why then the Per Vagina (PV) test which is normally\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">St. Vs.

This PV Test/ Finger Test\nwhich is being so conducted in routine upon the victims of sexual\noffences allows the character evidence to disqualify the victim&#x27;s\ntestimony. The presumptions under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_18\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and the\nexisting statutory provisions in India makes the sexual character of\na rape victim irrelevant to sexual violence trials.

This test is\nviolative of the Fundamental Right of Privacy an important\nConstitutional Right of the victim. If due to any reason, under the\ngiven circumstances of a case, if the investigating officer is of the\nview that this test would be essential and necessary to collect\nevidence against the accused, or to ascertain the extent of injury\ncaused to the victim in such case, then such a test should only be\nconducted only with the consent of the prosecutrix/ her guardians\n(prosecutrix if she is a major and guardians if she is a minor in terms\nof provisions of <a href=\"/doc/126734289/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 164-A</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure)\nand that too after taking due permission from the court and not\notherwise (since this test is not a preliminary test to establish charges\nof Rape).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">                Now coming to the merits of the case, as discussed\nherein above, the identity of the accused stands established. It is\nevident from the testimony of the prosecutrix that the accused had\nattempted to commit rape upon her but the medical record of the\nchild does not support this conclusion. The child was examined on\nthe same day and there was not fresh injury, bleeding etc. of any kind\nexcept redness around the anal area. The hymen of the child was\ntorn but according to the doctor, the tear was old and there was no\nfresh injury.      Therefore, the medical record of the child is only\nindicative of an assault but not of rape or attempt thereof.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">St. Vs.

As per the allegations he had asked the\nprosecutrix to get cigarette for him and when the child got the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">St. Vs. Munna, FIR No. 513/07, PS Shalimar Bagh             Page No. 32</span>\n cigarettes for him, he took her inside his Jhuggi and tried to commit\nGalat Kaam/ rape upon her but the prosecutrix was saved with the\ntimely intervention of Veer Paal. The most material witness of the\nprosecutrix Veer Pal has not appeared in the court and as per the\nreport of the investigating officer has expired. Even the mother of\nthe prosecutrix namely Smt. Laxmi and father of the prosecutrix\nnamely Shyam Singh had appeared at the initial stages and deposed\npartly but their examination in chief could not be completed and\nthereafter the investigating officer has failed to secure their presence\nbefore the court on the ground that they are not traceable. On the\nbasis of the testimony of the prosecutrix &#x27;M&#x27; and the MLC on record\nthe accused has been acquitted of the offences under Section 376 (2)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">(f) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_30\">Indian Penal Code</a> and has been held guilty only of the offence\nunder Section 342 and <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 354</a> Indian Penal Code and\nconvicted him accordingly.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">                I have heard the arguments advanced before me. Ld.\nAmicus Curiae appearing on behalf of the convict has argued that the\nconvict Munna is a young boy of 21 years having a family\ncomprising of father, mother and four brothers. It is submitted that\nthe convict is totally illiterate and is a driver by profession.\nAccording to him, the convict is a first time offender and is not\ninvolved in any other case and is in judicial custody w.e.f. 22.7.2007\ntill date. He requests that a lenient view be taken against the convict.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                The Ld. Addl. PP for the State has prayed that a stern\nview be taken against the convict in view of the fact that the offence\nhas been committed upon a small child of 5 years.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">St. Vs. Munna, FIR No. 513/07, PS Shalimar Bagh          Page No. 33</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">                 I have considered the rival contentions. The convict\nMunna has no criminal background and is not involved in any other\ncase. He is a young boy of 21 years of age and belongs to a very poor\nfamily. The maximum punishment prescribed for the offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 354</a> Indian Penal Code is two years and the convict has\nalready remained in judicial custody for about 3 years, 3 months, 20\ndays i.e. more than the prescribed period. Therefore, the convict\nMunna is sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of two\nyears for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 354</a> Indian Penal Code. He is\nalso sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of One Year\nfor the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 342</a> Indian Penal Code. Both the\nsentences shall run concurrently.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">                Benefit of <a href=\"/doc/914361/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 428</a> Cr.P.C. shall be given to the\nconvict for the period already undergone by him during the trial.\nSince the convict Munna has already remained in custody for the\nperiod more than the prescribed punishment, he is directed to be\nreleased forthwith.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">                The convict is informed that he has a right to prefer an\nappeal against this judgment. He has been apprised that in case he\ncannot afford to engage an advocate, he can approach the Legal Aid\ncell, functioning in Tihar Jail or write to the Secretary, Delhi High\nCourt Legal Services Committee, 34-37, Lawyers Chamber Block,\nHigh Court of Delhi, New Delhi.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">                Copy of the judgment and order of sentence be given to\nthe convict free of costs and another be attached with his jail\nwarrants.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">St. Vs.

The\nMLC of the prosecutrix &#x27;M&#x27; Ex.PW8/A reveals that the doctor who\nhad examined the prosecutrix had after reporting on the external\ninjuries, state of sexual organs of the victim and the samples\ncollected, conducted the following tests on the prosecutrix &#x27;M&#x27; aged\nabout 5 years:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">              1.      The Hymen Test\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">              2.      The PV Test.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">                   In so far as the Hymen Test is concerned, it has been\nreported by the doctor on the MLC of the prosecutrix that the\nHymen torn old. Further, with regard to the PV Test it has been\nreported that vagina admits one finger.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">                   This court has come across a number of MLCs of\nvictims of rape where apart from reporting on the signs of violence\nor resistance, state of sexual organs of the victim and details\nregarding collecting of samples and reporting on the condition of the\nhymen cord the information &quot;PV: two fingers admissible or\ninadmissible&quot; as the case may be is also mentioned.                In this\ninformation it is also transcribed as &quot;habituated to sex&quot; or &quot;used to\nsex&quot;. The category of habituated is used against raped women to\nsuggest they lie about rape and this extends to child sexual abuse\ncases too.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">St. Vs. Munna, FIR No. 513/07, PS Shalimar Bagh           Page No. 35</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">                 It is this test which is the cause of concern. It is being\nroutinely conducted by the doctors on the victims of sexual abuse and\nrape be it a minor, unmarried girl or married woman, without having\nany regards to the fact that the opinion of the doctors rendered after\nconducting such a test has no bearing with regard to the guilt or\notherwise of the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">                I may observe, that in case of sexual assault the doctor is\nonly required to look into signs of violence or resistance if any upon\nthe body of the victim for which the doctor would make a note of it\nby visible external examination. The doctor is further required to\nreport on the state of sexual organs of the victim to include\ninformation regarding puberty and attaining of sexual maturity of the\nvictim and in case of assault or pregnancy the abdominal and vaginal\nexaminations and thereafter to collect the samples from the clothes of\nthe victim and the alleged attacker and the vagina of the victim so as\nto establishing the nature of assault and the identity of the attacker.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">                In case if the victim is unmarried, the Hymen Test is\nconducted to check if the hymen cord is intact and in case of use of\nforce any signs of tearing or bruising off or near the vagina is noted.\nHaving conducted the aforesaid test no further examination is\nrequired. Why then the Per Vagina (PV) test which is normally\ncalled the Finger Test is being carried out in routine on victims of\nsexual offences. This test only establishes whether the vestibule is\ncongested and whether one, two or three fingers can be inserted.\nIt is this PV Test which is being carried out by the doctors in\nroutine upon the rape victims to which this court has serious\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">St. Vs.

Given these\ncircumstances, I hold that the PV Test is absolutely unnecessary and\nirrelevant in trial of rape cases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                Lastly the PV Test which allows the doctor to state\nwhether the woman is habituated to sex or used to sex is self\nincriminating as it is often used to disqualify the victim&#x27;s testimony.\nThis test shifts the focus of the investigations and the trial in\nsexual offences cases from the accused to the victim which is\nimpermissible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">                The humiliation which a rape victim suffers in the court\non account of existing procedures is impermissible. This court is of\nthe view that the existing medical and legal procedures which are\nirrelevant to the trial of the rape cases, are required to be reviewed\nand stopped forthwith.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">                This being the background, I hereby hold that the PV\nTest/ Finger Test is irrelevant to sexual violence trials. This test is\nviolative of the Fundamental Right of Privacy an important\nConstitutional Right of the victim. If due to any reason, under the\ngiven circumstances of a case, if the investigating officer is of the\nview that this test would be essential and necessary to collect\nevidence against the accused, then it should only be carried out with\nthe consent of the prosecutrix/ her guardians (prosecutrix if she is a\nmajor and guardians if she is a minor) and that too after taking due\npermission from the court and not otherwise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">                State action cannot be a threat to the Constitutional\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">St. Vs. Munna, FIR No. 513/07, PS Shalimar Bagh          Page No. 39</span>\n Right of an individual. What has shocked my conscious is the fact\nthat this PV Test/ Finger Test is being carried out in routine on\nvictims of sexual offences by the doctors (even on minors as has\nhappened in the present case) thereby reflecting a rampant violation\nof the Constitutional Rights of such victims. It has therefore become\nnecessary for this court to highlight this fact before the authorities\nconcerned so that the necessary steps are taken in the direction to\nensure the protection of the Right of Privacy of the victims of sexual\noffence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48808458\" id=\"span_44\">Even earlier in case bearing FIR No.1135/06, Police\nStation Uttam Nagar, Under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 363</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_41\">376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1629021/\" id=\"a_42\">368</a> Indian Penal\nCode under the title <a href=\"/doc/48808458/\" id=\"a_43\">State Vs.

It is desirable that investigating officers should be\nduly sensitized and instructed to ensure that this finger test/ PV Test\nis not carried out on the rape victims, particularly upon children,\nminor girls and married girls as a matter of routine.
