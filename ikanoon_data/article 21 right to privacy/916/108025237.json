It\n\nwas noted by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that the advances\n\nhad already paid before civil courts in suits for recovery of\n\ntheir dues and those suits had been compromised on receipt\n\nof payments from the Companies.

In these circumstances, the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Court felt that it would not be expedient to proceed\n\nfurther with the complaint and,                   dismissed the appeal,\n\nthereby maintaining the order of the High Court.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8.

It was noted that there would be almost no chance of\n\nconviction when the complainant was not likely to support\n\nthe prosecution either because she had resolved disputes\n\nwith her husband and other family members and as a result\n\nthereof, she had again started living with him or had parted\n\ncompany with him or was living happily on her own or had\n\nmarried someone else on earlier marriage having been\n\ndissolved by divorce with mutual consent of the parties. The\n\nHon&#x27;ble Court was of the view that where in the opinion of\n\nthe court, chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and,\n\ntherefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by\n\nallowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the Court may,\n\nwhile taking into consideration the special facts of a case,\n\nalso quash the proceedings. It was observed that in such\n\nmatrimonial matters, it becomes the duty of the Court to\n\nencourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Crlmc3447/09, 3712/09 &amp; WP(Crl.) 858/09      Page 8 of 38</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"> 10.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1936939\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/1936939/\" id=\"a_26\">Jagdish Channana and Ors v.

The Hon&#x27;ble Court\n\nobserved that it is advisable that in disputes where the\n\nquestion involved is purely personal in nature, the court\n\nshould ordinarily accept the terms of compromise even in\n\ncriminal proceedings as keeping the matter alive, with no\n\npossibility of a result in favour of the prosecution is a luxury,\n\nwhich the Courts, grossly overburdened as they are, cannot\n\nafford and that the time so saved can be utilized in deciding\n\nmore effective and meaningful litigation.

If the accused in such a\n\ncase is an affluent person and the prosecutrix comes from a\n\nsocially or economically weaker strata of the society,\n\nquashing in such a case would only encourage commission\n\nof such offences, as the accused, using his money power or\n\notherwise, may be able to induce the prosecutrix to enter in\n\nto settlement with him and then seek quashing of criminal\n\nproceedings, on the strength of that settlement.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">Crlmc3447/09, 3712/09 &amp; WP(Crl.) 858/09                   Page 29 of 38</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"272368\" id=\"span_56\">49.    In my view, a petitioner is not entitled to quashing\n\nmerely because in the facts and circumstances of some other\n\ncase, this court has quashed an FIR registered<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_184\"> u/s 376</a> of\n\nIndian Penal Code. Every case has to be decided on its own\n\nfacts and no hard and fast rule can be laid down as regards\n\nthe cases, which deserve quashing by the High Court in\n\nexercise of power<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_185\"> u/s 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nor Article 226/227 of the Constitution. This was recognized\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/272368/\" id=\"a_186\">Ravi Shankar\n\nParshad</a> (Supra). If, considering the special facts of a case,\n\nthe court decides to quash the FIR registered or the\n\ncomplaint filed in a particular case, that ipso facto does not\n\njustify quashing of the FIR/complaint in every other case\n\ninvolving the commission of an offence punishable under the\n\nsame provision of law or with equal or even lesser\n\npunishment. The nature of the offence than in fact be more\n\nimportant than the punishment prescribed for it. The court\n\nhas to apply its mind to the facts and circumstances of each\n\ncase that comes up before it for quashing, note the special\n\nfeatures, if any, justifying quashing of the prosecution and\n\nthen come to an appropriate conclusion.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">Crlmc3447/09, 3712/09 &amp; WP(Crl.) 858/09        Page 30 of 38</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\"> 50.    It was contended by the learned counsel in Crl.M.C.\n\n3447/2009 that in case this court is of the opinion that an\n\nFIR registered<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_187\"> u/s 376</a> of Indian Penal Code ought not to be\n\nquashed, the matter may be referred to a larger Bench as\n\nsome co-ordinate Benches have already quashed FIRs\n\nregistered<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_188\"> u/s 376</a> of Indian Penal Code.             I am unable to\n\nagree with the learned counsel. No doubt, if a Judge differs\n\nwith a co-ordinate Bench on a question of law, judicial\n\ndiscipline requires that he should refer the cases for\n\nconsideration of that proposition, of law by a larger Bench.\n\nI, however, do not find any particular proposition of law\n\nhaving been <a href=\"/doc/272368/\" id=\"a_189\">laid down in</a> any of the cases referred by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner. There is no denial that in\n\nappropriate cases the High Court has the power to quash an\n\nFIR or a criminal complaint even if the offence is otherwise\n\nnot compoundable.            But, this proposition of law has to be\n\napplied       taking      into      consideration   the      facts        and\n\ncircumstances of each individual case. Therefore, there is\n\nno ground for referring the matter to a larger Bench.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">Crlmc3447/09, 3712/09 &amp; WP(Crl.) 858/09                   Page 31 of 38</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\"> 51.

The object behind\n\naddition of Section 498-A to <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_191\">Indian Penal Code</a> by Criminal\n\nLaw (2nd <a href=\"/doc/150406021/\" id=\"a_192\">Amendment) Act, 1983</a> was to prevent the torture\n\nof a woman by her husband or relatives of the husband. The\n\nincrease in cases of harassment and deaths of young\n\nmarried women, as a result of unlawful demands of dowy by\n\ntheir husbands or parents-in-law, had led to enactment of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_193\">Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961</a>. Since the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_194\">Dowry\n\nProhibition Act</a> were not found to be adequate to curb the\n\nevil, the Parliament in its anxiety to extend protection to the\n\nweaker spouse, added Chapter XX-A, which includes Section\n\n498-A, to <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_195\">Indian Penal Code</a>.              Traditionally, the women in\n\nour society has, at least in the past, been subjudicated to the\n\nwhims and caprices of the husband and sometimes also her\n\nin-laws.     Sometimes, on account of the harassment caused\n\nand the cruelties inflicted on her, her life becomes so\n\nmiserable and intolerable that she decides to put an end to\n\nsuch a life by committing suicide.

It is, therefore, proposed to\n              amend the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_197\">Indian Evidence Act</a> suitably\n              to deal effectively not only with cases of\n              dowry deaths but also cases of cruelty\n              to married women by their in-laws.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">52.

The purpose is to enable the parties to\n\nlive peacefully, in future, without retaining any feeling of\n\nrancouror or ill-will towards each other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Crlmc3447/09, 3712/09 &amp; WP(Crl.) 858/09            Page 33 of 38</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">        But, when the wife has died, these considerations do\n\nnot exist any more and in such a situation, no useful purpose\n\nis served by quashing the criminal proceedings that were\n\ninitiated against the husband and/or in-laws of the deceased.\n\nIn fact, the parents or other family members of a deceased\n\nspouse are nobody to enter into a compromise in respect of\n\nthe offence which was committed against the deceased and\n\nnot against them.           It is the deceased and not her family\n\nmembers, who had to undergo the torture, cruelty and\n\nharassment at the hands of her husband and/or in-laws. It\n\nwould, therefore, neither be in consonance with public\n\npolicy nor in the benefit of the society at large to allow the\n\nfamily members of a deceased woman to enter into a\n\ncompromise with her husband and/or in-laws and then come\n\nto the court seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings\n\npursuant to such a compromise. In fact, quashing criminal\n\nproceedings in such cases, after death of victim of the crime\n\nmay in some cases, encourage the accused persons to win\n\nover the family members of the deceased for considerations\n\nwhich may not necessarily be brought on record.

Having already lost their\n\ndaughter/sister, they may not always find any incentive to\n\ncontinue the criminal proceedings, if they are compensated\n\nin monetary terms or are otherwise persuaded to enter in to\n\na settlement.

The main purpose behind\n\nthese sections is to give adequate protection to the public\n\nservants in discharge of their official duties and to maintain\n\nthe lawful authority of the public office held by them.
