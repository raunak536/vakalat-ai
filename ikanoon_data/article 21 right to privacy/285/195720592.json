Marriage between\n\nthe parties was solemnized on 20.02.2009. A daughter was born out of the\n\nwedlock on 11.05.2011 and petition seeking divorce filed in the year 2017.\n\nAn amended petition was filed on 03.04.2018. Husband submitted his\n\naffidavit by way of evidence in chief on 07.12.2018. When the matter was\n\nlisted for cross-examination, an application was moved by the husband on\n\n09.07.2019 seeking permission to submit his supplementary affidavit by way\n\nof examination-in-chief along with CD and transcriptions of conversations\n\nso recorded in the memory cards/chips of the respective mobile phones.\n\nReply was filed to the application. Application dated 09.07.2019 was\n\nallowed by the learned Family Court vide impugned order dated 29.01.2020\n\nwhile observing that the husband is allowed to prove the CD pertaining to\n\nthe conversations between him and his wife subject to the condition of\n\ncorrectness and that strict principles of evidence are not applicable to the\n\nproceedings before the Family Court keeping in view <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1231073/\" id=\"a_5\">20</a> of\n\nthe Family Court Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                                       2 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 23-01-2022 12:08:50 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> CR No. 1616 of 2020 and CR No. 2538 of 2020 (O&amp;M)                      3</span>\n\n            Aggrieved therefrom, CR No. 1616 of 2020 has been filed by\n\nthe wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">            Learned counsel for the petitioner-wife has vehemently argued\n\nthat the evidence sought to be led by the husband is completely beyond\n\npleadings, therefore, absolutely impermissible. It is contended that the\n\npleadings do not refer to any such conversations which are sought to be\n\nproved. Therefore, this evidence has been wrongly accepted. Furthermore,\n\nthe said CD&#x27;s are a clear cut infringement and downright invasion of the\n\nwife&#x27;s privacy thus a violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, as\n\nthe conversations have been recorded without knowledge, what to say of\n\nconsent of the petitioner. It is further contended that the learned Family\n\nCourt has given a complete go bye to <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 65</a> of the Indian Evidence Act,\n\nbecause if recording has been done through a mobile phone, CD&#x27;s of the\n\nrecording and transcripts thereof in any case, cannot be accepted as evidence\n\nthereof. Moreover, there is non-compliance of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 65-B</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">            Learned counsel for the petitioner reiterates that the respondent-\n\nhusband being very well aware of the conversations allegedly held years\n\nprior to filing of the divorce petition was at liberty to have incorporated the\n\nsame in his pleadings at the very first instance. Furthermore, though,\n\nveracity of such conversations cannot be vouched for, even if taken to be\n\ncorrect, the same are not admissible in evidence having been recorded\n\nwithout the consent or knowledge of the petitioner. It is thus prayed that this\n\npetition be allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">            Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent while refuting\n\narguments raised by learned counsel for the petitioner, while referring to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act submits that there is no question of any\n\n\n                                      3 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 23-01-2022 12:08:50 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> CR No. 1616 of 2020 and CR No. 2538 of 2020 (O&amp;M)                     4</span>\n\ninfringement of right of privacy and in any case, husband can always be\n\nsubjected to cross-examination. It is vehemently argued that conversations\n\nso recorded, are not beyond pleadings as it has always been the case of the\n\nhusband that he was treated with cruelty by his wife. Though, specific\n\nconversations are not mentioned in the petition, it has been clearly\n\nmentioned that the wife used to treat the husband in a cruel manner.\n\nConversations so recorded are only an attempt to prove the same, therefore,\n\nit cannot be said that the same are beyond pleadings. It is further urged that\n\nin view of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1231073/\" id=\"a_11\">20</a> of the Family Courts Act, Family Court is not\n\nbound by the strict rules of evidence. Therefore, learned Family Court has\n\ncorrectly allowed the application filed by the petitioner. Learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent further submits that certificate dated 16.12.2019 was\n\nsubmitted before the learned Family Court, therefore there is sufficient\n\ncompliance of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 65-B</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">             Mr. Goyal, learned senior counsel, further argues that the\n\napplication for placing on record the supplementary affidavit along with CD\n\nwas filed well before cross-examination of the husband. Therefore, no\n\nprejudice was caused to the petitioner. It is thus prayed that the impugned\n\norder be upheld. Learned counsel further submits that the learned Family\n\nCourt should be directed to conclude the proceedings in a time bound\n\nmanner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone\n\nthrough the files with their able assistance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">             Respondent-husband in this case filed a petition under <a href=\"/doc/40332/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n\n13</a> of the Act, seeking dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce on\n\nvarious grounds. Admittedly, there is no mention of the conversations\n\nrecorded by the husband between the years 2010 to 2016 in the said petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">                                      4 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 23-01-2022 12:08:50 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> CR No. 1616 of 2020 and CR No. 2538 of 2020 (O&amp;M)                       5</span>\n\nThere is no mention on these conversations in the amended petition filed on\n\n03.04.2018 as well. It is further a matter of record that in the affidavit filed\n\nby the husband by way of examination-in-chief, there is again no mention of\n\nthese conversations. It is only on 09.07.2019 that an application is moved by\n\nthe husband to submit his supplementary affidavit by way of examination-\n\nin-chief along with memory cards/chips of the respective mobile phones, CD\n\nand transcript of alleged conversation/s so recorded in memory cards/chips\n\nof the respective mobile phones. It is stated in application dated 09.07.2019\n\nthat various conversations between the husband and his wife from\n\nNovember 2010 to December 2010, August 2016 to December 2016, were\n\nrecorded and stored/procured by him. These conversations were further\n\nrecorded on CD for convenience. It is further averred that due to\n\ninadvertence, specific mention of these conversations has not been made in\n\nthe earlier affidavit. It is thus evident that the husband was well aware of\n\nthese conversations which could very well have formed part of the pleadings\n\nat the very outset, but clearly did not find mention. Furthermore, there was\n\nno averment regarding these conversations in the amended petition or even\n\nin the affidavit dated 07.1.2018 tendered in examination-in-chief. Moreover,\n\neven if it is accepted that the general averments in the petition regarding\n\ncruelty would very well cover the evidence sought to be produced, in my\n\nconsidered opinion the CD&#x27;s in question cannot be permitted in evidence.\n\nThis is so for various reasons as dileanated in the following paras.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">             Before proceeding further it is relevant to note that without\n\ndoubt provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_14\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a>, have been diluted by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 14</a> of the Family Court Act, which reads as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;A Family Court may receive as evidence any report, statement,\n             documents, information or matter that may, in its opinion, assist\n\n\n                                      5 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 23-01-2022 12:08:50 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> CR No. 1616 of 2020 and CR No. 2538 of 2020 (O&amp;M)                     6</span>\n\n            it to deal effectually with a dispute, whether or not the same\n            would be otherwise relevant or admissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_16\">Indian\n            Evidence Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">            Clearly, the technicalities and procedures otherwise followed by\n\nthe Civil and Criminal Courts may not be applicable to proceedings before\n\nthe Family Court. There is in-fact no quarrel with argument of learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent that a Family Court is not bound by strict rules of\n\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_11\">At the same time, it cannot be ignored that acceptance of the\n\nCD in question shall amount to a clear breach of fundamental right of the\n\npetitioner-wife i.e., her right to privacy, as has been upheld in various\n\njudicial pronouncements. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in People&#x27;s Union\n\nfor <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_17\">Civil Liberties Vs.

The right to privacy- by itself- has not been identified\n            under the Constitution. As a concept it may be too broad and\n            moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy can\n            be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend\n            on the facts of the said case. But the right to hold a telephone\n            conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office without\n            interference can certainly be claimed as &quot;right to privacy&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">            Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate and\n            confidential character. Telephone-conversation is a part of\n            modern man&#x27;s life. It is considered so important that more and\n            more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their\n            pockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a\n            man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would certainly include\n            telephone-conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office.\n            Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the\n            Constitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure\n            established by law.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                     6 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 23-01-2022 12:08:50 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> CR No. 1616 of 2020 and CR No. 2538 of 2020 (O&amp;M)                     7</span>\n\n            Thus, recording of telephonic conversation of the wife without\n\nher knowledge, is a clear cut infringement of her privacy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18692050\" id=\"span_14\">Furthermore, it cannot be said or ascertained as to the\n\ncircumstances in which the conversations were held or the manner in which\n\nresponse elicited by a person who was recording the conversations, because\n\nit is evident that these conversations would necessarily have been recorded\n\nsurreptiously by one of the parties.

A married woman too has a\n             valuable right to her privacy of speach with her husband in the\n             confines of the bedroom.

Aspect about admissibility of evidence with reference to\n            provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_29\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> has indeed been\n            diluted by <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 14</a> of the Family Court Act. The question,\n            which still arises in the present case, is whether conversation\n            tape recorded by the husband without wife&#x27;s consent or without\n            her knowledge, can be received in evidence and be made use of\n            against her? That question has to be answered in an affirmative\n            no, as recording of such conversation had breached her &quot;right to\n            privacy&quot;, one of the facets of her &#x27;right to liberty&#x27; enshrined\n            under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. The exception to\n            privileged communication between husband and wife carved\n            out in Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act, which enables\n            one spouse to compel another to disclose any communication\n            made to him/her during marriage by him/her, may be available\n            to such spouse in variety of other situations, but if such\n            communication is a tape recorded conversation, without the\n            knowledge of the other spouse, it cannot be, admissible in\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                                     9 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 23-01-2022 12:08:50 :::</span>\n CR No. 1616 of 2020 and CR No. 2538 of 2020 (O&amp;M)                      10\n\n             evidence or otherwise received in evidence. The argument that\n             this would defeat right of fair trial of the petitioner-husband,\n             proceed on the fallacious assumption of sanctimony of the\n             method used in such recording and in that process, ignores the\n             right of fair trial of the respondent-wife. In a case like present\n             one, husband cannot be, in the name of producing evidence,\n             allowed to wash dirty linen openly in the Court proceedings so\n             as to malign the wife by producing clandestine recording of\n             their conversation.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"183755708\" id=\"span_25\">Keeping in view the factual matrix of the case, it cannot be said\n\nthat as the Family Court is not bound by strict rules of evidence, it is at\n\nliberty to accept the CD in evidence which is a clear cut infringement of the\n\nright of privacy of the wife.
