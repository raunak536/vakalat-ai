The allegation in Ext. P1 FIR is due to the enmity of the\n\n           accused in Crime No. 297/2017 of Nedumbassery Police Station,\n\n           arising from the arrest and implication of Sri. Dileep in the said Crime,\n\n           the accused        in Ext.

P4\n\n           order holding prima facie that the offences alleged                 were    not\n\n           attracted. Reference was also made to certain comments                 made in\n\n           the media about the manner in which this Court considered the bail\n\n           applications. The media was reminded               that its right to freedom of\n\n           speech and expression cannot be a license to abuse the justice\n\n           delivery system by persons who have little or no knowledge of the\n\n           fundamental legal principles.

It is further alleged that respondents 3 to 5\n\n           are leaking       out materials    allegedly collected during investigation\n\n           and including those from the in camera trial in S.C. 118/2018 and the\n\n           same is forming the basis for the false and fabricated stories in the\n\n           media. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"53672964\" id=\"span_7\">Though the judicial First Class Court, Angamally had passed\n\n           an order dated 17-1-2018, Ext.

It is further alleged that the trial in S.C. 118/2018\n\n           conducted in camera and inspite of the prohibition under <a href=\"/doc/1129858/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 327\n\n           (3)</a> of the Cr.P.C., publications in            violation thereof are being made\n\n           and Sessions Court had passed Ext.

It is alleged that         Mr. M.V. Nikesh\n\n           Kumar, is the Chief Executive Officer of the 6 th respondent and that\n\n           he was cited as a prosecution witness in the pending trial. It is further\n\n           alleged that inspite of Mr. Dileep filing OP (Crl) No. 23/2022 before\n\n           this Court seeking implementation of Ext. P6 order in which Ext. P7\n\n           order was passed by this Court, no effective investigation is being\n\n           carried out though cases have been registered against the CEO of\n\n           the 6th respondent.           Alleging that the 6 th respondent is resorting to\n\n           sensationalism/publication/broadcast of fabricated allegations against\n\n           the accused persons and their associates which is evident from Exts.\n\n           P8 to P11 and Ext. P12 reports by the other medias. Exts. P8, P8 (a),\n\n           P8(b) and P8(c) suggested that one Mr. Sarath, a friend of the\n\n           petitioner&#x27;s family is the 6th accused             in the case and several news\n\n           items implicating the said person                were   published.   As a matter of\n\n           fact, the application filed by Sri. Sarath              for anticipatory   bail was\n\n           closed as the prosecution conceded that there was no material for\n\n           implicating him. The 6th respondent had notwithstanding the above\n\n           factual position made several nefarious attacks on Sarath. Exts. P9,\n\n           P9(a) to (c) are also on same lines. The petitioner further states that\n\n           from the last week of February 2022 onwards, the media reports\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> WP(Crl.)

Dileep and it\n\n           was one Mr. Saisankar who allegedly did this. Several reports have\n\n           been published spreading stories about the destruction of data by Mr.\n\n           Dileep when the prosecution has not moved this Court which granted\n\n           bail pointing out the same if it were actually true.           Similar reports\n\n           about the surrender of Mr. Saishankar before the 3 rd respondent who\n\n           in turn made allegations about the lawyers appearing for Sri. Dileep\n\n           and the petitioner herein as could be seen from Exts. P10 (a), (b), (c)\n\n           and P10(d) respectively.

Audio recording\n\n           allegedly of the conversations between the petitioner and the above\n\n           mentioned Sarath          and    between the petitioner      and     his family\n\n           members etc. were leaked out and the copies of the reports published\n\n           in the Reporter Online Portal regarding the audio clippings are marked\n\n           as Exts.

The learned Senior Counsel reiterating the contentions\n\n           raised in the Writ Petition points out that the contents of Exts. P8 to\n\n           P11 clearly prove that there is a trial by media with respect to the\n\n           aforesaid crime and the Sessions Case. He also points out that these\n\n           reports would clearly show that there has been selective leaking of\n\n           information allegedly gathered during the investigation by respondents\n\n           3 to 5.       It is further   argued     that    inspite of the orders and the\n\n           orders of the Magistrate Court in Ext. P5 and               the orders of the\n\n           Sessions Court in Ext. P6 concerning the publication of the details of\n\n           the court, the 6th respondent as well as the other media are reporting\n\n           matters as explained in paragraphs 10 to 16 of the writ petition. They\n\n           clearly interfere      with the administration of justice besides causing\n\n           prejudice to the writ petitioner.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"158887669\" id=\"span_23\">Reports made against the petitioner\n\n           and his close relatives involved in the crime and in the Sessions Case\n\n           are damaging their reputation. The learned Senior Counsel submits\n\n           that a free trial is hampered by the actions of the 6 th respondent with\n\n           the help given by respondents 3 to 5. He, therefore, prays for the\n\n           interim orders sought for.

Sri. Gracious Kuriakose, the learned Senior Advocate and\n\n           Additional Director General of Prosecution on the other hand contends\n\n           that the petitioner has no locus to file the Writ Petition as he is not an\n\n           accused in the Sessions Case mentioned above and             that he is an\n\n           accused only in the crime registered subsequently which is         only at\n\n           the investigation stage, there is no question of passing any interim\n\n           order as sought        for, since the crime in which the petitioner is the\n\n           accused is not pending trial. He also submits that the media would\n\n           have        got the materials from the documents produced before this\n\n           Court in the various proceedings including in the applications of bail\n\n           and thus reporting of the same cannot be said to be illegal. He further\n\n           argues that the second relief sought for in the writ petition cannot be\n\n           granted       as no such demand       in that line has been made to the\n\n           respondents before filing the writ petition and since that relief itself\n\n           cannot be granted, there cannot           be any interim order granted   on\n\n           same lines.

Sri. Grashious also submitted that respondents 1 to 5 had\n\n           noting to do with the report in Ext.

A larger negative impact to a\n\n           trial by media,      a more subtle one which often goes unnoticed also\n\n           needs a mention.         In a trial by media which        apart from adversely\n\n           affecting the rights of an accused for a fair trial has immense power to\n\n           influence public opinion.

Such persons are more\n\n           comfortable with the version that the media has given him. This loss\n\n           of faith in justice delivery system is aggravated when the judge, not\n\n           the judgment itself is        subjected to media criticism. In such cases,\n\n           trial by media results        in denigration of the justice delivery system\n\n           which without        doubt, is the very foundation of the rule of law in any\n\n           democratic set up.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">                   18.

There is a growing tendency\n                          among investigating officers (either police or other\n                          departments) to inform the media, even before the\n                          completion of investigation, that they have caught a\n                          criminal or an offender. Such crude attempts to claim\n                          credit for imaginary investigational breakthroughs should\n                          be curbed.

Similarly,\n                          when someone voluntarily declares the money he is\n                          carrying, media is informed that huge cash which was not\n                          declared was discovered by their vigilant investigations\n                          and thorough checking.

The contention of the learned Addl. Director General of\n\n            Prosecution Sri. Grashious Kuriakose is             that the petitioner has no\n\n            locus to approach this           Court     cannot be   accepted   as there are\n\n            specific references in the reports about the petitioner.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">                       24. The 6 th respondent herein who is alleged to have telecast\n\n            items,      the contents of which are evidenced by Exts. P8 to P11 and\n\n            pleaded from paragraph Nos. 10 to 16 in the Writ Petition are if true l\n\n            be nothing but gross             interference in the     due administration of\n\n            justice.      It further shows the         propensity of the 6 th respondent to\n\n            publish/telecast such items despite the orders passed                on earlier\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\"> WP(Crl.)

P5, P6 and P7. The petitioners apprehension that\n\n            the    6th respondent        will indulge in similar telecasts in future has\n\n            sound basis. As stated above, since these reports interferes/obstructs\n\n            the due course of justice going by the principles culled out from\n\n            the various decisions of the Apex Court, the sixth respondent is to\n\n            be prevented from telecasting/publishing the reports in the nature of\n\n            contents revealed in Exts. P8 to P11 reports and P12. The propensity\n\n            of the 6th respondent is clear and therefore, a reasonable inference\n\n            about its continuance can be drawn. Considering the nature of the\n\n            contents of the publication/telecast in Exts. P8 to P11 and that those\n\n            materials had not been established in any legal proceedings, there\n\n            cannot be any         justification for permitting such publications. Thus\n\n            viewed, I have no hesitation to hold that the instant case warrants\n\n            the extreme step of passing directions against the 6 th respondent to\n\n            prevent such publications in future.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">                       25.
