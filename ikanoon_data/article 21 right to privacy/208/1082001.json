Considering the materials on record, this Court \n\n\n\nis of the opinion that it is no doubt true that the \n\n\n\nservice   provider   has   to   act   on   an   urgent   basis   and \n\n\n\nhas to act in public interest. But in a given case, \n\n\n\nlike         the         present         one,         where         the         impugned \n\n\n\ncommunication   dated   9.11.2005   is   full   of   gross \n\n\n\nmistakes,   the   service   provider   while   immediately \n\n\n\nacting   upon   the   same,   should   simultaneously   verify \n\n\n\nthe authenticity of the same from the author of the \n\n\n\ndocument.   This   Court   is   of   the   opinion   that   the \n\n\n\nservice provider has to act as a responsible agency \n\n\n\nand   cannot   act   on   any   communication.   Sanctity   and \n\n\n\nregularity   in   official   communication   in   such \n\n\n\nmatters   must   be   maintained   especially   when   the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                          28</span>\n\n\f\nservice   provider   is   taking   the   serious   step   of \n\n\n\nintercepting the telephone conversation of a person \n\n\n\nand   by   doing   so   is   invading   the   privacy   right   of \n\n\n\nthe   person   concerned   and   which   is   a   fundamental \n\n\n\nright protected under the Constitution, as has been \n\n\n\nheld by this Court.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">39.     Therefore,   while   there   is   urgent   necessity   on \n\n\n\nthe   part   of   the   service   provider   to   act   on   a \n\n\n\ncommunication,   at   the   same   time,   the   respondent \n\n\n\nNo.8   is   equally   duty   bound   to   immediately   verify \n\n\n\nthe   authenticity   of   such   communication   if   on   a \n\n\n\nreasonable   reading   of   the   same,   it   appears   to   any \n\n\n\nperson,   acting   bona   fide,   that   such   communication, \n\n\n\nwith   innumerable   mistakes,   falls   clearly   short   of \n\n\n\nthe   tenor   of   a   genuine   official   communication. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">Therefore,   the   explanation   of   the   service   provider \n\n\n\nis   not   acceptable   to   this   Court.   If   the   service \n\n\n\nprovider could have shown, which it has not done in \n\n\n\nthe   present   case,   that   it   had   tried   to   ascertain \n\n\n\nfrom         the         author         of          the         communication,         its \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                              29</span>\n\n\f\ngenuineness,   but   had   not   received   any   response   or \n\n\n\nthat   the   authority   had   accepted   the   communication \n\n\n\nas   genuine,   the   service   provider&#x27;s   duty   would   have \n\n\n\nbeen   over.   But   the   mere   stand   that   there   is   no \n\n\n\nprovision under the rule to do so is a lame excuse, \n\n\n\nespecially   having   regard   to   the   public   element \n\n\n\ninvolved in the working of the service provider and \n\n\n\nthe   consequential   effect   it   has   on   the   fundamental \n\n\n\nright of the person concerned.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">40.    In view of the public nature of the function of \n\n\n\na   service   provider,   it   is   inherent   in   its   duty   to \n\n\n\nact   carefully   and   with   a   sense   of   responsibility. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">This   Court   is   thus   constrained   to   observe   that   in \n\n\n\ndischarging   the   said   duty,   respondent   No.   8,   the \n\n\n\nservice provider has failed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">41.    Of course, this Court is not suggesting that in \n\n\n\nthe   name   of   verifying   the   authenticity   of   any \n\n\n\nwritten   request   for   interception,   the   service \n\n\n\nprovider   will   sit   upon   it.   The   service   provider \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                              30</span>\n\n\f\nmust   immediately   act   upon   such   written   request   but \n\n\n\nwhen         the         communication            bristles         with         gross \n\n\n\nmistakes, as in the present case, it is the duty of \n\n\n\nthe   service   provider   to   simultaneously   verify   its \n\n\n\nauthenticity   while   at   the   same   time   also   act   upon \n\n\n\nit.   The   Central   Government   must,   therefore,   frame \n\n\n\ncertain   statutory   guidelines   in   this   regard   to \n\n\n\nprevent   interception   of   telephone   conversation   on \n\n\n\nunauthorised   communication,   as   has   been   done   in \n\n\n\nthis case.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">42.

It   is   very \n\n\n\ninteresting   to   note   that   when   the   petitioner   filed \n\n\n\na   detailed   affidavit   in   support   of   his   writ \n\n\n\npetition,   pursuant   to   the   order   of   this   Court,   the \n\n\n\npetitioner         admitted         that         he         relied         on         the \n\n\n\ninformation   from   the   same   Anurag   Singh,   and   the \n\n\n\nmain annexures to the petition, namely A and B were \n\n\n\nreceived   by   him   from   the   same   Anurag   Singh. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">Paragraphs 2 (2), 2 (3), 2 (4) and 2 (6) are based \n\n\n\non   the   information   received   from   Mr.   Anurag   Singh. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                    34</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">But  he  did  not  say  all  these  in  his  affidavit  when \n\n\n\nhe filed the writ petition on 21st January 2006.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">47.     It   may   be   noted   that   when   the   writ   petitioner \n\n\n\nfiled   the   petition   on   21st  January,   2006,   he   was \n\n\n\naware   of   an   investigation   that   was   going   on   by   the \n\n\n\nDelhi   Police   in   connection   of   the   forgery   of \n\n\n\nannexures   A   and   B.   Even   then   he   filed   the   petition \n\n\n\nwith         those         annexures          and         without         a         proper \n\n\n\naffidavit.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">48.     It   therefore   appears   that   the   petitioner   has \n\n\n\nbeen shifting his stand to suit his convenience.

On  the  basis  of  such  a \n\n\n\npetition, he invoked the jurisdiction of this Court \n\n\n\nand   an   interim   order   was   issued   in   his   favour, \n\n\n\nwhich is still continuing.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                        35</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">49.

This   Court   wants   to   make   it   clear   that   an \n\n\n\naction   at   law   is   not   a   game   of   chess.   A   litigant \n\n\n\nwho         comes         to         Court          and         invokes         its         writ \n\n\n\njurisdiction   must   come   with   clean   hands.

Apart   from   the   aforesaid,   in   the   writ   petition \n\n\n\nwhich   was   filed   on   21st  January,   2006,   there   is   no \n\n\n\nmention   of   the   fact   that   the   petitioner   gave   a \n\n\n\nstatement   under   <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_41\">section   161</a>,   Code   of   Criminal \n\n\n\nProcedure   in   connection   with   the   investigation \n\n\n\narising   out   of   FIR   lodged   on   30th  December,   2005. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">From   the   records   of   the   case   it   appears   the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                              36</span>\n\n\f\npetitioner gave 161 statement on 13th  January, 2006. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">In   the   writ   petition   there   is   a   complete \n\n\n\nsuppression   of   the   aforesaid   fact.

In   that   factual   context,   total \n\n\n\nsuppression   in   the   writ   petition   of   the   fact   that \n\n\n\nthe   petitioner   gave   a   161   statement   in   that \n\n\n\ninvestigation is, in our judgment, suppression of a \n\n\n\nvery material fact.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">52.    It   is,   therefore,   clear   that   writ   petition   is \n\n\n\nfrivolous   and   is   speculative   in   character.

In   the   last   noted   case   of  Dalip   Singh  (supra), \n\n\n\nthis   Court   has   given   this   concept   a   new   dimension \n\n\n\nwhich   has   a   far   reaching   effect.   We,   therefore, \n\n\n\nrepeat those principles here again:\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">       &quot;For         many         centuries         Indian         society \n\n       cherished   two   basic   values   of   life   i.e. \n\n       &quot;satya&quot;(truth)   and   &quot;ahimsa   (non-violence), \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                      41</span>\n\n\f\n       Mahavir,   Gautam   Budha   and   Mahatma   Gandhi \n\n       guided   the   people   to   ingrain   these   values \n\n       in   their   daily   life.   Truth   constituted   an \n\n       integral   part   of   the   justice-delivery \n\n       system   which   was   in   vogue   in   the   pre-\n\n       independence   era   and   the   people   used   to \n\n       feel   proud   to   tell   truth   in   the   courts \n\n       irrespective   of   the   consequences.   However, \n\n       post-Independence   period   has   seen   drastic \n\n       changes            in             our           value          system.                    The \n\n       materialism  has overshadowed  the old  ethos \n\n       and the quest for personal gain has become \n\n       so         intense                that          those          involved                   in \n\n       litigation do not hesitate to take shelter \n\n       of         falsehood,                     misrepresentation                          and \n\n       suppression                   of          facts          in         the         court \n\n       proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">\n\n       In   the   last   40   years,   a   new   creed   of \n\n       litigants has cropped up. Those who belong \n\n       to   this   creed   do   not   have   any   respect   for \n\n       truth.               They                shamelessly   resort                             to \n\n       falsehood                and             unethical                  means            for \n\n       achieving   their   goals.   In   order   to   meet \n\n       the   challenge   posed   by   this   new   creed   of \n\n       litigants,   the   courts   have,   from   time   to \n\n       time, evolved new rules and it is now well \n\n       established   that   a   litigant,   who   attempts \n\n       to   pollute   the   stream   of   justice   or   who \n\n       touches   the   pure   fountain   of   justice   with \n\n       tainted   hands,   is   not   entitled   to   any \n\n       relief, interim or final.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">61.

Following   these   principles,   this   Court   has   no \n\n\n\nhesitation   in   holding   that   the   instant   writ \n\n\n\npetition is an attempt by the petitioner to mislead \n\n\n\nthe Court on the basis of frivolous allegations and \n\n\n\nby suppression of material facts as pointed out and \n\n\n\ndiscussed above.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">63.    In   view   of   such   incorrect   presentation   of \n\n\n\nfacts,   this   court   had   issued   notice   and   also \n\n\n\nsubsequently   passed   the   injunction   order   which   is \n\n\n\nstill continuing. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">64.    This   Court,   therefore,   dismisses   the   writ \n\n\n\npetition   and   vacates   the   interim   order   and   is   not \n\n\n\ncalled   upon   to   decide   the   merits,   if   any,   of   the \n\n\n\npetitioner&#x27;s   case.

In   that   view   of   the   matter \n\n\n\nthis   Court   makes   it   clear   that   the   petitioner,   if \n\n\n\nso   advised,   may   proceed   against   the   service \n\n\n\nprovider,   respondent   No.8,   before   the   appropriate \n\n\n\nforum, in accordance with law.

However,   in   practice   they   are   frequently \n\n\n\nflouted   by   the   litigants   and   often   ignored   by   the \n\n\n\nRegistry   of   this   Court.   The   instant   petition   is   an \n\n\n\nillustration   of   the   same.   If   the   rules   for \n\n\n\naffirming affidavit according to Supreme Court were \n\n\n\nfollowed,   it   would   have   been   difficult   for   the \n\n\n\npetitioner   to   file   this   petition   and   so   much   of \n\n\n\njudicial   time   would   have   been   saved.   This   case   is \n\n\n\nnot   isolated   instance.
