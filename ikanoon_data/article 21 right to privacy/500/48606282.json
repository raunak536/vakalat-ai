Zakiya Luna has, in a 2020 publication, argued that\n             reproduction is both biological and political.90 According\n             to Luna, it is biological since physical bodies reproduce,\n             and it is political since the decision on whether to\n             reproduce or not is not solely a private matter. This\n             decision is intimately linked to wider political, social, and\n             economic structures. A woman&#x27;s role and status in\n             family, and society generally, is often tied to childbearing\n             and ensuring the continuation of successive generations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">             101. To this, we may add that a woman is often\n             enmeshed in complex notions of family, community,\n             religion, and caste. Such external societal factors affect\n             the way a woman exercises autonomy and control over\n             her body, particularly in matters relating to reproductive\n             decisions. Societal factors often find reinforcement by\n             way of legal barriers restricting a woman&#x27;s right to\n             access abortion. The decision to have or not to have an\n             abortion is borne out of complicated life circumstances,\n             which only the woman can choose on her own terms\n             without external interference or influence. Reproductive\n             autonomy requires that every pregnant woman has the\n             intrinsic right to choose to undergo or not to undergo\n             abortion without any consent or authorization from a\n             third party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">             102. The right to reproductive autonomy is closely linked\n             with the right to bodily autonomy. As the term itself\n             suggests, bodily autonomy is the right to take decisions\n             about one&#x27;s body. The consequences of an unwanted\n             pregnancy on a woman&#x27;s body as well as her mind\n             cannot be understated. The foetus relies on the pregnant\n             woman&#x27;s body for sustenance and nourishment until it is\n             born. The biological process of pregnancy transforms the\n             woman&#x27;s body to permit this. The woman may\n             experience swelling, body ache, contractions, morning\n             sickness, and restricted mobility, to name a few of a host\n             of side effects. Further, complications may arise which\n             pose a risk to the life of the woman. A mere description\n             of the side effects of a pregnancy cannot possibly do\n             justice to the visceral image of forcing a woman to\n             continue with an unwanted pregnancy. Therefore, the\n             decision to carry the pregnancy to its full term or\n             terminate it is firmly rooted in the right to bodily\n             autonomy and decisional autonomy of the pregnant\n             woman.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">             103. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_12\">K S Puttaswamy v.

The\n             autonomy of the individual was defined as &quot;the ability to\n             make decision on vital matters of concern to life. The\n             judgement delivered on behalf of four judges described\n             the right to privacy in the following terms:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                    &quot;297. ... Privacy postulates the reservation of a\n                    private space for the individual, described as the\n                    right to be let alone. The concept is founded on\n                    the autonomy of the individual. The ability of an\n                    individual to make choices lies at the core of the\n                    human personality. The notion of privacy enables\n                    the individual to assert and control the human\n                    element which is inseparable from the personality\n                    of the individual. The inviolable nature of the\n                    human personality is manifested in the ability to\n                    make decisions on matters intimate to human life.\n                    The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n                    matters which can be kept private. These are\n                    concerns over which there is a legitimate\n                    expectation of privacy. The body and the mind are\n                    inseparable elements of the human personality.\n                    The integrity of the body and the sanctity of the\n                    mind can exist on the foundation that each\n                    individual possesses an inalienable ability and\n                    right to preserve a private space in which the\n                    human personality can develop. Without the\n                    ability to make choices, the inviolability of the\n                    personality would be in doubt.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_18\">104. <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_15\">Importantly, Puttaswamy</a> (supra) also deals with\n             facets of reproductive autonomy.

The expert body\n             recorded that the victim had expressed her willingness to\n             bear the child and accordingly recommended the\n             continuation of the pregnancy. However, the High Court\n             directed the termination of the pregnancy on the ground\n             that the victim was mentally incapable of making an\n             informed decision on her own.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">             106. A three-judge Bench of this Court disagreed with the\n             High Court&#x27;s decision. In a judgment authored by K G\n             Balakrishnan, C.J., this Court emphasized that the\n             consent of the pregnant woman is an essential\n             requirement to proceed with the termination of a\n             pregnancy under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_21\">MTP Act</a>. It was held that the state\n             administration cannot claim guardianship of the woman\n             as she was a major. It was further held that the woman\n             only had &quot;mild mental retardation&quot; and was therefore\n             competent to give her consent in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(4)(a)</a>\n             of the MTP Act. This Court concluded that the state must\n             respect the reproductive rights of women with &quot;mental\n             retardation&quot; with regard to decisions about terminating\n             their pregnancy. In the process, this Court recognized\n             that a woman&#x27;s right to reproductive autonomy is a\n             dimension of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                    &quot;22. There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to\n                    make reproductive choices is also a dimension of\n                    &quot;personal liberty&quot; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a>\n                    of the Constitution of India. It is important to\n                    recognise that reproductive choices can be\n                    exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from\n                    procreating. The crucial consideration is that a\n                    woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily\n                    integrity should be respected. This means that\n                    there should be no restriction whatsoever on the\n                    exercise of reproductive choices such as a\n                    woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual\n                    activity or alternatively the insistence on use of\n                    contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are\n                    also free to choose birth control methods such as\n                    undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken to\n                    their logical conclusion, reproductive rights\n                    include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a\n                    pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\n                    subsequently raise children. However, in the case\n                    of pregnant women there is also a &quot;compelling\n                    State interest&quot; in protecting the life of the\n                    prospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\n                    pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions\n                    specified in the applicable statute have been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">WP(C) No.527/2023                                              Page 9 of 16</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">CM No.1259/2023</span>\n                     fulfilled.

More importantly, it also recognised that the\n             right to reproductive choice also includes the right not to\n             procreate.

A woman&#x27;s decision to terminate a\n                    pregnancy is not a frivolous one. Abortion is often\n                    the only way out of a very difficult situation for a\n                    woman. An abortion is a carefully considered\n                    decision taken by a woman who fears that the\n                    welfare of the child she already has, and of other\n                    members of the household that she is obliged to\n                    care for with limited financial and other resources,\n                    may be compromised by the birth of another\n                    child. These are decisions taken by responsible\n                    women who have few other options.

If a woman does not want to continue\n                    with the pregnancy, then forcing her to do so\n                    represents a violation of the woman&#x27;s bodily\n                    integrity and aggravates her mental trauma\n                    which would be deleterious to her mental health.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">             111.

Thus, while\n\nexercising the powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, this Court\n\nhas got wider powers than what is prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 3(2)</a> of the\n\nAct of 1971, which permits termination of pregnancy only when the\n\nlength of pregnancy does not exceed a maximum period of 24 weeks.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">17)   Having held that this Court does have power to permit\n\ntermination of pregnancy of a victim of rape who carries fetus of more\n\nthan 24 weeks, the next question that is required to be determined is as\n\nto whether the circumstances of the instant case warrant grant of such\n\npermission.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">18)   As already noted, the victim in the present case is aged only 11\n\nyears and she has been sexually molested at this tender age. She is\n\nstudying only in the 4th class and is expecting a great future ahead of\n\nher. If permission to terminate the pregnancy is not granted to the\n\nvictim, who has, admittedly, expressed her desire to terminate the\n\npregnancy, it will have serious consequences not only on her physical\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">WP(C) No.527/2023                                            Page 13 of 16</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">CM No.1259/2023</span>\n health but also upon mental health of the victim because she will have\n\nto live with the trauma and stigma of unwanted procreation throughout\n\nher life. This will not be in her interest and would also not be in the\n\ninterests of the child that may be born. In these circumstances, if\n\npermission is not granted to the victim to terminate her pregnancy, she\n\nwould be exposed to a miserable future. It is not in dispute that the\n\nfather of the victim has also expressed his desire that the pregnancy of\n\nthe victim needs to be terminated and for this reason, he has\n\napproached this Court by way of the instant petition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">19)   While this Court is of the opinion that the victim should be\n\npermitted to terminate her pregnancy, it is also to be taken into account\n\nthat she is at the advanced stage of pregnancy. Whether termination of\n\npregnancy of the victim at this stage would be medically feasible or\n\nwhether it would involve any danger to her life, are the issues which\n\nhave to be gone into by the experts in the relevant field, whereafter they\n\nhave to take a decision as to whether or not the pregnancy of the victim\n\nshould be terminated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\"
