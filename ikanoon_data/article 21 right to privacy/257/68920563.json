The facts are few. It is apparent that there is a trial going on in\n\nCC No.12/2004 (RC No. AC 0001/2003) before the Special Judge, CBI,\n\nPatiala House Courts, New Delhi.          In that case, the petitioner is an\n\naccused. The prosecution is seeking to use as evidence the material\n\ncollected pursuant to the seven interception orders mentioned above.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, the interception orders were passed\n\npurportedly under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_10\">Telegraph Act</a>, which\n\nprovision itself is unconstitutional and, as a consequence thereof, the\n\ninterception orders are void. It is further the case of the petitioner that the\n\nseven interception orders are, in any event, in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 5(2)</a> of\n\nthe said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_12\">Telegraph Act</a> and, therefore, the same should be declared as null\n\nand void. The petitioner also prays that this court should exercise the\n\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India to set aside and / or\n\nquash the order dated 02.11.2007 passed by the learned Special Judge,\n\nCBI, whereby the petitioner&#x27;s application under Section 395 of the Code\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                              Page 4 of 52</span>\n of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">CrPC</a>&#x27;) was\n\ndismissed. According to the petitioner, the case involved the question as\n\nto the validity of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_16\">Telegraph Act</a> and, therefore,\n\nthe application for reference to the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1786277/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 395</a>, CrPC\n\nought to have been allowed. It is furthermore the case of the petitioner\n\nthat the case pending before the said Special Judge involves a substantial\n\nquestion of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and the\n\ndetermination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case and,\n\ntherefore, this court ought to exercise the powers conferred upon it under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 228</a> of the Constitution of India by withdrawing that case from the\n\nSpecial Judge and thereafter either dispose the case itself or determine the\n\nquestion of law and return the case to the Special Judge for disposal in\n\nconformity with the decision of this court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.           Prior to considering the submissions of the learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner with regard to <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_20\">Telegraph Act</a>, it\n\nwould be appropriate to set out the provisions thereof. <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 5</a> of the\n\nsaid <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_22\">Telegraph Act</a> reads as under:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">             &quot;5.

After   reading   through    the   above    provision,     Mr    R.\n\nVenkatramani, the learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the\n\npetitioner, submitted that the powers under <a href=\"/doc/593470/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 5(1)</a> could be invoked\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                             Page 6 of 52</span>\n only on the occurrence of any &#x27;public emergency&#x27; or in the interest of\n\n&#x27;public safety&#x27;. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, there\n\nwas no &#x27;public emergency&#x27; nor was there any issue of &#x27;public safety&#x27; in\n\nthe present case. He further contended that <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 5(2)</a> also relates to\n\n&#x27;such occurrence of any public emergency&#x27; and also to a situation\n\ninvolving &#x27;public safety&#x27;.        Therefore, interception of messages\n\ntransmitted or received by any telegraph could be ordered under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n\n5(2)</a> only if there existed a situation of &#x27;public emergency&#x27; or it was in the\n\ninterest of &#x27;public safety&#x27;. Thus, according to the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, if these two conditions did not exist, there could not be any\n\norder for interception with regard to telephone. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_7\">It was further contended\n\nthat the power under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 5(2)</a> was very drastic and was absolutely\n\narbitrary.    Consequently, it could be used by the Government in an\n\narbitrary fashion. As such, <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 5(2)</a> was violative of the fundamental\n\nrights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_28\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_29\">, 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia. A reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_31\">Hukam Chand Shyam Lal v. Union of India</a>: (1976) 2 SCC 128\n\nas also to the Supreme Court decision in People&#x27;s Union of Civil\n\nLiberties (PUCL) v.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that it has\n\nbeen recognized in PUCL (supra) that telephone tapping amounted to an\n\ninfraction of the fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.        The very same decision of the Supreme Court also\n\nrecognized the fact that telephone tapping amounted to an infraction of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution unless it was saved by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_9\">The learned counsel also submitted that the expression &#x27;public\n\nemergency&#x27; and &#x27;public safety&#x27; were explained in <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_35\">Hukam Chand</a> (supra)\n\nand reiterated in PUCL (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_10\">7.           The learned counsel for the petitioner made a two-fold\n\nsubmission in the backdrop of the aforesaid decisions of the Supreme\n\nCourt.      His first submission was that <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 5(2)</a> was clearly\n\nunconstitutional inasmuch as it was amenable to arbitrary exercise of\n\npower. Secondly, he submitted that, in any event, the interception /\n\nphone tapping orders could only be issued in a situation which entailed\n\n&#x27;public emergency&#x27; or &#x27;public safety&#x27;.     According to him, a state of\n\nemergency did not exist in the present case prior to the issuance of the\n\nseven interception orders and the said orders were not in the interest of\n\n&#x27;public safety&#x27; as explained in <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_37\">Hukam Chand</a> (supra). Therefore, a\n\ndeclaration was sought by the petitioner that the seven interception orders\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                          Page 8 of 52</span>\n were in violation of the petitioner&#x27;s fundamental and statutory rights.</span> On\n\nthis foundation, it was urged on behalf of the petitioner that the trial court\n\nbe prohibited from using the materials collected pursuant to the said\n\nseven orders in the course of the trial pending before it.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">8.           It was also contended that this court should exercise its powers\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution to set aside the order dated\n\n02.11.2007 by which the learned Special Judge had dismissed the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/1786277/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 395</a>, CrPC for a reference to the\n\nHigh Court. It was contended that the learned Special Judge had failed to\n\nrealize that the case pending before the said Special Judge involved a\n\nquestion as to the validity of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_41\">Telegraph Act</a> and\n\nthat the determination of this question was necessary for the disposal of\n\nthe case. Consequently, the learned Special Judge, in view of Section\n\n395 (1), was duty bound to state a case and refer the same for the decision\n\nof the High Court. It was further contended that, in any event, the learned\n\nSpecial Judge could have acted under Section 395 (2) by exercising her\n\ndiscretion inasmuch as, even if the provisions of sub-Section (1) did not\n\napply, the case at least involved a question of law. Since the learned\n\nSpecial Judge did not make any reference under <a href=\"/doc/1786277/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 395</a>, CrPC, this\n\ncourt, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, ought to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 9 of 52</span>\n exercise its jurisdiction of superintendence under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 227</a> of the\n\nConstitution to set aside and quash the said order.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_13\">9.           In response to these arguments, Mr Dayan Krishnan,\n\nappearing on behalf of the CBI, submitted that, first of all, <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 228</a> of\n\nthe Constitution would have no application in the present case and,\n\ntherefore, the prayer for withdrawing of the case pending before the\n\nlearned Special Judge to this court ought to be rejected outright. In this\n\ncontext, he submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 228</a> of the Constitution could only be\n\ninvoked where the High Court was satisfied that a case pending before a\n\ncourt subordinate to it involved a &quot;substantial question of law&quot; as to the\n\ninterpretation of the Constitution and the determination of which was\n\nnecessary for the disposal of the case pending before the subordinate\n\ncourt. He submitted that a question already decided by the Supreme\n\nCourt can never be regarded as a substantial question of law. According\n\nto Mr Krishnan, the validity of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_47\">Telegraph Act</a> was\n\nto be considered as beyond reproach in view of the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_48\">Hukam Chand</a> (supra) and PUCL (supra). In both\n\nthese decisions, <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_50\">Telegraph Act</a> had been\n\nconsidered and the Supreme Court had not regarded it as invalid.</span> It was\n\ncontended that in PUCL (supra), <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 5(2)</a> was directly under\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                          Page 10 of 52</span>\n challenge, but in the course of the said decision, the Supreme Court noted\n\nthat the vires of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_53\">Telegraph Act</a> were not seriously\n\nchallenged and that the Supreme Court went on to prescribe the interim\n\nsafeguards till the rules were framed under <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 7</a> of the said\n\n<a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_55\">Telegraph Act</a> providing for safeguards.          It was contended by Mr\n\nKrishnan that these decisions and, in particular, the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in PUCL (supra) clearly indicates that the Supreme Court\n\nhad given its imprimatur insofar as the Constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_56\">Section\n\n5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_57\">Telegraph Act</a> was concerned. Therefore, according to\n\nhim, the same was not open to challenge and, consequently, no question\n\nof law with regard to the validity of that provision could at all arise as the\n\nsame had been settled by the Supreme Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">10.          In this very context, it was also submitted that even if this\n\ncourt were to hold that the seven interception orders were in violation of\n\nlaw, the evidence that was collected pursuant to the said seven orders,\n\nwould still be admissible as they were relevant.          According to Mr\n\nKrishnan, even illegally obtained evidence is admissible. This, according\n\nto him, was a common law principle which is well recognized in India\n\nand this issue also has been decided by several decisions of the Supreme\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 11 of 52</span>\n Court and other courts.

We may also point out, at this juncture, that the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner had referred to <a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_61\">State of Punjab v. Baldev\n\nSingh</a>: 1999 (6) SCC 172, wherein the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/558753/\" id=\"a_62\">Pooran Mal</a> (supra) was distinguished.</span></span>          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"558753\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1259796\" id=\"span_22\">However, Mr Krishnan\n\nsubmitted that the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_63\">Baldev Singh</a> (supra)\n\nwas purely in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_64\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\n\nSubstances Act, 1985</a> (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_65\">NDPS Act</a>&#x27;), which\n\nwas a special case and, therefore, cannot be regarded as having taken\n\naway anything from the Supreme Court decision in <a href=\"/doc/558753/\" id=\"a_66\">Pooran Mal</a> (supra).\n\nIt was, therefore, contended by Mr Krishnan that <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 228</a> of the\n\nConstitution could not be invoked at all in the present case as there was\n\nno substantial question of law which involved the interpretation of the\n\nConstitution.

The second point urged by Mr Dayan Krishnan was that the\n\nmatter was proceeding in trial before the learned Special Judge and that\n\nthis court is not at all required to go into the question of validity of the\n\nseven interception orders or into the question of exercise of the powers\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_69\">Telegraph Act</a>. That, according to the\n\nlearned counsel, is a matter to be gone into by the trial court. He placed\n\nreliance on the Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1287305/\" id=\"a_70\">State of Bihar v.\n\nP.P. Sharma</a>: 1992 Supp 1 SCC 222 and, in particular, on para 31\n\nthereof (per Kuldip Singh, J) which is to the following effect:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">             &quot;31.       Finally, we are at a loss to understand as to\n             why and on what reasoning the High Court assumed\n             extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226/227 of the\n             Constitution of India at a stage when the Special Judge\n             was seized of the matter. He had heard the arguments on\n             the question of cognisance and had reserved the orders.\n             The High Court did not even permit the Special Judge\n             to pronounce the orders.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">13.          Thirdly, Mr Krishnan submitted that the High Court generally\n\ndoes not entertain petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution when a\n\nfull-fledged trial is in progress, particularly, as the trial court is seized of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                              Page 13 of 52</span>\n the disputed questions of fact, which, this court in exercise of its writ\n\njurisdiction would not go into.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">14.          Fourthly, with regard to the order dated 02.11.2007 passed by\n\nthe Special Judge, whereby the petitioner&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/1786277/\" id=\"a_72\">Section\n\n395</a>, CrPC was rejected, Mr Krishnan submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 227</a> of the\n\nConstitution is not by way of an appellate jurisdiction. As such, it should\n\nnot be used as an appeal in disguise. He placed reliance on paragraph 28\n\nof the Supreme Court decision in the case of State, through Special Cell,\n\nNew Delhi v. Navjot Sandhu @ Afshan Guru &amp; Others: 2003 (6) SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">641. The said paragraph 28 reads as under:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">             &quot;28.         Thus the law is that <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 227</a> of the\n             Constitution of India gives the High Court the power of\n             superintendence over all Courts and Tribunals\n             throughout the territories in relation to which it\n             exercises jurisdiction. This jurisdiction cannot be\n             limited or fettered by any act of the State Legislature.\n             The supervisory jurisdiction extends to keeping the\n             subordinate Tribunal&#x27;s within the limits of their\n             authority and to seeing that they obey the law. The\n             powers under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 227</a> are wide and can be used, to\n             meet the ends of justice. They can be used to interfere\n             even with an interlocutory order. However, the power\n             under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 227</a> is a discretionary power and it is a\n             difficult to attribute to an order of the High Court, such\n             a source of power, when the High Court itself does not\n             in terms purport to exercise any such discretionary\n             power. It is settled law that this power of judicial\n             superintendence, under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 227</a>, must be exercised\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 14 of 52</span>\n              sparingly and only to keep subordinate Courts and\n             Tribunal&#x27;s within the bounds of their authority and not\n             to correct mere errors. Further where the statute bans\n             the exercise of revisional powers it would require very\n             exceptional circumstances to warrant interference under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India since the power\n             of superintendence was not meant to circumvent\n             statutory law. It is settled law that the jurisdiction under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 227</a> could not be exercised &quot;as the cloak of an\n             appeal in disguise&quot;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">15.          For all these reasons, Mr Krishnan submitted that the writ\n\npetition ought to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"698472\" id=\"span_27\">16.          Mr Dubey, appearing for the Union of India, submitted that\n\nthe main challenge of the petitioner is to <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said\n\n<a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_81\">Telegraph Act</a>.

He referred to the Supreme Court\n\ndecision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/698472/\" id=\"a_85\">State of Maharashtra v.

Consequently, what the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                              Page 15 of 52</span>\n court has to see is whether the procedure itself is fair, just and reasonable\n\nand not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive.</span> According to Mr Dubey, when\n\nthe PUCL (supra) case was heard by the Supreme Court, there was no\n\nprocedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 7</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_89\">Telegraph Act</a>. Yet, the\n\nSupreme Court directed a series of steps to be taken before passing an\n\norder of interception under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 5(2)</a>, till such time as the rules under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 7</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_92\">Telegraph Act</a> were framed. Mr Dubey submitted\n\nthat thereafter, Rule 419-A has been introduced in the said Telegraph\n\nRules which are virtually the same as the directions given by the Supreme\n\nCourt.    Therefore, it would be well nigh impossible to say that the\n\nsafeguards prescribed in Rule 419-A are not fair, just and reasonable\n\ninasmuch as they are virtually the same as the ones which find place in\n\nthe PUCL (supra) decision. That being the position, the validity of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_94\">Telegraph Act</a> cannot be questioned. Mr Dubey\n\nsubmitted that the PUCL (supra) case has already decided all the issues\n\nand now that Rule 419-A has been introduced with effect from\n\n16.02.1999, the safeguards are also in place and there is no scope for\n\nchallenging the validity of the said <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_96\">Telegraph\n\nAct</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                           Page 16 of 52</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"> 17.

It is, therefore, clear that, first of\n\nall, the court must itself be satisfied that a case involves the question as to\n\nthe validity of an act and that the declaration of which is necessary for the\n\ndisposal of the case.

First of all, we are in agreement with Mr Krishnan in view\n\nof the observations made by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/824650/\" id=\"a_111\">State v. Navjot\n\nSandhu</a>: 2003 (6) SCC 461, which we have already <a href=\"/doc/824650/\" id=\"a_112\">referred to above</a>,\n\nthat this is not a case for exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 227</a> of the\n\nConstitution and the same cannot be used as a disguise for an appeal\n\nwhich is not provided by the statute. Secondly, assuming that we agree\n\nwith the request of the petitioner and quash the impugned order dated\n\n02.11.2007, where does it take the petitioner. The fact remains that by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                           Page 19 of 52</span>\n quashing the order dated 02.11.2007, a reference to this court does not\n\nautomatically ensue.

At this juncture, it would be pertinent to refer to the provisions\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1908938/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 256</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which provided for a\n\nreference to the High Court. That was the avenue of proceeding from the\n\nIncome-tax Appellate Tribunal to the High Court prior to the introduction\n\nof Section 260-A which provided for appeals to the High Court. Under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1908938/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 256(1)</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961, an application could be\n\nmade requiring the Appellate Tribunal to refer a question of law to the\n\nHigh Court. Sub-Section (2) of Section 256 was specific, which entitled\n\nan aggrieved party to apply to the High Court in case the Tribunal refused\n\na reference under Section 256(1). If the High Court was not satisfied\n\nwith the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, it could\n\nrequire the Appellate Tribunal to state the case and to refer it to the High\n\nCourt. There is no provision similar to <a href=\"/doc/1908938/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 256(2)</a> of the Income-tax\n\nAct, 1961 in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_117\">CrPC</a> and, particularly, in Section 395 thereof. In the\n\nabsence of such a provision, we cannot assume such a power. And,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 227</a> cannot, in our view, be used for this purpose. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                             Page 20 of 52</span>\n prayer for quashing the order dated 02.11.2007 is, apart from being\n\nuntenable, of no consequence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">22.          We shall now deal with the prayer under <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 228</a> for\n\nwithdrawal of the case in conjunction with the prayer that <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 5(2)</a> of\n\nthe said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_121\">Telegraph Act</a> be declared as being unconstitutional and the\n\nprayer that the seven interception orders were in violation of the\n\nfundamental and statutory rights of the petitioner. The object of all these\n\nprayers, insofar as the petitioner is concerned, is that the material\n\ncollected pursuant to the seven interception orders should not be used\n\nagainst the petitioner in the pending trial. Mr Dayan Krishnan has raised\n\na very important issue and that is that, even if the said interception orders\n\nare held to be illegal, the material collected pursuant thereto would still\n\nbe admissible and, therefore, there is no question of invoking the\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 228</a> of withdrawing the case to the High Court\n\nor of this court going into the issue of validity of seven interception\n\norders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_38\">23.

Firstly, the\n             occurrence of a &quot;public emergency&quot; is the sine qua non\n             for the exercise of power under this section. As a\n             preliminary step to the exercise of further jurisdiction\n             under this section the Government or the authority\n             concerned must record its satisfaction as to the existence\n             of such an emergency. Further, the existence of the\n             emergency which is a pre-requisite for the exercise of\n             power under this section, must be a &quot;public emergency&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">             and not any other kind of emergency. The expression\n             public emergency has not been defined in the statute, but\n             contours broadly delineating its scope and features are\n             discernible from the section which has to be read as a\n             whole. In sub-section (1) the phrase &#x27;occurrence of any\n             public emergency&#x27; is connected with and is immediately\n             followed by the phrase &quot;or in the interests of the public\n             safety&quot;. These two phrases appear to take colour from\n             each other. In the first part of sub-section (2) those two\n             phrases again occur in association with each other, and\n             the context further clarifies with amplification that a\n             &quot;public emergency&quot; within the contemplation of this\n             section is one which raises problems concerning the\n             interest of the public safety, the sovereignty and integrity\n             of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with\n             foreign States or public order or the prevention of\n             incitement to the commission of an offence. It is in the\n             context of these matters that the appropriate authority has\n             to form an opinion with regard to the occurrence of a\n             public emergency with a view to taking further action\n             under this section.

The Supreme Court observed that\n\nthough the expression &#x27;public emergency&#x27; has not been defined in the\n\nsaid Act, the contours broadly delineating its scope and features are\n\ndiscernible from the section which has to be read as a whole. The\n\nSupreme Court further observed that the two phrases &#x27;occurrence of any\n\npublic emergency&#x27; and &#x27;in the interest of public safety&#x27; appear to take\n\ncolour from each other and this makes it clear that a &#x27;public emergency&#x27;\n\nwithin the contemplation of the said provision is one which raises\n\nproblems concerning the interest of public safety, the sovereignty and\n\nintegrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign\n\nStates or public order or the prevention of incitement to the commission\n\nof an offence.       The Supreme Court also observed that it is for the\n\nappropriate authority to form an opinion with regard to the occurrence of\n\na public emergency with a view to take a further action under this\n\nprovision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 23 of 52</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"> 25.          In PUCL (supra), the Supreme Court was considering a Public\n\nInterest Litigation (PIL) under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution in which the\n\nincidents of phone tapping had been highlighted. In that petition, there\n\nwas a challenge to the Constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said\n\n<a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_133\">Telegraph Act</a> and, in the alternative, it was contended that the said\n\nprovisions be suitably read down to include procedural safeguards, to rule\n\nout arbitrariness and to prevent indiscriminate telephone tapping. In this\n\nbackdrop, the Supreme Court held that a telephone conversation is an\n\nimportant facet of a man&#x27;s private life and the right to privacy would\n\ncertainly include a telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home\n\nor in the office. The Supreme Court was of the view that telephone\n\ntapping would thus infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India unless it\n\nis permitted under the procedure established by law. The exact words\n\nused by the Supreme Court are as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">             &quot;18.       The right to privacy -- by itself -- has not\n             been identified under the Constitution. As a concept it\n             may be too broad and moralistic to define it judicially.\n             Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been\n             infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of\n             the said case. But the right to hold a telephone\n             conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office\n             without interference can certainly be claimed as &quot;right\n             to privacy&quot;. Conversations on the telephone are often of\n             an intimate and confidential character. Telephone\n             conversation is a part of modern man&#x27;s life. It is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                          Page 24 of 52</span>\n              considered so important that more and more people are\n             carrying mobile telephone instruments in their pockets.\n             Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man&#x27;s\n             private life. Right to privacy would certainly include\n             telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or\n             office. Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_135\">Article\n             21</a> of the Constitution of India unless it is permitted\n             under the procedure established by law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">26.          The Supreme Court then, in PUCL (supra), examined the\n\nissue as to whether telephone tapping, in any way, impinged upon the\n\nright to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 19 (1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">(a) of the Constitution. In this context, the Supreme Court held as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">             &quot;19. Right to freedom of speech and expression is\n             guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.\n             This freedom means the right to express one&#x27;s\n             convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth,\n             writing, printing, picture, or in any other manner. When\n             a person is talking on telephone, he is exercising his\n             right to freedom of speech and expression.

It is apparent from the above extracts from the PUCL (supra)\n\ndecision that the Supreme Court had taken a clear view that telephone\n\ntapping would infract <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution unless it came\n\nwithin the grounds of restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 19(2).</a> The Supreme\n\nCourt was also of the view that telephone tapping would violate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_142\">Article\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                          Page 25 of 52</span>\n 21</a> of the Constitution unless it was permitted under a procedure\n\nestablished by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">28.          The Supreme Court in PUCL (supra), in this backdrop,\n\nnoticed that the Constitutional vires of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_144\">Telegraph\n\nAct</a> was not seriously challenged.

The above analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\n             Act shows that so far the power to intercept\n             messages/conversations is concerned the section clearly\n             lays down the situations/conditions under which it can\n             be exercised. But the substantive law as laid down in\n             <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act must have procedural backing\n             so that the exercise of power is fair and reasonable.

The Supreme Court, therefore, agreed with the submission\n\nthat no procedure had been prescribed for the exercise of the power under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_163\">Telegraph Act</a> as it was not disputed that Rules\n\nhad not been framed, by then, under <a href=\"/doc/179207/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 7(2)(b)</a> of that Act for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                              Page 28 of 52</span>\n providing the precautions to be taken for preventing the improper\n\ninterception and disclosure of messages.

The Supreme Court observed that it was entirely\n\nfor the Central Government to make such rules on the subject, but till the\n\ntime that was done, the right to privacy of an individual had to be\n\nsafeguarded and in order to rule out arbitrariness in exercise of the power\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_168\">Telegraph Act</a>, it was necessary to lay\n\ndown procedural safeguards for the exercise of power under the said\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 5(2)</a> so that the right of privacy of a person is protected.

It is entirely for the Central Government to\n             make rules on the subject but till the time it is done the\n             right to privacy of an individual has to be safeguarded.\n             In order to rule out arbitrariness in the exercise of\n             power under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act and till the time the\n             Central Government lays down just, fair and reasonable\n             procedure under <a href=\"/doc/179207/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 7(2)(b)</a> of the Act, it is\n             necessary to lay down procedural safeguards for the\n             exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act so that\n             the right to privacy of a person is protected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">             35.

It is obvious that Mr Krishnan is right in contending that a\n\nquestion of law, which has been settled by the Supreme Court, however,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                           Page 36 of 52</span>\n important or difficult it may have been regarded in the past and whatever\n\nbe the magnitude of its effect on any of the parties, cannot be regarded as\n\na substantial question of law. It is obvious that the questions with regard\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_210\">Telegraph Act</a> already stand settled by the\n\nSupreme Court in PUCL (supra) and the parameters for its functioning\n\nare already clearly laid out. It is for the courts to examine the facts of\n\neach case and to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the parameters have\n\nbeen transgressed in each individual case or not. The question would be\n\none of fact and not of law and certainly not a substantial question of law.\n\nTherefore, we agree with the submission of Mr Krishnan that this is not a\n\ncase in which we can invoke <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_211\">Article 228</a> of the Constitution and\n\nwithdraw the case pending before the learned Special Judge.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">36.          The submission of Mr Krishnan that, in any event, no question\n\nof law as such arises for consideration because even if the evidence is\n\ngathered illegally, the same would still be admissible, needs to be\n\nconsidered. The submission was that even if, on the facts of the present\n\ncase, the trial court came to the conclusion that the seven interception\n\norders in question were illegal in the sense that there was some\n\ncontravention of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 5(2)</a> of the said <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_213\">Telegraph Act</a>\n\nor of Rule 419-A of the said Telegraph Rules, the same would not, in any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                          Page 37 of 52</span>\n event, enable the trial court to detract from the position that the material\n\ncollected pursuant to the said orders would be admissible, as long as they\n\nwere relevant.

Next, Mr. Das has attacked the searches and\n             has urged that, even if there was jurisdiction to direct\n             the issue of search warrants, as I hold there was, still the\n             provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_215\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> have been\n             completely disregarded. On this assumption he has\n             contended that the evidence discovered by the searches\n             is not admissible, but to this view I cannot accede. For,\n             without in any way countenancing disregard of the\n             provisions prescribed by the Code, I hold that what\n             would otherwise be relevant does not become irrelevant\n             because it was discovered in the course of a search in\n             which those provisions were disregarded. As\n             Jimutavahana with his shrewd common sense observes-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">             -&quot;a fact cannot be altered by 100 texts,&quot; and as his\n             commentator quaintly remarks: &quot;If a Brahmana be slain,\n             the precept &#x27;slay not a Brahmana&#x27; does not annul the\n             murder.&quot; But the absence of the precautions designed\n             by the legislature lends support to the argument that the\n             alleged discovery should be carefully scrutinized. In\n             this case there do seem to have been some irregularities,\n             In the case of some searches there were not the two\n             witnesses directed by the Code, while in the case of\n             others it is at least problematical whether the witnesses\n             called in comply with the statutory test of being\n             &quot;respectable inhabitants of the locality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                              Page 38 of 52</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\"> 38.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1179783\" id=\"span_64\">In <a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_216\">R.M.

It was said by counsel for the appellant that\n             the tape recorded conversation was obtained by illegal\n             means. The illegality was said to be contravention of\n             <a href=\"/doc/1034087/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 25</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act. There is no\n             violation of Section 25 of the Telagraph Act in the facts\n             and circumstances of the present case. There is warrant\n             for proposition that even if evidence is illegally\n             obtained it is admissible. Over a century ago it was\n             said in an English case where a constable searched the\n             appellant illegally and found a quantity of offending\n             article in his pocket that it would be a dangerous\n             obstacle to the administration of justice if it were held,\n             because evidence was obtained by illegal means, it\n             could not be used against a party charged with an\n             offence. See Jones v. Owen [ (1870) 34 JP 759] . The\n             Judicial Committee in Kuruma, Son of Kanju v. R. [\n             1955 AC 197] dealt with the conviction of an accused\n             of being in unlawful possession of ammunition which\n             had been discovered in consequence of a search of his\n             person by a police officer below the rank of those who\n             were permitted to make such searches. The Judicial\n             Committee held that the evidence was rightly admitted.\n             The reason given was that if evidence was admissible it\n             matters not how it was obtained. There is of course\n             always a word of caution. It is that the Judge has a\n             discretion to disallow evidence in a criminal case if the\n             strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly\n             against the accused. That caution is the golden rule in\n             criminal jurisprudence.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 39 of 52</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">              30.        It was said that the admissibility of the tape\n             recorded evidence offended <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_218\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_219\">21</a> of the\n             Constitution. The submission was that the manner of\n             acquiring the tape-recorded conversation was not\n             procedure established by law and the appellant was\n             incriminated. The appellant&#x27;s conversation was\n             voluntary. There was no compulsion. The attaching of\n             the tape-recording instrument was unknown to the\n             appellant. That fact does not render the evidence of\n             conversation inadmissible. The appellant&#x27;s conversation\n             was not extracted under duress or compulsion. If the\n             conversation was recorded on the tape it was a\n             mechanical contrivance to play the role of an\n             eavesdropper. In R. v. Leatham[ (1961) 8 Cox CC 498]\n             it was said &quot;it matters not how you get it if you steal it\n             even, it would be admissible in evidence&quot;. As long as it\n             is not tainted by an inadmissible confession of guilt\n             evidence even if it is illegally obtained is admissible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">             31.         There is no scope for holding that the\n             appellant was made to incriminate himself. At the time\n             of the conversation there was no case against the\n             appellant. He was not compelled to speak or confess.\n             <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 21</a> was invoked by submitting that the privacy\n             of the appellant&#x27;s conversation was invaded. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 21</a>\n             contemplates procedure established by law with regard\n             to deprivation of life or personal liberty.

The protection is not for the\n             guilty citizen against the efforts of the police to\n             vindicate the law and prevent corruption of public\n             servants. It must not be understood that the Courts will\n             tolerate safeguards for the protection of the citizen to be\n             imperilled by permitting the police to proceed by\n             unlawful or irregular methods.

Prosecution cannot be permitted to\n             take advantage of its own wrong. Conducting a fair trial\n             for those who are accused of a criminal offence is the\n             cornerstone of our democratic society. A conviction\n             resulting from an unfair trial is contrary to our concept\n             of justice. Conducting a fair trial is both for the benefit\n             of the society as well as for an accused and cannot be\n             abandoned. While considering the aspect of fair trial,\n             the nature of the evidence obtained and the nature of the\n             safeguard violated are both relevant factors. Courts\n             cannot allow admission of evidence against an accused,\n             where the court is satisfied that the evidence had been\n             obtained by a conduct of which the prosecution ought\n             not to take advantage particularly when that conduct\n             had caused prejudice to the accused. If after careful\n             consideration of the material on record it is found by\n             the court that the admission of evidence collected in\n             search conducted in violation of Section 50 would\n             render the trial unfair then that evidence must be\n             excluded.</span> In R. v.

The legality and admissibility of intercepted\n             telephone calls arises in the context of telephone\n             conversation between Shaukat and his wife Afsan Guru\n             on 14th December at 2009 hrs and the conversation\n             between Gilani and his brother Shah Faizal on the same\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                           Page 48 of 52</span>\n              day at 1222 hrs. Interception of communication is\n             provided for by the provisions contained in Chapter V\n             of POTO/POTA which contains Sections 36 to 48. The\n             proviso to Section 45 lays down the pre-requisite\n             conditions for admitting the evidence collected against\n             the accused through the interception of wire, electronic\n             or oral communication. Chapter V governing the\n             procedure for interception and admission of the\n             intercepted communications presupposes that there is\n             an investigation of a terrorist act under POTA which\n             has been set in motion. It is not in dispute that the\n             procedural requirements of Chapter V have not been\n             complied with when such interceptions took place on\n             14-12-2001. But, as already noticed, on the crucial date\n             on which interception took place (i.e. 14th December),\n             no offence under POTA was included whether in the\n             FIR or in any other contemporaneous documents. We\n             have already held that the non-inclusion of the POTO\n             offences even at the threshold of investigation cannot\n             be legally faulted and that such non-inclusion was not\n             deliberate. The admissibility or the evidentiary status of\n             the two intercepted conversations should, therefore, be\n             judged de hors the provisions of POTO/POTA. On the\n             relevant day, the interception of messages was\n             governed by <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_262\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885\n             read with Rule 419-A of the Telegraph Rules, 1951.\n             The substantive power of interception by the\n             Government or the authorised officer is conferred by\n             <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 5</a>. The modalities and procedure for\n             interception is governed by the said Rules. It is\n             contended by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n             the two accused Shaukat and Gilani, that even Rule\n             419-A, has not been complied with in the instant case,\n             and, therefore, the tape-recorded conversation obtained\n             by such interception cannot be utilised by the\n             prosecution to incriminate the said accused. It is the\n             contention of the learned counsel for the State Mr\n             Gopal Subramanium, that there was substantial\n             compliance with Rule 419-A and, in any case, even if\n             the interception did not take place in strict conformity\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 49 of 52</span>\n              with the Rule, that does not affect the admissibility of\n             the communications so recorded. In other words, his\n             submission is that the illegality or irregularity in the\n             interception does not affect its admissibility in evidence\n             there being no specific embargo against the\n             admissibility in the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_264\">Telegraph Act</a> or in the Rules.\n             Irrespective of the merit in the first contention of Mr\n             Gopal Subramanium, we find force in the alternative\n             contention advanced by him.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">             154.        In regard to the first aspect, two infirmities\n             are pointed out in the relevant orders authorising and\n             confirming the interception in respect of specified\n             telephone numbers. It is not shown by the prosecution\n             that the Joint Director, Intelligence Bureau who\n             authorised the interception, holds the rank of Joint\n             Secretary to the Government of India. Secondly, the\n             confirmation orders passed by the Home Secretary\n             (contained in Vol. 7 of the lower court record, p. 447,\n             etc.) would indicate that the confirmation was\n             prospective. We are distressed to note that the\n             confirmation orders should be passed by a senior officer\n             of the Government of India in such a careless manner,\n             that too, in an important case of this nature. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1179783\" id=\"span_97\">However,\n             these deficiencies or inadequacies do not, in our view,\n             preclude the admission of intercepted telephonic\n             communication in evidence. It is to be noted that unlike\n             the proviso to Section 45 of POTA, <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\n             Telegraph Act or Rule 419-A does not deal with any\n             rule of evidence. The non-compliance or inadequate\n             compliance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_266\">Telegraph Act</a>\n             does not per se affect the admissibility. The legal\n             position regarding the question of admissibility of the\n             tape-recorded conversation illegally collected or\n             obtained is no longer res integra in view of the decision\n             of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_267\">R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra</a>\n             [(1973) 1 SCC 471 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 399] . In that case,\n             the Court clarified that a contemporaneous tape record\n             of a relevant conversation is a relevant fact and is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">WP(Crl) No.1582/07                                            Page 50 of 52</span>\n              admissible as res gestae under <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 7</a> of the\n             Evidence Act. ...&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1179783\" id=\"span_99\">44.          It is apparent that the Supreme Court categorically held that\n\nthe question of admissibility of a tape recorded conversation illegally\n\ncollected or obtained was no longer in issue in view of the decision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_269\">R.M. Malkani</a> (supra), where the Supreme Court held that a\n\ncontemporaneous tape record of a relevant conversation was a relevant\n\nfact and was admissible. The Supreme Court clearly held that the non-\n\ncompliance or inadequate compliance with the provisions of the said\n\n<a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_270\">Telegraph Act</a> did not per se affect the admissibility.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">45.          Therefore, without going into the issue of whether there was\n\nnon-compliance of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 5(2)</a> or of Rule 419-A, it is\n\nclear that even if there was, in fact, no compliance, the evidence gathered\n\nthereupon would still be admissible. This is the clear position settled by\n\nthe Supreme Court and, therefore, no further question of law arises on\n\nthis aspect of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">46.
