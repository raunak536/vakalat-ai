What is this wonderful\nnotion? And what is the concept of justice in today&#x27;s time?\n                                                            Page 2 of 23\n\n\nThe concept of justice is as old as civilization and society. It is\ndeeply ingrained in the roots of our Indian Civilization. The\nword &#x27;Justice&#x27; finds its roots in the Latin term &#x27;JUSTITIA&#x27;\nwhich signifies righteousness or equity. It is also derived from\nthe French word &#x27;JOSTISE&#x27; which means uprightness, equity,\nvindication of right, administration of law.\n\n\nThe idea of justice is most frequently linked to the underlying\npresumption that justice is synonymous with the idea of equal\nrights and opportunities and to get fair treatment. Justice is the\nquality that ensures that each person receives their rightful\ncompensation in opposed to any violation or harm. Justice\nmeans to give each and every person what they deserve. Justice\nmeans the standard of rightfulness, by standard of rightfulness\none means to say that the minimum threshold should be\napplicable of what will amount to right or wrong. &#x27;Justice can\nalso be understood as the correct application of law, as opposed\nto arbitrariness&#x27;.\n\n\nA society cannot exist without the presence of justice which is\none of the most important pillars of any nation. Justice can be\n                                                            Page 3 of 23\n\n\nattained in the society only by correct interpretation and\nimplementation of Laws.\n\n\nThe perception of the concept of justice may change over time\nin every society. This can lead to differences in social and\nphysical systems. My aim today is to focus on philosophical\nand social interpretation of justice in India and the changes in\nthe definition of justice that have taken place in this society\nduring different periods of time and what Justice means in\ntoday&#x27;s date.\n\n\nThe idea of justice is so ancient that everything has been said\nabout it and at the same time, it is so modern that it constitutes\nan ever-changing context of contemporary society. From this\nperspective, we may say that justice has a traditional meaning\nand has also acquired a more technical and complex meaning in\nmodern times. Traditionally, justice was seen as a moral virtue\nof character as well as an important and desirable attribute that\na political society requires. For Plato, justice is &quot;giving to each\nperson his due&quot;. Justice in this sense involves the fair, equal,\nmoral and impartial treatment of all. In a simple sense therefore,\n                                                             Page 4 of 23\n\n\njustice traditionally means ensuring that fair results are\nproduced and each person duly receives what he is entitled to.\n\n\nWhen we look at the Modern view of justice in the context of a\nlegal system, natural justice is built into the legal rules and their\nobservance becomes compulsory in the realization of justice.\nJustice dispensed in accordance with such legal rules is legal\njustice. The Law determines what a person is entitled to and\nalso lays down the circumstances in which he can stake his\nclaim to such entitlement. A person so entitled or having a\nclaim is said to be a right -holder. Another, who has a\ncorresponding duty to recognize and respect the right of its\nholder, is referred to as the duty bearer. Where the law confers\nrights, justice is achieved when rights are enforced in\naccordance with the law. Where the right of another is not\nrespected, it amounts to the violation of the right of the former.\nIn case of a violation of his right, the right -holder would be\ncaused an injustice. This means that for justice to be realized,\nthe right -holder would require a remedy and this remedy is\nprovided by the courts. Hence the existence of a remedy is\ncrucial to the enjoyment of a right conferred by the law as\nwithout a remedy the enjoyment of the right becomes\n                                                              Page 5 of 23\n\n\nmeaningless. According to the modern view, justice is about\ntranslating the right into action.\n\n\nThus, we can say that the idea that justice as a moral obligation\nor a religious mandate in the ancient times got secularized with\nthe passage of time in the modern period thereby emphasising\nthe importance of access to justice in today&#x27;s date.\n\n\nWhen we talk about the Concept of Justice in India, we need to\nfocus on two things.       One is the traditional Indian (or the\nHindu) view of Justice and second is the concept of Justice\nenshrined in the constitution. The concept of justice has also\nbeen incorporated into the spiritualist philosophy of Indian\nthought. To the best of my knowledge there is no single treatise\non the subject of justice per se in traditional Indian literature;\nhowever, ideas related, directly or indirectly, to justice can be\ngleaned from the Indian scriptures and other philosophical and\nspiritual    literature   depicting    Indian     thought.        The\nDharmashastras, include some forms of justice under the rubric\n&amp; &quot;vyahar&quot;. The ancient concept finds justice as a recurring\ntheme in aphorisms, codes in various texts, anecdotes and\ndialogues. One important feature of the traditional Indian idea\n                                                            Page 6 of 23\n\n\nof justice that stands out is the predominance of religious code\nover legal code i.e., if there is a conflict between two legal\ncodes, equity should supersede law which means that fairness\nand equity is given more importance over legality.\n\n\nTo understand the idea of justice in today&#x27;s date, it is important\nto understand the concept of justice is enshrined in the preamble\nof Indian Constitution. The framers of Indian constitution were\naware about the need of establishing justice in a country\ntherefore they made sure that it is included in Indian\nconstitution. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_2\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_3\">, 16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_4\">17</a> of the Indian constitution\nalso reflect the idea of justice enshrined in the preamble of the\nconstitution. All these articles are incorporated under part III of\nthe constitution which gives fundamental rights to every citizen.\nProvisions relating to &#x27;Equal Justice and Free Legal Aid&#x27; are\nenshrined under <a href=\"/doc/169871995/\" id=\"a_5\">article 39A</a> of the Indian constitution. Which\ngive every citizen right to get free legal help from officers of the\ncourt. No one can be denied access to free legal aid. It is the\nduty of the State to secure that working of the legal system is\nbased on justice, it should provide equal opportunity, and also,\nprovide free legal aid, to ensure that any opportunity for\n                                                           Page 7 of 23\n\n\nsecuring justice is not denied to any citizen due to his economic\nor other disabilities.\n\n\nOne of the important concepts of justice as enshrined in the\nconstitution is the concept of Distributive justice. Distributive\njustice means fair distribution of resources among those who\nare in need of it. This has been described in <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 38</a> and <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_7\">39</a> of\nIndian Constitution. Natural justice, economic justice, political\njustice, social justice, and legal justice are a few examples of\nthe many diverse types of justice. Indian Constitution defines 3\ntypes of justice:-\nSocial Justice\nEconomic Justice\nPolitical justice\nSocial Justice\nSocial justice as a concept arose during industrial revolution of\n19th century. Different definitions of social justice is provided\nby different institutions, for few it is fair and comprehensive\ndistribution of goods among people for economic growth and\nfor few its equality of status among individuals.\n                                                            Page 8 of 23\n\n\nSocial justice means greater good for larger number of people\nand un-equals should be treated equally. The apex court in\nthe Kesavananda Bharati case held that social justice is part of\nBasic structure of the Indian Constitution.\n\n\nSocial justice means that equal social opportunities are\navailable to every person for personal development of every\nperson without any discrimination based on race, sex or caste.\n\n\nNo person should be deprived of social conditions necessary for\ndevelopment due to these differences. The concept of social\njustice is based on the practice of social equality. Social justice\ncan only be enforced in a society where exploitation of man by\na man is not present.\n\n\nIn the Case of S.R Bommai v. Union of India, the apex court\nheld that social justice and judicial review are two basic\nfeatures of the Indian constitution.\n\n\nEconomic Justice\n                                                            Page 9 of 23\n\n\nEconomic justice is somehow part of social justice itself; the\nIndian constitution visualizes socio-economic justice as\nincorporated under Directive principles of state policy.\n\n\nEconomic justice means providing economic opportunity,\neconomic equality and removing economic disabilities. It is\nalways implemented under the umbrella of Social Justice.\n\n\nEconomic justice means there should be economic equality\namong everyone in the society. There should not exist any\ninequality among individuals based on their economic status.\nNo one should be deprived of any opportunity due to his/her\neconomic status.\n\n\nEconomic status of any person should not be responsible for the\nlack of opportunities provided to him. Economic justice means\neradication of poverty by adding on to national wealth and\nresources and distributing this wealth equally among everyone\nwho contributes in its production.\n\n\nPolitical Justice\n                                                              Page 10 of 23\n\n\nPolitical   Justice   means    a      system   free   from   political\narbitrariness. There should be political fairness in the working\nof the government. Political status of any person should not\ngive him any advantage. In Raghunathrao Ganpatrao v. Union\nof India, the Court attempted to provide a meaning to the term\npolitical justice and observed thus: &quot;96. Political justice relates\nto the principle of rights of the people, i.e., right to universal\nsuffrage, right to democratic form of Government and right to\nparticipation in political affairs&quot;\n\n\nIn Canara Bank v. V.K. Awasthy, the Court highlighted the\nfundamental premise of natural justice and observed thus: &quot;9.\nThe expressions &quot;natural justice&quot; and &quot;legal justice&quot; do not\npresent a water-tight classification. It is the substance of justice\nwhich is to be secured by both, and whenever legal justice fails\nto achieve this solemn purpose, natural justice is called in aid of\nlegal justice. Natural justice relieves legal justice from\nunnecessary technicality, grammatical pedantry or logical\nprevarication. It supplies the omissions of a formulated law.&quot;\n\n\nReference could also be had to State Bank of Patiala &amp; Ors. v.\nS.K. Sharma wherein the Court had noted thus: &quot;32. Justice\n                                                           Page 11 of 23\n\n\nmeans justice between both the parties. The interests of justice\nequally demand that the guilty should be punished and that\ntechnicalities and irregularities which do not occasion failure of\njustice are not allowed to defeat the ends of justice. Principles\nof natural justice are but the means to achieve the ends of\njustice. They cannot be perverted to achieve the very opposite\nend. That would be a counter-productive exercise.&quot;\n\n\nAll these types of justice are closely related to each other. One\ncan&#x27;t be obtained unless and until the other two are present.\nSocial justice can be obtained only when economic and political\njustice is present. Indian Constitution under part III enforces all\nthree types of justice by making provisions relating to equality\nunder <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_8\">article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_9\">15.</a> Also in 2019, 103rd constitutional\namendment was enacted to ensure economic justice for\neveryone. The jurisprudence behind this amendment was\nimplementation of economic justice.\n\n\nThe Role of Judiciary becomes all the more important in our\nconstitution as judiciary is the protector of civil rights and it\nacts as a custodian of fundamental rights. It plays an important\n                                                          Page 12 of 23\n\n\nrole in enforcement of all three types of justice given under the\nIndian constitution.\n\n\nJudiciary has played an important role in the establishment of\njustice in the country and to make the concept of justice given\nin preamble a reality. The approach of judiciary has been\nprogressive in this regard and it has shown through its decisions\nthat justice is an essential ingredient of a developed and law-\nabiding society. In cases like Maneka Gandhi v. UOI (right of\nliberty) the court has enforced the concept of social justice time\nand again.\n\n\nThe role of judiciary has also changed over the years and the\ncourts have taken a more active role in realization of justice\nthrough judicial activism. In recent years, courts have risen in\npower across the world, and the Indian Supreme Court has\nrightly been pointed to as an example of this global trend. In\nmany ways the Indian Court has become a court of good\ngovernance that sits in judgment over the rest of the Indian\ngovernment. The Court has been able to expand its mandate as\na result of the shortcomings (real, perceived, or feared) of\nIndia&#x27;s representative institutions. The Indian Supreme Court&#x27;s\n                                                            Page 13 of 23\n\n\ninstitutional structure has also aided its rise and it helps explain\nwhy the Indian Courts have gained more influence than most\nother judiciaries in the world. The Indian Supreme Court has\nbeen called the most powerful court in the world for its wide\njurisdiction, its expansive understanding of its own powers and\nthe billion plus people under its authority.\n\n\nThe Doctrine of Basic Structure was propounded by the Indian\nJudiciary on 24th April 1973 in Keshavananda Bharati case to\nput a limitation on the amending powers of the Parliament so\nthat the &#x27;basic structure of the basic law of the land&#x27; cannot be\namended in exercise of its &#x27;constituent power&#x27; under the\nConstitution. What constitutes basic structure although not\nexplicitly defined, most of its constituents can be derived from\nvarious Supreme Court judgements over the years like\nsupremacy of the Constitution of India, Rule of law, judicial\nreview, federalism, secularism, Fundamental rights, <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 32</a>,\nbalance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles\nof State Policy etc. The basic structure of our constitution is not\nstatic but dynamic and continuously evolving.\n                                                           Page 14 of 23\n\n\nJudicial activism is seen as a success in liberalising access to\njustice and giving relief to disadvantaged groups because of the\nefforts of Justice VR Krishna Ayer and Justice PN Bhagwati. It\nis an effective tool for upholding the citizens&#x27; rights and\nimplementing the constitutional principles when the executive\nand legislative fail to do so. The shift from locus standi to\nPublic Interest Litigation has made the Indian Judicial process\nmore participatory and democratic. Judicial activism therefore\ncounters the opinion that the judiciary is a mere spectator.\n\n\nThe Higher Courts of the country innovatively interpreted the\nConstitution in a manner as to give effective rights to the\ncitizens which are important in day-to-day life. The framers of\nconstitution wished to empower citizens with certain rights\nwhich are levied as fundamental rights and they cannot be taken\naway by the government. In the years that followed, the\njudiciary, on its part innovatively interpreted the constitution\nand gave to us various rights like right to information, right to\neducation, right to free legal aid, to include right to live with\ndignity in right to life.\n                                                            Page 15 of 23\n\n\nBut we must also understand that Judicial activism challenges\nthe concept of separation of power of the three arms of the state.\nMany times, in the name of judicial activism, judiciary\ninterferes in the administrative domain and ventures into\njudicial adventurism or overreach. This is when judicial\nrestraint comes into picture. If judges are to freely decide and\nmake laws of their choices, it would not only go against the\nprinciples of separation of powers but it would also result in\nchaos and uncertainty in the laws.\n\n\nThe five rights that shaped India to my understanding are -\n  1.</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1903603\" id=\"span_1\">Substantive    equality   -     India   is   no   stranger     to\n     discrimination on the basis of sex.

Right to creative expression - The Courts in India have\n        developed the law and held that <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the\n        Constitution of India which states that, &quot;all citizens shall\n        have the right to freedom of speech and expression&quot;,\n        includes the right to creative expression. The philosophy\n        behind this Article lies in the Preamble of the Constitution,\n        where a solemn resolve is made to secure to all its citizen,\n        liberty of thought and expression. The Supreme Court has\n        recently said that when the ability to portray art in any\n        form is subject to extra constitutional authority, there is a\n        grave danger that fundamental human freedoms will be\n        imperilled by a cloud of opacity and arbitrary state\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                         Page 17 of 23</span>\n\n\n  behaviour. A declaration attributed to Voltaire: &quot;I despise\n  what you say but will defend to the death your right to say\n  it&quot; encapsulates the essence of the protection of free\n  speech. I may quote from the landmark judgment by\n  Justice Dr DY Chandrachud,         in the case of <a href=\"/doc/55820570/\" id=\"a_13\">Indibility\n  Creative Pvt Ltd versus Govt of West Bengal &quot;The</a> true\n  purpose of art, as manifest in its myriad forms, is to\n  question and provoke. Art in an elemental sense reflects a\n  human urge to question the assumptions on which societal\n  values may be founded. In questioning prevailing social\n  values and popular cultures, every art form seeks to\n  espouse a vision. Underlying the vision of the artist is a\n  desire to find a new meaning for existence. The artist, in an\n  effort to do so, is entitled to the fullest liberty and freedom\n  to critique and criticise. Satire and irony are willing allies\n  of the quest to entertain while at the same time to lead to\n  self-reflection.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_6\"> Third, is the -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">3.

The constitution of India recognizes the fact, how\nimportant religion is in the life of people of India and\nhence, provides for the right to freedom of religion under\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_18\">Articles 25</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 28.</a> The Constitution of India\nenvisages a secular model and provides that every person\nhas the right and freedom to choose and practice his or her\nreligion.

While <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 25</a> itself does not read\nany other condition into the protection of this right, courts,\nover the years, have ruled that the right would protect only\n&quot;essential religious practices&quot; and not all religious\npractices.

Right to privacy - which is now a fundamental right\n that does not need to be separately articulated but can be\n derived from <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_23\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">21</a> of the Constitution of\n India. It is a natural right that subsists as an integral part to\n the right to life and liberty. It is a fundamental and\n inalienable right and attaches to the person covering all\n information about that person and the choices that he/ she\n makes. It protects an individual from the scrutiny of the\n State in their home, of their movements and over their\n reproductive choices, choice of partners, food habits, etc.\n Therefore, any action by the State that results in an\n infringement of the right to privacy is subject to judicial\n review. A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the\n case of Puttuswamy v. Union of India declared the right to\n privacy as a fundamental right protected under Part III of\n the Constitution of India. In declaring that this right stems\n from the fundamental right to life and liberty, the Court&#x27;s\n decision has far-reaching consequences.

This decision has\n    connected our privacy jurisprudence over the years with\n    our international commitments and established our\n    conformity with comparative laws around the world.\n    The Supreme Court has also recognized sexual integrity as\n    an aspect of privacy and consensual sexual intercourse\n    between two adults of the same was decriminalized.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">And lastly and perhaps one of the most important is the-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">  5. Right to enforce fundamental rights - Our Constitution\n    has also put in place a legal mechanism through which a\n    person can enforce his fundamental rights where there is\n    an existing or threatened infringement to the exercise of\n    such rights. The law also stipulates the constitutional\n    remedies that can be sought and given to an aggrieved\n    applicant. The Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_25\">article 32</a> and the\n    High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution have the\n    power to issue suitable writs for the enforcement of a\n    citizen&#x27;s fundamental right. The fundamental rights created\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                        Page 21 of 23</span>\n\n\n    under the Indian constitution are necessary for a\n    democratic society and <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_27\">articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">226</a> are very vital\n    provisions, as they give citizens the remedy for\n    enforcement of the fundamental rightsmedium through\n    which they can enforce their fundamental rights and seek\n    appropriate remedies.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">Thus, the Idea of Justice is intricately interlinked with our\nConstitution. Just like our ever evolving and dynamic\nConstitution, the Idea of Justice is also forever evolving.\nRather, it is our evolving Idea of Justice that drives the\nevolution of our constitution. We can see examples of this in\nthe landmark changes made in our laws in the recent times like\ndecisions of the Supreme Court on Right to Privacy, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n377</a> of IPC, Coparcenary rights of Daughter under Hindu\nSuccession, Triple Talaq, access to internet as fundamental\nright, and many more.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">Thus, we can see that the Idea of Justice has forever been\nevolving since the adoption of our Constitution. The most\ngeneral way to understand the Idea of Justice can be to say that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                            Page 22 of 23</span>\n\n\nJustice is the enforcement of the fundamental principles and\nvalues enshrined in our Constitution, Justice is when a person&#x27;s\nfundamental rights are protects, Justice is when the State\nMachinery functions in accordance with the Constitutional\nprinciples and ethos, Justice is when the Constitutional Courts\nuphold the Constitutional Values. One might also say that to\ntest whether justice has been done or not, one can simply see\nwhether the act conforms to our Constitution, its fundamental\nprinciples and values. Justice is not mere literal interpretation of\nthe provisions of the constitution in black and white, but it is to\nunderstand the aims and objective of the particular provision\nand the principles outlined in our constitution by our\nconstitution framers.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">Our judicial system is the enforcer and protector of Justice. In\nthis 76th year of Independence, with the society evolving at its\nmost rapid pace, we have to focus towards the goal of a welfare\nstate. The Directive Principles of State Policy contained in part\n4 of the constitution set out the aims and objectives to be taken\nby the state. The idea of welfare state and constitution can only\nbe achieved if the state endeavours to implement them with a\nhigh sense of moral duty. We should strive to promote the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                         Page 23 of 23</span>\n\n\nWelfare of the people by securing and protecting a social order\nin which justice social, economic and political shall inform all\nthe Institutions of National life. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_11\">In the celebrated case of\n<a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_30\">Kesvananda Bharati vs State of Kerala</a> the Supreme Court has\nsaid that fundamental rights and directives principles aim at the\nsame goal of bringing about a social Revolution and\nestablishment of a welfare state and they can be interpreted and\napplied together and that they are supplementary and\ncomplementary to each other.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">With these thoughts, I conclude my views on our topic for\ntoday.
