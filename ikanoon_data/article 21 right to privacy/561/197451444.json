Both these\n                                                   rights embody the notion that a choice must inhere in a woman on\n                                                   whether or not to bear a child.

To be sure, there are some indigenous groups within our\n                                                          country wherein sexual relations outside the marital setting are\n                                                          accepted as a normal occurrence.
