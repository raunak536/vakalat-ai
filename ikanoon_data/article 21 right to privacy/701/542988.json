Despite the above, Hamlet&#x27;s dilemma of &quot;to be or not to\nbe&quot; faces many a    soul  in  times of distress,  agony\t and\nsuffering,  when  the question asked is &quot;to die\t or  not  to\ndie&quot;.  If the decision be to die and the same is implemented\nto its fructification resulting in death, that is the end of\nthe  matter.   The dead is relieved of the agony,  pain\t and\nsuffering and no evil consequences known to our law  follow.\nBut  if the person concerned be unfortunate to survive,\t the\nattempt\t to commit suicide may see him behind bars,  as\t the\nsame is punishable under Section 309 of our Penal Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3.

The judiciary of this country had occasion to deal with\nthe  aforesaid aspect; and we have three reported  decisions\nof  the\t three High Courts of the  country,  namely,  Delhi,\nBombay and Andhra Pradesh on the aforesaid question.   There\nis also an unreported decision of the Delhi High Court.\t  It\nwould be appropriate and profitable to note at the threshold\nwhat  the  aforesaid  three High Courts have  held  in\tthis\nregard before we apply our mind to the issue at hand.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1253283\" id=\"span_2\">5.   The  first\t in  point  of time is\tthe  decision  of  a\nDivision Bench of Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1253283/\" id=\"a_3\">State v. Sanjay  Kumar\nBhatial</a>\t in which the Court was seized with the question  as\nto  whether the investigation of the case under Section\t 309\nshould\tbe  allowed to continue beyond the period  fixed  by\nSection 368 CRPC.  Some loud thinking was done by the  Bench\non  the\t rationale of Section 309.  Sachar, J., as  he\tthen\nwas, observed for the Bench:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      &quot;It  is  ironic  that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  309</a> IPC still\n\t      continues to be on our Penal Code. ... Strange\n\t      paradox  that  in\t the  age  of  votaries\t  of\n\t      Euthanasia,   suicide  should  be\t  criminally\n\t      punishable.   Instead of the  society  hanging\n\t      its  head in shame that there should  be\tsuch\n\t      social  strains that a young man (the hope  of\n\t      tomorrow)\t  should   be  driven\tto   suicide\n\t      compounds\t its inadequacy by treating the\t boy\n\t      as  a criminal.  Instead of sending the  young\n\t      boy  to psychiatric clinic it gleefully  sends\n\t      him   to\t mingle\t  with\t criminals....\t The\n\t      continuance   of\t <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  309</a>  IPC   is\t  an\n\t      anachronism  unworthy of a human society\tlike\n\t      ours.

Soon  came the Division Bench decision of\tBombay\tHigh\nCourt  in <a href=\"/doc/490515/\" id=\"a_7\">Maruti Shripati Dubal v. State of Maharashtra2</a>  in\nwhich the Bench speaking through Sawant, J., as he then was,\non  being  approached for quashing  a  prosecution  launched\nagainst\t the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 309</a> of the Penal\tCode\non  the ground of unconstitutionality of the  section,\ttook\nthe  view  and\tthat  the  section  was\t ultra\tvires  being\nviolative  of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">21</a> and was  therefore  struck\ndown.  We would note the reasons for the view taken later.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"146939\" id=\"span_5\">7.   Close on the heels was the decision of a Division Bench\nof Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href=\"/doc/146939/\" id=\"a_11\">Chenna Jagadeeswar v.  State\nof A.p.3</a> in which on the High Court being approached against\nthe  conviction of the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_12\">Section\t 309</a>,  inter\nalia,  on  the\tground of the  section\tbeing  violative  of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_13\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">21</a> of the Constitution, the Bench held\tthat\nthe  section  was valid as it did not offend  any  of  these\narticles.  The Bombay view was dissented to; the reasons  of\nwhich also we shall advert to later.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217810\" id=\"span_6\">8.   The  unreported  decision of the Delhi High  Court\t has\nbeen  noted  in the articles of Shri B.B. Pande,  Reader  in\nLaw,  University  of  Delhi, as\t published  in\tIslamic\t and\nComparative  Law Quarterly [Vol.  VII(1), March 1987 at\t pp.\n112 to 120] and of Shri Faizan Mustafa, Lecturer, Department\nof  Law,  Aligarh Muslim University [(1993) 1  SCJ   Journal\nSection\t at pp. 36 to 42].  That decision was rendered in  a\nsuo  motu  proceeding titled as Court on its own  <a href=\"/doc/217810/\" id=\"a_15\">Motion  v.\nYogesh\tSharma4</a>.  The decision was rendered by Sachar,\tC.J.\nThe  Court once again pointed out the futility\tof  creating\ncriminal liability in suicide cases, but instead of striking\ndown  the section or declaring it invalid, what the  learned\nChief  Justice\tdid  was to quash all  the  119\t proceedings\npending\t in the trial courts on the ground that dragging  of\nthe prosecutions for years when the victims have had  enough\nof  misery and the accused also belonged to  poorer  section\nwhich added further insult to the injury, would be abuse  of\nthe  process of the court.  Being of this view, each of\t the\naccused was directed to be acquitted.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">9.   Striking  down of the section by the Bombay High  Court\nhas  come to be criticised by the aforesaid Shri  Pande\t and\nShri   Mustafa,\t so  also  by  Shri  D.C.  Pande,   Research\nProfessor, Indian Law Institute, in his article on &quot;Criminal\nLaw&quot; [of Annual Survey of Indian Law, Vol. 23 (1987) at\t pp.\n260  to 270 of published by the Indian Law  Institute].\t  In\nthe  &#x27;Editorial Note&#x27; titled &#x27;Taking One&#x27;s Life&#x27;  [(1986-87)\n91  CWN\t (Journal  Section)  at pp. 37\tto  40]\t the  Bombay\ndecision received some criticism.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.  Before   dealing  with  the  points  raised  in   these\nwritings,  it  would be worthwhile to note  that  Shri\tV.S.\nDeshpande  after  his retirement as Chief Justice  of  Delhi\nHigh Court had expressed his view on this question in his\n1  1987\t Cri LJ 743 (1986) 88 Bom LR 589: 1986\tMah  LJ\t 913\n(Bom)\n3    1988 Cri LJ 549 (1987) 2 Andh LJ 263 : 1987 APLJ  (Cri)\n110 (AP)\n4    Registered as Cri.\t Revision No. 230 of 1985\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">403</span>\narticle titled &quot;To be or not to be&quot; [(1984) 3 SCC  (Journal)\nat pp. 10 to 15] Shri Deshpande, after referring to what had\nbeen  held by this Court regarding the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article\t 21</a>,\ntook  the  view\t that if <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 309</a> is\t restricted  in\t its\napplication to attempts to commit suicide which are cowardly\nand  which are unworthy, then only this section would be  in\nconsonance with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a>, because, if a person having\t had\nno  duties  to perform to himself or to others\twhen  he  is\nterminally ill, decides to end his life and relieve  himself\nfrom  the pain of living and the others from the  burden  of\nlooking\t after\thim, prosecution of such a person  would  be\nadding\tinsult to injury and it was asked : &quot;Should a  Court\nconstrue <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 309</a> IPC to apply to such cases?&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">11.  Sometime afterwards appeared an article of Justice R.A.\nJahagirdar of Bombay High Court in the Illustrated Weekly of\nIndia  (September 29, 1985) in which the learned Judge\ttook\nthe  view  that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 309</a> was\t unconstitutional  for\tfour\nreasons: (1) neither academicians nor jurists are agreed  on\nwhat  constitutes suicide, much less attempted suicide;\t (2)\nmens rea, without which no offence can be sustained, is\t not\nclearly discernible in such acts; (3) temporary insanity  is\nthe  ultimate reason of such acts which is a  valid  defence\neven  in  homicides; and (4) individuals driven\t to  suicide\nrequire psychiatric care.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">12.  Apart from the aforesaid judicial and legal thinking on\nthe subject relating to justification and permissibility  of\npunishing a man for attempting to commit suicide, there\t are\nproponents of the view that euthanasia (mercykilling) should\nbe  permitted  by law.\tWe do not propose to  refer  to\t the\nthinking  on this subject, principally because the  same  is\nbeyond\tthe scope of the present petitions and also  because\nin euthanasia a third person is either actively or passively\ninvolved about whom it may be said that he aids or abets the\nkilling of another person.  We propose to make a distinction\nbetween\t an attempt of a person to take his life and  action\nof  some  others  to bring to an end the  life\tof  a  third\nperson.\t Such a distinction can be made on principle and  is\nconceptually permissible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">13.  Though what we propose to decide in these cases  would,\ntherefore, relate to the offence of attempted suicide, it is\nnonetheless  required  to be stated that euthanasia  is\t not\nmuch unrelated to the act of committing suicide inasmuch  as\nwherever passive euthanasia has been held to be\t permissible\nunder  the  law, one of the requirements  insisted  upon  is\nconsent\t of  the  patient or of his relations  in  case\t the\npatient be not in a position to give voluntary consent.\t The\nrelationship  between suicide and euthanasia has come to  be\nhighlighted  in\t a decision of the Supreme Court  of  Nevada\n(one of the States of United States of America) in Mckay  v.\nBergstedt5 where a patient filed a petition to the court for\npermitting  disconnection of his respirator.   The  district\ncourt,\ton the facts of the case, granted  permission.\t The\nState  appealed to the Supreme Court of Nevada which,  after\nbalancing  the interest of the patient against the  relevant\nState interest, affirmed the district court&#x27;s judgment.\t The\ncourt took the view that the desire of the patient for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">404</span>\nwithdrawal  of his respirator did not tantamount to  suicide\nthe  same was rather an exercise of his\t constitutional\t and\ncommon law right to discontinue unwanted medical  treatment.\nThis was the view taken by the majority.  One of the  Judges\nexpressed a dissenting view.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">14.  A\tcomment has been made on the aforesaid decision\t [at\npp.  829  to 838 of Suffolk University Law Review,  Vol.  25\n(1991)] by stating that the distinction made by the majority\nbetween\t suicide  and euthanasia because of  differences  in\nmotive\t and  mental  attitude,\t is  not  tenable  and\t the\ncommentator  referred to the dissenting opinion in which  it\nwas  observed  that the patient was in fact  requesting\t the\ncourt  to  sanction  affirmative  act  which  was   entirely\nconsistent with the court&#x27;s definition of suicide,  inasmuch\nas  the majority had defined suicide as &quot;an act or  instance\nof taking one&#x27;s own life voluntarily and intentionally;\t the\ndeliberate and intentional destruction of his own life by  a\nperson\tof years of discretion and of sound mind;  one\tthat\ncommits\t or attempts his self-murder&quot;. (This was indeed\t the\ndefinition  given  in  Webster&#x27;s  Third\t New   International\nDictionary, 1968.)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">15.  We\t may now note the reasons given by the\tBombay\tHigh\nCourt  in  Shripati case2 for striking down the\t section  as\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21.</a>  These reasons are basically three:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(1) <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> has conferred a positive right to live  which\ncarries\t with  it the negative right not to live.   In\tthis\nconnection  it\thas been first stated that  the\t fundamental\nrights\tare to be read together as held in R. C.  Cooper  v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">Union of India6.  Mention was then made of freedom of speech\nand  expression, as to which it was observed that  the\tsame\nincludes  freedom  not\tto  speak  and\tto  remain   silent.\nSimilarly, about the freedom of business and occupation,  it\nwas stated that it includes freedom not to do business.\t (2)\nNotice\twas  then  taken of the various\t causes\t which\tlead\npeople\tto commit suicide.  These being mental diseases\t and\nimbalances,  unbearable\t physical  ailments,  affliction  by\nsocially-dreaded   diseases,  decrepit\tphysical   condition\ndisabling the person from taking normal care of his body and\nperforming  the normal chores, the loss of all senses or  of\ndesire\tfor  the pleasures of any of the  senses,  extremely\ncruel or unbearable conditions of life making it painful  to\nlive, a sense of shame or disgrace or a need to defend one&#x27;s\nhonour or a sheer loss of interest in life or disenchantment\nwith  it, or a sense of fulfilment of the purpose for  which\none was born with nothing more left to do or to be  achieved\nand  a genuine urge to quit the world at the proper  moment.\n(3)  The  Bench\t thereafter  stated  that  in  our   country\ndifferent  forms of suicide are known.\tThese being:  Johars\n(mass suicides or self-immolation) of ladies from the  royal\nhouses\tto  avoid  being dishonoured by\t the  enemies;\tSati\n(self-immolation  by  the widow on the burning pyre  of\t her\ndeceased  husband);  Samadhi (termination of one&#x27;s  life  by\nself-restraint\ton breathing); Prayopaveshan (starving\tunto\ndeath);\t  and  Atmarpana  (self-sacrifice).   It  was\talso\nobserved that the saints and savants, social, political\t and\nreligious leaders have immolated themselves in the past\t and\ndo so even today by one method or the other and society\t has\nnot only\n6 (1970) 2 SCC 298 : AIR 1970 SC 1318\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">405</span>\nnot  disapproved  of  the practice  but\t has  eulogised\t and\ncommemorated the practitioners.\t It may be pointed out\tthat\nthe  Bench made a distinction between &quot;suicide&quot; and  &quot;mercy-\nkilling&quot;;  so also, between suicide and aiding\tor  abetting\nthe same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">16.  The Bombay High Court held <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 309</a> as violation  of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> also mainly because of two reasons.\tFirst, which\nact  or\t acts in series of acts will constitute\t attempt  to\nsuicide, where to draw the line, is not known some  attempts\nmay be serious while others non-serious.  It was stated that\nin  fact philosophers, moralists and sociologists  were\t not\nagreed upon what constituted suicide.  The want of plausible\ndefinition or even guidelines, made <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 309</a> arbitrary as\nper  the  learned  Judges.  Another reason  given  was\tthat\n<a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\t 309</a>  treats all attempts to commit suicide  by\t the\nsame measure without referring to the circumstances in which\nattempts are made.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">17.  The  first\t of  the aforesaid  reasons  is\t not  sound,\naccording to us,because\t whatever  differences there may  be\nas to what constitutes suicide,there is no    doubt\tthat\nsuicide is intentional taking of one&#x27;s life, as stated at p.\n1521 of\t  Encyclopaedia of Crime and Justice, Vol.  IV, 1983\nEdn.  Of course, there still exists difference among suicide\nresearchers  as to what constitutes suicidal behaviour,\t for\nexample,  whether  narcotic addiction,\tchronic\t alcoholism,\nheavy cigarette smoking, reckless driving, other risk-taking\nbehaviours  are\t suicidal  or  not.  It\t may  also  be\tthat\ndifferent  methods are adopted for committing  suicide,\t for\nexample,  use  of firearms, poisoning especially  by  drugs,\noverdoses, hanging, inhalation of gas.\tEven so, suicide  is\ncapable\t of  a broad definition, as has been  given  in\t the\naforesaid  Webster&#x27;s Dictionary.  Further, on a\t prosecution\nbeing  launched it is always open to an accused to take\t the\nplea  that his act did not constitute suicide whereupon\t the\ncourt would decide this aspect also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">18.  Insofar  as  treating of different attempts  to  commit\nsuicide\t by  the same measure is concerned,  the  same\talso\ncannot\tbe regarded as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 14</a>, inasmuch  as\nthe nature, gravity and extent of attempt may be taken\tcare\nof  by\ttailoring the sentence appropriately.  It  is  worth\npointing out that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 309</a> has only provided the  maximum\nsentence  which\t is  up\t to  one  year.\t  It  provides\t for\nimposition of fine only as a punishment.  It is this  aspect\nwhich weighed with the Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High\nCourt in its aforesaid decision to disagree with the  Bombay\nview  by  stating that in certain cases\t even  <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_29\">Probation  of\nOffenders Act</a> can be pressed into service, whose <a href=\"/doc/1678715/\" id=\"a_30\">Section  12</a>\nenables\t  the\tcourt\tto  ensure   that   no\t stigma\t  or\ndisqualification is attached to such a person. (See para  32\nof the judgment.)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">19.  We agree with the view taken by the Andhra Pradesh High\nCourt as regards Section 309 qua <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 14.</a>  But the Bombay\nBench itself was more involved with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> and violation\nof  it by Section 309, the reasons whereof have been  noted.\nWhether\t these\tare  sound and tenable, would  be  our\treal\nconsideration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">20.  The Bombay High Court&#x27;s decision2 led some thinkers  to\nexpress their own views.  We have noted who they were.\t The\nbroad points of their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">406</span>\nobjection/criticism  were  these:  (1)\tsuicide\t is  an\t act\nagainst religion; (2) it is immoral; (3) it produces adverse\nsociological effects; (4) it is against public policy  (This\nhas  also been the main argument of the counsel of Union  of\nIndia before us.); (5) it damages monopolistic power of\t the\nState,\tas  State  alone can take life;\t and  (6)  it  would\nencourage aiding and abetting of suicide and may  even\tlead\nto &#x27;constitutional cannibalism&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">21.  We\t shall\tin  due course\tsee  whether  the  aforesaid\nobjections raised\nagainst\t  the  Bombay judgment are valid.  Concerned  as  we\nare with the broad contention that Section 309 is  violative\nof  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article  21</a>, we shall first inform ourselves as  to\t the\ncontent\t and  reach  of this article and then  answer  in  a\ngeneral\t way as to whether a person residing in India has  a\nright to die.  Section 309 being a part of our enacted\tlaw,\nwe would desire to know what object a law seeks to  achieve.\nThis  section  having  made attempt  to\t commit\t suicide  an\noffence, we shall ask the question as to why is a particular\nact treated as crime and what acts are so treated.  We shall\nthen  apply  our mind to the purposeful query as  to  how  a\ncrime  can  be prevented.  Being seized with  the  crime  of\n&#x27;attempted  suicide&#x27;, we shall apprise ourselves as  to\t why\nsuicides are committed and how can they be really prevented.\nWe would also desire to know what type of persons have\tbeen\ncommitting suicides and what had been their motivations.  We\nwould  then  view  the\tact of\tcommitting  suicide  in\t the\nbackground of our accepted social ethos.

According\t to Indian  philosophy\tthat\n\t      which  is\t born must die.\t Death is  the\tonly\n\t      certain thing in life.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1510944\" id=\"span_25\">30.  May it be said that in <a href=\"/doc/1510944/\" id=\"a_51\">C.E.S.C. Ltd. v. Subhash Chandra\nBose27</a>\tit  has\t been opined by Ramaswamy, J.  (who  is,  of\ncourse,\t a minority Judge) that physical and  mental  health\nhave  to  be  treated as integral part\tof  right  to  life,\nbecause\t without good health the civil and political  rights\nassured by our Constitution cannot be enjoyed.\n(2)  Has a person residing in India right to die?</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">31.  If a person has a right to live, question is whether he\nhas  right  not to live.  The Bombay High  Court  stated  in\nparagraph  10  of its judgment that as all  the\t fundamental\nrights\tare to be read together, as held in R.C.  Cooper  v.\nUnion  of  India6 what is true of one fundamental  right  is\nalso true of another fundamental right.\t It was then  stated\nthat  it  is  not, and cannot be,  seriously  disputed\tthat\nfundamental  rights have their positive as well as  negative\naspects.   For\texample, freedom of  speech  and  expression\nincludes  freedom not to speak.\t Similarly, the\t freedom  of\nassociation  and movement includes freedom not to  join\t any\nassociation  or move anywhere.\tSo too, freedom of  business\nincludes  freedom  not to do business.\tIt  was,  therefore,\nstated that\n26 (1986) 2 SCC 68: AIR 1986 SC 847\n27 (1992) 1 SCC 441 :1992 SCC (L&amp;S) 313\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">410</span>\nlogically it must follow that the right to live will include\nright not to live, i.e., right to die or to terminate  one&#x27;s\nlife.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">32.  Two  of the abovenamed critics of the  Bombay  judgment\nhave stated that the aforesaid analogy is &quot;misplaced&quot;, which\ncould  have  arisen  on account\t of  superficial  comparison\nbetween\t the  freedoms,\t ignoring  the\tinherent  difference\nbetween\t one fundamental right and the other.  It  has\tbeen\nargued\tthat the negative aspect of the right to live  would\nmean  the end or extinction of the positive aspect, and\t so,\nit  is not the suspension as such of the right as is in\t the\ncase  of &#x27;silence&#x27; or &#x27;non-association&#x27; and  &#x27;no  movement&#x27;.\nIt  has\t also been stated that the right to life  stands  on\ndifferent footing from other rights as all other rights\t are\nderivable from the right to live.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">33.  The  aforesaid  criticism\tis  only  partially  correct\ninasmuch as though the negative aspect may not be  inferable\non the analogy of the rights conferred by different  clauses\nof  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 19</a>, one may refuse to live, if his life  be\t not\naccording  to  the person concerned worth living or  if\t the\nrichness  and  fullness of life were not  to  demand  living\nfurther.   One\tmay rightly think that having  achieved\t all\nworldly pleasures or happiness, he has something to  achieve\nbeyond\tthis life.  This desire for communion with  God\t may\nvery rightly lead even a very healthy mind to think that  he\nwould  forego his right to live and would rather choose\t not\nto  live.  In any case, a person cannot be forced  to  enjoy\nright to life to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"709776\" id=\"span_27\">34.  From  what\t has  been  stated  above,  it\tmay  not  be\nunderstood  that  according to us the right  encompassed  or\nconferred  by  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article\t21</a> can be  waived.   Need  for\tthis\nobservation  has  been felt because it has been\t held  by  a\nConstitution  Bench  in\t <a href=\"/doc/709776/\" id=\"a_54\">Olga  Tellis  v.  Bombay  Municipal\nCorpn.28</a>  that\ta  fundamental right cannot  be\t waived.   A\nperusal of that judgment, however, shows that it dealt\tmore\nwith the question of estoppel by conduct about which it\t can\nbe said that the same is a facet of waiver.  In the  present\ncases, we are, however, not on the question of estoppel\t but\nof  not taking advantage of the right conferred\t by  Article</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">21.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">35.  Keeping  in view all the above, we state that right  to\nlive of which <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article\t 21</a>  speaks of can be said to  bring\nin its trail the right not to live a forced  life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">36.  In this context, reference may be made to what Alan  A.\nStone,\twhile serving as Professor of Law and Psychiatry  in\nHarvard\t University  stated  in his  1987  Jonas  Robitscher\nMemorial  Lecture in Law and Psychiatry, under\tthe  caption\n&quot;The  Right to Die : New Problems for Law and  Medicine\t and\nPsychiatry&quot;.  (This lecture has been printed at pp.  627  to\n643 of Emory Law Journal, Vol. 37, 1988).  One of the  basic\ntheories of the lecture of Professor Stone was that right to\ndie inevitably leads to the right to commit suicide.\n28 (1985) 3 SCC 545 : AIR 1986 SC 180\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">411</span>\n(3)  Why  is  a\t law enacted?  What object(s)  it  seeks  to\nserve?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">37.  Section 309 being a part of our enacted law, let it  be\nknown as to why a law is framed or is required to be framed.\nTo  put\t it  differently,  what objects\t are  sought  to  be\nachieved  by  framing  laws.  For our purpose  it  would  be\nenough\tif  what has been stated by Shri M.  Ruthnaswamy  in\nChapters  5  and 6 of his book Legislation:  Principles\t and\nPractice  (1st\tEdn.,  1974)  (the  Chapter  headings  being\n&quot;Principles  of\t Legislation in History&quot;  and  &quot;Contemporary\nPrinciples  of Legislation&quot;), is noted.\t The learned  author\nhas  within  a\tshort compass  brought\thome  the  different\nprinciples  which  had held sway in different parts  of\t the\nworld  at different points of time.  Ruthnaswamy  starts  in\nChapter\t 5  by\tsaying\tthat it is  from  the  time  of\t the\nRenaissance  and  the Reformation when men, as a  result  of\nthese great revolutionary movements broke away from rule  of\ncustom\tand tradition, that legislation began its career  as\nan  instrument of social and political, and even  religious,\nchange.\t  The readers are then informed as to  what  Richard\nHooker\t(15541600)  thought on the question  of\t law  Which,\naccording  to  him, has to be influenced by  experience\t and\nsupported by reason.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">38.  The next important thinker of England after Hooker\t was\nthe  famous Francis Bacon (1561-1626).\tIn his\tEssays\t(the\nmost popular of his works) we find his views on\t legislators\nand  legislation.  Bacon stood out for progress and  utility\nand was of the view that it was not good to try\t experiments\nin legislation.\t As against Bacon there was Sir Edward Coke,\nwho was a defender of the rights of the Parliament.  Mention\nis then made about John Locke (1632-1704) according to\twhom\nthe  laws  made\t must  respect\tthe  right  to\tliberty\t and\nproperty; and laws must be made for the good of the people.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">39.  Ruthnaswamy  then\ttakes  the  reader  to\tFrance\t and\nmentions  about Montesquieu (1689-1755), who in\t his  famous\nSpirit of Laws published in 1748, which has been regarded as\na great classic of political and legal literature,  rendered\nimmemorial service to legislation and legislatures.  In this\nmonumental work, he insists that laws and legislation should\nbe  in\tconformity  with the spirit of the  people,  if\t its\ntraditions,  its  philosophy  of  life,\t even  the  physical\nsurroundings  of  the people, including\t the  climate.\t The\njourney\t is then to Germany, where Leibnitz  (1646-1717),  a\nphilosopher, mathematician and adviser of kings and  princes\nin  Germany and Europe, took the view that greatness of\t law\nis proved by the fact that great rulers were also great law-\ngivers.\t  Names of Augustus, Constantine and  Justinian\t are\nmentioned  in this regard.

The very definition of &#x27;crime&#x27; depends on the values of\na given society.  To establish this what has been stated  by\nJustice\t  Krishna   Iyer  in  his   book   Perspectives\t  in\nCriminology, Law and Social Change (1980) at pp. 7 and 8 may\nbe noted:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\t      &quot;What   is  a  sex  crime\t in  India  may\t  be\n\t      sweetheart virtue in Scandinavia.\t What is  an\n\t      offence  against\tproperty  in  a\t  capitalist\n\t      society  may  be\ta lawful way of\t life  in  a\n\t      socialist society.

Not only this, crimes can also be created or  abolished\nwith the passage of time, as stated at p. 7 of R.S.  Cavan&#x27;s\nCriminology  (2nd  Edn.). This has been\t elucidated  by\t the\nauthor by stating that in democracy where individual opinion\ncan  express  itself freely through  speaking,\twriting\t and\nelections,  public  opinion  becomes the  final\t arbiter  in\nplacing\t the  opprobrium of crime upon a  specific  type  of\nbehaviour  and\twhen a law is not accepted  the\t police\t may\nattempt to enforce it against public opinion, but  gradually\nthe  police yield to the pressure of public  opinion,  which\nthey perhaps share.

Dr Paranjape states  that  in\nthe   absence  of  a  single  theory   of   crime-causation,\ncriminologists\t have  offered\tdifferent  explanations\t  to\njustify\t their\town theory as an explanation  of  delinquent\nbehaviour.  There are, however, some writers who seem to  be\nconvinced that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">416</span>\nno  single theory of crime can fully explain the  causes  of\ncrime.\t They  therefore  prefer  a  multiple  approach\t  to\ncriminal  behaviour which suggests that crime  is  generated\nnot as a result of one solitary factor but as a\t consequence\nof a combination of such factors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">58.

The causes of suicides are many and varying inasmuch as\nsome  owe their origin to sentiments of exasperation,  fury,\nfrustration  and revolution; some are the result of  feeling\nof burden, torture, and sadness.  Some are caused by loss of\nemployment,  reversal  of fortune, misery  due\tto  illness,\nfamily\ttrouble and thwarted love.  Sometimes killing is  in\nopposition  to\tsociety\t and  sometimes\t in  opposition\t  to\nparticular persons.  This happens when the person committing\nsuicide\t nurses a feeling of unjust treatment,\tmaltreatment\nand cruelty. [See the Causes of Suicide by Maurice Halbwacks\n(translated  by Harold Goldblatt).] The Bombay judgment\t has\nmentioned many causes in paragraph 12 of its judgment  which\nhave been noted in paragraph 15 above.\tThe same may not  be\nrepeated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">(7)  Who commits suicide?

While on the question &quot;Who commits suicide?&quot;, it  would\nbe  relevant to state that there has been great increase  in\nthe number of commission of suicides.  In his aforementioned\narticle, Shri Faizan Mustafa pointed out that the number  of\nsuicides  by the youths below 18 in 1986 was 7545.  But\t out\nof about 60,000 persons who committed suicide in 1990 nearly\nhalf of them were aged between 18 to 25, which is  generally\nconsidered to be the best period of a person&#x27;s life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">71.

The figures collected for  the  first\nhalf   of  the\tyear  shocked  the  members  of\t the   State\nLegislature because of incredible 664 suicidal deaths over a\nsix-month  period, which was higher than the total  combined\nfigures for Calcutta and Hyderabad in the last three years.\n(8)  How suicide-prone persons should be dealt with?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">72.  We\t now come to the question relating to the  treatment\nto  be given to the persons who attempt to  commit  suicide.\nDo they deserve prosecution because they had failed?  is the\nall  important\tquestion.  The answer has to be a  bold\t NO.\nThe  reasons  are not far to seek.  Let us  illustrate\tthis\nfirst  by  referring  to the case of those  20\tpersons\t who\ncommitted  suicide  in Tamil Nadu distressed  as  they\tfelt\nbecause\t of  prolonged\tillness\t of  Chief  Minister,\tM.G.\nRamachandran.\tThat this had happened was published in\t the\nIndian\tExpress\t of 28-10-1984.\t Question is  whether  these\npersons\t would have deserved prosecution had they failed  in\ntheir  attempt?\t The answer has to be that there can  be  no\njustification to prosecute such sacrificers of their  lives.\nSimilar approach has to be adopted towards students who jump\ninto wells after having failed in examinations, but survive.\nThe  approach cannot be different qua those  girls/boys\t who\nresent arranged marriages and prefer to die, but  ultimately\nfail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">73.  Let us come to the case of a woman who commits  suicide\nbecause she had\t    been  raped.   Would it  not  be  adding\ninsult\tto  injury, and insult manifold, to require  such  a\nwoman  in  case\t of her survival, to face  the\tignominy  of\nundergoing  an\topen trial during the course  of  which\t the\nsexual\tviolence committed on her which earlier\t might\thave\nbeen known only to a few, would become widely known,  making\nthe  life of the victim still more intolerable.\t Is  it\t not\ncruel to prosecute such a person?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">74.  We\t would go further and state that attempt  to  commit\nsuicide by such a woman is not, cannot be, a crime.  What is\ncrime in such a case is to prosecute her with a view to\t get\nher punished.  It is entirely a different matter that at the\nend of the trial, the court may impose a token fine or\teven\nrelease\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">420</span>\nthe  convict on probation.  That would not take care of\t the\nmental\ttorture\t and  torment which  the  woman\t would\thave\nundergone   during  the\t course\t of  the  trial.    Such   a\nprosecution is, therefore, par excellence persecution.\t And\nwhy  persecute the already tormented woman?  Have we  become\nsoulless?   We think not.  What is required is to reach\t the\nsoul  to  stir\tit to make it cease to\tbe  cruel.   Let  us\nhumanise our laws.  It is never late to do so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">75.  Suicide,  as has already been noted, is  a\t psychiatric\nproblem\t and not a manifestation of criminal  instinct.\t  We\nare  in\t agreement  with Dr (Mrs) Dastoor  that\t suicide  is\nreally a &quot;call for help&quot; to which we shall add that there is\nno  &quot;call for punishment&quot; in it.  Mention may also  be\tmade\nabout what was observed in &quot;The Attitudes of Society towards\nSuicide&quot;,  a  xerox  copy  of which is\ta  part\t of  written\nsubmissions  filed  on\tbehalf of  Respondent  2  (State  of\nOrissa) in W.P. No. (Crl.) 419 of 1987.\t It has been  stated\nin  this article at p. 9 that shortly after passing  of\t the\nSuicide\t Act,  1961  (in England), the\tMinistry  of  Health\nissued\trecommendation advising all doctors and\t authorities\nthat attempted suicide was to be regarded as a &quot;medical\t and\nsocial problem&quot;, as to which it was stated that the same was\n&quot;more  in keeping with present-day knowledge  and  sentiment\nthan  the purely moralistic and punitive reaction  expressed\nin the old law&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">76.

After discussing the subject as  understood  by\nthe primitive societies, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism and\nBuddhism,  the discussion has been included by stating\tthat\nthe very act of posing the question &quot;What is life?&quot; produces\nan initial sense of bafflement and perplexity.\tIt has\tbeen\nstated\tthereafter that a precise, distinct and\t universally\nacceptable  concept does not accompany the use of  the\tword\n&quot;life&quot;;\t and  that posing of the above query brings  in\t its\nwake  a sense that life is an &quot;inexhaustible  storehouse  of\nmysteries, a realm of endlessly self-perpetuating novelties,\nin  which the solution to any given problem gives rise to  a\nplethora of other questions that beckon the always restless,\nnever  contended  mind of Homo Sapiens to seek\tfurther\t for\nadditional  answers  or,  at  least,  to  search  out\tmore\nintellectually\trefined, morally elevating, and\t spiritually\nsalutary ways of pursuing the quest&quot;.  So, life does not end\nin this world and the quest continues, may be after the\t end\nof this life.  Therefore, one who takes life may not  really\nbe  taken  to have put an end to his whole life.

Law  and  morals often intersect and there\t can  be  no\ndoubt that historically at least law and morals were closely\nrelated\t and  that in many areas the law continues  to\tlook\nupon  its  function  as\t the  enforcement  of  morals,\t the\nreinforcement  of  moral  standards  in\t society,  and\t the\npunishment  of moral depravity, as noted at p. 19 of  Burton\nM.

Being\nof this view, instead of breaking law, he took poison.\t But\nthen,  at times an individual would be between two horns  of\ndilemma\t when  confronted with the question  of\t obeying  an\nunjust\tand pernicious law.

In\t the  aforesaid work of Burton, this aspect  of\t the\nmatter has been concluded at p. 353 by stating as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\t      &quot;It is right to be law-abiding.

It is the sanctity  of  human\nlife  which is said to be defaced when one  commits  suicide\nand  the question of morality, therefore, arises.  We  would\nhave  occasion\tlater to refer to the enactment\t of  Suicide\nAct,  1961 by the British Parliament, when the related\tBill\nwas  taken up for consideration in the House of\t Lords,\t the\nLord  Bishop of Carlisle had raised objection on the  ground\nof morality by saying that sanctity of human life was  being\ndestroyed.

A reference to Simon Lee&#x27;s above work shows there is no\nunanimity regarding the moral object which law should try to\nachieve.   Simon  Lee  has mentioned at p.  90\tabout  three\ntheories  prevalent in England in this regard, one of  whose\npropounder  was Mill, according to whom &quot;harm-to-others&quot;  is\nwhat ought to be prevented by law.  Devlin would have  liked\nthat  law  should aim to establish minimum and\tnot  maximum\nstandards  of  behaviour showing respect for  tolerance\t and\nprivacy.   Hart&#x27;s  approach  was that  only  &quot;the  universal\nvalues&quot; merited legal support and not those which  fluctuate\naccording to fashion, unless harm is caused to others.\t[See\nH.L.P.\t Hart&#x27;s\t Law,  Liberty\tand  Morality  (1982)\talso\nparticularly pp. 30 and 3 1.]\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">423</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623275\" id=\"span_43\">87.

The Constitution Bench speaking through Hidayatullah,\nJ., as he then was, stated in paragraph 9 that the  question\nof obscenity depends upon the mores of the people and it  is\nalways\ta  question of degree and where the line  is  to  be\ndrawn.\t After going through the case law and what  Lawrence\nmight  have  had  in mind in writing  the  book,  the  Bench\nunanimously  came  to  the  conclusion\tthat  Lawrence\t was\nprobably  unfolding his philosophy of life and the urges  of\nthe  unconscious,  which caused no loss to  the\t society  if\nthere  was  a  message in the  book.   After  examining\t the\ncontents  of  the  book from this standard it  was  held  it\ncontained no obscenity.\t The importance of this decision for\nour  purpose  is  that the aforesaid book  was\tregarded  as\nmorally objectionable at one point of time even in  England,\nwhere  moral  standard\trelating to sex is on  a  lower\t key\ncompared to ours.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">88.  The  above shows that morality has no defined  contours\nand  it\t would\tbe too hazardous to make  a  bold  and\tbald\nstatement  that commission of suicide is per se\t an  immoral\nact.   If human beings can be treated inhumanly, as  a\tvery\nlarge  segment of our population is, which in a\t significant\nmeasure may be due to wrong (immoral) acts of others, charge\nof  immorality\tcannot be, and in any case  should  not\t be,\nlevied, if such human beings or like of them, feel and think\nthat it would be better to end the wretched life instead  of\nallowing  further humiliation or torture.

One  of the points raised against suicide is  that\t the\nperson who had so done might have been the sole bread-earner\nof  the\t family, say a husband, a father, because  of  whose\ndeath  the  entire family might have been left in  lurch  or\ndoldrums,  bringing  in\t its wake  untold  miseries  to\t the\nmembers of his family.\tIt is therefore stated that  suicide\nhas  adverse  effects  on the social setup.  No\t doubt,\t the\neffects\t of  suicide in such cases are\tquite  hurting;\t but\nthen,  it is a matter of extreme doubt whether by booking  a\nperson\twho  had  attempted  to\t commit\t suicide  to  trial,\nsuicides  can  be taken care of.  Even imposition  of  death\nsentences  has not been able to take care of  commission  of\nmurders, as mentioned earlier.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">90.  Further, the aforesaid adverse sociological effects are\ncaused by the death of the person concerned, and not by\t one\nwho had tried to commit suicide.  Indeed, those who fail  in\ntheir attempts become available to be more or less as useful\nto the family as they were.  So the person to be punished is\none  who had committed suicide; but, he is beyond the  reach\nof  law and cannot be punished.\t This can provide no  reason\nto punish a person who should not be punished.\n32 AIR 1965 SC 881 : (1965) 1 SCR 65 : (1965) 2 Cri LJ 8\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">424</span>\n(12) Is suicide against public policy?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">91.  The basic argument of Shri Sharma, learned counsel\t for\nthe  Union  of India, was that allowing\t persons  to  commit\nsuicide would be against public policy.\t Though which public\npolicy would be so affected was not spelt out by the learned\ncounsel,  we  presume  that  the  public  policy  to  be  so\njeopardised  is\t one which requires  preservation  of  human\nlife.

According  to  the  Editor,\t the\nrationale   of\t the  judgment\twould\tnecessarily   permit\neuthanasia  as\tlegal.\t This  comment\tmay  not  be   quite\nincorrect,  because in passive euthanasia, wherever  it\t has\nbeen  accepted\tas  legally  permissible,  consent  of\t the\npatient,  if  he be in a sound mental  condition,  has\tbeen\nregarded  as  one of the prerequisites.\t So,  if  one  could\nlegally\t commit suicide, he could also give consent for\t his\nbeing  allowed\tto  die.   But then,  the  legal  and  other\nquestions relatable to euthanasia are in many ways different\nfrom  those  raised by suicide.\t One  would,  therefore,  be\nright  in  making a distinction logically and  in  principle\nbetween\t suicide  and euthanasia, though it may be  that  if\nsuicide is held to be legal, the persons pleading for  legal\nacceptance of passive euthanasia would have a winning point.\nFor  the  cases at hand, we would remain content  by  saying\nthat  the  justification  for  allowing\t persons  to  commit\nsuicide\t is  not  required to be played\t down  or  cut\tdown\nbecause\t of  any  encouragement\t to  persons  pleading\t for\nlegalisation of mercy-killing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">102.

The proceedings in GR Case No. 177 of 1984 (State  v.\nNagbhushan  Patnaik)  pending  in the  Court  of  Sub-Judge,\nGunpur in the District of Koraput, Orissa stands quashed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">112. Before parting, we should like to observe that what  we\nhave sought to do through this judgment may be said to be an\nattempt to &quot;search for the social dynamics of criminal\tlaw,\nthe  functional\t theory of sentencing  and  the\t therapeutic\nreach  of  punitive arts, to catch up with  social  sciences\nrelevant   to  criminal\t justice  and  to  link\t up   prison\njurisprudence  with constitutional roots&quot;, of which  Justice\nKrishna\t Iyer has mentioned in his preface  (styled  Krishna\nIyerishly  as &#x27;A Word in Confidence&#x27;) to his  aforementioned\nbook.  Whether we have succeeded or not; and, if so, to what\nextent is for others to judge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">113. 1\tdesire\tto place on record (though  it\twould  sound\nunusual to some and may be to many) my appreciation for\t the\nassistance  I had received from Shri Satish  Chandra,  Joint\nRegistrar  (Library) of the Court, in supplying me  promptly\nvery   useful  and  varied  materials  for  preparing\tthis\njudgment, as and how required by me.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">434</span>\n\n\n\n","numcites":36,"numcitedby":51,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":542988,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"EUTHANASIA ","formInput":"EUTHANASIA%20"},{"value":"right to die","formInput":"right%20to%20die"},{"value":"law and morality","formInput":"law%20and%20morality"},{"value":"section 309 ipc","formInput":"section%20309%20ipc"},{"value":"attempt to commit suicide","formInput":"attempt%20to%20commit%20suicide"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"passive euthanasia","formInput":"passive%20euthanasia"},{"value":"attempted to suicide","formInput":"attempted%20to%20suicide"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"no violation of article 21","formInput":"no%20violation%20of%20article%2021"},{"value":"309 ipc","formInput":"309%20ipc"},{"value":"principles of legislation","formInput":"principles%20of%20legislation"},{"value":"article 21(1)","formInput":"article%2021%281%29"},{"value":"public policy","formInput":"public%20policy"},{"value":"religion","formInput":"religion"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"criminology","formInput":"criminology"},{"value":"suicide","formInput":"suicide"},{"value":"sec 309 of indian penal code","formInput":"sec%20309%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"public opinion","formInput":"public%20opinion"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
