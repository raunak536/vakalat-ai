She alleged that in the month\n\n\n\n\n\n    of September, 2018, she alongwith other family members had gone to\n\n    the room of her daughter at Gatta Factory, Solan and accused\n\n    namely, Gaurav Sinha, not only misbehaved and hurled abuses, but\n\n    also stopped her and other family members from taking her daughter\n\n    back to their home.

She alleged that she has apprehension that some wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n    has been committed upon her daughter and petitioner namely,\n\n    Gaurav Sinha may also be involved. After having received aforesaid\n\n\n\n\n\n    complaint, police started investigation and found that daughter of the\n\n    complainant had gone to Delhi to get her pregnancy terminated from\n\n    Jain Child Maternity Hospital, Delhi.

In nutshell, victim/prosecutrix categorically\n\n    stated before the police as well as Judicial Magistrate while getting\n\n    her statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_14\">164</a> Cr.P.C,\n\n    respectively that she got the pregnancy terminated of her own volition\n\n    and there is no fault, if any, of the petitioners, who were only present\n\n\n\n    on the spot on her request.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">    4.          Being not satisfied with aforesaid explanation rendered\n\n\n\n\n    on record by the victim/prosecutrix, coupled with the fact that\n\n\n\n\n\n    petitioners herein had signed on the consent form, claiming\n\n\n\n\n\n    themselves to be in close relation of the victim/prosecutrix, police\n\n    lodged FIR bearing No.6 of 2019, dated 6.01.2019 under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections\n\n    376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_16\">312</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_17\">419</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_18\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_19\">471</a>, <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_20\">201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_21\">120-B</a> of IPC.

Petitioners\n\n\n\n\n\n    claimed before the trial Court that at the time of pregnancy,\n\n    victim/prosecutrix was major and as per provisions contained under\n\n\n\n\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3</a> of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971\n\n    (hereinafter referred to as the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_24\">MTP Act</a>), victim/prosecutrix on account\n\n\n\n\n\n    of her being raped could always get the pregnancy terminated,\n\n    especially when same was of less than 20 weeks. Petitioners also\n\n    averred before the trial Court that once victim/ prosecutrix in her\n\n    statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C has already stated that\n\n    pregnancy was on account of her being raped by accused Vikram and\n\n\n\n    she of her own volition, decided to get her pregnancy terminated,\n\n    there is no reason, if any, to charge them under the provisions of law,\n\n\n\n\n    as mentioned in the FIR.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">    5.          Learned trial Court on the basis of the pleadings adduced\n\n\n\n\n\n    on record by the respective parties, rejected the applications filed by\n\n    both the petitioners vide common order dated 11.01.2024. Vide\n\n    aforesaid order, trial Court charged accused Vikram under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n\n    376</a> of IPC and petitioners herein came to be charged under <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections\n\n    312</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_28\">419</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_29\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_30\">471</a>, <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_31\">201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_32\">120-B</a> of IPC.

Precisely, the grouse of the petitioners as has been\n\n    highlighted in the petitions and further canvassed by Mr. Anirudh\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioners, is that no case muchless\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_34\">Sections 312</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_35\">419</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_36\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_37\">471</a>, <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_38\">201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_39\">120-B</a> of IPC is made out\n\n\n\n\n\n    against the petitioners. Learned counsel for the petitioners, while\n\n    making this Court peruse statements of the victim/prosecutrix\n\n    recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_41\">164</a> Cr.P.C, vehemently argued that\n\n    at no point of time petitioners impersonated, rather they rightly\n\n    disclosed in the consent form filled up by the victim/prosecutrix at the\n\n\n\n    time of termination of her pregnancy that they are in close relation of\n\n    the victim/prosecutrix. Learned counsel for the petitioners further\n\n\n\n\n    submitted that victim/prosecutrix, who at the time of termination of\n\n\n\n\n\n    pregnancy was major, was otherwise not required to furnish consent\n\n\n\n\n\n    of the family members, rather she being major, could herself give her\n\n    consent and approach Hospital with a prayer to terminate her\n\n    pregnancy and hospital concerned could proceed merely on the basis\n\n    of the consent, if any, given by the victim/prosecutrix. While making\n\n    this Court peruse <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 3</a> of the Medial Termination of Pregnancy\n\n    Act, 1971, learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently argued that\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 02/08/2024 20:33:11 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                         7</span>\n                                                                        2024:HHC:6178\n\n\n\n\n    otherwise also petitioners could not be charged under <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 312</a> of\n\n    IPC for the reason that pregnancy of the victim/prosecutrix was\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   .\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">    terminated when it had not exceeded the period of 20 weeks.

He further\n\n\n\n\n\n    submitted that since pregnancy was caused on account of rape\n\n    committed upon the victim/ prosecutrix by accused Vikram, she in\n\n    terms of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act was well within her rights to get the\n\n    pregnancy terminated and for that purpose, consent of family\n\n    members was otherwise not required, rather in such situation,\n\n\n\n    consent, if any, required was of victim/ prosecutrix.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">    7.           Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that\n\n\n\n\n    no evidence, worth credence, ever came to be adduced on record\n\n\n\n\n\n    that documents, if any, were ever forged by the petitioners and as\n\n\n\n\n\n    such, it is not understood on what basis, police proceeded to register\n\n    case against the petitioners under <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_48\">Sections 468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_49\">471</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_50\">120-B</a> of\n\n    IPC.

Since documents recovered from the\n\n    bag of the victim/prosecutrix disclosed factum of termination of\n\n\n\n\n\n    pregnancy at some Hospital at Delhi, police verified the records of the\n\n    hospital at Delhi and found that at the time of termination of\n\n\n\n\n\n    pregnancy of the victim/prosecutrix, petitioners herein had signed on\n\n    the consent form, disclosing themselves to be in close relation of the\n\n    victim/prosecutrix. Petitioner namely, Gaurav Sinha disclosed himself\n\n    to be maternal uncle (Mamu) of the victim/prosecutrix, whereas\n\n    another petitioner namely, Bhawna Jain, disclosed herself to be\n\n\n\n    attendant. No doubt, on the basis of consent form filled up by the\n\n    victim/ prosecutrix as well as the petitioners, Hospital concerned\n\n\n\n\n    proceeded to terminate the pregnancy of the victim/prosecutrix, which\n\n\n\n\n\n    admittedly at that relevant time was of less than eight weeks, but\n\n\n\n\n\n    question which needs to be determined in the instant case, is whether\n\n    consent, if any, given by the petitioners on the consent from filled up\n\n    by the victim/prosecutrix for termination of her pregnancy was of any\n\n    relevance or not?.

One of the inbuilt restrictions is that it should not\n                 be against an interim or interlocutory order.
