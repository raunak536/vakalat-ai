Similarly, the right to privacy of a\nthird party, which is part of his personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution, may be breached if a particular kind of information, purely of\npersonal nature may be directed to be furnished by the concerned authority. To\nprotect the rights of third parties, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11</a> of the Act provides that where a\nCentral Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case\nmay be, intends to disclose any information or record or part thereof, may on a\nrequest made under the Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party\nand has been treated as confidential by that third party, a written notice will have\nto be given to such third party inviting such party to make a submission in writing\nor orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such\nsubmission of the third party can be kept in view while taking a decision about\ndisclosure of the information. The decision taken by the Central Public Information\nOfficer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n11</a> of the Act is appealable under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 19</a> of the Act before the Information\nCommission and when the Information Commission decides such an appeal, it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         3</span>\n decides only whether or not the information should be furnished to the citizen in\nview of the objection of the third party. Here also the Information Commission\ndoes not decide the rights of a third party but only whether the information which\nis held by or under the control of a public authority in relation to or supplied by\nthat third party could be furnished to a citizen under the provisions of the Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">Hence, the Information Commission discharges administrative functions, not\njudicial functions.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">The Appellant, w.r.t the denial under <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 7(9)</a> of the RTI Act, reiterated the\ncontents of his written submissions, which states as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1546492\" id=\"span_5\">&quot;The CIC in its order in <a href=\"/doc/1546492/\" id=\"a_16\">Er.

It observed that <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n7(9)</a> of the act does not authorise a public authority to deny information.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"187590418\" id=\"span_6\">The CIC\nin its order in <a href=\"/doc/187590418/\" id=\"a_19\">M. Raja Manohar v. Ordinance Factory, Yedumailaram</a> further\nclarified the scope of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 7 (9)</a> and held that the provision only\nallows for the disclosure of the requested information in a form other than the one\nasked for on account of the reasons given under the said provision. The CIC,\nthrough its orders has time and again has reiterated that the denial of information\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_21\">RTI Act</a> can happen only under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 9</a>\nof the Act.</span> The Madras High Court in its judgement in Public Information Officer,\nVillupuram Dist., Central Co-op. Bank Ltd. and Ors. v. Tamil Nadu Information\nCommission and Ors[i]. has held that reasons such as shortage of human\nresources cannot be raised to whittle down the citizen&#x27;s right to seek information&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">The Respondent, during the hearing, reiterated the contents of their written\nsubmissions, which states as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_7\">&quot;It is submitted that the FAA after detailed query-wise consideration of the\ncontentions raised by the applicant dismissed the appeal vide its order dated\n20.05.2022. While dismissing the appeal, the FAA observed as follows: &quot;4..... The\nAppellant had sought for inspection reports risk assessment reports pertaining to\neight banks for three years. In this regard, it is pointed out that if the information\nsought by the appellant is spread across various files, culling out the information\nand compiling the same in the form sought by the appellant will\ndisproportionately divert the resources of the Reserve Bank in an unreasonable\nway in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_24\">section 7(9)</a> of the RTI Act. In such circumstances, the CPIO cannot\nbe compelled to collate, compile and provide the same. Further, disclosure of\ncertain information In the reports may be subject to exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_25\">sections 8</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_26\">9</a> of the RTI Act. Therefore, even if the CPIO is to allow the Appellant to\ninspect the records, the CPIO would be required to peruse all the documents and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          4</span>\n sever/ blackout the exempt information beforehand. At the same time, It is also\nincumbent upon the CPIO to examine each point in the reports and consider\nwhether the disclosure of information would be premature in terms of para 77 of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court judgement dated December 16, 2015 in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_27\">Reserve Bank\nof India v. Jayantilal Mistry</a> 2016 (3) SCC 525. This would heavily encumber the\nresources of the public authority. Since the CPIO has issued a reasoned reply to the\nAppellant, clearly specifying the rationale behind not providing the information,\nthere is no reason to interfere with the reply of the CPIO. Having regard to the\nnature of the query, I am of the opinion that there is no infirmity in the reply given\nby the CPIO. 5. The Appellant has sought for a direction to the CPIO to provide the\ninformation free of cost to him under <a href=\"/doc/383252/\" id=\"a_28\">section 7 (6)</a> of the RTI Act. As per <a href=\"/doc/383252/\" id=\"a_29\">section\n7(6)</a>, the person making request for the information shall be provided the\ninformation free of charge, where the public authority fails to comply with the\ntime limits specified in the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_30\">RTI Act</a>. In this matter, I observe that there is no delay\nin the reply of the CPIO. Therefore, I find no merit in the prayer of the Appellant to\ndirect the CPIO to provide the information free of cost.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">Decision:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">In the facts of the instant case, it is pertinent to note that a decision of a\ncoordinate bench of the Commission in the matter of various third-party banks vs.\nRBI vide File No. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 + Ors. dated 05.05.2022 covers a\ndetailed discussion inter alia on the same nature of information sought for from\nthe RBI and the reliance placed by RBI on the Jayantilal Mistry case. Suffice to say\nthat the issues raised in the instant case are encapsulated in that same discussion\nof the coordinate bench in the following manner:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;39. A comprehensive view has to be taken on the objection filed by the\ninstitutions. These objectives has to be deliberated and adjudicated in the light of\nJayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and other judicial pronouncements relevant in such\nmatter, some of which have been referred by the Commission in the above parts\nas well. The Commission while examining various objections realize that the Writ\nPetitions filed before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India is seeking directions of\nthe Supreme Court for non-disclosure of certain aspects of these audit/inspection\nreport and any such guidance in these Writ Petitions will have direct bearing and\nprovide further clarity to the CPIO/FAA in adjudicating various aspects of\ndisclosure/non-disclosure of reports or the information/data which are part of\nthese reports under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_31\">RTI Act</a>. The Commission takes note that\nall the cases/second appeals filed herein are based on interpretations of RBI Vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          5</span>\n Jayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judicial pronouncements requesting for\nfull disclosure vis-à-vis with exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act for non-\ndisclosure of full or parts of these reports.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        40. In view of the above observations, the Commission is of the view that\nthe reports generated in the hands of regulatory public authority in discharge of\nits statutory obligations are information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the RTI Act, as the\nregulator and the regulated entities are not governed by fiduciary relationship.\nThe orders of the Commission to their effect has been upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and the position is unchanged even\ntoday. Various objections filed by banks/financial institutions, to be examined,\nanalyzed and adjudicated upon, are related to various data and information\nsubmitted to the Reserve Bank of India by these financial institutions explaining\ntheir operations, commercial decisions, clients data etc. under statutory\nobligations can be disclosed as such. There are apparently two set of such\ninformation which have been shared by the institutions with the regulator under\nstatutory obligation. First is the information/data of clients relating to their\nbusiness/commercial operations, financial transactions, business and commercial\nstrategy which is shared by clients with financial institutions in full trust and\nconfidence and is held by them in fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_34\">RTI Act</a> in their hands. Second set is the information relating to business\nstrategy, decisions, transactions, other operational data etc. of financial\ninstitutions have been bearing on their competitive position which also enjoys the\nexemption from disclosure in their hands, if it is a public authority or otherwise,\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_35\">RTI Act</a>. Some of such data, on case to case basis be sensitive enough for\nprotection of national interest. The Commission is of the view that the protection\nof disclosure of information under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of\nfinancial institutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in\ngood faith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligation. Various\nobservations of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case also does not\nindicate so and decision of the regulator to consider redacting such\ndata/information while disclosing the reports is aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        41. The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of\nthe CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and later\nin the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be required to\nadjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of the Commission\nafresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take view on various\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                         6</span>\n objections filed by the Banks and Financial Institutions and submissions made by\napplicant to reach the decision in favour or against redaction of various parts of\nthe report on case to case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judgments, some of\nwhich have been referred in this order as well. Hence, with these observations the\norders passed by the CPIO and FAA in these matters are set aside and the cases\nare being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh. (Emphasis Supplied)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       42. It is amply clear that Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nothers tagged are admitted in Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court wherein guidance and\ndirection has been sought on non-disclosure of certain type of information which\nare essentially the part of the Annual Inspection Report/RAR, etc. These petitions\nalso seek protection of interim communication between regulator and the\nregulated entity in the process of finalization of these reports or otherwise. It is\nobvious that decision in these Writ Petitions will provide clarity and guidance to\nthe Public Authority on redaction/non-disclosure of a set of information inspite of\nbeing part of these reports which are open to disclosure. At this stage, any\ndecision by the Public Authority will amount to pre-judging the issues pending\nadmitted Writ Petitions before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Various banks,\nfinancial institutions, respondent public authority and the RTI applicant have\nalready impleaded party and are presenting their arguments before the Apex\nCourt.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       43. Hence, any decision of redaction or disclosure of information, without\nwaiting for decision in the Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged may cause irrevocable damage against right of privacy and protection of\ncommercial interest. Hence, the respondent public authority if expedient may\nwait for the outcome in Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged or seek clarification from the Hon&#x27;ble Court and accordingly decide these\nRTI applications by following process as enumerated in the earlier paras by the\nCommission in the interest of principles of natural justice. While disclosing the\ninformation they should be cautious in taking a considerate view balancing right\nto privacy, protection of national and commercial interest on one hand vis-à-vis\nlarger public interest. (Emphasis Supplied)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38822192\" id=\"span_11\">44. It is further observed that similar view has also been taken by the\nDivision Bench of the Commission in file bearing nos. CIC/VS/A/2013/001488 and\nCIC/VS/A/2013/001805 dated 11.05.2017 wherein the Commission observed that\n&#x27;Having considered the submissions of both the parties, the Commission observes\nthat since a similar issue is pending adjudication before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in the matter of Central for <a href=\"/doc/38822192/\" id=\"a_37\">Public Interest Litigation Vs. Housing &amp; Urban\nDevelopment Corporation Ltd. &amp;Ors.</a>, it would be judicious to await the final\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                         7</span>\n outcome from the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.
