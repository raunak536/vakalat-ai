These petitions have been filed challenging the order dated\n24.03.2021 passed by the respondent no.1 under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 26(1)</a> of the\nCompetition Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;Act&#x27;), forming a\nprima facie opinion of the violation of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 4</a> of the Act by the\npetitioners, and directing the Director General of the respondent no.1 to\ncause an investigation to be made into the WhatsApp 2021 Update to its\nTerms and Privacy Policy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">2.     The petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4378/2021 is providing software\nbased application for sending and receiving variety of media texts, photos\nand videos, calls etc. by using the internet. It was acquired by the\nrespondent no.2 (petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4407/2021) in the year 2014. It\nis claimed that WhatsApp is used by more than a billion users throughout\nthe world and over 400 million users in India.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 2\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\"> 3.     It is stated that prior to 25.08.2016, the Agreement between\nWhatsApp and its users was governed by the Terms of Service and\nPrivacy Policy dated July, 2012. On 25.08.2016, WhatsApp updated its\nTerms and Services of Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;2016\nUpdate&#x27;). It is claimed that WhatsApp users prior to the 2016 Update\nwere given a one-time opportunity to &#x27;opt-out&#x27; of Facebook using their\nWhatsApp account information. The users who joined WhatsApp after\nthe release of 2016 Update, however, were not offered this &#x27;opt-out&#x27;\noption.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"138689631\" id=\"span_1\">4.     The 2016 Update was challenged in a Public Interest Litigation,\nbeing W.P.(C) 7663/2016 titled <a href=\"/doc/138689631/\" id=\"a_3\">Karmanya Singh Sareen &amp; Anr. vs.\nUnion of India &amp; Ors.</a>, before this Court. This Court by its judgment\ndated 23.09.2016, was pleased to dispose of the petition with the\nfollowing observations and directions:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;20. Having regard to the complete security and protection of\n       privacy provided by the Respondent No.2 initially while launching\n       &quot;WhatsApp&quot; and keeping in view that the issue relating to the\n       existence of an individual&#x27;s right of privacy as a distinct basis of a\n       cause of action is yet to be decided by a larger Bench of the\n       Supreme Court [vide K.S. Puttaswamy (supra)], we consider it\n       appropriate to issue the following directions to protect the interest\n       of the users of &quot;WhatsApp&quot;:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               i)    If the users opt for completely deleting &quot;WhatsApp&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">               account before 25.09.2016, the information/data/details of\n               such users should be deleted completely from &quot;WhatsApp&quot;\n               servers and the same shall not be shared with the\n               &quot;Facebook&quot; or any one of its group companies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">               ii)   So far as the users who opt to remain in &quot;WhatsApp&quot;\n               are concerned, the existing information/data/details of such\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                        Page 3\n                users upto 25.09.2016 shall not be shared with &quot;Facebook&quot;\n               or any one of its group companies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">               iii) The respondent Nos.1 and 5 shall consider the issues\n               regarding the functioning of the Internet Messaging\n               Applications like &quot;WhatsApp&quot; and take an appropriate\n               decision at the earliest as to whether it is feasible to bring\n               the same under the statutory regulatory framework.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">5.     The above judgment has been challenged by the petitioner in the\nreferred petition before the Supreme Court in SLP(C) No.804/2017,\nhowever, no interim order has been passed therein and the petition\nremains pending for adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">6.     On 4th January, 2021, WhatsApp announced that it was updating\nthe Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;2021\nUpdate&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">7.     It is claimed by WhatsApp that the 2021 Update does not in any\nmanner negate the choice of the user made under the 2016 Update and\nthat it is applicable only to the users who had &#x27;opted-in&#x27; to the 2016\nUpdate as also the users who joined WhatsApp services after the 2016\nUpdate agreeing to those terms. It is further asserted that the 2021\nUpdate is aimed at providing users with further transparency about how\nWhatsApp collects, uses and shares data and to inform the users about\nhow optional business messaging features work when certain business\nmessaging features become available to them. It is further asserted that\n2021 Update does not expand WhatsApp&#x27;s ability to share data with\nFacebook and does not impact the privacy of personal messages of the\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                        Page 4\n WhatsApp users; it provides more specifics on how WhatsApp works\nwith businesses that use Facebook or third-parties to manage their\ncommunications with users on WhatsApp.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2126567\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"171200111\" id=\"span_3\">8.     It is further asserted by WhatsApp that its 2021 Update has been\nchallenged in several judicial fora, including before this Court and the\nSupreme Court. It makes specific reference to the two petitions pending\nbefore this Court that is, W.P.(C) No.677/2021 titled <a href=\"/doc/171200111/\" id=\"a_4\">Chaitanya Rohilla\nvs. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a>, and W.P.(C) No.1355/2021 titled <a href=\"/doc/2126567/\" id=\"a_5\">Dr.Seema\nSingh &amp; Anr. vs. Union of India &amp; Anr. It</a> is further contended that the\npetitioner, in the above-referred Special Leave Petition and the intervener\ntherein (Internet Freedom Foundation), have filed applications seeking to\nrestrain WhatsApp from implementing the 2021 Update.             The said\napplications are pending before the Supreme Court.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">9.     The petitioner(s) (WhatsApp and Facebook) challenge the\nImpugned Order passed by the respondent no.1 on the ground that despite\nthe judicial challenge to the 2021 Update pending before the Supreme\nCourt and before this Court, the respondent no. 1 has wrongly taken suo\nmoto action and passed the Impugned Order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"130504148\" id=\"span_4\">10.    Mr.Salve, the learned senior counsel for WhatsApp LLC., and Mr.\nRohatgi, learned senior counsel appearing for Facebook Inc., submit that\nthe issue as to whether the sharing of the information available with\nWhatsApp with Facebook violates the right of privacy of the users\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, and as to whether\nthe petitioner(s) are under any legal obligation to provide an &#x27;opt-out&#x27;\nfacility to the users of WhatApp, are issues that are pending adjudication\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 5\n before the Constitutional Court, and especially the Constitutional Bench\nof the Supreme Court, and therefore, it is not open for the respondent\nno.1 to consider the same issues in exercise of its suo moto powers under\nthe Act. They submit that judicial discipline would demand that the\nrespondent no.1 refrains from adjudicating on the said issues till the same\nare pronounced upon by the Supreme Court and this Court in the above-\nreferred proceedings. They place reliance on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_7\">Competition Commission of India vs. Bharti Airtel\nLimited &amp; Ors.</a>, (2019) 2 SCC 521 in support of their submission that the\nrespondent no. 1 should be restrained from proceeding with the\ninvestigation until the issues pending adjudication before the Supreme\nCourt and this Court are first decided by the said Courts.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"47700095\" id=\"span_5\">11.    Mr.Salve submits that even otherwise, the challenge to the 2016\nUpdate was rejected by the respondent no.1 by its order dated 01.06.2017\npassed in Case No. 99/2016, <a href=\"/doc/47700095/\" id=\"a_8\">Shri Vinod Kumar Gupta v WhatsApp Inc.\nThe</a> same is pending adjudication in an appeal before the learned\nNational Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), being Compt.</span>\nAppeal (AT) No.13/2017 titled Vinod Kumar Gupta vs. Competition\nCommission of India &amp; Anr. He submits that, therefore, the respondent\nno. 1 cannot re-open the issues already decided and should have awaited\nthe outcome of the appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">12.     Mr.Sibal, the learned senior counsel appearing for WhatApp, adds\nthat the investigation could not have been ordered by the respondent no. 1\nwithout first coming to a prima facie finding on the claim of WhatsApp\nthat the 2021 Update does not expand WhatsApp&#x27;s ability to share data\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 6\n with Facebook and that the said update intends to provide users with\nfurther transparency about how WhatsApp collects, uses and shares data.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">13.    Mr.Rohatgi, the learned senior counsel appearing for Facebook,\nwhile reiterating the submissions of Mr.Salve, has further submitted that\nin any case, Facebook could not have been involved in the investigation\ndirected by the Impugned Order.        He submits that Facebook Inc. is\nmerely the parent company of WhatsApp LLC, however, the 2021\nUpdate is in relation to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy offered\nby WhatsApp alone. He submits that the said update is not applicable for\nthe Facebook users and therefore, Facebook could not have been added\nas a party in such an investigation into WhatsApp&#x27;s Terms and\nConditions of Service to its users.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">14.    On the other hand, the learned Additional Solicitor General\nappearing for the respondent no.1, submits that apart from the issues\nwhich are pending before the Supreme Court in SLP(C) No.804/2017 or\nbefore this Court in the petitions mentioned hereinabove, the respondent\nno.1 is examining the 2021 Update in relation to any violation of the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 4</a> of the Competition Act, 2002. He submits that\nthe respondent no. 1 is examining as to whether the excessive data\ncollection by WhatsApp and the use of the same has any anti-competitive\nimplications. He submits that the concentration of data in the hands of\nWhatsApp may itself raise competition concerns, thereby resulting in\nviolation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 4</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">15.    Placing reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in\nCompetition Commission of India vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd. &amp;\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                     Page 7\n Anr., (2010) 10 SCC 744, he submits that the Impugned Order has been\npassed under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act and it does not determine any\nrights or obligations of the parties; it is only administrative in nature; and\nis not appealable. He submits that in fact, the petitioner(s) in the present\npetitions were not even entitled to a notice or hearing before passing of\nthe order under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act and therefore, cannot be heard in\nchallenge to such an order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">16.    I have considered the submissions made by the learned senior\ncounsels for the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">17.    The scope and ambit of an order passed under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 26(1)</a> of the\nAct, has been authoritatively explained by the Supreme Court in Steel\nAuthority of India Ltd. (supra), holding as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;38. In contradistinction, the direction under Section 26(1)\n       after formation of a prima facie opinion is a direction simpliciter\n       to cause an investigation into the matter. Issuance of such a\n       direction, at the face of it, is an administrative direction to one of\n       its own wings departmentally and is without entering upon any\n       adjudicatory process. It does not effectively determine any right or\n       obligation of the parties to the lis. Closure of the case causes\n       determination of rights and affects a party i.e. the informant;\n       resultantly, the said party has a right to appeal against such\n       closure of case under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 26(2)</a> of the Act. On the other hand,\n       mere direction for investigation to one of the wings of the\n       Commission is akin to a departmental proceeding which does not\n       entail civil consequences for any person, particularly, in light of\n       the strict confidentiality that is expected to be maintained by the\n       Commission in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1537115/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 57</a> of the Act and <a href=\"/doc/1753275/\" id=\"a_16\">Regulation 35</a> of\n       the Regulations.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       39. Wherever, in the course of the proceedings before the\n       Commission,    the Commission passes a direction or interim\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                         Page 8\n        order which is at the       preliminary stage and of preparatory\n       nature without recording           findings which will bind the parties\n       and where such order will only pave the way for final decision, it\n       would not make that direction as         an order or decision which\n       affects the rights of the parties and therefore, is not appealable.\n       xxxxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       91. The jurisdiction of the Commission, to act under this\n       provision, does not contemplate any adjudicatory function. The\n       Commission is not expected to give notice to the parties i.e. the\n       informant or the affected parties and hear them at length, before\n       forming its opinion. The function is of a very preliminary nature\n       and in fact, in common parlance, it is a departmental function. At\n       that stage, it does not condemn any person and therefore,\n       application of audi alteram partem is not called for. Formation of\n       a prima facie opinion departmentally (the Director General, being\n       appointed by the Central Government to assist the Commission, is\n       one of the wings of the Commission itself) does not amount to an\n       adjudicatory function but is merely of administrative nature. At\n       best, it can direct the investigation to be conducted and report to\n       be submitted to the Commission itself or close the case in terms of\n       <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 26(2)</a> of the Act, which order itself is appealable before the\n       Tribunal and only after this stage, there is a specific right of notice\n       and hearing available to the aggrieved/affected party. Thus,\n       keeping in mind the nature of the functions required to be\n       performed by the Commission in terms of Section 26(1), we are of\n       the considered view that the right of notice or hearing is not\n       contemplated under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act.\n       xxxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       93. We may also usefully note that the functions performed by\n       the Commission under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act are in the nature of\n       preparatory measures in contrast to the decision-making process.\n        That is the precise reason that the legislature has used the word\n       &quot;direction&quot; to be issued to the Director General for investigation in\n       that provision and not that the Commission shall take a decision or\n       pass an order directing inquiry into the allegations made in the\n       reference to the Commission.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                         Page 9\n        xxxxx\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       97. The above reasoning and the principles enunciated, which\n       are consistent with the settled canons of law, we would adopt even\n       in this case. In the backdrop of these determinants, we may refer to\n       the provisions of the Act. Section 26, under its different sub-\n       sections, requires the Commission to issue various directions, take\n       decisions and pass orders, some of which are even appealable\n       before the Tribunal. Even if it is a direction under any of the\n       provisions and not a decision, conclusion or order passed on\n       merits by the Commission, it is expected that the same would be\n       supported by some reasoning. At the stage of forming a prima facie\n       view, as required under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act, the Commission\n       may not really record detailed reasons, but must express its mind\n       in no uncertain terms that it is of the view that prima facie case\n       exists, requiring issuance of direction for investigation to the\n       Director General. Such view should be recorded with reference to\n       the information furnished to the Commission. Such opinion should\n       be formed on the basis of the records, including the information\n       furnished and reference made to the Commission under the various\n       provisions of the Act, as aforereferred. However, other decisions\n       and orders, which are not directions simpliciter and determining\n       the rights of the parties, should be well reasoned analysing and\n       deciding the rival contentions raised before the Commission by the\n       parties. In other words, the Commission is expected to express\n       prima facie view in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act, without\n       entering into any adjudicatory or determinative process and by\n       recording minimum reasons substantiating the formation of such\n       opinion, while all its other orders and decisions should be well\n       reasoned.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">18.    A reading of the above clearly shows that at this stage, the\nrespondent no.1 was merely to form a prima facie opinion for directing\nan investigation to be carried out by the Director General. It has not to\ngive any final conclusions on the merit of the violation alleged or on the\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 10\n defence of the petitioner(s) herein. The order passed under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 26(1)</a>\nof the Act is purely administrative in nature and does not entail any\nconsequence on the civil rights of the petitioner(s). In fact, the Impugned\nOrder could have been passed without notice or granting an opportunity\nof hearing to the petitioner(s). Though the respondent no. 1 is to give\nreasons in the Impugned Order, in my opinion, as it is not to give any\nconclusive findings but is to form only a prima facie opinion to order an\ninvestigation, it need not deal with all the submissions of the petitioner(s)\nin detail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">19.    In the present set of petitions, the respondent no.1 has, inter alia,\ngiven the following reasons for directing an investigation to be carried\nout by its Director General into the 2021 Update of WhatsApp:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">       &quot;20. Based on the above, the Commission concluded that\n       WhatsApp is dominant in the relevant market for OTT messaging\n       apps through smartphones in India. As such, in light of the said\n       holding of the Commission in Harshita Chawla case, there is no\n       occasion to separately and independently examine the issue of\n       relevant market and dominance of WhatsApp therein, when there is\n       no change in the market construct or structure since the passing of\n       the said order in August, 2020 and announcing of the new policy\n       by WhatsApp on January 04, 2021 - which itself seems to emanate\n       out of the entrenched dominant position of WhatsApp in the said\n       relevant market, as detailed in this order. The Commission has\n       also taken note of the recent developments wherein the competing\n       apps, i.e. Signal and Telecom witnessed a surge in downloads after\n       the policy announcement by WhatsApp. However, apparently this\n       has not resulted in any significant loss of users for WhatsApp.\n       Further, as elaborated in detail in succeeding paras, the network\n       effects working in favour of WhatsApp reinforces its position of\n       strength and limit its substitutability with other functionally similar\n       apps/platforms.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                        Page 11\n        xxxxxxx\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">       25. Having considered the overarching terms and conditions of\n       the new policy, the Commission is of prima facie opinion that the\n       &#x27;take-it-or-leave-it&#x27; nature of privacy policy and terms of service of\n       WhatsApp and the information sharing stipulations mentioned\n       therein, merit a detailed investigation in view of the market\n       position and market power enjoyed by WhatsApp. The Commission\n       has also taken note of the submission of WhatsApp that 2021\n       Update does not expand WhatsApp&#x27;s ability to share data with\n       Facebook and the said update intends to provide users with further\n       transparency about how WhatsApp collects, uses and shares data.\n       The veracity of such claims would also be examined during the\n       investigation by the DG.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">       26. WhatsApp is the most widely used app for instant messaging\n       in India. A communication network/platform gets more valuable as\n       more users join it, thereby benefiting from network effects. The\n       OTT messaging platforms not being interoperable, communication\n       between two users is enabled only when both are registered on the\n       same network. Thus, the value of a messaging app/platform\n       increases for users with an increasing number of their friends and\n       acquaintances joining the network. In India, the network effects\n       have indubitably set in for WhatsApp, which undergird its position\n       of strength and limit its substitutability with other functionally\n       similar apps/platforms. This, in turn, causes a strong lock-in effect\n       for users, switching to another platform for whom gets difficult and\n       meaningless until all or most of their social contacts also switch to\n       the same other platform. Users wishing to switch would have to\n       convince their contacts to switch and these contacts would have to\n       persuade their other contacts to switch. Thus, while it may be\n       technically feasible to switch, the pronounced network effects of\n       WhatsApp significantly circumscribe the usefulness of the same.\n       The network effects have been reflected when despite increase in\n       downloads of the competing apps like Signal and Telegram, user\n       base of WhatsApp apparently did not suffer any significant loss. As\n       pointed out in Harshita Chawla case (supra), the second largest\n       player in terms of market share in the relevant market of instant\n       messaging and thus the next sizeable alternative available to users\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                       Page 12\n        is Facebook Messenger, which too is a Facebook Group company.\n       Thus, the conduct of WhatsApp/ Facebook under consideration\n       merits detailed scrutiny.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">       27. The Commission is of further opinion that users, as owners\n       of their personalised data, are entitled to be informed about the\n       extent, scope and precise purpose of sharing of such data by\n       WhatsApp with other Facebook Companies. However, it appears\n       from the Privacy Policy as well as Terms of Service (including the\n       FAQs published by WhatsApp), that many of the information\n       categories described therein are too broad, vague and\n       unintelligible. For instance, information on how users &quot;interact\n       with others (including businesses)&quot; is not clearly defined, what\n       would constitute &quot;service-related information&quot;, &quot;mobile device\n       information&quot;, &quot;payments or business features&quot;, etc. are also\n       undefined. It is also pertinent to note that at numerous places in\n       the policy while illustrating the data to be collected, the list is\n       indicative and not exhaustive due to usage of words like &#x27;includes&#x27;,\n       &#x27;such as&#x27;, &#x27;For example&#x27;, etc., which suggests that the scope of\n       sharing may extend beyond the information categories that have\n       been expressly mentioned in the policy. Such opacity, vagueness,\n       open-endedness and incomplete disclosures hide the actual data\n       cost that a user incurs for availing WhatsApp services. It is also\n       not clear from the policy whether the historical data of users\n       would also be shared with Facebook Companies and whether data\n       would be shared in respect of those WhatsApp users also who are\n       not present on other apps of Facebook i.e., Facebook, Instagram,\n       etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       28. Further, users are not likely to expect their personal data to\n       be shared with third parties ordinarily except for the limited\n       purpose of providing or improving WhatsApp&#x27;s service. However,\n       it appears from the wordings of the policy that the data sharing\n       scheme is also intended to, inter alia, &#x27;customise&#x27;, &#x27;personalise&#x27;\n       and &#x27;market&#x27; the offerings of other Facebook Companies. Under\n       competitive market condition, users would have sovereign rights\n       and control over decisions related to sharing of their personalised\n       data. However, this is not the case with WhatsApp users and\n       moreover, there appears to be no justifiable reason as to why users\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 13\n        should not have any control or say over such cross-product\n       processing of their data by way of voluntary consent, and not as a\n       precondition for availing WhatsApp&#x27;s services.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">       29. As pointed out previously, users earlier had such control\n       over sharing of their personal data with Facebook, in terms of an\n       &#x27;opt-out&#x27; provision available for 30 days in the previous policy\n       updates. However, the same has not been made available to users\n       this time. Thus, users are required to accept the unilaterally\n       dictated &#x27;take-it-or-leave-it&#x27; terms by a dominant messaging\n       platform in their entirety, including the data sharing provisions\n       therein, if they wish to avail their service. Such &quot;consent&quot; cannot\n       signify voluntary agreement to all the specific processing or use of\n       personalised data, as provided in the present policy. Users have\n       not been provided with appropriate granular choice, neither\n       upfront nor in the fine prints, to object to or opt-out of specific\n       data sharing terms, which prima facie appear to be unfair and\n       unreasonable for the WhatsApp users.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">       30. On a careful and thoughtful consideration of the matter, the\n       conduct of WhatsApp in sharing of users&#x27; personalised data with\n       other Facebook Companies, in a manner that is neither fully\n       transparent nor based on voluntary and specific user consent,\n       appears prima facie unfair to users. The purpose of such sharing\n       appears to be beyond users&#x27; reasonable and legitimate\n       expectations regarding quality, security and other relevant aspects\n       of the service for which they register on WhatsApp. One of the\n       stated purposes of data sharing viz. targeted ad offerings on other\n       Facebook products rather indicates the intended use being that of\n       building user profiles through cross-linking of data collected\n       across services. Such data concentration may itself raise\n       competition concerns where it is perceived as a competitive\n       advantage. The impugned conduct of data-sharing by WhatsApp\n       with Facebook apparently amounts to degradation of non-price\n       parameters of competition viz. quality which result in objective\n       detriment to consumers, without any acceptable justification. Such\n       conduct prima facie amounts to imposition of unfair terms and\n       conditions upon the users of WhatsApp messaging app, in violation\n       of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 4(2)(a)(i)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 14\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">        31. Given the pronounced network effects it enjoys, and the\n       absence of any credible competitor in the instant messaging\n       market in India, WhatsApp appears to be in a position to\n       compromise quality in terms of protection of individualised data\n       and can deem it unnecessary to even retain the user-friendly\n       alternatives such as &#x27;opt-out&#x27; choices, without the fear of erosion\n       of its user base. Moreover, the users who do not wish to continue\n       with WhatsApp may have to lose their historical data as porting\n       such data from WhatsApp to other competing apps is not only a\n       cumbersome and time consuming process but, as already\n       explained, network effects make it difficult for the users to switch\n       apps. This would enhance and accentuate switching costs for the\n       users who may want to shift to alternatives due to the policy\n       changes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">       32. Today&#x27;s consumers value non-price parameters of services\n       viz. quality, customer service, innovation, etc. as equally if not\n       more important as price. The competitors in the market also\n       compete on the basis of such non-price parameters. Reduction in\n       consumer data protection and loss of control over their\n       personalised data by the users can be taken as reduction in quality\n       under the antitrust law. Lower data protection by a dominant firm\n       can lead to not only exploitation of consumers but can also have\n       exclusionary effects as WhatsApp/Facebook would be able to\n       further entrench/reinforce their position and leverage themselves\n       in neighbouring or even in unrelated markets such as display\n       advertising market, resulting in insurmountable entry barriers for\n       new entrants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">       33. Data and data analytics have immense relevance for\n       competitive performance of digital enterprises. Cross-linking and\n       integration of user data can further strengthen data advantage\n       besides safeguarding and reinforcing market power of dominant\n       firms. For Facebook, the processing of data collected from\n       WhatsApp can be a means to supplement the consumer profiling\n       that it does through direct data collection on its platform, by\n       allowing it to track users and their communication behaviour\n       across a vast number of locations and devices outside Facebook\n       platform. Therefore, the impugned data sharing provision may\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 15\n        have exclusionary effects also in the display advertising market\n       which has the potential to undermine the competitive process and\n       creates further barriers to market entry besides leveraging, in\n       violation of the provisions of Section 4(2)(c) and (e) of the Act. As\n       per the 2021 update to the privacy policy, a business may give\n       third-party service provider such as Facebook access to its\n       communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process\n       them for the business. It may be possible that Facebook will\n       condition provision of such services to businesses with a\n       requirement for using the data collected by them. The DG may also\n       investigate these aspects during its investigation.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">20.    A reading of the above would show that the respondent no. 1 has\nprima facie concluded that WhatsApp is dominant in the relevant market\nfor Over-the-Top (OTT) messaging apps through smartphones in India;\ndue to lack of/restricted interoperability between platforms, the users may\nfind it difficult to switchover to other applications except at a significant\nloss; there is opacity, vagueness, open-endedness and incomplete\ndisclosures in the 2021 Update on vital information categories;\nconcentration of data in WhatsApp and Facebook itself may raise\ncompetition concerns; data-sharing amounts to degradation of non-price\nparameters of competition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">21.

They also stipulate the charges to be realised for\n       POIs that are to be provided to another service provider. Even the\n       consequences for breach of such obligations are mentioned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       104. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the High Court is right\n       in concluding that till the jurisdictional issues are straightened and\n       answered by TRAI which would bring on record findings on the\n       aforesaid aspects, CCI is ill-equipped to proceed in the matter.\n       Having regard to the aforesaid nature of jurisdiction conferred\n       upon an expert regulator pertaining to this specific sector, the\n       High Court is right in concluding that the concepts of\n       &quot;subscriber&quot;, &quot;test period&#x27;&#x27;, &quot;reasonable demand&quot;, &quot;test phase and\n       commercial phase rights and obligations&quot;, &quot;reciprocal obligations\n       of service providers&quot; or &quot;breaches of any contract and/or\n       practice&quot;, arising out of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_27\">TRAI Act</a> and the policy so declared,\n       are the      matters within the jurisdiction of the Authority/TDSAT\n       under the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_28\">TRAI Act</a> only. Only when the jurisdictional facts in\n       the present matter as mentioned in this judgment particularly in\n       paras 72 and 102 above are determined by TRAI against the\n       IDOs, the next question would arise as to whether it was a result\n       of any concerted agreement between the IDOs and COAI\n       supported the IDOs in that endeavour. It would be at that stage\n       CCI can go into the         question as to whether violation of the\n       provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_29\">TRAI Act</a>         amounts to &quot;abuse of dominance&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">       or &quot;anti-competitive        agreements&quot;. That also follows from the\n       reading of <a href=\"/doc/55639/\" id=\"a_30\">Sections 21</a> and         <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_31\">21-A</a> of the Competition Act, as\n       argued by the respondents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">       105. The issue can be examined from another angle as well. If\n       CCI is allowed to intervene at this juncture, it will have to\n       necessarily undertake an exercise of returning the findings on the\n       aforesaid issues/aspects which are mentioned in para 102 above.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                       Page 19\n        Not only TRAI is better equipped as a sectoral regulator to deal\n       with these jurisdictional aspects, there may be a possibility that the\n       two authorities, namely, TRAI on the one hand and CCI on           the\n       other, arrive at conflicting views. Such a situation needs to be\n       avoided. This analysis also leads to the same conclusion, namely,\n       in     the first instance it is TRAI which should decide these\n       jurisdictional issues, which come within the domain of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_32\">TRAI\n       Act</a> as they not only arise out of the telecom licences granted to the\n       service providers, the service providers are governed by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_33\">TRAI\n       Act</a> and are supposed to follow various regulations and directions\n       issued by TRAI itself.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">26.    The Supreme Court, however, rejected the argument that TRAI\nwould have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the matters involving anti-\ncompetitive practices to the exclusion of the respondent no.1, observing\nas under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       &quot;108. Such a submission, on a cursory glance, may appear to be\n       attractive. However, the matter cannot be examined by looking\n       into the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_34\">TRAI Act</a> alone. Comparison of the\n       regimes and purpose behind the two Acts becomes essential to find\n       an answer to this issue. We have discussed the scope and ambit of\n       the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_35\">TRAI Act</a> in the given context as well as the functions of TRAI.\n       No doubt, we have accepted that insofar as the telecom sector is\n       concerned, the issues which arise and are to be examined in the\n       context of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_36\">TRAI Act</a> and related regime need to be examined by\n       TRAI. At the same time, it is also imperative that specific purpose\n       behind the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_37\">Competition Act</a> is kept in mind. This has been taken\n       note of and discussed in the earlier part of the judgment. As\n       pointed out above, the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_38\">Competition Act</a> frowns at the        anti-\n       competitive agreements. It deals with three kinds of practices\n       which are treated as anti-competitive and are prohibited. To\n       recapitulate, these are:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                       Page 20\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                (a) where agreements are entered into by certain persons\n               with a view to cause an appreciable adverse effect on\n               competition;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               (b) where any enterprise or group of enterprises, which\n               enjoys dominant position, abuses the said dominant\n               position; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">               (c) regulating the combination of enterprises by means of\n               mergers or amalgamations to ensure that such mergers or\n               amalgamations do not become anti-competitive or abuse the\n               dominant position which they can attain.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       109. CCI is specifically entrusted with duties and functions, and\n       in the process empower as well, to deal with the aforesaid three\n       kinds of anti-competitive practices. The purpose is to eliminate\n       such practices which are having adverse effect on the competition,\n       to promote and sustain competition and to protect the interest of\n       the consumers and ensure freedom of trade, carried on by other\n       participants, in India. To this extent, the function that is assigned\n       to CCI is distinct from the function of TRAI under the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_39\">TRAI Act</a>.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       The learned counsel for the appellants are right in their\n       submission that CCI is supposed to find out as to whether the IDOs\n       were acting in concert and colluding, thereby forming a cartel,\n       with the intention to block or hinder entry of RJIL in the market in\n       violation of <a href=\"/doc/615592/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 3(3)(b)</a> of the Competition Act. Also, whether\n       there was an anti-competitive agreement between the IDOs, using\n       the platform of COAI. CCI, therefore, is to determine whether the\n       conduct of the parties was unilateral or it was a collective action\n       based on an agreement. Agreement between the parties, if it was\n       there, is pivotal to the issue. Such an exercise has to be necessarily\n       undertaken by CCI. In Haridas Exports, this Court held that\n       where statutes operate in different fields and have different\n       purposes, it cannot be said that there is an implied repeal of one by\n       the other. <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_41\">The Competition Act</a> is also a special statute which deals\n       with anti-competition. It is also to be borne in mind that if the\n       activity undertaken by some persons is anti-competitive and\n       offends <a href=\"/doc/1153878/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 3</a> of the Competition Act, the consequences\n       thereof are provided in the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_43\">Competition Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">WP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                       Page 21\n        xxxxxx\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">       112. Obviously, all the aforesaid functions not only come within\n       the domain of CCI, TRAI is not at all equipped to deal with the\n       same. Even if TRAI also returns a finding that a particular activity\n       was anti-competitive, its powers would be limited to the action that\n       can be taken under the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_44\">TRAI Act</a> alone. It is only CCI which is\n       empowered to deal with the same anti-competitive act from the\n       lens of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_45\">Competition Act</a>. lf such activities offend the provisions\n       of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_46\">Competition Act</a> as well, the consequences under that Act\n       would also follow. Therefore, contention of the IDOs that the\n       jurisdiction of CCI stands totally ousted cannot be accepted.\n       Insofar as the nuanced exercise from the standpoint of the\n       <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_47\">Competition Act</a> is concerned, CCI is the experienced body in\n       conducting competition analysis. Further, CCI is more likely to opt\n       for structural remedies which would lead the sector to evolve a\n       point where sufficient new entry is induced thereby promoting\n       genuine competition. This specific and important role assigned to\n       CCI cannot be completely wished away and the &quot;comity&quot; between\n       the sectoral regulator (i.e. TRAI) and the market regulator (i.e.\n       CCI) is to be maintained.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">       113. The conclusion of the aforesaid discussion is to give primacy\n       to the respective objections (sic objectives) of the two regulators\n       under the two Acts. At the same time, since the matter pertains to\n       the telecom sector which is specifically regulated by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_48\">TRAI Act</a>,\n       balance is maintained by permitting TRAI in the first instance to\n       deal with and decide the jurisdictional aspects which can be more\n       competently handled by it. Once that exercise is done and there are\n       findings returned by TRAI which lead to the prima facie conclusion\n       that the IDOs have indulged in anti-competitive practices, CCI\n       can be activated to investigate the matter going by the criteria <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_49\">laid\n       down in</a> the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_50\">Competition Act</a> and take it\n       to its logical conclusion. This balanced approach in construing\n       the two Acts would take care of <a href=\"/doc/264874/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 60</a> of the Competition Act\n       as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">       114. We, thus, do not agree with the appellants that CCI could\n       have dealt with this matter at this stage itself without availing the\n       inquiry by TRAI. We also do not agree with the respondents that\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                       Page 22\n        insofar as the telecom sector is concerned, jurisdiction of CCI\n       under the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_52\">Competition Act</a> is totally ousted. In a nutshell, that\n       leads to the conclusion that the view taken by the High Court is\n       perfectly justified. Even the argument of the learned ASG is that\n       the exercise of jurisdiction by CCI to investigate an alleged cartel\n       does not impinge upon TRAI&#x27;s jurisdiction to regulate the industry\n       in any way. It was submitted that the promotion of competition and\n       prevention of competitive behaviour may not be high on the change\n       of sectoral regulator which makes it prone to &quot;regulatory capture&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       and, therefore, CCI is competent to exercise its jurisdiction from\n       the standpoint of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_53\">Competition Act</a>. However, having taken\n       note of the skilful exercise which TRAI is supposed to carry out,\n       such a comment vis-a-vis TRAI may not be appropriate. No doubt,\n       as commented by the Planning Commission in its report of\n       February 2007, a sectoral regulator, may not have an overall view\n       of the economy as a whole, which CCI is able to fathom.\n       Therefore, our analysis does not bar the jurisdiction of CCI\n       altogether but only pushes it to a later stage, after TRAI has\n       undertaken necessary exercise in the first place, which it is more\n       suitable to carry out.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">27.    A reading of the above judgment would clearly show that, in spite\nof having come to the conclusion that TRAI is the expert regulator\nconstituted for the purposes of ensuring an orderly and healthy growth of\ntelecommunication infrastructure services, the Supreme Court held that\nTRAI would not be the sole repository of the jurisdiction to deal even\nwith the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_54\">Competition Act</a> and violations thereunder. However, the\nSupreme Court found that the jurisdictional facts and obligations under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_55\">TRAI Act, 1997</a> and the Regulations framed thereunder were first to\nbe determined by the TRAI and therefore, held that the respondent no. 1\nhad to await the outcome of the proceedings before TRAI before\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 23\n proceeding with the investigation ordered by it under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 26(1)</a> of the\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">28.    In the present case, the issue as to whether the 2016 Update/2021\nUpdate announced by WhatsApp in any manner infringes upon the Right\nof Privacy of the users guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia is pending adjudication before the Supreme Court and this Court.\nThe question regarding the 2016 Update/2021 Update not giving an\noption to opt-out is also an issue before the Supreme Court and this\nCourt. However, the same cannot necessarily mean that during the\npendency of those petitions, the respondent no.1 is completely denuded\nof the jurisdiction vested in it under the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_58\">Competition Act, 2002</a> or that it\nmust necessarily await the outcome of such proceedings. Therefore, it is\nnot a question of lack of jurisdiction of the respondent no. 1, but rather\none of prudence and discretion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">29.    It must be remembered that any finding by the respondent no. 1 on\nany of the issues would always be subject to the findings of the Supreme\nCourt or of this Court in the above-mentioned petitions and would be\nbinding on the respondent no. 1. Such is the case in every proceeding\nbefore the respondent no. 1. Nevertheless, while such issues are being\ndetermined by the Supreme Court or by the High Court, it cannot be\nstated that the respondent no.1 has to necessarily await the outcome of\nsuch proceedings before acting further under its own jurisdiction. The\nrespondent no.1 has to proceed within its own jurisdiction, applying the\nlaw as it stands presently. In this regard, I may only note the submission\nof the learned ASG appearing for the respondent no. 1 that the scope of\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 24\n inquiry before the respondent no. 1 is not confined only to the issues\nraised before the Supreme Court or before this Court, but is much vaster\nin nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">30.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107317036\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/107317036/\" id=\"a_59\">State of Maharashtra and Anr. vs. Sarva Shramik Sangh,\nSangli and Ors.</a>; (2013) 16 SCC 16, the Supreme Court in relation to the\n<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_60\">Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</a>, has observed as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       &quot;27.

The same, in my opinion, is not sustainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"138689631\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47700095\" id=\"span_16\">35.    As far as the 2016 Update having been upheld by respondent no. 1\nin <a href=\"/doc/47700095/\" id=\"a_71\">Vinod Kumar Gupta</a> (supra) or by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/138689631/\" id=\"a_72\">Karmanya Singh\nSareen</a> (supra), it need only be noted that presently there is nothing on\nrecord to presume that the respondent no. 1 shall act contrary to the same.\nIn any case, these orders are also pending challenge before the learned\nNCLAT and before the Supreme Court respectively.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">36.    As far as the submission of Facebook on its impleadment in the\ninvestigation is concerned, the same is only stated to be rejected. A\nreading of the Impugned Order passed by the respondent no.1 itself\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                        Page 27\n shows that Facebook shall be an integral part of such investigation and\nthe allegations in relation to sharing of data by Whatsapp with Facebook\nwould necessarily require the presence of Facebook in such an\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">37.    In view of the above, I find no merit in these present petitions. The\nsame are dismissed. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p><pre id=\"pre_6\">\n\n\n\n\n                                                    NAVIN CHAWLA, J\nAPRIL 22, 2021\nRN/A.\n\n\n\n\nWP(C) Nos.4378/2021 &amp; 4407/2021                                      Page 28\n </pre>","numcites":21,"numcitedby":1,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":94382510,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"anti competitive agreements","formInput":"anti%20competitive%20agreements"},{"value":"whatsapp","formInput":"whatsapp"},{"value":"facebook","formInput":"facebook"},{"value":"competition act","formInput":"competition%20act"},{"value":"competition commission of india","formInput":"competition%20commission%20of%20india"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"Facebook Inc ","formInput":"Facebook%20Inc%20"},{"value":"privacy policy","formInput":"privacy%20policy"},{"value":"trai","formInput":"trai"},{"value":"prima facie opinion","formInput":"prima%20facie%20opinion"},{"value":"\"network effects\"","formInput":"%22network%20effects%22"},{"value":"suo moto","formInput":"suo%20moto"},{"value":"competition act,2002","formInput":"competition%20act%2C2002"},{"value":"TRAI Act","formInput":"TRAI%20Act"},{"value":"user data ","formInput":"user%20data%20"},{"value":"larger bench","formInput":"larger%20bench"},{"value":"dominant position","formInput":"dominant%20position"},{"value":"\"prima facie opinion\"  ","formInput":"%22prima%20facie%20opinion%22%20%20"},{"value":"direction for investigation","formInput":"direction%20for%20investigation"},{"value":"anti competitive ","formInput":"anti%20competitive%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"competition","formInput":"tag:competition"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
