Sub-section   (1)(b)(i)   of   <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_17\">section   3</a> \nrefers   to   the   risk   involved   to   the   pregnant   woman \nwhich   includes   even   injury   in   respect   of   mental \nhealth.  There shall not be reason to doubt that since \npregnancy   in   the   instant   matter   is   as   a   result   of \noffence   of   rape,   it   causes   a   huge   mental   trauma   and \nsuch inference is in consonance with explanation 1 to \n<a href=\"/doc/1331665/\" id=\"a_18\">section 3(1)</a> of the Act of 1971.  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_7\">11.

Chandigarh   Administration</a> \nreported in  2009(9) SCC 1, has observed that there is \nno   doubt   that   a   woman&#x27;s   right   to   make   reproductive \nchoices   is   also   a   dimension   of   &quot;personal   liberty&quot;   as \nunderstood   under   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article   21</a>   of   the   Constitution   of \nIndia.  It is important to recognise that reproductive \nchoice   can   be   exercised   to   procreate   as   well   as     to \nabstain   from   procreating.     The   crucial   consideration \nis that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily \nintegrity   should   be   respected.       In   the   instant \nmatter, when the victim was before the Medical Board, \nshe had communicated (It appears that while indicating \nthe   psychiatric   examination),   that   she   has   no   other \noption   than   to   commit   suicide   if   she   is   forced   to \ncontinue   pregnancy.     It   must   be   noted   that   the \npregnancy   carried   by   petitioner   is   as   a   result   of \nphysical abuse thrust against her and that she has a \nchoice   whether   to   continue   with   such   pregnancy   which \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">  ::: Uploaded on - 13/10/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 14/10/2017 02:51:55 :::</span>\n      (Judgment)                       (8)              W.P.

It shall also \nbe   taken   into   consideration   that   besides   physical \ninjury, the legislature has widened the scope of term \ninjury   by   including   injury   to   mental   health   of   a \npregnant   woman.     If   continuation   of   pregnancy   is \nharmful to mental health of a pregnant woman, then it \nshall   be   construed   as   a   good   legal   ground   for \npermitting   her   to   terminate   pregnancy   and,   since   in \nthe   instant   matter,   pregnancy   is   alleged   to   be   as   a \nresult of physical abuse, in view of <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_21\">section 5</a> of the \nAct   of   1971,   the   choice   of   the   victim   of   rape   of \nterminating unwanted pregnancy needs to be respected. \nObservations   made   by   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   in \nSuo Motu Public Interest Litigation no. 1/2016 in the \nmatter of  High Court on its own motion Vs.

A woman irrespective of her marital status can be\n            pregnant either by choice or it can be an unwanted\n            pregnancy. To be pregnant is a natural phenomenon\n            for which woman and man both are responsible.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">            Wanted pregnancy is shared equally, however, when it is\n            an accident or unwanted, then the man may not be\n            there to share the burden but it may only be the woman\n            on whom the burden falls. Under such circumstances, a\n            question arises why only a woman should suffer. There\n            are social, financial and other aspects immediately\n            attached to the pregnancy of the         woman and if\n            pregnancy is unwanted, it can have serious\n            repercussions. it undoubtedly affects her mental health.\n            The law makers have taken care of helpless plight of a\n            woman and have enacted <a href=\"/doc/681103/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(2)(b)(i)</a> by\n            incorporating the words &quot;grave injury to her mental\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">  ::: Uploaded on - 13/10/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 14/10/2017 02:51:55 :::</span>\n         (Judgment)                      (9)              W.P. No. 12408 of 2017\n\n\n               health&quot;. It is mandatory on the registered medical\n               practitioner while forming opinion of necessity of\n               termination of pregnancy to take into account whether\n               it is injurious to her physical or mental health. While\n               doing so, the woman&#x27;s actual or reasonable foreseeable\n               environment may be taken into account.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">12.               In   the   matter  of  Appellant  &quot;X&quot;  Vs.  Union   of \nIndia   and   others  reported   in  AIR   2016   SC   3525,   the \nHonourable   Apex   Court   considering   the   provisions   of \n<a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_23\">section 5</a> of the Act of 1971, permitted termination of \npregnancy   of   duration   of   23   to   24   weeks.     It   is \nobserved in the judgment that <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_24\">section 3</a> leaves no room \nfor   doubt   that   it   is   not   permissible   to   terminate \npregnancy after 20 weeks however, <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_25\">section 5</a> of the Act \nlays   down   exception   to   <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_26\">section   3</a>.     It   is   further \nobserved   that   termination   of   pregnancy   which   is \nnecessary   to   save   life   of   a   pregnant   woman   is \npermissible.   The Honourable Apex Court in the matter \nof  Appellant X Vs. union of India and others  reported \nin       AIR   2017   SC   1055,   granted   permission   for \ntermination of pregnancy of duration of 24 weeks since \nit was noticed that the foetus could not survive.   In \nthe instant matter, apart from danger to the life of \nthe   petitioner,   this   Court   has   to   take   note   of   the \npsychological trauma the petitioner is undergoing as a \nresult   of   carrying   unwanted   pregnancy.     As   has   been \nstated above, the freedom of petitioner to make choice \nto   terminate   unwanted   pregnancy   which   is   result   of \nphysical abuse needs to be respected and such freedom \nof choice shall have to be construed as integral part \nof her personal liberty.   In the instant matter, the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">     ::: Uploaded on - 13/10/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 14/10/2017 02:51:55 :::</span>\n       (Judgment)                   (10)             W.P.

In   the   circumstances,   we   do \nnot notice any impediment in permitting petitioner to \nterminate unwanted pregnancy.  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">13.            Learned   counsel   for   petitioner,   states   on \ninstructions,   that   the   petitioner   would   like   to \ncomplete the procedure of termination of pregnancy at \nGovernment   Medical   College   &amp;   Hospital,   Aurangabad. \nThe   Dean   of   Government   Medical   College   &amp;   Hospital, \nAurangabad is thus directed to forthwith complete the \nprocedure   of   termination   of   pregnancy   of   petitioner \nunder supervision of the team of medical experts.
