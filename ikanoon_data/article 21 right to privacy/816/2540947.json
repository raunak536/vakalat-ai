These two writ petitions raise common question of law\n\n     and are also in relation to same facts, hence are being\n\n     decided jointly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     2.   The petitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma, who was working\n\n     as an Inspector in the Rajasthan Police, after having already\n\n     served for 18 years in Indian Air Force, was asked to get his\n\n     DNA Test conducted and was subsequently subjected to\n\n     initiation of departmental enquiry vide memorandum dated\n\n     16/12/2000 during pendency of the writ petition alleging of\n\n     having illicit relations with one Dharma Rani (petitioner in the\n\n     connected writ petition) who is a Constable working in the\n\n     Rajasthan Police; and also of having begotten a child from\n\n     their illicit relations on 24/05/1997.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">     3.   The petitioner Dharma Rani in the connected writ\n\n     petition has been charge-sheeted vide memorandum dated\n\n     16/12/2000 of living with Mahesh Chand Sharma as husband\n\n     and wife in House No.151, Jeen Mata Ka Khurra, Galta Road,\n\n     Jaipur. She has been further charged of having stated during\n\n     preliminary enquiry conducted on 16/08/1997 of having got\n\n     married to one Mahesh Chand Sharma son of Bhagwati\n\n     Prasad Sharma on 10/07/1989 at Udaipur and the marriage\n\n     having taken place after performing Hindu rites and that she\n\n     has been going to and fro to her in-laws place after taking\n\n     leave and in the second statement, which she has submitted\n\n     to the authorities on 24/12/1998, she has mentioned of the\n\n     marriage having taken place at Udaipur in a temple which she\n                                   (3 of 33)                  [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\ndoes not know and also does not know where her in-laws are\n\nstaying   in   Udaipur    and      thus,      has    given     misleading\n\nstatements. The third charge levelled is again of misleading\n\nthe   authorities   by   giving    wrong      date    of   marriage     as\n\n10/07/1989 while in an application for taking casual leave\n\nshe has mentioned of sudden marriage having taken place\n\nvide her application dated 13/07/1992 for leave from\n\n08/07/1992 to 12/07/1992. The fourth charge levelled\n\nagainst her is of her father&#x27;s statement contrary to her\n\nversion wherein her father has refused to have performed\n\n&quot;Kanya Dan&quot; of his daughter Dharma Rani and has not\n\nparticipated in her marriage and thus there was no marriage\n\nperformed by her with Mahesh Chand Sharma son of\n\nBhagwati Prasad who has also not been produced during the\n\ncourse of preliminary enquiry. The further charge is that the\n\npetitioner Dharma Rani has mentioned name of father of her\n\nchild Yogendra as Tikam Chand (Mahesh) Haldenia in the card\n\nof &#x27;Janam Mahotsava&quot; while in the nomination Form No. GA-\n\n126 (RSR) dt.12/04/1993, she has mentioned name of\n\nnominee as Mahesh Chand Sharma. The sixth charge levelled\n\nagainst her is of having illicit relations with Mahesh Chand\n\nSharma, Police Inspector and of having begotten a child on\n\n24/05/1997 and she alongwith Mahesh Chand Sharma, Police\n\nInspector have conducted &quot;Havan&quot; prayer as husband and\n\nwife while performing birth ceremony of the child. Further\n\nallegation is of the petitioner Dharma Rani living with Mahesh\n\nChand Sharma son of Shri Girraj Prasad, Police Inspector and\n                              (4 of 33)            [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nmaintaining illicit relations and having acted in contravention\n\nof the Rajasthan Conduct Rules and tarnished police image in\n\npublic and thus has committed misconduct.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">4.   The petitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma had originally\n\nfiled writ petition only against the letter dated 30/01/1999\n\nwhereby he was directed to get his DNA Test conducted with\n\nfurther prayer to quash the enquiry which may be conducted\n\nagainst him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">5.   During the pendency of writ, petitioner Mahesh Chand\n\nSharma had been suspended from service vide order dated\n\n14/03/2001 and this Court vide order dated 23/03/2001\n\nstayed the operation of order of suspension till disposal of the\n\nwrit petition and further proceedings of the departmental\n\nenquiry were also stayed till disposal of the writ petition.\n\nPetitioner     Mahesh    Chand       Sharma     has    attained\n\nsuperannuation during pendency of writ.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">6.   Similarly, in writ petition of the petitioner Dharma Rani\n\nvide order dated 28/03/2001, the departmental proceedings\n\nas well as the order of suspension passed against her were\n\nalso stayed. She is stated to be still in service while her son\n\nhas grown more than 18 years of age.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">7.   Learned counsel for the petitioners Shri Ajeet Bhandari\n\nhas submitted that the action of the respondents in asking\n\nthe petitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma to get his DNA Test\n\nconducted was against all norms of service jurisprudence and\n\nthe State or its authorities have no authority under service\n\nrules to ask for such test to be conducted and also it has no\n                                (5 of 33)            [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nrelation with the working or field of duties which the\n\npetitioner has to perform. He submits that the respondents\n\nhave    conducted   an   enquiry     which   was   beyond    their\n\njurisdiction. Merely on a complaint of neighbours of Dharma\n\nBai including one Prabhu Devi. A fishing enquiry into the\n\nnature of personal relations of the petitioner could not have\n\nbeen conducted by the State authorities. The action amounts\n\nto maligning image of the petitioner and destroying his\n\noutstanding service career as well as his private family life\n\nand the purpose behind this was only to tarnish the image\n\nand deprive him of his further promotions. The action\n\ninherently suffers from malice in law and on facts.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">8.     The petitioner Dharma Rani has also given a statement\n\nthat the child born to her is not on account of illicit relations\n\nwith the petitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma and the family\n\nmembers of the petitioner have already given their statement\n\nin this regard pointing out that the petitioner does not have\n\nany illicit relation. It is submitted that the petitioner was also\n\nmarried to Pushpa Sharma in the year 1973 and had three\n\nchildren out of the wedlock. While the petitioner was in\n\ndefence services, he also underwent vasectomy operation on\n\n03/01/1978 which is already entered in his personal record\n\nmaintained by the Indian Air Force. He had an unblemished\n\ncareer but the action of the respondents has resulted in\n\ntarnishing his public image.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">9.     There are two aspects which need to be addressed\n\nseparately while deciding the present writ petitions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                                  (6 of 33)              [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">10.    The first aspect is with regard to factual pleadings taken\n\nup by the petitioners wherein, so far as the petitioner Mahesh\n\nChand Sharma is concerned, he has raised objections; firstly\n\nto the letter by which he was asked to get his DNA Test\n\nconducted and secondly to the aspect relating to charge-\n\nsheet issued to him for having illicit relations with petitioner\n\nDharma Rani and having procured a child from their\n\nrelationship and thus having acted unbecoming of an officer\n\nand committed a misconduct within meaning of Rule 4 of the\n\nRajasthan Conduct Rules, 1971.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">11.    Similarly, the petitioner Dharma Rani has raised two\n\nseparate questions. Firstly, with regard to the factual aspect\n\nof her having illicit relation with petitioner Mahesh Chand\n\nSharma and of having begotten a child from the said\n\nrelationship and secondly, the other aspect of the question\n\nraised of parenthood of her son by her mentioning of a\n\nparticular person as her husband and the authority of the\n\nState Government or its authorities to level allegations which\n\nintrude upon her private life and also affects privacy of her\n\nson.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">12.    The respondents have filed a reply and stated that\n\nmerely      because     the   petitioner     has   undergone     basic\n\nvasectomy operation, it cannot be said that he has become\n\ninfertile   and   has    supported     their   action   of   initiating\n\ndepartmental enquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">13.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has raised a larger\n\nquestion before this Court during course of arguments with\n                               (7 of 33)            [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nregard to the jurisdiction and the authority available with the\n\nState Government to initiate departmental proceedings in\n\nregard to the allegations of having illicit relationship. Learned\n\ncounsel submits that in the present scenario and with the\n\nchanges in the society and the laws as laid down by the Apex\n\nCourt from time to time, right to privacy inherently also\n\nmeans right to live with a person of his own choice and such\n\na private right relating to having sexual relationship with\n\nanother adult female or male, as the case may be, would not\n\ncome within the ambit of misconduct for the purpose of\n\ndepartmental proceedings under the Conduct Rules of 1971.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">14.   Learned counsel submits that Rule 4 of the Conduct\n\nRules, 1971, which provides that leading an immoral life\n\nbeing an improper and unbecoming conduct, is to be\n\ninterpreted differently. If an adult person is having sexual\n\nrelations with another woman apart from his wife, it cannot\n\nbe a subject matter for departmental proceedings for leading\n\nan immoral life. The Constitutional morality cannot be\n\nsacrificed at the alter of civil morality. A right to live with\n\ndignity inherently means a right to have a choice of ones own\n\nlife and the sovereign cannot be allowed to affect the day to\n\nday personal life of an individual. An individual may have a\n\nparticular relation with another independent of her job\n\nrequirements. While she may not be allowed to get married\n\nagain, her right to choose a partner for whom she has\n\naffection, cannot be denied or controlled by State or its\n\nauthorities. Any rule which is understood in a manner to\n                                 (8 of 33)             [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\ndeprive her of the said right would impinge upon her right to\n\nprivacy and sovereignty over her body would amount to\n\nviolence her fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 27</a> of the\n\nConstitution. While a Government servant may be under the\n\ncontrol of the Conduct Rules but the Conduct Rules cannot be\n\nespoused to treat and hold a relationship between a man and\n\na woman who may not be husband and wife as leading an\n\nimmoral   life   therefore,   the    relations   between    the   two\n\npetitioners could not be a subject matter of enquiry under the\n\nCCA Rules, 1958 nor their relationship can be said to come\n\nwithin the ambit of misconduct in terms of Rule 4(4) of the\n\nConduct Rules of 1971, even if it is stated that the allegation\n\nis true although the petitioners have denied the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">15.   Learned counsel        has taken this Court         to various\n\njudgments    passed     by     the    Supreme     Court    and    the\n\nobservations made therein which shall be referred to at the\n\nrelevant place in this judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">16.   Per-contra, Mr. GS Gill, learned Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral, appearing for the respondent-State has vehemently\n\nsupported the action and submits that so far as service laws\n\nare concerned, the State has an exclusive authority and\n\ncontrol on its employees. It is open for the State Government\n\nto put restrictions on the Government servants which may\n\nrelate to various aspects of living in the society. Certain\n\nactions are settled norms of immorality like drinking and\n\nsmoking in office premises and similarly of having illicit\n\nrelationship. The word &quot;illicit relationship&quot; has to be construed\n                              (9 of 33)           [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nto mean relationship of having sexual intercourse with\n\nanother person than her own spouse. Any action which\n\naffects a civilized society norms laid down and known as\n\n&quot;Maryada&quot;, mean leading an immoral life. He submits that\n\nany conduct which creates conflict in society has to be\n\ntreated as immoral. India i.e. &quot;Bharat&quot; as a country, has a\n\nlong cultural background spreading over 5000 years. The\n\nnorms which an Indian society believes in are those which\n\nhave come to be accepted by experience of their forefathers\n\nand ancestors. The Indians still believe in monogamy in the\n\nsociety and when a person enters into second marriage, he\n\nshall be treated to have committed a misconduct. Having\n\nrelationship, while his spouse is living, with another woman\n\ncannot be treated as a illusory offence. While the courts have\n\ndeclared <a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 494</a> IPC as ultravires, the action of having\n\nrelations with another woman cannot be said to be proper\n\nand has to be deprecated by the State. Once such an\n\ninformation has been received relating to a Government\n\nServant of having illicit relationship, enquiry in this regard\n\ncan always be conducted so as to maintain clean environment\n\nby the employer and there can be no exception to the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">17.   Mr. Gill, learned Additional Advocate General has also\n\ntaken this Court to the replica of the calligraphist version of\n\nthe Constitution of India wherein there is a photo lithography\n\non each part of the Constitution giving illustrations of the\n\nculture of &quot;Bharat&quot;. The illustrations show the &quot;Mohenjodaro&quot;\n\nperiod in Chapter-1, &quot;Vedic&quot; period showing scene from Vedic\n                             (10 of 33)             [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nAsram (Gurukul) in Chapter-2, epic period in Chapters 3 &amp; 4\n\nshowing scenes from &quot;Ramayana&quot; (conquest of Lanka and\n\nrecovery of Sita by Rama) and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (Srikrishna\n\npropounding Gita to Arjuna); &quot;Mahajanpada&quot; and &quot;Nanda&quot;\n\nperiod in Chapter-5 &amp; 6 showing scene from &quot;Buddha&#x27;s&quot; life\n\nand &quot;Mahaveer&#x27;s&quot; life. Chapter-7 illustrates &quot;Mauryan&quot; period\n\ndepicting spread of &quot;Buddhism&quot; by emperor &quot;Ashoka&quot; in India\n\nand abroad and &quot;Gupta&quot; period in Chapter-8 depicting scenes\n\nfrom &quot;Gupta&quot; art and its development in different phases.\n\nChapters 9 &amp; 10 also illustrate &quot;Gupta&quot; period showing\n\nscheme from &quot;Vikramaditya&#x27;s&quot; Court and the scenes depicting\n\none of the ancient Universities (Nalanda)&quot;. Chapters 11, 12\n\nand 13 are relating to the Medieval period showing scenes\n\nfrom &quot;Orrisan&quot; Sculptures, Image of &quot;Nataraja&quot; and scenes\n\nfrom   &quot;Mahabalipuram&quot;   Sculptures      showing   &quot;Bhagirath&#x27;s&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">penance and the descent of &quot;Ganga&quot;. Chapters 14 and 15\n\nspeak of &quot;Muslim&quot; period mentioning of portraits of &quot;Akbar&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">and &quot;Mugal&quot; architecture and portraits of &quot;Shivaji&quot; and &quot;Guru\n\nGovind Singh&quot; respectively. Chapter 16 depicts British period\n\nby showing portraits of &quot;Tipu Sultan&quot; and &quot;Lakshmi Bai&quot; and\n\nthe rise against the British conquest. Chapter 17 and 18\n\ndepict India&#x27;s Freedom Movement showing portraits of the\n\nFather of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, his Dandi March and\n\nBapuji, the Peace-Maker and his tour in the riot affected\n\nareas of &quot;Naokhali&quot;. Chapter 19 mentions revolutionary\n\nmovement for the freedom taken up by &quot;Netaji Subhash\n\nChandra Bose&quot; and the other portraits trying to liberate\n                              (11 of 33)           [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nMother India. Chapters 20, 21 and 22 depict the natural\n\nfeatures namely; scene of Himalaya, desert and ocean\n\nrespectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">18.   With the assistance of the above, learned Additional\n\nAdvocate General proceeds to argue that morality has\n\ndifferent connotation in different societies and different\n\ncountries. India as a nation follows the Constitutional will and\n\nthe aforesaid illustrations raised in each chapter depict the\n\nrich cultural heritage of India which believed in a particular\n\nconcept of life and method of living. It is his submission that\n\nin country like India, there is no room for allowing an\n\nindividual to enter into illicit relationship by having sexual\n\nrelations with persons other than his own spouse and\n\ntherefore, such actions, once they have come in knowledge of\n\nthe department of the employer, who are bound to follow the\n\nconstitutional goals, have to take departmental action and\n\nalso severely punish if proved. If no action is taken, it is\n\nbound to create indiscipline and the image of the department\n\nis also tarnished.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">19.   Learned Additional Advocate General further submits\n\nthat as per provisions of the Rajasthan Conduct Rules, 1971,\n\nthe petitioners can be said to be leading immoral life and\n\nimproper and unbecoming conduct of the petitioners was\n\nsufficient for conducting departmental enquiry against them\n\nin terms of the CCA Rules, 1958 and the charge-sheet issued\n\nto the petitioners cannot be said to be in any manner illegal,\n\narbitrary or unjustified. Countering the contention of the\n                              (12 of 33)          [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\npetitioners that it is only an inter-se relation between two of\n\nthem and the State would have no reason to intrude in the\n\nprivate life of the petitioners, he submits that it would\n\namount to allowing indiscipline amongst the forces and\n\nencourage persons to lead immoral life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">20.   I have considered the submissions and the judgments\n\nrelied upon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">21.   Having noted aforesaid, this Court deems it appropriate\n\nto deal with the first argument of both the petitioners jointly\n\nand the second argument raising the larger question jointly in\n\ntwo parts as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">22.   Part First:- A letter was issued to the petitioner\n\nMahesh Chand Sharma on 30/01/1999 whereby he was\n\ninformed that in view of the enquiry being conducted on the\n\nbasis of a complaint made against him and petitioner Dharma\n\nRani, it is necessary that he alongwith Dharma Rani and the\n\nchild remain present on 08/02/1999 before the Additional\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Jaipur City (North) at 10.00 am so\n\nthat their DNA Test may be conducted. This Court finds that\n\nsuch demand could not have been made by the concerned\n\npolice officer for the purpose of conduct investigation at his\n\nown level. Neither he has an authority to get the DNA Test\n\nconducted nor it can be said that there was a criminal case\n\nregistered against the petitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma. The\n\npetitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma has nowhere admitted of\n\nhaving relationship with petitioner Dharma Rani and has also\n\nsubmitted of having got      vasectomy operation conducted\n                              (13 of 33)           [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nupon him. It is also to be noticed that if DNA Test is\n\nconducted relating to the child, it would amount to examining\n\nthe paternity of the child and in departmental proceedings\n\nsuch a procedure cannot be allowed to be adopted as it would\n\nbe beyond the purview of the authorities since the child\n\ncannot be said in any manner to be under the control of the\n\nconcerned departmental authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">22.1 As regards the DNA Test of petitioner Dharma Rani and\n\npetitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma is concerned, such a course\n\nwas not available for the departmental authorities for\n\ninvestigation on a private complaint.

Admittedly, since the wife\n\nand children of the petitioner Mahesh Chand Sharma have\n\nnot made any complaint nor there is any such statement of\n\nhis spouse or any other family member, merely on the basis\n\nof some complaint made by the residents of a particular\n\ncolony, the department ought not have proceeded to initiate\n\ndepartmental    proceedings.      The     preliminary   enquiry\n\nconducted could not have been conducted on the basis of\n\nsuch complaint and it cannot be ruled out that            such\n                                 (14 of 33)          [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\ncomplaints made by the individuals may be on account of\n\nseveral other considerations as have been alleged by the\n\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">22.3 The departmental process cannot be started on the\n\nbasis of private complaint and the fishing enquiry conducted\n\non the said basis is held to be unjustified.\n\n22.4 The aspect relating to illicit relationship or a relationship\n\nof living of a man and woman like husband and wife, require\n\nfactual proof and on the basis of surmises and conjectures or\n\nrumors, a presumption cannot be drawn that a lady is having\n\nillicit relationship with a man.

The\n\nstandards of living in a society, as <a href=\"/doc/162566950/\" id=\"a_8\">laid down by</a> it for an\n\nindividual, is generally understood to be the concept of\n\nmorality. There are certain aspects of mankind which are\n\ngenerally accepted as immoral and moral. For example,\n\nhelping others, keeping promises, living an honest life are\n\ntreated as virtues which are said to be moral while\n\ncommitting   acts   of   murder,   rape,   cheating,   lying   and\n\nbehaving in a manner different from others. Causing danger\n\nor apprehension in mind of others, is generally considered as\n\nacts of immorality. A person, who is upholding mutual\n                              (17 of 33)               [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nrelationships   being   trustworthy,      local,   respectful   and\n\ngratuitous, is said to be having high moral values by the\n\npeople who are surrounding him and in the society where he\n\nis living. However, there may be circumstances where a\n\nparticular sect of people or a particular community or\n\nresidents of a particular area like tribals who may fix their\n\ndifferent norms of living and for them certain actions may not\n\nbe immoral.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162566950\" id=\"span_5\">23.2 Thus, polygamy is found to be ever common in Nepal.\n\nAmongst tribals also, there is a concept of men having\n\nseveral wives or even women living with single male. In\n\nRajasthan, there are certain communities who believe in\n\n&#x27;Nata&#x27; marriage i.e. where a lady, after marriage, may leave\n\nher husband and start living with another male with the\n\nconsent of her father. Similarly, there is also a concept of\n\nkeeping one&#x27;s &#x27;Bhabhi&#x27; who has become a widow as a wife.\n\n23.3 While generally, it is held that being faithful to one&#x27;s\n\nspouse and not having relations with any other woman is one\n\nof the concept of moral values, however, it has different\n\nconnotations in different societies. Thus, what is understood\n\nto be leading a moral life in one particular society, may be\n\ntreated as leading an immoral life in another.\n\n23.4 If we look at the Indian mythology, we find that Indian\n\nGods have had single wife and there are some Gods who\n\nhave had more than one wife like Lord Ganesh who is said to\n\nhave Ridhi and Siddhi as his life partners. Lord Indra is said\n\nto have several concubines known as &quot;Aphsaras&quot;. Lord\n                                 (18 of 33)            [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nKrishna is said to have had 16000 &quot;Ranis&quot; but these are all\n\nmythological concepts having no concrete bases as such but\n\nthe only aspect which can be understood is that            of being\n\nfaithful to the spouse alone and is a concept understood in\n\nrelation to the new laws and norms <a href=\"/doc/162566950/\" id=\"a_9\">laid down in</a> the society.\n\n23.5 In opposition to the aforesaid concept of mythology,\n\nthere is another thought process and that is in relation to the\n\nindividual&#x27;s right of choice. Under <a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 494</a> IPC, marrying\n\nagain during lifetime of husband or wife is an offence.</span> It is\n\none of the offence relating to marriage and is a non-\n\ncognizable offence that is tried on the basis of a complaint\n\nmade by husband or wife as the case may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"42184625\" id=\"span_6\">23.6 In an article by Amelie Rorty published in Journal Ethics\n\n2012 on the subject of &quot;Use and Abuse of Morality, she states\n\n&quot;Righteous and self-righteous people misappropriate the\n\nclaims and language of morality placing themselves in the\n\nposition   of   divinity,   judging   the    world,   praising   and\n\ncondemning according to their lights. The second abuse of\n\nmorality is moral narcissism talking about purity of the heart.\n\nThe third abuse of morality is that of claiming the high\n\nground of justification or condemnation.&quot;\n\n23.7 The concept of illicit relation i.e. of a married man living\n\nconsensually with another woman or a woman living and\n\nhaving sexual intercourse with a married man is taken from\n\nthe concept of adultery which was defined in <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 497</a> IPC.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has declared <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 497</a> as\n\nultravires in a case of <a href=\"/doc/42184625/\" id=\"a_13\">Joseph Shine Vs.

With regard to right of privacy, this Court finds that\n\nprivacy has a very long history, it has its origins already in\n\nthe ancient societies. Even the Bible has some passages\n\nwhere the violation of privacy appeared in its early form,\n\nwhere shame and anger followed the intrusion into someone&#x27;s\n\nprivate sphere. It is enough to think of Adam and Eve, who\n\nstarted to cover their bodies with leaves in order to preserve\n\ntheir privacy. From a legal point of view, the Code of\n\nHammurabi contained a paragraph against the intrusion into\n\nsomeone&#x27;s home. The Roman law also regulated the same\n\nquestion. The idea of privacy traditionally comes from the\n\ndifference between &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot;, which distinction\n\ncomes from the natural need - as old as mankind - of the\n\nindividual to make a distinction between himself/herself and\n\nthe outer world. Of course the limits between private and\n\npublic differ according to the given era and society, which will\n\ncause the on-going change throughout history of what people\n\nconsider private. Plato illustrates this phenomenon in his\n\ndialogue &#x27;the Laws&#x27;, where the complete life of the individual\n\nwas determined by the state and its aims, there was no place\n\nfor   individual   freedom   and   autonomy.   Thus   the   book\n\ndescribes a very extreme state (which in totality was never\n\nrealised), some elements of it came true in ancient societies,\n                                 (20 of 33)            [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nand the life of the individual was strongly influenced by the\n\npublic interests. In the Medieval Age &#x27;Privacy&#x27; did not exist as\n\na societal value in today&#x27;s sense, the individual existed as a\n\nmember of a community, so his/her private life was affected\n\nby the constant &quot;monitoring&quot; conducted by other members.\n\nThe appearance of &quot;real&quot; privacy relates to the transformation\n\nof these small communities: the appearance of cities. During\n\nthe 19th century the new changes in the economy and in the\n\nsociety led to the transformation of the way people lived and\n\nthese new changes had had consequences for privacy too, as\n\nphysical and mental privacy were separated and started to\n\nevolve in two different ways. Due to urbanization, the\n\npopulation of cities started to grow and it led to the physical\n\nloss of privacy as people in cities had to live in crowded\n\nplaces. On the other hand, citizens could experience a new\n\n&quot;type&quot; of privacy, as they ceased to live under them. They\n\nrecognized two phenomena that posed a threat to privacy:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">technological     development           (namely       instantaneous\n\nphotographs)    and   gossip,     which      became   a   trade   in\n\nnewspapers. Considering these changes, they were the first\n\nto demand the recognition of the right to privacy (which they\n\ndefined as &quot;the right to be let alone&quot;) as a separate and\n\ngeneral right, as a right which ensured protection against not\n\nthe violation of property rights, but the mere emotional\n\nsuffering. Warren and Brandeis defined an already existing\n\ncommon law right as a stepping stone to the right to be let\n\nalone, such as the right to determine to what extents the\n                               (21 of 33)           [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\nthoughts, the sentiments and emotions of the individual shall\n\nbe communicated to others. The principle of this right was\n\nthe &quot;inviolate personality&quot;. The right to be let alone basically\n\nensured protection against the unwanted disclosure of private\n\nfacts, thoughts, emotions, etc.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">25.   The concept of privacy has to be looked into with\n\nrespect to two view points. Firstly, from the point of view of\n\nan individual and secondly, from the point of view of the\n\nsociety. In a given circumstance, the society might treat\n\nprivacy of an individual the way they allow him to remain\n\nwhile the individual will have an idea of privacy in a manner\n\nhe feels society and its members must leave it for him. This\n\nconflict continues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">26.   There is another concept and that is of adultery. It is a\n\nconcept emerging from mutual faith which two partners living\n\nin relationship with each other have. Here again, a female\n\nmay want to have relationship and have sexual enjoyment\n\nwith another person without having any personal shame or\n\nmental constraint. However, another woman already in\n\nrelationship by way of marriage or otherwise may object her\n\npartner of having sexual relationship of any kind with another\n\nwoman who wants him. Thus, for woman &#x27;a&#x27;, it is not an\n\nadultery but for woman &#x27;b&#x27; it is loss of faith if her partner has\n\nalso started having relationship with another woman and\n\nwoman may call it adultery and object. Thus, abiding\n\ndisapproval of infidelity by the wife or partner is an adultery\n\nfor that person.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                              (22 of 33)             [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">27.   It is true that in the Indian society, promiscuous\n\nrelationship or adulterous relationship is understood to mean\n\nin the present circumstances as a relation created between a\n\nmale and a female person contrary to the norms laid down by\n\nthe society. It may be live in relationship without getting\n\nmarried or it may be a relationship between a married man\n\nand a married woman or an unmarried man with a married\n\nwoman and a married man and a unmarried woman. The\n\nIndian society does not accept such affairs to come within the\n\ndefinition of morality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">28.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"812938\" id=\"span_7\">Interestingly, in one of the cases which came up before\n\nthe Supreme Court namely; <a href=\"/doc/812938/\" id=\"a_14\">Ministry of Finance and\n\nanother Vs. S.B. Ramesh</a>: (1998) 3 SCC 227, wherein\n\nallegation was of Mr. SB Ramesh, an Income Tax Officer\n\ncontracting second marriage with one K.R. Aruna while his\n\nfirst wife Smt.

Aruna and also had begotten children\n\nfrom her and accordingly he had exhibited a conduct\n\nunbecoming of a Government servant. He was compulsorily\n\nretired in departmental proceedings. While setting aside the\n\nfindings and the departmental proceedings, the Tribunal\n\nmade    certain   observations   which    were   quoted   by   the\n\nSupreme Court as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;Though it would be ideal if sexual relationship is\n      confined to legal wedlock, there is no law in our\n      country which makes sexual relationship of two\n      adult individuals of different sex, unlawful unless\n      the relationship is adulterous or promiscuous. If\n                               (23 of 33)              [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n      a man and a woman are residing under the same\n      roof and if there is no law prohibiting such a\n      residence, what transpires between them is not a\n      concern of their employer. Such a life, if accepted\n      by the society at large, without any displeasure\n      or grudge, then it cannot be said that there is\n      any moral turpitude involved in their living. In\n      this case, there is no case that on account of the\n      applicant living with Smt. K.R. Aruna, his\n      reputation among the general public has been\n      lowered or that, the public has been looking\n      down on his conduct as immoral one. Therefore,\n      even if factually, the allegation that the applicant\n      who is already married to another woman is\n      living with Smt. K.R. Aruna is proved to be true,\n      we are of the considered view that, that alone\n      will not justify a finding that the applicant is\n      guilty of misconduct deserving departmental\n      action and punishment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">29.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"812938\" id=\"span_8\">In the aforesaid case of <a href=\"/doc/812938/\" id=\"a_15\">Ministry of Finance and\n\nanother Vs.

To fully\ncomprehend its nature and impact, every\nlegislative provision must be understood as a\n&#x27;discourse&#x27; about social structuring. However, the\ndiscourse of law is not homogenous. In the\ncontext particularly of <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 497</a>, it regards\nindividuals as &#x27;gendered citizens&#x27;. In doing so,\nthe law creates and ascribes gender roles based\non      existing    societal     stereotypes.

While it is true that the\n\nConstitution of India depicts the history of India i.e. &#x27;Bharat&#x27;,\n\nhowever, as held by the Supreme Court, as noted above in\n\nforegoing paras, the evolution of a human mind is a\n\ncontinuous process. With the change of times, the concept of\n\nmorality has to be understood according to change of the\n\nsociety and the concept which an individual citizen may be\n\nholding 100 years back, would not be the same with the\n\nprogression of he human development.

In the\n      theatre of life, without possession of the attribute\n      of identity with dignity, the entity may be allowed\n      entry to the centre stage but would be\n      characterized as a spineless entity or, for that\n      matter, projected as a ruling king without the\n      sceptre. The purpose of saying so is that the\n      identity of every individual attains the quality of\n      an ―individual being‖ only if he/she has the\n      dignity. Dignity while expressive of choice is\n      averse to creation of any dent. When biological\n                               (32 of 33)            [CW-2067/1999]\n\n\n      expression, be it an orientation or optional\n      expression of choice, is faced with impediment,\n      albeit through any imposition of law, the\n      individual&#x27;s natural and constitutional right is\n      dented. Such a situation urges the conscience of\n      the final constitutional arbiter to 56 (1978) 1 SCC\n      248 demolish the obstruction and remove the\n      impediment so as to allow the full blossoming of\n      the natural and constitutional             rights  of\n      individuals. This is the essence of dignity and we\n      say, without any inhibition, that it is our\n      constitutional duty to allow the individual to\n      behave and conduct himself/herself as he/she\n      desires    and     allow    him/her     to    express\n      himself/herself, of course, with the consent of the\n      other.

In view of the above discussions and observations, this\n\nCourt is of the opinion that an act of relationship entered by\n\nan individual with another female or male as the case may be\n\nwhile is/her spouse is alive would be an act of amounting to\n\nadultery and would be considered as an immoral act so far as\n\nthe Indian society is concerned.
