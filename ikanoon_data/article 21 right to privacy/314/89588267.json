The petitioner is a lawyer. He has given a representation dated 22.01.2018, to the Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, Secretariat, Fort St. George, Chennai, relevant portion of the representation read as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\u00132. The courts have often come to the rescue of the innocent victims of marriage in other guises also. For example a man could set up a separate household for his concubine, would have even married her without the knowledge of his wife, to the detriment of both. Even after years of living together and begetting children men could easily wriggle out of the marital obligations under the defense that the marriage is not legal, taking advantage of his own illegal action. However the Supreme Court and the High Courts justified the rights of illegitimate children over the father&#x27;s estate and also approved \u0013live-in\u0014 relationships as being eligible for maintenance. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court also has given directions with regard to uniform civil code. There are so many occasions when the courts came to the rescue of helpless women who underwent untold misery and established their rights. One such directions was a directive to form guidelines and make registration of marriages compulsory, whatever be the personal law. I submit that though the Tamilnadu Registration of Marriages Act 2009 was enacted it did not make registration mandatory. Section 23 therein provides that no marriage would be considered invalid on the ground that it had not been registered under the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t3. I submit that it is time that a scheme of regularization be brought in to register all marriages and have a database of the same. Just like how conveyances and property related transactions are catalogued and made available upon search, marriage details should also be made available upon application for the same. Similarly there should be an adjudication system for condoning delays in registration and also for resolving disputes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t4. I submit that apart from this time has now evolved for checking another crime which is now prevalently the major reason for divorces viz. the medical fitness or the existence of a contagious disease in the spouse. While the parents of boy or girl venture to check about the background, character, the number of sister or brother to the groom and the presence or absence of in-laws, and most of the families look for the harmony in horoscopes but fail to check about the physical fitness of the groom and bribe. This kind of handicap is often not found until a person is married and gets acquainted with the partner and in worst cases, after being victim of the contagious disease themselves. I therefore submit that a medical fitness certificate from a recognized physician ought to be made a precondition for a valid marriage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t5. As the popular saying goes, \u0013Necessity is the mother of all inventions.\u0014 As novel and new crimes are invented, new laws and rules come into force to curb the crimes. Therefore registration of marriages along with a medical fitness certificate should be made mandatory to make any marriage valid. Courts are being liberal when rights are denied on the ground that the marriage is not registered which is of course a welcome gesture. Even recently the Madurai Bench of this Hon&#x27;ble Court has held that registration of a inter religious marriage is not mandatory. However to regulate the entire system like how an Aadhar card is the single unit record of an individual&#x27;s identity a marriage database of all marriages is also necessary so that prospective brides and grooms can look upto the same before consent to marriage and to ensure that their &#x27;would be partner&#x27; is not already married. A certificate of medical fitness would put an end to all anxiety about health related issues which may crop up later.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\t3. The writ petition has been filed for the reason that, the representation of the petitioner, has not been considered. The writ petition is nothing but a reproduction of the representation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\t4. The prayer of the writ petitioner can be broken into two parts. The first part of the prayer is for making a scheme for registering all the marriages conducted so far and hereinafter. The second part of the prayer is for a direction to declare that a medical certificate of fitness is compulsory for all the prospective registrations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\t5.

The Court observed that it is neither legal nor proper for the High Court to issue directions or advisory sermons to the executive in respect of the sphere which is exclusively within the domain of the executive under the Constitution. The power under <a href=\"/doc/1123043/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 309</a> of the Constitution to frame rules is the legislative power. This power under the Constitution has to be exercised by the President or the Governor of a State, as the case may be. The courts cannot usurp the functions assigned to the executive under the Constitution and cannot even indirectly require the executive to exercise its law-making power in any manner.

In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala [Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225] (\u0013Kesavananda Bharati\u0014), Sikri, C.J. noticed that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution. The Preamble emphasises the need to secure to all citizens justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Together they constitute the founding faith or the blueprint of values embodied with a sense of permanence in the constitutional document. The Preamble speaks of securing liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Fraternity is to be promoted to assure the dignity of the individual. The individual lies at the core of constitutional focus and the ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity animate the vision of securing a dignified existence to the individual. The Preamble envisions a social ordering in which fundamental constitutional values are regarded as indispensable to the pursuit of happiness. Such fundamental values have also found reflection in the foundational document of totalitarian regimes in other parts of the world. What distinguishes India is the adoption of a democratic way of life, founded on the Rule of Law. Democracy accepts differences of perception, acknowledges divergences in ways of life, and respects dissent. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">108. Over the last four decades, our constitutional jurisprudence has recognised the inseparable relationship between protection of life and liberty with dignity. Dignity as a constitutional value finds expression in the Preamble. The constitutional vision seeks the realisation of justice (social, economic and political); liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship); equality (as a guarantee against arbitrary treatment of individuals) and fraternity (which assures a life of dignity to every individual). These constitutional precepts exist in unity to facilitate a humane and compassionate society. The individual is the focal point of the Constitution because it is in the realisation of individual rights that the collective well-being of the community is determined. Human dignity is an integral part of the Constitution. Reflections of dignity are found in the guarantee against arbitrariness (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 14</a>), the lamps of freedom (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19</a>) and in the right to life and personal liberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a>). \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">119. To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of the Constitution defined their vision of the society in which constitutional values would be attained by emphasising, among other freedoms, liberty and dignity. So fundamental is dignity that it permeates the core of the rights guaranteed to the individual by Part III. Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence. Privacy with its attendant values assures dignity to the individual and it is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true substance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity and is a core value which the protection of life and liberty is intended to achieve. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement or a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are inseparably intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realisation of the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the body and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions on vital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an independent fundamental right. But that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded to it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with those fundamental rights which are expressly protected is understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary State action. It prevents the State from discriminating between individuals. The destruction by the State of a sanctified personal space whether of the body or of the mind is violative of the guarantee against arbitrary State action. Privacy of the body entitles an individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The intersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-determination. When these guarantees intersect with gender, they create a private space which protects all those elements which are crucial to gender identity. The family, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how freedom shall be exercised. An individual may perceive that the best form of expression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a process of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes which musically lead to silence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on the ability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas or interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood. The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including what and how one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other matters on which autonomy and self-determination require a choice to be made within the privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not express those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner in which privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been declared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with an alpha-suffixed right to privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">309. Formulation of a regime for data protection is a complex exercise which needs to be undertaken by the State after a careful balancing of the requirements of privacy coupled with other values which the protection of data subserves together with the legitimate concerns of the State. One of the chief concerns which the formulation of a data protection regime has to take into account is that while the web is a source of lawful activity\u0017both personal and commercial, concerns of national security intervene since the seamless structure of the web can be exploited by terrorists to wreak havoc and destruction on civilised societies. Cyber attacks can threaten financial systems. Richard A. Posner, in an illuminating article, has observed:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">\u0013Privacy is the terrorist&#x27;s best friend, and the terrorist&#x27;s privacy has been enhanced by the same technological developments that have both made data mining feasible and elicited vast quantities of personal information from innocents: the internet, with its anonymity, and the secure encryption of digitized data which, when combined with that anonymity, make the internet a powerful tool of conspiracy. The government has a compelling need to exploit digitization in defense of national security.\u0005\u0014 [ Richard A. Posner, \u0013Privacy, Surveillance, and Law\u0014, The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), Vol. 75, at p. 251.]\nPosner notes that while \u0013people value their informational privacy\u0014, yet \u0013they surrender it at the drop of a hat\u0014 by readily sharing personal data in the course of simple daily transactions. The paradox, he observes, can be resolved by noting that as long as people do not expect that the details of their health, intimacies and finances among others will be used to harm them in interaction with other people, they are content to reveal those details when they derive benefits from the revelation. [ Richard A. Posner, \u0013Privacy, Surveillance, and Law\u0014, The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), Vol. 75, at p. 251.] As long as intelligence personnel can be trusted to use the knowledge gained only for the defence of the nation, \u0013the public will be compensated for the costs of diminished privacy in increased security from terrorist attacks\u0014 [ Richard A. Posner, \u0013Privacy, Surveillance, and Law\u0014, The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), Vol. 75, at p. 251.] . Posner&#x27;s formulation would indicate that the State does have a legitimate interest when it monitors the web to secure the nation against cyber attacks and the activities of terrorists.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">310. While it intervenes to protect legitimate State interests, the State must nevertheless put into place a robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a threefold requirement. These three requirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not just informational privacy). They emanate from the procedural and content-based mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21.</a> The first requirement that there must be a law in existence to justify an encroachment on privacy is an express requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21.</a> For, no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law. The existence of law is an essential requirement. Second, the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate State aim, ensures that the nature and content of the law which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of reasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 14</a>, which is a guarantee against arbitrary State action. The pursuit of a legitimate State aim ensures that the law does not suffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial review does not reappreciate or second guess the value judgment of the legislature but is for deciding whether the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from palpable or manifest arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the means which are adopted by the legislature are proportional to the object and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the guarantee against arbitrary State action because it ensures that the nature and quality of the encroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence, the threefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual interdependence between the fundamental guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and the protection of life and personal liberty, on the other. The right to privacy, which is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is subject to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">318.
