The MCI by virtue of Regulations on Graduate\n\nMedical Education (Amendment) 2010, (Part II) notified by the\n\nGovernment of India, amended the Regulations on Graduate Medical\n\nEducation, 1997.     Similarly, the other notification issued by MCI\n\ncalled “Post­Graduate Medical Education (Amendment) Regulation,\n\n2010 (Part­II)” to amend the Post Graduate Medical Education\n\nRegulations, 2000.

In Writ Petition (C) No.443 of 2016, prayer has been made to\n\nprotect the rights of the petitioner­institutions guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_8\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_9\">, 25</a><a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_10\">, 26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_11\">30</a> of the Constitution of India. In Writ\n\nPetition (C) No.750 of 2016, prayer is made to direct the respondents\n\nto conduct centralized counselling for admission to all Graduate\n\nMedical and Dental Courses throughout the country. In Transferred\n\nCase (C) No.25 of 2019, it is stated that vires of the provisions of\n\nMaharasthra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institution\n\n(Regulation of Admissions &amp; Fees) Act, 2015, applying them to\n\nUnaided Private Minority Professional Educational Institutions are bad\n\nin law.    In S.L.P. (C) No.28223 of 2016, provisions have been\n\nquestioned on the ground that they cannot take away the rights\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_13\">30</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_14\">Articles 25</a><a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_15\">, 26</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/421731/\" id=\"a_16\">29(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">8.   Initially, the questions were raised that MCI and DCI could not\n\nhave introduced NEET as the same offends the fundamental rights\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                   12</span>\n\n\nguaranteed under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India and the\n\nrights of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer\n\neducational institutions of their choice as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 30</a>\n\nConstitution of India.   Thus, subordinate legislation could not have\n\noverriding effect over the fundamental rights guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_18\">Articles 25</a><a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_19\">, 26</a><a href=\"/doc/421731/\" id=\"a_20\">, 29(1)</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_21\">30</a> of the Constitution of India. Now the\n\namendment made could not take away or abridge the aforesaid rights\n\nof minorities. The right to admit students is one of the fundamental\n\nrights, thus, rider of clearing NEET examination could not have been\n\nimposed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">9.   It was urged on behalf of petitioners that the impugned\n\nnotifications violate the fundamental rights of an unaided minority\n\ninstitution to “establish and administer educational institutions of\n\ntheir choice” protected under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 30</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_23\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_24\">26</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India, which includes the right to admit students\n\nof their own choice. The doctrine of limited Government provides that\n\na citizen&#x27;s liberty and autonomy is the central notion of the\n\nConstitution of India and there is an inherent limitation on the State&#x27;s\n\ninvolvement in matters of admissions of students.            The NEET\n\nprescribes no alternative to the institution, impinges upon the\n\nfundamental rights of an unaided minority institution to establish and\n\nadminister educational institution of their choice.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                   13</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">10.   It was further urged on behalf of petitioners that State has no\n\npower to compel an unaided minority institution to admit students\n\nthrough a single centralized national examination such as NEET. The\n\nunaided minority professional colleges have the fundamental rights to\n\nchoose the method and manner in which to admit its students,\n\nsubject to satisfying the triple test of having a fair, transparent, and\n\nnon­exploitative process.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">11.   It was also argued on behalf of petitioners that they have a time­\n\ntested admission procedure without any complaints. Their process is\n\nfair and transparent, and they have a fundamental right to protect\n\nautonomy and reputation by continuing to admit students using their\n\nadmission process.     The NEET cannot be the only parameter to\n\ndetermine the merit of a student.       Some of the institutions are\n\nproviding best medical professional by having their procedure for\n\nadmission. They have fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_25\">Articles 19(1)(g)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_26\">30(1)</a> of the Constitution to conduct and manage the affairs of the\n\ninstitution. The State, while imposing reasonable restrictions, can fix\n\nthe threshold criterion of merit, but cannot restrict the petitioners\n\nfrom having any additional criteria of merit over and above the\n\nthreshold fixed by the State.     The restriction violates the test of\n\nproportionality.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                     14</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">12.   The petitioners have also referred to the existing position\n\nconcerning centralised examination for professional courses in India\n\nand   internationally,   to   hold   entrance   examination   cannot   be\n\ncompulsion, it has to be voluntarily. They have relied upon Common\n\nLaw Admission Test (CLAT) ­ a system of examination for admission in\n\nthe Law Colleges.    Reference has also been made to the admission\n\nprocess followed in Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), National\n\nInstitute of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institute of Management\n\n(IIMs). NEET is the first of its kind, both in India and globally, where\n\nall institutions are compelled by the State to follow a single admission\n\nprocedure. Some of the institutions are having an excellent record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">They follow the gurukul tradition. With the introduction of NEET in\n\n2016­17, institutions have been compelled to admit students through\n\nNEET instead of their method.         Some of them have the All India\n\nEntrance Test.   They have their unique procedure of admission for\n\nMBBS as well as Post Graduation. The system of examination of some\n\nof the institutions is wider on All India Basis, and they test general\n\nability also, whereas, in NEET, evaluation is based on three subjects,\n\nnamely, Physics, Biology, and Chemistry.        They have an elaborate\n\nprocedure of the assessment, and they do not admit students only\n\nbased on their theoretical knowledge.       Some of them are the best\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   15</span>\n\n\nmedical educational institutions in the country. There is not even a\n\nsingle allegation of maladministration against some of the reputed\n\ninstitutions. The principles, which govern the selection, are eligibility,\n\nsuitability, and distributive justice. The selection of candidates is an\n\nimportant factor to the medical colleges to suit their requirements in a\n\nparticular field.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">13.   There are various issues which have arisen according to the\n\nadmission given for post­graduate examination after the introduction\n\nof NEET. Now, in some of the specialised institutions, they are not\n\ngetting good doctors to take care of patients, for example, in the\n\nOncology Department. Some of the candidates are not able to bear\n\nthe burden of the procedure and have expressed their inability to go\n\nwith very sick patients.   Some of them were not able to undertake\n\nprocedures in a sterile manner to avoid infections.       Similar is the\n\nposition in other super­speciality departments. There are complaints\n\nof lack of clinical competence among students admitted to speciality\n\ncourses like general medicine.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">14.   The petitioners further submitted that they have a fundamental\n\nright to admit students of their own choice under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 30</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It is submitted that the admission procedure adopted by\n\nthem passes the triple test, i.e., fair, transparent, and non­\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                  16</span>\n\n\nexploitative.   Various orders were passed by this Court recognising\n\nfair method adopted in individual institutions while admitting\n\nstudents through their admission procedure as apparent from interim\n\norders passed in the years 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1998.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">15.   This Court on 28.4.2016 passed an order in Sankalp Charitable\n\nTrust and Anr. v.

In Re The Kerala Education Bill, 1957, AIR 1958 SC 956,\n\nquestion arose concerning right of the Government to prescribe\n\nqualification to be possessed by the incumbents for appointment as\n\nteachers in aided or recognized schools.            The State Public Service\n\nCommission was empowered to select candidates for appointment as\n\nteachers in Government and aided schools.              The Court opined that\n\nminority cannot ask for the aid or recognition for an educational\n\ninstitution without competent teachers and fair standards. The choice\n\ndoes not necessarily militate against the claim of the State to insist on\n\nreasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to\n\nbe aided or even recognized. The Court held thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">         “(29) Their grievances are thus stated: The gist of the right of\n         administration of a school is the power of appointment,\n         control, and dismissal of teachers and other staff. But under\n         the said Bill such power of management is practically taken\n         away. Thus the manager must submit annual statements (Cl.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">         5). The fixed assets of the aided schools are frozen and cannot\n         be dealt with except with the permission of the authorised\n         officer (Cl. 6). No educational agency of an aided school can\n         appoint a manager of its choice and the manager is completely\n         under the control of the authorised officer, for he must keep\n         accounts in the manner he is told to do and to give periodical\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                              21</span>\n\n\ninspection of them and on the closure of the school the\naccounts must be made over to the authorised officer (Cl. 7).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">All fees etc. collected will have to be made over to the\nGovernment (Cl. 8(3)). Government will take up the task of\npaying the teachers and the non­teaching staff (Cl. 9).\nGovernment will prescribe the qualification of teachers (Cl. 10).\nThe school authorities cannot appoint a single teacher of their\nchoice, but must appoint persons out of the panel settled by\nthe Public Service Commission (Cl. 11). The school authorities\nmust provide amenities to teachers and cannot dismiss,\nremove, reduce, or even suspend a teacher without the\nprevious sanction of the authorised officer (Cl. 12). ……\n\n(31) We are thus faced with a problem of considerable\ncomplexity apparently difficult of solution. There is, on the one\nhand the minority rights under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_51\">Art. 30(1)</a> to establish and\nadminister educational institutions of their choice and the\nduty of the Government to promote education, there is, on the\nother side the obligation of the State under <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_52\">Art. 45</a> to\nendeavour to introduce free and compulsory education. We\nhave to reconcile between these two conflicting interests and to\ngive effect to both if that is possible and bring about a\nsynthesis between the two. The directive principles cannot\nignore or override the fundamental rights but must, as we\nhave said, subserve the fundamental rights. We have already\nobserved that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_53\">Art. 30(1)</a> gives two rights to the minorities, (1)\nto establish and (2) to administer educational institutions of\ntheir choice. The right to administer cannot obviously include\nthe right to                        maladminister. The minority\ncannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational\ninstitution run by them in unhealthy surroundings, without\nany competent teachers, possessing any semblance of\nqualification, and which does not maintain even a fair\nstandard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive of\nthe welfare of the scholars. It stands to reason, then, that the\nconstitutional right to administer an educational institution of\ntheir choice does not necessarily militate against the claim of\nthe State to insist that in order to grant aid the State may\nprescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of\nthe institutions to be aided. Learned Attorney­General\nconcedes that reasonable regulations may certainly be\nimposed by the State as a condition for aid or even for\nrecognition... ...Clauses 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 20\nrelate to the management of aided schools. Some of these\nprovisions, e.g., 7, 10, 11(1), 12(1)(2)(3) and (5) may easily be\nregarded as reasonable regulations or conditions for the grant\nof aid. Clauses 9, 11(2) and 12(4) are, however, objected to as\ngoing much beyond the permissible limit. It is said that by\ntaking over the collections of fees etc., and by undertaking to\npay the salaries of the teachers and other staff the\nGovernment is in reality confiscating the school fund and\ntaking away the prestige of the school, for none will care for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                22</span>\n\n\nthe school authority. Likewise Cl. 11 takes away an obvious\nitem of management, for the manager cannot appoint any\nteacher at all except out of the panel to be prepared by the\nPublic Service Commission which, apart from the question of\nits power of taking up such duties, may not be qualified at all\nto select teachers who will be acceptable to religious\ndenominations and in particular sub­cl. (2) of that clause is\nobjectionable for it thrusts upon educational institutions of\nreligious minorities teachers of Scheduled Castes who may\nhave no knowledge of the tenets of their religion and may be\notherwise weak educationally. Power of dismissal, removal,\nreduction in rank, or suspension is an index of the right of\nmanagement, and that is taken away by Cl. 12(4). These are,\nno doubt, serious inroads on the right of administration and\nappear perilously near violating that right. But considering\nthat those provisions are applicable to all educational\ninstitutions and that the impugned parts of Cls. 9, 11 and 12\nare designed to give protection and security to the ill paid\nteachers who are engaged in rendering service to the nation\nand protect the backward classes, we are prepared, as at\npresent advised, to treat these clauses 9, 11(2) and 12(4) as\npermissible regulations which the State may impose on the\nminorities as a condition for granting aid to their educational\ninstitutions. We, however, find it impossible to support Cls. 14\nand 15 of the said Bill as mere Regulations. The provisions of\nthose clauses may be totally destructive of the rights under\n<a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_54\">Art. 30(1).</a> It is true that the right to aid is not implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_55\">Art.\n30(1)</a> but the provisions of those clauses, if submitted to on\naccount of their factual compulsion as condition of aid, may\neasily be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_56\">Art. 30(1)</a> of the Constitution. Learned\nCounsel for the State of Kerala recognizes that Cls. 14 and 15\nof the Bill may annihilate the minority communities&#x27; right to\nmanage educational institutions of their choice but submits\nthat the validity of those clauses is not the subject matter of\nquestion 2. But, as already explained, all newly established\nschools seeking aid or recognition are, by Cl. 3(5), made\nsubject to all the provisions of the Act. Therefore, in a\ndiscussion as to the constitutional validity of Cl. 3(5) a\ndiscussion of the validity of the other clauses of the Bill\nbecomes relevant, not as and by way of a separate item but in\ndetermining the validity of the provisions of Cl. 3(5). In our\nopinion, sub­cl. 3 of Cl. 8 and Cls. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 being\nmerely regulatory do not offend <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_57\">Art. 30(1)</a>, but the provisions\nof sub­cl. (5) of cl. 3 by making the aided educational\ninstitutions subject to Cls. 14 and 15 as conditions for the\ngrant of aid do offend against <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_58\">Art. 30(1)</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                       23</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">21.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_59\">Rev.

The entire controversy centres round the extent of the\n         right of the religious and linguistic minorities to administer\n         their educational institutions. The right to administer is said\n         to consist of four principal matters. First is the right to choose\n         its managing or governing body. It is said that the founders of\n         the minority institution have faith and confidence in their own\n         committee or body consisting of persons elected by them.\n         Second is the right to choose its teachers. It is said that\n         minority institutions want teachers to have compatibility with\n         the ideals, aims, and aspirations of the institution. Third is the\n         right not to be compelled to refuse admission to students. In\n         other words, the minority institutions want to have the right to\n         admit students of their choice subject to reasonable\n         regulations about academic qualifications. Fourth is the right\n         to use its properties and assets for the benefit of its own\n         institution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1013076\" id=\"span_38\">20. The right conferred on the religious and linguistic\n         minorities to administer educational institutions of their\n         choice is not an absolute right. This right is not free from\n         regulation. Just as regulatory measures are necessary for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                               25</span>\n\n\nmaintaining the educational character and content of minority\ninstitutions, similarly, regulatory measures are necessary for\nensuring orderly, efficient, and sound administration.

Educational institutions are temples of learning. The\nvirtues of human intelligence are mastered and harmonised by\neducation. Where there is complete harmony between the\nteacher and the taught, where the teacher imparts and the\nstudent receives, where there is complete dedication of the\nteacher and the taught in learning, where there is discipline\nbetween the teacher and the taught, where both are\nworshippers of learning, no discord or challenge will arise. An\neducational institution runs smoothly when the teacher and\nthe taught are engaged in the common ideal of pursuit of\nknowledge. It is, therefore, manifest that the appointment of\nteachers is an important part in educational institutions. The\nqualifications and the character of the teachers are really\nimportant. The minority institutions have the right to\nadminister institutions. This right implies the obligation and\nduty of the minority institutions to render the very best to the\nstudents. In the right of administration, checks, and balances\nin the shape of regulatory measures are required to ensure the\nappointment of good teachers and their conditions of service.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">The right to administer is to be tempered with regulatory\nmeasures to facilitate smooth administration. The best\nadministration will reveal no trace or colour of minority. A\nminority institution should shine in exemplary eclectism in the\nadministration of the institution. The best compliment that\ncan be paid to a minority institution is that it does not rest on\nor proclaim its minority character.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">31. Regulations which will serve the interests of the students,\nregulations which will serve the interests of the teachers are of\nparamount importance in good administration.

In the field of administration it is not reasonable to claim\nthat minority institutions will have complete autonomy.\nChecks on the administration may be necessary in order to\nensure that the administration is efficient and sound and will\nserve the academic needs of the institution. The right of a\nminority to administer its educational institution involves, as\npart of it, a correlative duty of good administration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">90. We may now deal with the scope and ambit of the right\nguaranteed by clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 30.</a> The clause confers a\nright on all minorities, whether they are based on religion or\nlanguage, to establish and administer educational instructions\nof their choice. The right conferred by the clause is in absolute\nterms and is not subject to restrictions, as in the case of rights\nconferred by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. The right of the\nminorities to administer educational institutions does not,\nhowever, prevent the making of reasonable regulations in\nrespect of those institutions. The regulations have necessarily\nto be made in the interest of the institution as a minority\neducational institution. They have to be so designed as to\nmake it an effective vehicle for imparting education. The right\nto administer educational institutions can plainly not include\nthe right to maladminister. Regulations can be made to\nprevent the housing of an educational institution in unhealthy\nsurroundings as also to prevent the setting up or continuation\nof an educational institution without qualified teachers. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_41\">The\nState can prescribe regulations to ensure the excellence of the\ninstitution. Prescription of standards for educational\ninstitutions does not militate against the right of the minority\nto administer the institutions. Regulations made in the true\ninterests of efficiency of instruction, discipline, health,\nsanitation, morality, public order, and the like may\nundoubtedly be imposed. Such regulations are not restrictions\non the substance of the right, which is guaranteed: they\nsecure the proper functioning of the institution, in matters\neducational [see observations of Shah, J. in <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_71\">Rev. Sidhajbhai\nSabhai</a> (supra), [(1963 3 SCR 837] p. 850].</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_42\">Further, as\nobserved by Hidyatullah, C.J. in the case of <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_72\">Very Rev. Mother\nProvincial</a> (supra) [(1971) 1 SCR 734], the standards concern\nthe body politic and are dictated by considerations of the\nadvancement of the country and its people. Therefore, if\nuniversities establish syllabi for examinations, they must be\nfollowed, subject, however, to special subjects which the\ninstitutions may seek to teach, and to a certain extent, the\nState may also regulate the conditions of employment of\nteachers and the health and hygiene of students. Such\nregulations do not bear directly upon management as such,\nalthough they may indirectly affect it. Yet the right of the State\nto regulate education, educational standards, and allied\nmatters cannot be denied. The minority institutions cannot be\nallowed to fall below the standards of excellence expected of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                               27</span>\n\n\neducational institutions, or under the guise of exclusive right\nof management, to decline to follow the general pattern. While\nthe management must be left to them, they may be compelled\nto keep in step with others.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_44\">92.    A    regulation    which     is   designed    to   prevent\nmaladministration of an educational institution cannot be said\nto offend Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 30.</a> At the same time, it has to be\nensured that under the power of making regulations, nothing\nis done as would detract from the character of the institution\nas a minority educational institution or which would impinge\nupon the rights of the minorities to establish and administer\neducational institutions of their choice. The right conferred by\n<a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 30(1)</a> is intended to be real and effective and not a mere\npious and abstract sentiment; it is a promise of reality and not\na teasing illusion. Such a right cannot be allowed to be\nwhittled down by any measure masquerading as a regulation.\nAs observed by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_75\">Rev. Sidhajbhai\nSabhai</a> (supra) [(1963 3 SCR 837], regulations which may\nlawfully be imposed either by legislative or executive action as\na condition of receiving grant or of recognition must be\ndirected to making the institution while retaining its character\nas minority institution effective as an educational institution.</span>\nSuch regulation must satisfy a dual test — the test of\nreasonableness, and the test that it is regulative of the\neducational character of the institution and is conducive to\nmaking the institution an effective vehicle of education for the\nminority community or other persons who resort to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">94. If a request is made for the affiliation or recognition of an\neducational institution, it is implicit in the request that the\neducational institution would abide by the regulations which\nare made by the authority granting affiliation or recognition.\nThe said authority can always prescribe regulations and insist\nthat they should be complied with before it would grant\naffiliation or recognition to an educational institution. To deny\nthe power of making regulations to the authority concerned\nwould result in robbing the concept of affiliation or recognition\nof its real essence. No institution can claim affiliation or\nrecognition until it conforms to a certain standard. The fact\nthat the institution is of the prescribed standard indeed\ninheres in the very concept of affiliation or recognition. It is,\ntherefore, permissible for the authority concerned to prescribe\nregulations which must be complied with before an institution\ncan seek and retain affiliation and recognition. Question then\narises whether there is any limitation on the prescription of\nregulations for minority educational institutions. So far as this\naspect is concerned, the authority prescribing the regulations\nmust bear in mind that the Constitution has guaranteed a\nfundamental right to the minorities for establishing and\nadministering their educational institutions. Regulations made\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                        28</span>\n\n\n         by the authority concerned should not impinge upon that\n         right. Balance has, therefore, to be kept between the two\n         objectives, that of ensuring the standard of excellence of the\n         institution and that of preserving the right of the minorities to\n         establish and administer their educational institutions.\n         Regulations which embrace and reconcile the two objectives\n         can be considered to be reasonable.”\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n     The Court held that it is permissible for the State to prescribe\n\nqualifications for teachers.

Recognition or affiliation is granted on the basis of the\n         excellence of an educational institution, namely, that it has\n         reached the educational standard set up by the university.\n         Recognition or affiliation is sought for the purpose of enabling\n         the students in an educational institution to sit for an\n         examination to be conducted by the university and to obtain a\n         degree conferred by the university. For that purpose, the\n         students should have to be coached in such a manner so as to\n         attain the standard of education prescribed by the university.\n         Recognition or affiliation creates an interest in the university\n         to ensure that the educational institution is maintained for the\n         purpose intended and any regulation which will subserve or\n         advance that purpose will be reasonable and no educational\n         institution established and administered by a religious or\n         linguistic minority can claim recognition or affiliation without\n         submitting to those regulations. That is the price of recognition\n         or affiliation: but this does not mean that it should submit to a\n         regulation stipulating for surrender of a right or freedom\n         guaranteed by the Constitution, which is unrelated to the\n         purpose of recognition or affiliation. In other words,\n         recognition or affiliation is a facility which the university\n         grants to an educational institution, for the purpose of\n         enabling the students there to sit for an examination to be\n         conducted by the university in the prescribed subjects and to\n         obtain the degree conferred by the university, and therefore, it\n         stands to reason to hold that no regulation which is unrelated\n         to the purpose can be imposed. If besides recognition or\n         affiliation, an educational institution conducted by a religious\n         minority is granted aid, further regulations for ensuring that\n         the aid is utilized for the purpose for which it is granted will be\n         permissible. The heart of the matter is that no educational\n         institution established by a religious or linguistic minority can\n         claim total immunity from regulations by the legislature or the\n         university if it wants affiliation or recognition, but the\n         character of the permissible regulations must depend upon\n         their purpose. As we said, such regulations will be permissible\n         if they are relevant to the purpose of securing or promoting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                               29</span>\n\n\nobject of recognition or affiliation. There will be borderline\ncases where it is difficult to decide whether a regulation really\nsubserves the purpose of recognition or affiliation. But that\ndoes not affect the question of principle. In every case, when\nthe reasonableness of a regulation comes up for consideration\nbefore the Court, the question to be asked and answered is\nwhether the regulation is calculated to subserve or will in\neffect subserve the purpose of recognition or affiliation,\nnamely, the excellence of the institution as a vehicle for\ngeneral secular education to the minority community and to\nother persons who resort to it. The question whether a\nregulation is in the general interest of the public has no\nrelevance if it does not advance the excellence of the\ninstitution as a vehicle for general secular education as,\nex­hypothesi, the only permissible regulations are those which\nsecure the effectiveness of the purpose of the facility, namely,\nthe excellence of the educational institutions in respect of their\neducational standards. This is the reason why this Court has\ntime and again said that the question whether a particular\nregulation is calculated to advance the general public interest\nis of no consequence if it is not conducive to the interests of\nthe minority community and those persons who resort to it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">197. On the second question, I have nothing significant to add\nto what has fallen from My Lord the Chief Justice. I am in\nentire agreement with the view that, although, <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_76\">Articles 29</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_77\">30</a> may supplement each other so far as certain rights of\nminorities are concerned, yet, <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 29</a> of the Constitution\ndoes not, in any way, impose a limit on the kind or character\nof education which a minority may choose to impart through\nits Institution to the children of its own members or to those of\nothers who may choose to send their children to its schools. In\nother words, it has a right to impart a general secular\neducation. I would, however, like to point out that, as rights\nand duties are correlative, it follows, from the extent of this\nwider right of a minority under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 30(1)</a> to impart even\ngeneral or non­denominational secular education to those who\nmay not follow its culture or subscribe to its beliefs, that,\nwhen a minority Institution decides to enter this wider\neducational sphere of national education, it, by reason of this\nfree choice itself, could be deemed to opt to adhere to the\nneeds of the general pattern of such education in the country,\nat least whenever that choice is made in accordance with\nstatutory provisions. Its choice to impart an education\nintended to give a secular orientation or character to its\neducation necessarily entails its assent to the imperative needs\nof the choice made by the State about the kind of “secular”\neducation which promotes national integration or the elevating\nobjectives set out in the preamble to our Constitution, and the\nbest way of giving it. If it is part of a minority&#x27;s rights to make\nsuch a choice, it should also be part of its obligations, which\nnecessarily follow from the choice to adhere to the general\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                               30</span>\n\n\npattern. The logical basis of such a choice is that the\nparticular minority Institution, which chooses to impart such\ngeneral secular education, prefers that higher range of freedom\nwhere, according to the poet Rabindranath Tagore, &quot;the narrow\ndomestic walls&quot; which constitute barriers between various\nsections of the nation will crumble and fall. It may refuse to\naccept the choice made by the State of the kind of secular\neducation the State wants or of the way in which it should be\ngiven. But, in that event, should it not be prepared to forego\nthe benefits of recognition by the State? The State is bound to\npermit and protect the choice of the minority Institution,\nwhatever that might be. But, can it be compelled to give it a\ntreatment different from that given to other Institutions\nmaking such a choice?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_48\">221. Evidently, what was meant was that the right to exclusive\nmanagement of the institution is separable from the right to\ndetermine the character of education and its standards. This\nmay explain why &quot;standards&quot; of education were spoken as &quot;not\npart of management&quot; at all. It meant that the right to manage,\nhaving been conferred in absolute terms, could not be\ninterfered with at all although the object of that management\ncould be determined by a general pattern to be <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_80\">laid down by</a>\nthe State, which could prescribe the syllabi and standards of\neducation. Speaking for myself, I find it very difficult to\nseparate the objects and standards of teaching from a right to\ndetermine who should teach and what their qualifications\nshould be. Moreover, if the “standards of education” are not\npart of management, it is difficult to see how they are\nexceptions to the principle of freedom of management from\ncontrol. Again, if what is aimed at directly is to be\ndistinguished from an indirect effect of it, the security of\ntenure of teachers and provisions intended to ensure fair and\nequitable treatment for them by the management of an\ninstitution would also not be directly aimed at interference\nwith its management. They could more properly be viewed as\ndesigned to improve and ensure the excellence of teachers\navailable at the institution, and, therefore, to raise the general\nstandard of education. I think that it is enough for us to\ndistinguish this case on the ground that the provisions to be\ninterpreted by us are different, although, speaking for myself, I\nfeel bound to say, with great respect, that I am unable to\naccept every proposition found stated there as correct. In that\ncase, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/162543282/\" id=\"a_81\">Kerala University Act</a> 9 of 1969,\nconsidered there were inescapable for the minority institutions\nwhich claimed the right to be free from their operation. As I\nhave already observed, in the case before us, Section 38­B of\nthe Act provides the petitioning College before us with a\npractically certain mode of escape from the compulsiveness of\nprovisions other than <a href=\"/doc/31707573/\" id=\"a_82\">Sections 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_83\">40</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_84\">41</a> of the Act if\nclaims made on its behalf are correct.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                        31</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">         232. Even if <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution is held to confer\n         absolute and unfettered rights of management upon minority\n         institutions, subject only to absolutely minimal and negative\n         controls in the interests of health and law and order, it could\n         not be meant to exclude a greater degree of regulation and\n         control when a minority institution enters the wider sphere of\n         general secular and non­denominational education, largely\n         employs teachers who are not members of the particular\n         minority concerned, and when it derives large parts of its\n         income from the fees paid by those who are not members of\n         the particular minority in question. Such greater degree of\n         control could be justified by the need to secure the interests of\n         those who are affected by the management of the minority\n         institution and the education it imparts but who are not\n         members of the minority in management. In other words, the\n         degree of reasonably permissible control must vary from\n         situation to situation. For the reasons already given above, I\n         think that, apart from <a href=\"/doc/31707573/\" id=\"a_86\">Sections 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_87\">40</a> and <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_88\">41</a> of the Act, which\n         directly and unreasonably impinge upon the rights of the\n         petitioning minority managed college, protected by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 30(1)</a>\n         of the Constitution, I do not think that the other provisions\n         have that effect. On the situation under consideration before\n         us, the minority institution affected by the enactment has,\n         upon the claims put forward on its behalf, a means of escape\n         from the impugned provisions other than <a href=\"/doc/31707573/\" id=\"a_90\">Sections 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_91\">40</a> and\n         <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_92\">41</a> of the Act by resorting to <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 38B</a> of the Act.”\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">23.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1993702\" id=\"span_50\">In The Gandhi Faiz­e­am <a href=\"/doc/1993702/\" id=\"a_94\">College, Shahjahanpur v.

It was contended that St. Stephen’s College after being\n         affiliated to the Delhi University has lost its minority\n         character. The argument was based on some of the provisions\n         in the <a href=\"/doc/65439626/\" id=\"a_107\">Delhi University Act</a> and the Ordinances made\n         thereunder. It was said that the students are admitted to the\n         University and not to the College as such. But we find no\n         substance in the contention. In the first place, it may be stated\n         that the State or any instrumentality of the State cannot\n         deprive the character of the institution, founded by a minority\n         community by compulsory affiliation since <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 30(1)</a> is a\n         special right to minorities to establish educational institutions\n         of their choice.

Any such coercive action\n         would be void being contrary to the constitutional guarantee.\n         The right to administer is the right to conduct and manage the\n         affairs of the institution. This right is exercised by a body of\n         persons in whom the founders have faith and confidence.

However, it\n        has been consistently held by the courts that the right to\n        establish an educational institution is not confined to\n        purposes of conservation of language, script or culture.

St. Stephen&#x27;s College at Delhi and\n        Allahabad Agricultural Institute at Naini. The factual context\n        as summed­up in the majority judgment authored by Shetty,\n        J., was as under:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">           “68. It is not in dispute that St. Stephen&#x27;s College and\n           Allahabad Agricultural Institute are receiving grant­in­aid\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">\f                               37</span>\n\n\n  from the government. St. Stephen&#x27;s College gives preference\n  to Christian students. The Allahabad Agricultural Institute\n  reserves 50 per cent of the seats for Christian students. The\n  Christian students admitted by preference or against the\n  quota reserved are having less merit in the qualifying\n  examination than the other candidates. The other\n  candidates with more merit are denied admission on the\n  ground that they are not Christians.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">  69. It was argued for the University and the Students Union\n  that since both the institutions are receiving State aid, the\n  institutional preference for admission based on religion is\n  violative of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 29(2)</a> of the Constitution. The institutions\n  shall not prefer or deny admission to candidates on ground\n  of religion. For institutions, on the other hand, it was\n  claimed that any preference given to the religious minority\n  candidates in their own institutions cannot be a\n  discrimination falling under <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 29(2).</a> The institutions\n  are established for the benefit of their community and if\n  they are prevented from admitting their community\n  candidates, the purpose of establishing the institutions\n  would be defeated. The minorities are entitled to admit their\n  candidates by preference or by reservation. They are also\n  entitled to admit them to the exclusion of all others and\n  that right flows from the right to establish and administer\n  educational institutions guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 30(1)</a>.”\n\n28.1. The majority judgment dealt with the submissions raised\nby the institution as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">   “80. Equally, it would be difficult to accept the\n   second submission that the minorities are entitled to\n   establish and administer educational institutions for their\n   exclusive benefit. The choice of institution provided in\n   <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 30(1)</a> does not mean that the minorities could\n   establish educational institution for the benefit of their own\n   community people. Indeed, they cannot. It was pointed out\n   in Re, Kerala Education Bill that the minorities cannot\n   establish educational institution only for the benefit of their\n   community. If such was the aim, <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 30(1)</a> would have\n   been differently worded and it would have contained the\n   words &quot;for their own community&quot;. In the absence of such\n   words it is legally impermissible to construe the article as\n   conferring      the    right     on      the     minorities to\n   establish educational institution for their own benefit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">  81. Even in practice, such claims are likely to be met with\n  considerable hostility. It may not be conducive to have a\n  relatively homogeneous society. It may lead to religious\n  bigotry which is the bane of mankind. In the nation\n  building with secular character sectarian schools or\n  colleges, segregated faculties or universities for imparting\n  general secular education are undesirable and they may\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                              38</span>\n\n\n  undermine secular democracy. They would be inconsistent\n  with the central concept of secularism and equality\n  embedded in the Constitution. Every educational institution\n  irrespective of community to which it belongs is a &#x27;melting\n  pot&#x27; in our national life. The students and teachers are the\n  critical ingredients. It is there they develop respect for, and\n  tolerance of, the cultures and beliefs of others. It is\n  essential therefore, that there should be proper mix of\n  students of different communities in all educational\n  institutions.”\n\n                                ***\n\n28.3. The majority Judgment, then, considered the matter\nfrom the perspective of &quot;Rights of Minorities and Balancing\nInterest&quot; and observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">  “101. Laws carving out the rights of minorities in\n  <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 30(1)</a> however, must not be arbitrary, invidious or\n  unjustified; they must have a reasonable relation between\n  the aim and the means employed. The individual rights will\n  necessarily have to be balanced with competing minority\n  interests. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_72\">In <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_137\">Sidhajbhai</a> case (1963) 3 SCR 837 the\n  government order directing the minority run college to\n  reserve 80 per cent of seats for government nominees and\n  permitting only 20 per cent of seats for the management\n  with     a    threat   to   withhold       the    grant­in­aid\n  and recognition was struck down by the Court as infringing\n  the fundamental freedom guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 30(1).</a>\n  Attention may also be drawn to <a href=\"/doc/1282987/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 337</a> of the\n  Constitution which provided a special concession to Anglo­\n  Indian community for ten years from the commencement of\n  the Constitution. Unlike <a href=\"/doc/1329698/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 30(2)</a> it conferred a positive\n  right on the Anglo­Indian community to get grants from the\n  government for their educational institutions, but subject\n  to the condition that at least 40 per cent of annual\n  admission were made available to members of other\n  communities.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">  102. In the light of all these principles and factors, and in\n  view of the importance which the Constitution attaches to\n  protective measures to minorities under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 30(1)</a>, the\n  minority aided educational institutions are entitled to prefer\n  their community candidates to maintain the minority\n  character of the institutions subject of course to conformity\n  with the University standard. The State may regulate the\n  intake in this category with due regard to the need of the\n  community in the area which the institution is intended to\n  serve. But in no case such intake shall exceed 50 per cent\n  of the annual admission. The minority institutions shall\n  make available at least 50 per cent of the annual admission\n  to members of communities other than the minority\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                               39</span>\n\n\n   community. The admission of other community candidates\n   shall be done purely on the basis of merit.”\n\n28.4. It was also observed that regulations which serve the\ninterest of students and teachers and preserve the uniformity\nin standards of education amongst the affiliated institutions\ncould validly be made. The relevant discussion in para 59 was\nas under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">   “59. The need for a detailed study on this aspect is indeed\n   not necessary. The right to minorities whether religious or\n   linguistic, to administer educational institutions and the\n   power of the State to regulate academic matters and\n   management is now fairly well settled. The right to\n   administer does not include the right to maladminister. The\n   State being the controlling authority has right and duty\n   to regulate all academic matters. Regulations which will\n   serve the interests of students and teachers, and to\n   preserve the uniformity in standards of education among\n   the affiliated institutions could be made. The minority\n   institutions cannot claim immunity against such general\n   pattern and standard or against general laws such as laws\n   relating to law and order, health, hygiene, labour relations,\n   social welfare legislations, contracts, torts etc. which are\n   applicable to all communities. So long as the basic right of\n   minorities to manage educational institution is not taken\n   away, the State is competent to make regulatory legislation.\n   Regulations, however, shall not have the effect of depriving\n   the right of minorities to educate their children in their own\n   institution. That is a privilege which is implied in the right\n   conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 30(1)</a>.”\n\n28.5.

The questions\n         framed were recast and on 6­2­1997, the Court directed that\n         the matter be placed before a Bench of at least eleven Judges,\n         as it was felt that in view of the Forty­second Amendment to\n         the Constitution, whereby &quot;education&quot; had been included in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                              42</span>\n\n\nEntry 25 of List III of Seventh Schedule, the question of who\nwould be regarded as a &quot;minority&quot; was required to be\nconsidered because the earlier case­law related to the pre­\namendment era, when education was only in the State List.\nWhen the cases came up for hearing before an eleven­Judge\nBench, during the course of hearing on 19­3­1997, the\nfollowing order was passed:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">          “Since a doubt has arisen during the course of our\n          arguments as to whether this Bench would feel\n          itself bound by the ratio propounded in — Kerala\n          Education Bill, 1957, In Re, AIR 1958 SC 956 and\n          Ahmedabad St. Xavier&#x27;s College Society v.

The scheme in Unni Krishnan case, (1993) 1 SCC 645 has\nthe effect of nationalizing education in respect of important\nfeatures viz. the right of a private unaided institution to give\nadmission and to fix the fee. By framing this scheme, which\nhas led to the State Governments legislating in conformity with\nthe scheme, the private institutions are indistinguishable from\nthe government institutions; curtailing all the essential\nfeatures of the right of administration of a private unaided\neducational institution can neither be called fair nor\nreasonable. Even in the decision in Unni Krishnan case it has\nbeen observed by Jeevan Reddy, J., at p. 749, para 194, as\nfollows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">    “194. The hard reality that emerges is that private\n    educational institutions are a necessity in the present­day\n    context. It is not possible to do without them because the\n    governments are in no position to meet the demand —\n    particularly in the sector of medical and technical education\n    which call for substantial outlays. While education is one of\n    the most important functions of the Indian State it has no\n    monopoly therein. Private educational institutions —\n    including minority educational institutions — too have a\n    role to play.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">40. Any system of student selection would be unreasonable if\nit deprives the private unaided institution of the right of\nrational selection, which it devised for itself, subject to the\nminimum qualification that may be prescribed and to some\nsystem of computing the equivalence between different kinds\nof qualifications, like a common entrance test. Such a system\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">\f                               43</span>\n\n\nof selection can involve both written and oral tests for\nselection, based on principle of fairness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">45. In view of the discussion hereinabove, we hold that the\ndecision in Unni Krishnan case, (1993) 1 SCC 645 insofar as it\nframed the scheme relating to the grant of admission and the\nfixing of the fee, was not correct, and to that extent, the said\ndecision and the consequent directions given to UGC, AICTE,\nthe Medical Council of India, the Central and State\nGovernments etc. are overruled.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">50.

With regard to the core components of the rights under\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_160\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/272397/\" id=\"a_161\">26(a)</a>, it must be held that while the State has\nthe right to prescribe qualifications necessary for admission,\nprivate unaided colleges have the right to admit students of\ntheir choice, subject to an objective and rational procedure of\nselection and the compliance with conditions, if any, requiring\nadmission of a small percentage of students belonging to\nweaker sections of the society by granting them freeships or\nscholarships, if not granted by the Government. Furthermore,\nin setting up a reasonable fee structure, the element of\nprofiteering is not as yet accepted in Indian conditions. The fee\nstructure must take into consideration the need to generate\nfunds to be utilized for the betterment and growth of the\neducational institution, the betterment of education in that\ninstitution and to provide facilities necessary for the benefit of\nthe students. In any event, a private institution will have the\nright to constitute its own governing body, for which\nqualifications may be prescribed by the State or the university\nconcerned. It will, however, be objectionable if the State\nretains the power to nominate specific individuals on\ngoverning bodies. Nomination by the State, which could be on\na political basis, will be an inhibiting factor for private\nenterprise to embark upon the occupation of establishing and\nadministering educational institutions. For the same reasons,\nnomination of teachers either directly by the department or\nthrough a service commission will be an unreasonable inroad\nand an unreasonable restriction on the autonomy of the\nprivate unaided educational institution.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                              44</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">68. It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations\nregulating admission to both aided and unaided professional\ninstitutions. It must be borne in mind that unaided\nprofessional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their\nadministration while, at the same time, they do not forego or\ndiscard the principle of merit. It would, therefore, be\npermissible for the university or the Government, at the time\nof granting recognition, to require a private unaided institution\nto provide for merit­based selection while, at the same time,\ngiving the management sufficient discretion in admitting\nstudents. This can be done through various methods. For\ninstance, a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for\nadmission by the management out of those students who have\npassed the common entrance test held by itself or by the\nState/university and have applied to the college concerned for\nadmission, while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the\nbasis of counselling by the State agency. This will incidentally\ntake care of poorer and backward sections of the society. The\nprescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by\nthe Government according to the local needs and different\npercentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non­\nminority unaided and professional colleges. The same\nprinciples may be applied to other non­professional but\nunaided educational institutions viz. graduation and\npostgraduation non­professional colleges or institutes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">71. While giving aid to professional institutions, it would be\npermissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe by rules or\nregulations, the conditions on the basis of which admission\nwill be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit,\ncoupled with the reservation policy of the State. The merit may\nbe determined either through a common entrance test\nconducted by the university or the Government followed by\ncounselling, or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by\nindividual institutions — the method to be followed is for the\nuniversity or the Government to decide. The authority may\nalso devise other means to ensure that admission is granted to\nan aided professional institution on the basis of merit. In the\ncase of such institutions, it will be permissible for the\nGovernment or the university to provide that consideration\nshould be shown to the weaker sections of the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">90. In the exercise of this right to conserve the language,\nscript or culture, that section of the society can set\nup educational institutions.

The said primary schools and college were\nconducted for the benefit of the religious denomination of the\nUnited Church of Northern India and Indian Christians\ngenerally, though admission was not denied to students\nbelonging to other communities. The petitioners challenged the\ngovernment order requiring 80% of the seats to be filled by\nnominees of the Government, inter alia, on the ground that the\npetitioners were members of a religious denomination and that\nthey constituted a religious minority, and that the educational\ninstitutions had been established primarily for the benefit of\nthe Christian community.

If this is so, it is difficult to appreciate how the\nGovernment can be prevented from framing regulations that\nare in the national interest, as it seems to be indicated in\nthe passage quoted hereinabove. Any regulation framed in\nthe national interest must necessarily apply to all\neducational institutions, whether run by the majority or the\nminority.

Analysing that clause it would follow\n      that the right which has been conferred by the clause\n      is on two types of minorities. Those minorities may\n      be based either on religion or on language. The right\n      conferred upon the said minorities is to establish and\n      administer educational institutions of their choice.\n      The word &#x27;establish&#x27; indicates the right to bring into\n      existence, while the right to administer an institution\n      means the right to effectively manage and conduct\n      the affairs of the institution. Administration connotes\n      management of the affairs of the institution. The\n      management must be free of control so that the\n      founders or their nominees can mould the institution\n      as they think fit and in accordance with their ideas of\n      how the interest of the community in general and the\n      institution in particular will be best served.

The idea of giving some special rights to the\n      minorities is not to have a kind of a privileged or\n      pampered section of the population but to give to the\n      minorities a sense of security and a feeling of\n      confidence. The great leaders of India since time\n      immemorial had preached the doctrine of tolerance\n      and catholicity of outlook. Those noble ideas were\n      enshrined in the Constitution.

The same\n       generous, liberal and sympathetic approach should\n       weigh           with        the         courts        in\n       construing <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_196\">Articles 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_197\">30</a> as        marked       the\n       deliberations of the Constitution­makers in drafting\n       those articles and making them part of the\n       fundamental rights. The safeguarding of the interest\n       of the minorities amongst sections of population is as\n       important as the protection of the interest amongst\n       individuals of persons who are below the age of\n       majority or are otherwise suffering from some kind\n       of infirmity. The Constitution and the laws made by\n       civilized        nations,      therefore,      generally\n       contain provisions for the protection of those\n       interests. It can, indeed, be said to be an index of the\n       level of civilization and catholicity of a nation as to\n       how far their minorities feel secure and are\n       not subject to any discrimination or suppression.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">122. The learned Judge then observed that the right of the\nminorities to administer educational institutions did not\nprevent the making of reasonable regulations in respect of\nthese     institutions.   Recognizing    that   the    right to\nadminister educational institutions could not include the\nright to maladminister, it was held that regulations could be\nlawfully     imposed,    for   the    receiving   of    grants\nand recognition, while permitting the institution to retain its\ncharacter as a minority institution. The regulation &quot;must\nsatisfy a dual test — the test of reasonableness, and the test\nthat it is regulative of the educational character of the\ninstitution and is conducive to making the institution an\neffective vehicle of education for the minority community or\nother persons who resort to it&quot;. (SCC p. 783, para 92) It was\npermissible for the authorities to prescribe regulations,\nwhich must be complied with, before a minority institution\ncould seek or retain affiliation and recognition. But it was\nalso stated that the regulations made by the authority\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">\f                           50</span>\n\n\nshould not impinge upon the minority character of the\ninstitution. Therefore, a balance has to be kept between the\ntwo objectives — that of ensuring the standard of excellence\nof the institution, and that of preserving the right of the\nminorities to establish and administer their educational\ninstitutions. Regulations that embraced and reconciled the\ntwo objectives could be considered to be reasonable. This, in\nour view, is the correct approach to the problem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">123. After referring to the earlier cases in relation to the\nappointment of teachers, it was noted by Khanna, J., that\nthe conclusion which followed was that a law which\ninterfered with a minority&#x27;s choice of qualified teachers, or\nits disciplinary control over teachers and other members of\nthe staff of the institution, was void, as it was violative of\n<a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 30(1).</a> While it was permissible for the State and its\neducational authorities to prescribe the qualifications of\nteachers, it was held that once the teachers possessing\nthe requisite qualifications were selected by the minorities\nfor their educational institutions, the State would have no\nright       to veto the selection of     those       teachers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">The selection and appointment of teachers for an\neducational institution was regarded as one of the essential\ningredients under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 30(1).</a> The Court&#x27;s attention was\ndrawn to the fact that in Kerala Education Bill, 1957 case,\n1959 SCR 995, this Court had opined that clauses 11 and\n12 made it obligatory for all aided schools to select teachers\nfrom a panel selected from each district by the Public\nService Commission and that no teacher of an aided school\ncould be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank without the\nprevious sanction of the authorized officer. At SCR p.245,\nKhanna, J., observed that in cases subsequent to the\nopinion in Kerala Education Bill, 1957 case, (1959) SCR 995\nthis Court had held similar provisions as clause 11 and\nclause 12 to be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 30(1)</a> of the minority\ninstitutions.

We agree with the contention of the learned Solicitor­\nGeneral that the Constitution in Part III does not contain or\ngive any absolute right. All rights conferred in Part III of the\nConstitution are subject to at least other provisions of the\nsaid Part. It is difficult to comprehend that the framers of\nthe Constitution would have given such an absolute right to\nthe religious or linguistic minorities, which would enable\nthem to establish and administer educational institutions in\na manner so as to be in conflict with the other Parts of the\nConstitution. We find it difficult to accept that in the\nestablishment      and      administration   of    educational\ninstitutions by the religious and linguistic minorities, no\nlaw of the land, even the Constitution, is to apply to them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">136. Decisions of this Court have held that the right to\nadminister does not include the right to maladminister. It\nhas also been held that the right to administer is not\nabsolute, but must be subject to reasonable regulations for\nthe benefit of the institutions as the vehicle of education,\nconsistent with national interest. General laws of the land\napplicable to all persons have been held to be applicable to\nthe minority institutions also — for example, laws relating\nto taxation, sanitation, social welfare, economic regulation,\npublic order and morality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">137. It follows from the aforesaid decisions that even\nthough the words of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 30(1)</a> are unqualified, this Court\nhas held that at least certain other laws of the land\npertaining to health, morality and standards of education\napply. The right under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 30(1)</a> has, therefore, not been\nheld to be absolute or above other provisions of the law, and\nwe reiterate the same. By the same analogy, there is no\nreason why regulations or conditions concerning, generally,\nthe welfare of students and teachers should not be made\napplicable     in order    to provide a   proper    academic\natmosphere, as such provisions do not in any way interfere\nwith the right of administration or management under\n<a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 30(1).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"703393\" id=\"span_94\">138. As we look at it, <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 30(1)</a> is a sort of guarantee or\nassurance to the linguistic and religious minority\ninstitutions of their right to establish and administer\neducational institutions of their choice. Secularism and\nequality being two of the basic features of the Constitution,\n<a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 30(1)</a> ensures protection to the linguistic and\nreligious minorities, thereby preserving the secularism of\nthe country. Furthermore, the principles of equality must\nnecessarily apply to the enjoyment of such rights. No law\ncan be framed that will discriminate against such minorities\nwith regard to the establishment and administration of\neducational institutions vis­a­vis other educational\ninstitutions. Any law or rule or regulation that would put\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">\f                            52</span>\n\n\nthe educational institutions run by the minorities at a\ndisadvantage when compared to the institutions run by the\nothers will have to be struck down. At the same time, there\nalso cannot be any reverse discrimination. It was observed\nin <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_206\">St. Xavier&#x27;s College</a> case, (1975) 1 SCR 173 at SCR p. 192\nthat: (SCC p. 743, para 9)\n        “The whole object of conferring the right on\n        minorities under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 30</a> is to ensure that there\n        will be equality between the majority and the\n        minority. If the minorities do not have such special\n        protection they will be denied equality.”\nIn other words, the essence of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 30(1)</a> is to ensure\nequal treatment between the majority and the minority\ninstitutions. No one type or category of institution should be\ndisfavoured or, for that matter, receive more favourable\ntreatment     than     another.       Laws    of   the   land,\nincluding rules and regulations, must apply equally to the\nmajority institutions as well as to the minority institutions.</span>\nThe minority institutions must be allowed to do what the\nnon­minority institutions are permitted to do.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">139. Like any other private unaided institutions, similar\nunaided educational institutions administered by linguistic\nor religious minorities are assured maximum autonomy in\nrelation thereto; e.g. method of recruitment of teachers,\ncharging of fees and admission of students. They will have\nto comply with the conditions of recognition, which cannot\nbe such as to whittle down the right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_209\">Article 30.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">144. It cannot be argued that no conditions can be imposed\nwhile giving aid to a minority institution. Whether it is an\ninstitution run by the majority or the minority, all\nconditions that have relevance to the proper utilization of\nthe grant­in­aid by an educational institution can be\nimposed. All that <a href=\"/doc/1329698/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 30(2)</a> states is that on the ground\nthat an institution is under the management of a minority,\nwhether based on religion or language, grant of aid to that\neducational institution cannot be discriminated against, if\nother educational institutions are entitled to receive aid.\nThe conditions for grant or non­grant of aid to educational\ninstitutions have to be uniformly applied, whether it is a\nmajority­run institution or a minority­run institution. As in\nthe case of a majority­run institution, the moment a\nminority institution obtains a grant of aid, <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_211\">Article 28</a> of the\nConstitution comes into play. When an educational\ninstitution is maintained out of State funds, no religious\ninstruction can be provided therein. <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 28(1)</a> does not\nstate that it applies only to educational institutions that are\nnot established or maintained by religious or linguistic\nminorities.     Furthermore,     upon     the receipt of   aid,\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 28(3)</a> would apply to all educational\ninstitutions whether run by the minorities or the non­\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">\f                             53</span>\n\n\nminorities. <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 28(3)</a> is the right of a person studying in\na State­recognized institution or in an educational\ninstitution receiving aid from State funds, not to take part\nin any religious instruction, if imparted by such institution,\nwithout his/her consent (or his/her guardian&#x27;s consent if\nsuch a person is a minor). Just as <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_215\">Articles 28(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_216\">(3)</a>\nbecome applicable the moment any educational institution\ntakes aid, likewise, <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_217\">Article 29(2)</a> would also be attracted and\nbecome applicable to an educational institution maintained\nby the State or receiving aid out of State funds. It was\nstrenuously contended that the right to give admission is\none of the essential ingredients of the right to\nadminister conferred on the religious or linguistic minority,\nand that this right should not be curtailed in any manner.\nIt is difficult to accept this contention. If <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_218\">Articles 28(1)</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_219\">(3)</a> apply to a minority institution that receives aid out of\nState funds, there is nothing in the language of\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 30</a> that        would         make       the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 29(2)</a> inapplicable.          Like       <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 28(1)</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 28(3)</a>,     <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 29(2)</a> refers   to &quot;any    educational\ninstitution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of\nState funds&quot;. A minority institution would fall within the\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 29(2)</a> in the same manner in which\n<a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 28(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_227\">Article 28(3)</a> would be applicable to an\naided minority institution. It is true that one of the rights to\nadminister an educational institution is to grant admission\nto the students. As long as an educational institution,\nwhether belonging to the minority or the majority\ncommunity, does not receive aid, it would, in our opinion,\nbe its right and discretion to grant admission to such\nstudents as it chooses or selects subject to what has been\nclarified before. Out of the various rights that the minority\ninstitution has in the administration of the institution,\n<a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 29(2)</a> curtails the right to grant admission to a\ncertain extent. By virtue of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_229\">Article 29(2)</a>, no citizen can be\ndenied admission by an aided minority institution on the\ngrounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of\nthem. It is no doubt true that <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_230\">Article 29(2)</a> does curtail one\nof the powers of the minority institution, but on receiving\naid, some of the rights that an unaided minority institution\nhas, are also curtailed by <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_231\">Articles 28(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_232\">28(3).</a> A\nminority educational institution            has a       right to\nimpart religious instruction — this right is taken away by\n<a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 28(1)</a>, if that minority institution is maintained\nwholly out of State funds. Similarly on receiving aid out\nof State funds or on being recognized by the State,\nthe absolute right of a minority institution requiring a\nstudent to attend religious instruction is curtailed by\n<a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_234\">Article 28(3).</a> If the curtailment of the right to administer a\nminority institution on receiving aid or being wholly\nmaintained out of State funds as provided by <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_235\">Article 28</a> is\nvalid, there is no reason why <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_236\">Article 29(2)</a> should not be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">\f                            54</span>\n\n\nheld to be applicable. There is nothing in the language of\n<a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_237\">Articles 28(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_238\">(3)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 29(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 30</a> to suggest\nthat, on receiving aid, <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_241\">Articles 28(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_242\">(3)</a> will apply, but\n<a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_243\">Article 29(2)</a> will not. Therefore, the contention that the\ninstitutions covered by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_244\">Article 30</a> are outside the injunction\nof <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 29(2)</a> cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545248\" id=\"span_98\">151. The right of the aided minority institution to preferably\nadmit students of its community, when <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 29(2)</a> was\napplicable, has been clarified by this Court over a decade\nago in <a href=\"/doc/1545248/\" id=\"a_247\">St. Stephen&#x27;s College</a> case, (1992) 1 SCC 558. While\nupholding the procedure for admitting students, this Court\nalso held that aided minority educational institutions were\nentitled to preferably admit their community candidates so\nas to maintain the minority character of the institution, and\nthat the State may regulate the intake in this category with\ndue regard to the area that the institution was intended to\nserve, but that this intake should not be more than 50% in\nany case. Thus, St. Stephen&#x27;s endeavoured to strike a\nbalance between the two articles. Though we accept\nthe ratio of St. Stephen&#x27;s which has held the field for over a\ndecade, we have compelling reservations in accepting the\nrigid percentage stipulated therein. As <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_248\">Article 29</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_249\">Article 30</a> apply not only to institutions of higher education\nbut also to schools, a ceiling of 50% would not be proper. It\nwill be more appropriate that, depending upon the level of\nthe institution, whether it be a primary or secondary or high\nschool or a college, professional or otherwise, and on the\npopulation and educational needs of the area in which the\ninstitution is to be located, the State properly balances the\ninterests of all by providing for such a percentage of\nstudents of the minority community to be admitted, so as to\nadequately serve the interest of the community for which\nthe institution was established.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">152. At the same time, the admissions to aided institutions,\nwhether awarded to minority or non­minority students,\ncannot be at the absolute sweet will and pleasure of the\nmanagement of minority educational institutions. As the\nregulations to promote academic excellence and standards\ndo not encroach upon the guaranteed rights Under\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_250\">Article 30</a>, the aided minority educational institutions can\nbe required to observe inter se merit amongst the eligible\nminority applicants and passage of common entrance test\nby the candidates, where there is one, with regard to\nadmissions in professional and non­professional colleges. If\nthere is no such test, a rational method of assessing\ncomparative merit has to be evolved. As regards the non­\nminority segment, admission may be on the basis of the\ncommon entrance test and counselling by a State agency. In\nthe courses for which such a test and counselling are not in\nvogue, admission can be on the basis of relevant criteria for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">\f                            55</span>\n\n\nthe determination of merit.

However, the terrain of thought as has developed\nthrough successive judicial pronouncements culminating in\nPai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, is that looking at the\nconcept of education, in the backdrop of the constitutional\nprovisions, professional educational institutions constitute a\nclass by themselves as distinguished from educational\ninstitutions imparting non­professional education. It is not\nnecessary for us to go deep into this aspect of the issue posed\nbefore us inasmuch as Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, has\nclarified that merit and excellence assume special significance\nin the context of professional studies. Though merit and\nexcellence are not anathema to non­professional education, yet\nat that level and due to the nature of education which is more\ngeneral, the need for merit and excellence therein is not of the\ndegree as is called for in the context of professional education.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">105. Dealing with unaided minority educational institutions,\nPai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, holds that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_263\">Article 30</a> does\nnot come in the way of the State stepping in for the purpose of\nsecuring transparency and recognition of merit in the matter of\nadmissions. Regulatory measures for ensuring educational\nstandards and maintaining excellence thereof are no anathema\nto the protection conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_264\">Article 30(1).</a> However, a\ndistinction is to be drawn between unaided minority\neducational institution of the level of schools and\nundergraduate colleges on the one side and institutions of\nhigher education, in particular, those imparting professional\neducation, on the other side. In the former, the scope for\nmerit­based selection is practically nil and hence may not call\nfor regulation. But in the case of the latter, transparency and\nmerit have to be unavoidably taken care of and cannot be\ncompromised. There could be regulatory measures for\nensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence\nthereof. (See para 161, answer to Question 4, in Pai\nFoundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481.) The source of this distinction\nbetween two types of educational institutions referred to\nhereinabove is to be found in the principle that right to\nadminister does not include a right to maladminister.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">106. S.B. Sinha, J. has, in his separate opinion in Islamic\nAcademy, (2003) 6 SCC 697, described (in para 199) the\nsituation as a pyramid­like situation and suggested the right of\nminority to be read along with the fundamental duty. Higher\nthe level of education, lesser are the seats and higher weighs\nthe consideration for merit.

Education\n        aimed at imparting professional or technical qualifications\n        stands on a different footing from other educational\n        instruction. Apart from other provisions, <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_265\">Article 19(6)</a> is a clear\n        indicator and so are clauses (h) and (j) of Article 51­A.\n        Education up to the undergraduate level aims at imparting\n        knowledge just to enrich the mind and shape the personality\n        of a student. Graduate­level study is a doorway to admissions\n        in educational institutions imparting professional or technical\n        or other higher education and, therefore, at that level, the\n        considerations akin to those relevant for professional or\n        technical educational institutions step in and become relevant.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_109\">This is in the national interest and strengthening the national\n        wealth,     education   included.

When a minority institution applies to a\n          university to be affiliated, it expresses its choice to participate\n          in the system of general education and courses of instructions\n          prescribed by that university, and it agrees to follow the\n          uniform courses of study.

Undoubtedly, the right to establish and manage the\n         educational institutions is a fundamental right recognised\n         under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_295\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Act. It also cannot be denied that\n         this right is not “absolute” and is subject to limitations i.e.\n         “reasonable restrictions” that can be imposed by law on the\n         exercise of the rights that are conferred under clause (1) of\n         <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 19.</a> Those restrictions, however, have to be reasonable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">         Further, such restrictions should be “in the interest of general\n         public”, which conditions are stipulated in clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_297\">Article\n         19</a>, as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">                “19.

Another significant feature which can be noticed from the\nreading of the aforesaid clause is that the State is empowered\nto make any law relating to the professional or technical\nqualifications necessary for practising any profession or\ncarrying on any occupation or trade or business. Thus, while\nexamining as to whether the impugned provisions of the\nstatute and rules amount to reasonable restrictions and are\nbrought out in the interest of the general public, the exercise\nthat is required to be undertaken is the balancing of\nfundamental right to carry on occupation on the one hand and\nthe restrictions imposed on the other hand. This is what is\nknown as “doctrine of proportionality”. Jurisprudentially,\n“proportionality” can be defined as the set of rules determining\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions for limitation of a\nconstitutionally protected right by a law to be constitutionally\npermissible. According to Aharon Barak (former Chief Justice,\nSupreme Court of Israel), there are four sub­components of\nproportionality which need to be satisfied [Aharon Barak,\nProportionality: Constitutional Rights and Their Limitation\n(Cambridge University Press 2012)], a limitation of a\nconstitutional right will be constitutionally permissible if:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">       (i) it is designated for a proper purpose;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">       (ii) the measures undertaken to effectuate such a\n   limitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of that\n   purpose;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">       (iii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that there\n   are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve that\n   same purpose with a lesser degree of limitation; and finally\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">       (iv) there needs to be a proper relation (“proportionality\n   stricto sensu” or “balancing”) between the importance of\n   achieving the proper purpose and the social importance of\n   preventing the limitation on the constitutional right.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_97\">61. Modern      theory of     constitutional rights draws a\nfundamental     distinction   between the scope of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">\f                               67</span>\n\n\nconstitutional rights, and the extent of its protection. Insofar\nas the scope of constitutional rights is concerned, it marks the\nouter boundaries of the said rights and defines its contents.\nThe extent of its protection prescribes the limitations on the\nexercises of the rights within its scope. In that sense, it defines\nthe justification for limitations that can be imposed on such a\nright.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\">62. It is now almost accepted that there are no absolute\nconstitutional rights and all such rights are related. As per the\nanalysis of Aharon Barak, two key elements in developing the\nmodern constitutional theory of recognising positive\nconstitutional rights along with its limitations are the notions\nof democracy and the rule of law. Thus, the requirement of\nproportional limitations of constitutional rights by a sub­\nconstitutional law i.e. the statute, is derived from an\ninterpretation of the notion of democracy itself. Insofar as the\nIndian Constitution is concerned, democracy is treated as the\nbasic feature of the Constitution and is specifically accorded a\nconstitutional status that is recognised in the Preamble of the\nConstitution itself. It is also unerringly accepted that this\nnotion of democracy includes human rights which is the\ncornerstone of Indian democracy. Once we accept the aforesaid\ntheory (and there cannot be any denial thereof), as a fortiori, it\nhas also to be accepted that democracy is based on a balance\nbetween constitutional rights and the public interests. In fact,\nsuch a provision in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 19</a> itself on the one hand\nguarantees some certain freedoms in clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_299\">Article 19</a>\nand at the same time empowers the State to impose\nreasonable restrictions on those freedoms in public interest.\nThis notion accepts the modern constitutional theory that the\nconstitutional rights are related. This relativity means that a\nconstitutional licence to limit those rights is granted where\nsuch a limitation will be justified to protect public interest or\nthe rights of others. This phenomenon—of both the right and\nits limitation in the Constitution—exemplifies the inherent\ntension between democracy’s two fundamental elements. On\nthe one hand is the right’s element, which constitutes a\nfundamental component of substantive democracy; on the\nother hand is the people element, limiting those very rights\nthrough their representatives. These two constitute a\nfundamental component of the notion of democracy, though\nthis time in its formal aspect. How can this tension be\nresolved? The answer is that this tension is not resolved by\neliminating the “losing” facet from the Constitution. Rather,\nthe tension is resolved by way of a proper balancing of the\ncompeting principles. This is one of the expressions of the\nmulti­faceted nature of democracy. Indeed, the inherent\ntension between democracy’s different facets is a “constructive\ntension”. It enables each facet to develop while harmoniously\ncoexisting with the others. The best way to achieve this\npeaceful coexistence is through balancing between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">\f                               68</span>\n\n\ncompeting interests. Such balancing enables each facet to\ndevelop alongside the other facets, not in their place. This\ntension between the two fundamental aspects—rights on the\none hand and its limitation on the other hand—is to be\nresolved by balancing the two so that they harmoniously\ncoexist with each other. This balancing is to be done keeping\nin mind the relative social values of each competitive aspects\nwhen considered in proper context.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">63. In this direction, the next question that arises is as to\nwhat criteria is to be adopted for a proper balance between the\ntwo facets viz. the rights and limitations imposed upon it by a\nstatute. Here comes the concept of “proportionality”, which is a\nproper criterion. To put it pithily, when a law limits a\nconstitutional right, such a limitation is constitutional if it is\nproportional. The law imposing restrictions will be treated as\nproportional if it is meant to achieve a proper purpose, and if\nthe measures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally\nconnected to the purpose, and such measures are necessary.\nThis essence of doctrine of proportionality is beautifully\ncaptured by Dickson, C.J. of Canada in R. v. Oakes, (1986) 1\nSCR 103 (Can SC) in the following words (at p. 138):\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">   “To establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably\n   justified in a free and democratic society, two central\n   criteria must be satisfied. First, the objective, which the\n   measures, responsible for a limit on a Charter right or\n   freedom are designed to serve, must be “of” sufficient\n   importance to warrant overriding a constitutional protected\n   right or freedom … Second … the party invoking <a href=\"/doc/62932860/\" id=\"a_300\">Section 1</a>\n   must show that the means chosen are reasonable and\n   demonstrably justified. This involves “a form of\n   proportionality test…” Although the nature of the\n   proportionality test will vary depending on the\n   circumstances, in each case courts will be required to\n   balance the interests of society with those of individuals\n   and groups. There are, in my view, three important\n   components of a proportionality test. First, the measures\n   adopted must be … rationally connected to the objective.\n   Second, the means … should impair “as little as possible”\n   the right or freedom in question … Third, there must be a\n   proportionality between the effects of the measures which\n   are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom,\n   and the objective which has been identified as of “sufficient\n   importance”. The more severe the deleterious effects of a\n   measure, the more important the objective must be if the\n   measure is to be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a\n   free and democratic society.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">64. The exercise which, therefore, is to be taken is to find out\nas to whether the limitation of constitutional rights is for a\npurpose that is reasonable and necessary in a democratic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">\f                                      69</span>\n\n\n        society and such an exercise involves the weighing up of\n        competitive values, and ultimately an assessment based on\n        proportionality i.e. balancing of different interests.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185766757\" id=\"span_124\">(d) In <a href=\"/doc/185766757/\" id=\"a_301\">Modern Dental College and Research Centre</a> (supra), the Court,\n\nwhile dealing with reasonable restriction on rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_302\">Article 19</a>\n\nobserved:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">        “65.

While defining as to what constitutes a reasonable\n        restriction, this Court in a plethora of judgments has held that\n        the expression “reasonable restriction” seeks to strike a\n        balance between the freedom guaranteed by any of the sub­\n        clauses of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_304\">Article 19</a> and the social control\n        permitted by any of the clauses (2) to (6).

Further, in order to be reasonable, the\n        restriction must have a reasonable relation to the object which\n        the legislation seeks to achieve, and must not go in excess of\n        that object (see P.P.

No doubt, we have entered into an era of liberalisation of\n        the economy, famously termed as “globalisation” as well. In\n        such an economy, private players are undoubtedly given much\n        more freedom in economic activities, as the recognition has\n        drawn to the realities that the economic activities, including\n        profession, business, occupation, etc. are not normal forte of\n        the State and the State should have minimal role therein. It is\n        for this reason, many sectors which were hitherto State\n        monopolies, like telecom, power, insurance, civil aviation, etc.\n        have now opened up for private enterprise. Even in the field of\n        education the State/Government was playing a dominant role\n        inasmuch as it was thought desirable that in a welfare State it\n        is the fundamental duty, as a component of directive\n        principles, to impart education to the masses and commoners\n        as well as weaker sections of the society, at affordable rates. It\n        was almost treated as solemn duty of the Government to\n        establish adequate number of educational institutions at all\n        levels i.e. from primary level to higher education and in all\n        fields including technical, scientific and professional, to cater\n        to the varied sections of the society, particularly, when one­\n        third of the population of the country is poverty­stricken with\n        large percentage as illiterate. With liberalisation, the\n        Government has encouraged establishments of privately\n        managed institutions. It is done with the hope that the private\n        sector will play vital role in the field of education with\n        philanthropic approach/ideals in mind as this activity is not to\n        be taken for the purpose of profiteering, but more as a societal\n        welfare.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">        86. It is, therefore, to be borne in mind that the occupation of\n        education cannot be treated on a par with other economic\n        activities. In this field, the State cannot remain a mute\n        spectator and has to necessarily step in in order to prevent\n        exploitation, privatisation and commercialisation by the\n        private sector. It would be pertinent to mention that even in\n        respect of those economic activities which are undertaken by\n        the private sector essentially with the objective of profit­\n        making (and there is nothing bad about it), while throwing\n        open such kind of business activities in the hands of private\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">\f                                        71</span>\n\n\n        sector, the State has introduced regulatory regime as well by\n        providing regulations under the relevant statutes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">        89. With the advent of globalisation and liberalisation, though\n        the market economy is restored, at the same time, it is also felt\n        that market economies should not exist in pure form. Some\n        regulation of the various industries is required rather than\n        allowing self­regulation by market forces. This intervention\n        through regulatory bodies, particularly in pricing, is\n        considered necessary for the welfare of the society and the\n        economists point out that such regulatory economy does not\n        rob the character of a market economy which still remains a\n        market economy. Justification for regulatory bodies even in\n        such industries managed by private sector lies in the welfare of\n        people. Regulatory measures are felt necessary to promote\n        basic well being for individuals in need. It is because of this\n        reason that we find regulatory bodies in all vital industries\n        like, insurance, electricity and power, telecommunications, etc.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">        90. Thus, it is felt that in any welfare economy, even for\n        private industries, there is a need for regulatory body and\n        such a regulatory framework for education sector becomes all\n        the more necessary. It would be more so when, unlike other\n        industries, commercialisation of education is not permitted as\n        mandated by the Constitution of India, backed by various\n        judgments of this Court to the effect that profiteering in the\n        education is to be avoided.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">(f) The Court held that the regulatory mechanism for centralised\n\nexamination is legal and constitutional and does not infringe on the\n\nfundamental rights of the minority or non­minority to establish and\n\nadminister educational institutions.

It would be pertinent to mention that even in\n         respect of those economic activities which are undertaken by\n         the private sector essentially with the objective of profit­\n         making (and there is nothing bad about it), while throwing\n         open such kind of business activities in the hands of private\n         sector, the State has introduced regulatory regime as well by\n         providing regulations under the relevant statutes.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">\f                               73</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">96. As is evident from the facts mentioned by the State of\nMadhya Pradesh in its reply filed in IA No. 83 of 2015, the\nAssociation of Private Colleges has failed to hold their CETs in\na fair, transparent and rational manner. The accountability\nand transparency in State actions is much higher than in\nprivate actions. It is needless to say that the incidents of\ncorruption in the State machinery were brought in the public\neye immediately and have been addressed expeditiously. The\nsame could never have been done in case of private actions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">Even on a keel of comparative efficiency, it is more than\nevident that the State process is far more transparent and fair\nthan one that is devised by the private colleges which have no\nmechanism of any checks and balances. The State agencies\nare subject to the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_308\">Right to Information Act</a>, audit, State\nLegislature, anti­corruption agencies, Lokayukta, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">172. Maintenance and improvement of public health and to\nprovide health care and medical services is the constitutional\nobligation of the State. To discharge this constitutional\nobligation, the State must have the doctors with professional\nexcellence and commitment who are ready to give medical\nadvice and services to the public at large. The State can\nsatisfactorily discharge its constitutional obligation only when\nthe aspiring students enter into the profession based on merit.\nNone of these lofty ideals can be achieved without having good\nand committed medical professionals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">190. For the foregoing discussion, I hold that the State has the\nlegislative competence to enact the impugned legislation—the\n2007 Act to hold common entrance test for admission to\nprofessional educational institutions and to determine the fee\nand the High Court has rightly upheld the validity of the\nimpugned legislation. Regulations sought to be imposed by the\nimpugned legislation on admission by common entrance test\nconducted by the State and determination of fee are in\ncompliance of the directions and observations in T.M.A. Pai,\n(2002) 8 SCC 481, Islamic Academy of Education, (2003) 6 SCC\n697 and P.A. Inamdar, (2005) 6 SCC 537. Regulations on\nadmission process are necessary in the larger public interest\nand welfare of the student community to ensure fairness and\ntransparency in the admission and to promote merit and\nexcellence. Regulation on fixation of fee is to protect the rights\nof the students in having access to higher education without\nbeing subjected to exploitation in the form of profiteering. With\nthe above reasonings, I concur with the majority view in\nupholding the validity of the impugned legislation and affirm\nthe well­merited decision of the High Court.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">\f                                       74</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_131\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185766757\" id=\"span_132\">(h)   The Court in <a href=\"/doc/185766757/\" id=\"a_309\">Modern Dental College and Research Centre</a> (supra)\n\nwhile considering the decision in <a href=\"/doc/665015/\" id=\"a_310\">T.M.A. Pai Foundation</a> (supra) opined\n\nthat Court did not give complete freedom to admit the students and\n\nalso as to fixation of fee.

This Court\n\nobserved thus:</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">         “34. In the modern age, therefore, particularly after the policy\n         of liberalisation adopted by the State, educational institutions\n         by private bodies are allowed to be established. There is a\n         paradigm shift over from the era of complete government\n         control over education (like other economic and commercial\n         activities) to a situation where private players are allowed to\n         mushroom. But at the same time, regulatory mechanism is\n         provided thereby ensuring that such private institutions work\n         within such regulatory regime. When it comes to education, it\n         is expected that unaided private institutions provide quality\n         education and at the same time they are given “freedom in\n         joints” with minimal Government interference, except what\n         comes under regulatory regime. Though education is now\n         treated as an “occupation” and, thus, has become a\n         fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_311\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the\n         Constitution, at the same time shackles are put insofar as this\n         particular occupation is concerned which is termed as “noble”.\n         Therefore, profiteering and commercialisation are not\n         permitted and no capitation fee can be charged. The admission\n         of students has to be on merit and not at the whims and\n         fancies of the educational institutions. Merit can be tested by\n         adopting some methodology and few such methods are\n         suggested in T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, which\n         includes holding of CET. It is to be ensured that this\n         admission process meets the triple test of transparency,\n         fairness and non­exploitativeness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">         37. Insofar as the first part of the question is concerned, it\n         does not pose any problem and the answer goes in favour of\n         the appellants. We may recapitulate here that <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_312\">Article 26</a> of the\n         Constitution gives freedom to every religious denomination or\n         any section thereof by conferring certain rights which include\n         right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and\n         charitable purposes. Thus, insofar as religious denominations\n         or any section thereof are concerned, they were given right to\n         establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable\n         purposes making it a fundamental right. Likewise, <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_313\">Article 30</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">\f                                75</span>\n\n\nconfers upon minorities fundamental right to establish and\nadminister educational institutions. Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_314\">Article 26</a> is\nconcerned, it comes under the caption “Right to Freedom of\nReligion”. As far as <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_315\">Article 30</a> is concerned, it is under the\nheading “Cultural and Educational Rights”. Thus, rights of the\nminorities to establish and administer educational institutions\nwere always recognised as fundamental rights. Further, the\nright of private unaided professional institutions to establish\nand manage educational institutions was not clearly\nrecognised as a fundamental right covered under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_316\">Article 19(1)</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"212098\" id=\"span_134\">(g) and categorically rejected by the Constitution Bench of this\nCourt comprising of five Judges in Unni Krishnan, (1993) 1\nSCC 645. It was held in para 198 of the judgment that: (SCC\np. 752)\n    “198. [w]e are, therefore, of the opinion, adopting the line of\n    reasoning in <a href=\"/doc/212098/\" id=\"a_317\">State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala</a>,\n    AIR 1957 SC 699, that imparting education cannot be\n    treated as a trade or business. Education cannot be allowed\n    to be converted into commerce nor can petitioners seek to\n    obtain the said result by relying upon the wider meaning of\n    “occupation”.”</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">38. In Unni Krishnan case, (1993) 1 SCC 645, this Court also\nrejected the argument that the said activity could be classified\nas a “profession”. However, the right of professional\ninstitutions to establish and manage educational institutions\nwas finally regarded as an “occupation” befitting the\nrecognition of this right as a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_318\">Article\n19(1)(g)</a> in T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, in the\nfollowing words: (SCC p. 535, para 25)\n    “25. The establishment and running of an educational\n    institution where a large number of persons are employed\n    as teachers or administrative staff, and an activity is carried\n    on that results in the imparting of knowledge to the\n    students, must necessarily be regarded as an occupation,\n    even if there is no element of profit generation. It is difficult\n    to comprehend that education, per se, will not fall under\n    any of the four expressions in <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> “Occupation”\n    would be an activity of a person undertaken as a means of\n    livelihood or a mission in life. The abovequoted observations\n    in Sodan Singh case, (1989) 4 SCC 155, correctly interpret\n    the expression “occupation” in <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_320\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">40. It becomes necessary to point out that while treating the\nmanaging of educational institution as an “occupation”, the\nCourt was categorical that this activity could not be treated as\n“business” or “profession”. This right to carry on the\noccupation that education is, the same is not put on a par\nwith other occupations or business activities or even other\nprofessions. It is a category apart which was carved out by this\nCourt in T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481. There was a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">\f                                       76</span>\n\n\n         specific purpose for not doing so. Education is treated as a\n         noble “occupation” on “no profit no loss” basis. Thus, those who\n         establish and are managing the educational institutions are\n         not expected to indulge in profiteering or commercialising this\n         noble activity. Keeping this objective in mind, the Court did\n         not give complete freedom to the educational institutions in\n         respect of right to admit the students and also with regard to\n         fixation of fee. As far as admission of students is concerned,\n         the Court was categorical that such admissions have to be on\n         the basis of merit when it comes to higher education,\n         particularly in professional institutions.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_136\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185766757\" id=\"span_137\">(i)   In <a href=\"/doc/185766757/\" id=\"a_321\">Modern Dental College and Research Centre</a> (supra), the Court\n\nconsidered decision in <a href=\"/doc/665015/\" id=\"a_322\">T.M.A. Pai Foundation</a> (supra), and observed\n\nthat Government is permitted to frame regulations for unaided private\n\nprofessional educational institutions, thus:</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_138\">“42. In order to see that merit is adjudged suitably and\n         appropriately, the Court candidly laid down that the procedure\n         for admission should be so devised which satisfies the triple\n         test of being fair, transparent and non­exploitative. The next\n         question was as to how the aforesaid objective could be\n         achieved? For determining such merit, the Court showed the\n         path in para 59 by observing that such merit should be\n         determined either by the marks that students obtained at\n         qualifying examination or at CET conducted by the institutions\n         or in the case of professional colleges, by government agencies.\n         Para 59 suggesting these modes reads as under: (<a href=\"/doc/665015/\" id=\"a_323\">T.M.A. Pai\n         Foundation</a> case, (2002) 8 SCC 481, SCC p. 546)\n             “59. Merit is usually determined, for admission to\n             professional and higher education colleges, by either the\n             marks that the student obtains at the qualifying\n             examination or school leaving certificate stage followed by\n             the interview, or by a common entrance test conducted by\n             the institution, or in the case of professional colleges, by\n             government agencies.”\n\n         This paragraph very specifically authorises CET to be\n         conducted by government agencies in the case of professional\n         colleges.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">         43. In order to ensure that the said CET is fair, transparent\n         and merit­based, T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481,\n         also permitted the Government to frame regulations for\n         unaided private professional educational institutions. Paras 67\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                              77</span>\n\n\nand 68 which permit framing of such regulations are\nreproduced below: (SCC p. 549)\n   “67. We now come to the regulations that can be framed\n   relating to private unaided professional institutions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">   68. It would be unfair to apply the same rules and\n   regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided\n   professional institutions. It must be borne in mind that\n   unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy\n   in their administration while, at the same time, they do not\n   forego or discard the principle of merit. It would, therefore,\n   be permissible for the university or the Government, at the\n   time of granting recognition, to require a private unaided\n   institution to provide for merit­based selection while, at the\n   same time, giving the management sufficient discretion in\n   admitting students. This can be done through various\n   methods. For instance, a certain percentage of the seats can\n   be reserved for admission by the management out of those\n   students who have passed the common entrance test held\n   by itself or by the State/university and have applied to the\n   college concerned for admission, while the rest of the seats\n   may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the State\n   agency. This will incidentally take care of poorer and\n   backward sections of the society. The prescription of\n   percentage for this purpose has to be done by the\n   Government according to the local needs and different\n   percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non­\n   minority unaided and professional colleges. The same\n   principles may be applied to other non­professional but\n   unaided educational institutions viz. graduation and\n   postgraduation non­professional colleges or institutes.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">44. A plea was raised by the appellants that by exercising the\npower to frame regulations, the State could not usurp the very\nfunction of conducting this admission test by the educational\ninstitutions. It was argued that it only meant that such a CET\nis to be conducted by the educational institutions themselves\nand the Government could only frame the regulations to\nregulate such admission tests to be conducted by the\neducational institutions and could not take away the function\nof holding CET.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">45. This argument has to be rejected in view of the\nunambiguous and categorical interpretation given by the\nSupreme Court in P.A. Inamdar, (2005) 6 SCC 537, with\nrespect to certain observations, particularly in para 68 in\nT.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481. In this behalf, we\nwould like to recapitulate that in T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002)\n8 SCC 481, a Bench of eleven Judges dealt with the issues of\nscope of right to set up educational institutions by private\naided or unaided, minority or non­minority institutions and\nthe extent of government regulation of the said right. It was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">\f                               78</span>\n\n\nheld that the right to establish and administer an institution\nincluded the right to admit students and to set up a\nreasonable fee structure. But the said right could be regulated\nto ensure maintenance of proper academic standards,\natmosphere and infrastructure. Fixing of rigid fee structure,\ndictating the formation and composition of a governing body,\ncompulsory nomination of teachers and staff for appointment\nor nominating students for admissions would be unacceptable\nrestrictions. However, occupation of education was not\nbusiness but profession involving charitable activity. The State\ncan forbid charging of capitation fee and profiteering. The\nobject of setting up educational institution is not to make\nprofit. There could, however, be a reasonable revenue surplus\nfor development of education. For admission, merit must play\nan important role. The State or the University could require\nprivate unaided institution to provide for merit­based selection\nwhile giving sufficient discretion in admitting students. Certain\npercentage of seats could be reserved for admission by\nmanagement out of students who have passed CET held by the\ninstitution or by the State/University. Interpretation of certain\nobservations in para 68 of the judgment in T.M.A. Pai\nFoundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, has been a matter of debate to\nwhich we will advert to in detail hereinafter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">48. The matter was then considered by a larger Bench of seven\nJudges in P.A. Inamdar, (2005) 6 SCC 537. It was held that the\ntwo committees for monitoring admission procedure and\ndetermining fee structure as per the judgment in Islamic\nAcademy of Education, (2003) 6 SCC 697, were permissible as\nregulatory measures aimed at protecting the student\ncommunity as a whole as also the minority themselves in\nmaintaining required standards of professional education on\nnon­exploitative terms. This did not violate <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_324\">Article 30(1)</a> or\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> It was observed that: (P.A. Inamdar case,\n(2005) 6 SCC 537, SCC p. 607, para 145)\n   “145. … Unless the admission procedure and fixation of fees\n   is regulated and controlled at the initial stage, the evil of\n   unfair practice of granting admission on available seats\n   guided by the paying capacity of the candidates would be\n   impossible to curb.”\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\nOn this ground, suggestion of the institutions to achieve the\npurpose for which committees had been set up by post­audit\nchecks after the institutions adopted their own admission\nprocedure and fee structure was rejected. The committees\nwere, thus, allowed to continue for regulating the admissions\nand the fee structure until a suitable legislation or regulations\nwere framed by the States. It was left to the Central\nGovernment and the State Governments to come out with a\ndetailed well­thought out legislation setting up a suitable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">\f                                       79</span>\n\n\n         mechanism for regulating admission procedure and fee\n         structure. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_142\">Para 68 in <a href=\"/doc/665015/\" id=\"a_326\">T.M.A. Pai Foundation</a> case, (2002) 8 SCC\n         481, was explained by stating that observations permitting the\n         management to reserve certain seats were meant for poorer\n         and backward sections as per local needs. It did not mean to\n         ignore the merit. It was also held that CET could be held,\n         otherwise, merit becomes a casualty. There is, thus, no bar to\n         CET being held by a State agency when the law so provides.”</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">(j) The Court held that entrance examination is a regulatory measure\n\nand does not infringe on the rights of the institutions. It opined:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">         “49. Thus, the contention raised on behalf of the appellants\n         that the private medical colleges had absolute right to make\n         admissions or to fix fee is not consistent with the earlier\n         decisions of this Court. Neither merit could be compromised in\n         admissions to professional institutions nor capitation fee could\n         be permitted. To achieve these objects it is open to the State to\n         introduce regulatory measures. We are unable to accept the\n         submission that the State could intervene only after proving\n         that merit was compromised or capitation fee was being\n         charged. As observed in the earlier decisions of this Court,\n         post­audit measures would not meet the regulatory\n         requirements. Control was required at the initial stage itself.\n         Therefore, our answer to the first question is that though\n         “occupation” is a fundamental right, which gives right to the\n         educational institutions to admit the students and also fix the\n         fee, at the same time, scope of such rights has been discussed\n         and limitations imposed thereupon by the aforesaid judgments\n         themselves explaining the nature of limitations on these rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_143\">55. It would be necessary to clarify the position in respect of\n         educational institutions run by minorities. Having regard to\n         the pronouncement in T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC\n         481, with lucid clarifications to <a href=\"/doc/665015/\" id=\"a_327\">the said judgment</a> given by this\n         Court in P.A. Inamdar, (2005) 6 SCC 537, it becomes clear that\n         insofar as such regulatory measures are concerned, the same\n         can be adopted by the State in respect of minority­run\n         institutions as well.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1545248\" id=\"span_144\">Reliance placed by the appellants in St.\n         Stephen’s <a href=\"/doc/1545248/\" id=\"a_328\">College v.

Undoubtedly, right to establish and administer\n         educational institutions is treated as a fundamental right as it\n         is termed “occupation”, which is one of the freedoms\n         guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> It was so recognised for the\n         first time in T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481. Even\n         while doing so, this right came with certain clutches and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">\f                                      80</span>\n\n\n        shackles. The Court made it clear that it is a noble occupation\n        which would not permit commercialisation or profiteering and,\n        therefore, such educational institutions are to be run on “no\n        profit no loss basis”. While explaining the scope of this right,\n        right to admit students and right to fix fee was accepted as\n        facets of this right, the Court again added caution thereto by\n        mandating that admissions to the educational institutions\n        imparting higher education, and in particular professional\n        education, have to admit the students based on merit. For\n        judging the merit, the Court indicated that there can be a CET.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">        While doing so, it also specifically stated that in case of\n        admission to professional courses such a CET can be\n        conducted by the State. If such a power is exercised by the\n        State assuming the function of CET, this was so recognised in\n        T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481 itself, as a measure of\n        “reasonable restriction on the said right”. Islamic Academy of\n        Education, (2003) 6 SCC 697, further clarified the contour of\n        such function of the State while interpreting T.M.A. Pai\n        Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC 481, itself wherein it was held that\n        there can be committees constituted to supervise conducting\n        of such CET. This process of interpretative balancing and\n        constitutional balancing was remarkably achieved in P.A.\n        Inamdar, (2005) 6 SCC 537, by not only giving its premature to\n        deholding (sic imprimatur to the holding) of CET but it went\n        further to hold that agency conducting the CET must be the\n        one which enjoys the utmost credibility and expertise in the\n        matter to achieve fulfilment of twin objectives of transparency\n        and merit and for that purpose it permitted the State to\n        provide a procedure of holding a CET in the interest of\n        securing fair and merit­based admissions and preventing\n        maladministration.”\n\n\n\n     This Court also considered the balancing of rights even if there is\n\na violation of fundamental rights of the appellants to admit students\n\nby Central Examination Test by State. It held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">        “92. In this sense, when imparting of quality education to\n        cross­section of the society, particularly, the weaker section\n        and when such private educational institutions are to rub\n        shoulders with the State managed educational institution to\n        meet the challenge of the implementing ambitious\n        constitutional promises, the matter is to be examined in a\n        different hue. It is this spirit which we have kept in mind while\n        balancing the right of these educational institutions given to\n        them under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> on the one hand and\n        reasonableness of the restrictions which have been imposed by\n        the impugned legislation. The right to admission or right to fix\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">\f                                       81</span>\n\n\n         the fee guaranteed to these appellants is not taken away\n         completely, as feared. T.M.A. Pai Foundation, (2002) 8 SCC\n         481, gives autonomy to such institutions which remains\n         intact. Holding of CET under the control of the State does not\n         impinge on this autonomy. Admission is still in the hands of\n         these institutions. Once it is even conceded by the appellants\n         that in admission of students “triple test” is to be met, the\n         impugned legislation aims at that. After all, the sole purpose of\n         holding CET is to adjudge merit and to ensure that admissions\n         which are done by the educational institutions, are strictly on\n         merit. This is again to ensure larger public interest. It is\n         beyond comprehension that merely by assuming the power to\n         hold CET, fundamental right of the appellants to admit the\n         students is taken away. Likewise, when it comes to fixation of\n         fee, as already dealt with in detail, the main purpose is that\n         the State acts as a regulator and satisfies itself that the fee\n         which is proposed by the educational institution does not have\n         the element of profiteering and also that no capitation fee, etc.\n         is charged. In fact, this dual function of regulatory nature is\n         going to advance the public interest inasmuch as those\n         students who are otherwise meritorious but are not in a\n         position to meet unreasonable demands of capitation fee, etc.\n         are not deprived of getting admissions. The impugned\n         provisions, therefore, are aimed at seeking laudable objectives\n         in larger public interest. Law is not static, it has to change\n         with changing times and changing social/societal conditions.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">(k)   The Court held that <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_331\">MCI Act</a> and the rules prescribed reasonable\n\nrestrictions under <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_332\">Article 19(6)</a>, thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185766757\" id=\"span_147\">“53.

The Constitution Bench came to the\nconclusion that <a href=\"/doc/180474146/\" id=\"a_374\">Regulation 27</a> could not have any application\nat the highest level of superspeciality as this would defeat the\nvery object of imparting the best possible training to selected\nmeritorious candidates, who could contribute to the\nadvancement of knowledge in the field of medical research and\nits applications.

It\nwas also observed that at the same time such a price would\nhave to be paid if the constitutional promise of social justice\nwas to be redeemed. However, after making such suggestions,\na note of caution was introduced in the very next paragraph in\nthe light of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_375\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution. A distinction was,\nhowever, made with regard to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_376\">Article 16</a> and\nit was held that <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_377\">Article 335</a> would be relevant and it would not\nbe permissible not to prescribe any minimum standard at all.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"842859\" id=\"span_170\">Of course, the said observation was made in the context of\nadmission to medical colleges and reference was also made to\nthe decision in <a href=\"/doc/842859/\" id=\"a_378\">State of M.P. v. Nivedita Jain</a>, (1981) 4 SCC\n296, where admission to medical courses was regulated by an\nentrance test.

In the very next paragraph, the nine­\nJudge Bench while discussing the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_379\">Article 335</a>\nalso observed that there were certain services and posts where\neither on account of the nature of duties attached to them or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">\f                                       91</span>\n\n\n         the level in the hierarchy at which they stood, merit alone\n         counts.

The\n\nGovernment cannot be prevented from framing regulations that are in\n\nthe national interest.

Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any\n      system of limited Government, is protected in part under our\n      Constitution by explicit constitutional guarantees. In the\n      application of the Constitution our contemplation cannot only be\n      of what has been but what may be. Time works changes and\n      brings into existence new conditions. Subtler and far reaching\n      means of invading privacy will make it possible to be heard in the\n      street what is whispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition of\n      privacy raises serious questions about the propriety of judicial\n      reliance on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of\n      course, privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore\n      relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most\n      serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious\n      problems of defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy\n      interest in autonomy must also be placed in the context of other\n      rights and values.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">      24.

Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as\n       unifying principle underlying the concept has been the assertion\n       that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the\n       concept of ordered liberty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">       25. Rights and freedoms of citizens are set forth in the\n       Constitution in order to guarantee that the individual, his\n       personality, and those things stamped with his personality shall\n       be free from official interference except where a reasonable basis\n       for intrusion exists. “Liberty against Government” a phrase coined\n       by Professor Corwin expresses this idea forcefully.

Thus, it is apparent that the provisions in question which have\n\nbeen incorporated in the Act relating to Medical/Dental education, the\n\nGovernment, MCI and DCI cannot be said to be an invasion of the\n\nfundamental rights.     The intendment is to ensure fairness in the\n\nselection, recognition of merit, and the interests of the students. In the\n\nnational interest, educational institutions are basically for a charitable\n\npurpose.   By and large, at present education is devoid of its real\n\ncharacter of charity, it has become a commodity. To weed out evils\n\nfrom the system, which were eating away fairness in admission\n\nprocess, defeating merit and aspiration of the common incumbent\n\nwith no means, the State has the right to frame regulatory regime for\n\naided/ unaided minority/ private institutions as mandated by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">\f                                    104</span>\n\n\nDirectives Principles, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_416\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_417\">21</a> of the Constitution. The first\n\nstep has been taken to weed out the evils from the system, and it\n\nwould not be in the national interest to step back considering the\n\noverall scenario. If we revert to the old system, posterity is not going\n\nto forgive us. Still, complaints are galore that merit is being ignored\n\nby private institutions; there is still a flood of litigation. It seems that\n\nunfettered by a large number of regulatory measures, unscrupulous\n\nmethods and malpractices are yet being adopted. Building the nation\n\nis the main aspect of education, which could not be ignored and\n\noverlooked.   They have to cater to national interest first, then their\n\ninterest, more so, when such conditions can be prescribed for\n\nrecognition, particularly in the matter of professional education.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">56.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545248\" id=\"span_204\">In <a href=\"/doc/1545248/\" id=\"a_418\">St. Stephen&#x27;s College v.

The learned counsel argued that it is open to some of the\n\ninstitutions to impose higher standards of merit. Firstly, conditions of\n\naffiliation are binding apart from that, we find that when it comes to\n\nnational standards and the objects sought to be achieved by NEET, to\n\nconduct individual examinations by some institutions cannot be\n\npermitted. The system is not yet out of clutches of unscrupulous\n\ndevices and dubious means are adopted to defeat merit, the interest of\n\neducation would further suffer and very purpose of centralised\n\nexamination would be defeated. It is not possible to prescribe further\n\nexamination over and above NEET that cannot be said to be workable,\n\nno exemption can be granted from NEET, considering the objective\n\nwith which it has been introduced. We find that the uniform Entrance\n\nExamination cannot be said to be unreasonable regulatory framework.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">Considering the terms and conditions for affiliation and recognition for\n\nprofessional medical and such other professional courses are binding,\n\nand no relaxation can be permitted in the conditions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_164\">58.

The same is intended to check several maladies which\n\ncrept into medical education, to prevent capitation fee by admitting\n\nstudents which are lower in merit and to prevent exploitation,\n\nprofiteering, and commercialisation of education. The institution has\n\nto be a capable vehicle of education.      The minority institutions are\n\nequally bound to comply with the conditions imposed under the\n\nrelevant Acts and Regulations to enjoy affiliation and recognition,\n\nwhich apply to all institutions. In case they have to impart education,\n\nthey are bound to comply with the conditions which are equally\n\napplicable to all.    The regulations are necessary, and they are not\n\ndivisive   or   disintegrative.   Such    regulatory   measures     enable\n\ninstitutions to administer them efficiently. There is no right given to\n\nmaladminister the education derogatory to the national interest. The\n\nquality of medical education is imperative to sub­serve the national\n\ninterest, and the merit cannot be compromised. The Government has\n\nthe right for providing regulatory measures that are in the national\n\ninterest, more so in view of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_425\">Article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">\f                                  107</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">59.   The rights of the religious or linguistic minorities under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_426\">Article\n\n30</a> are not in conflict with other parts of the Constitution. Balancing\n\nthe rights is constitutional intendment in the national and more\n\nenormous public interest. Regulatory measures cannot be said to be\n\nexceeding the concept of limited governance. The regulatory measures\n\nin question are for the improvement of the public health and is a step,\n\nin furtherance of the directive principles enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_427\">Articles 47</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/854952/\" id=\"a_428\">51(A)(j)</a> and enable the individual by providing full opportunity in\n\npursuance of his objective to excel in his pursuit.      The rights to\n\nadminister an institution under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_429\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution are not\n\nabove the law and other Constitutional provisions.          Reasonable\n\nregulatory measures can be provided without violating such rights\n\navailable under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_430\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution to administer an\n\ninstitution.
