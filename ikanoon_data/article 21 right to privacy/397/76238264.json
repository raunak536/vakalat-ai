This Section was substantially reproduced by Section 66 of\nthe UK Post Office Act, 1953 as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         66.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Bill\n\nwhich introduced the Amendment Act stated in paragraph 3 that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      “3. A rapid increase in the use of computer and internet\n      has given rise to new forms of crimes like publishing\n      sexually explicit materials in electronic form, video\n      voyeurism and breach of confidentiality and leakage of\n      data by intermediary, e-commerce frauds like\n      personation commonly known as Phishing, identity\n      theft and offensive messages through communication\n      services. So, penal provisions are required to be\n      included in the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_4\">Information Technology Act</a>, the Indian\n      Penal code, the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_5\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and the code of\n      Criminal Procedure to prevent such crimes.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">4.   The petitioners contend that the very basis of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 66A</a> -\n\nthat it has given rise to new forms of crimes - is incorrect, and that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/48199014/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 66B</a> to <a href=\"/doc/91763765/\" id=\"a_8\">67C</a> and various Sections of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">Indian Penal\n\nCode</a> (which will be referred to hereinafter) are good enough to\n\ndeal with all these crimes.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">5.    The petitioners’ various counsel raised a large number of\n\npoints as to the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 66A</a>.        According to\n\nthem, first and foremost <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 66A</a> infringes the fundamental\n\nright to free speech and expression and is not saved by any of the\n\neight subjects covered in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(2).</a> According to them, the\n\ncausing of annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult,\n\ninjury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill-will are all outside\n\nthe purview of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19(2).</a>       Further, in creating an offence,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 66A</a> suffers from the vice of vagueness because unlike the\n\noffence created by <a href=\"/doc/326206/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 66</a> of the same Act, none of the\n\naforesaid terms are even attempted to be defined and cannot be\n\ndefined, the result being that innocent persons are roped in as well\n\nas those who are not. Such persons are not told clearly on which\n\nside of the line they fall; and it would be open to the authorities to\n\nbe as arbitrary and whimsical as they like in booking such persons\n\nunder the said Section.       In fact, a large number of innocent\n\npersons have been booked and many instances have been given\n\nin the form of a note to the Court. The enforcement of the said\n\nSection would really be an insidious form of censorship which\n\nimpairs a core value contained in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In addition, the\n\nsaid Section has a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and\n\nexpression. Also, the right of viewers is infringed as such chilling\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                    6</span>\n\neffect would not give them the benefit of many shades of grey in\n\nterms of various points of view that could be viewed over the\n\ninternet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">       The petitioners also contend that their rights under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_17\">Articles\n\n14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">21</a> are breached inasmuch there is no intelligible differentia\n\nbetween those who use the internet and those who by words\n\nspoken or written use other mediums of communication. To punish\n\nsomebody        because      he   uses   a    particular   medium    of\n\ncommunication is itself a discriminatory object and would fall foul\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 14</a> in any case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">6.    In reply, Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral defended the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 66A</a>. He argued\n\nthat the legislature is in the best position to understand and\n\nappreciate the needs of the people.          The Court will, therefore,\n\ninterfere with the legislative process only when a statute is clearly\n\nviolative of the rights conferred on the citizen under Part-III of the\n\nConstitution.       There is a presumption in favour of the\n\nconstitutionality of an enactment.       Further, the Court would so\n\nconstrue a statute to make it workable and in doing so can read\n\ninto it or read down the provisions that are impugned.              The\n\nConstitution does not impose impossible standards of determining\n\nvalidity.   Mere possibility of abuse of a provision cannot be a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                   7</span>\n\nground to declare a provision invalid. Loose language may have\n\nbeen used in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 66A</a> to deal with novel methods of disturbing\n\nother people’s rights by using the internet as a tool to do so.\n\nFurther, vagueness is not a ground to declare a statute\n\nunconstitutional if the statute is otherwise legislatively competent\n\nand non-arbitrary. He cited a large number of judgments before us\n\nboth from this Court and from overseas to buttress his\n\nsubmissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">Freedom of Speech and Expression\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India states as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      “Article 19. Protection of certain rights regarding\n      freedom of speech, etc.—(1) All citizens shall have\n      the right—\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      (a) to freedom of speech and expression;”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">7.    <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 19(2)</a> states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      “Article 19.

The Preamble of the Constitution of India inter alia speaks of\n\nliberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. It also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                            8</span>\n\n         says that India is a sovereign democratic republic. It cannot be\n\n         over emphasized that when it comes to democracy, liberty of\n\n         thought and expression is a cardinal value that is of paramount\n\n         significance under our constitutional scheme.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_15\">9.       Various judgments of this Court have referred to the\n\n         importance of freedom of speech and expression both from the\n\n         point of view of the liberty of the individual and from the point of\n\n         view of our democratic form of government. For example, in the\n\n         early case of <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_24\">Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras</a>, [1950] S.C.R.\n\n         594 at 602, this Court stated that freedom of speech lay at the\n\n         foundation of all democratic organizations.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_25\">Sakal Papers (P)\n\n         Ltd. &amp; Ors. v.

This last judgment is important in that it refers to the “market\n\n         place of ideas” concept that has permeated American Law.

They believed that\nfreedom to think as you will and to speak as you think\nare means indispensable to the discovery and spread\nof political truth; that without free speech and assembly\ndiscussion would be futile; that with them, discussion\naffords ordinarily adequate protection against the\ndissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest\nmenace to freedom is an inert people; that public\ndiscussion is a political duty; and that this should be a\nfundamental principle of the American government.\nThey recognized the risks to which all human\ninstitutions are subject. But they knew that order\ncannot be secured merely through fear of punishment\nfor its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage\nthought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds\nrepression; that repression breeds hate; that hate\nmenaces stable government; that the path of safety\nlies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed\ngrievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting\nremedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the\npower of reason as applied through public discussion,\nthey eschewed silence coerced by law-the argument of\nforce in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional\ntyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the\nConstitution so that free speech and assembly should\nbe guaranteed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression\nof free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and\nburnt women. It is the function of speech to free men\nfrom the bondage of irrational fears. To justify\nsuppression of free speech there must be reasonable\nground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech\nis practiced. There must be reasonable ground to\nbelieve that the danger apprehended is imminent.\nThere must be reasonable ground to believe that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                                         11</span>\n\n                 evil to be prevented is a serious one. Every\n                 denunciation of existing law tends in some measure to\n                 increase the probability that there will be violation of\n                 it. Condonation of a breach enhances the probability.\n                 Expressions of approval add to the probability.\n                 Propagation of the criminal state of mind by teaching\n                 syndicalism increases it. Advocacy of lawbreaking\n                 heightens it still further. But even advocacy of violation,\n                 however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for\n                 denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of\n                 incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the\n                 advocacy would be immediately acted on. The wide\n                 difference between advocacy and incitement, between\n                 preparation and attempt, between assembling and\n                 conspiracy, must be borne in mind. In order to support\n                 a finding of clear and present danger it must be shown\n                 either that immediate serious violence was to be\n                 expected or was advocated, or that the past conduct\n                 furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was\n                 then contemplated.” (at page 1105, 1106)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">        13.      This leads us to a discussion of what is the content of the\n\n        expression “freedom of speech and expression”. There are three\n\n        concepts which are fundamental in understanding the reach of this\n\n        most basic of human rights. The first is discussion, the second is\n\n        advocacy, and the third is incitement. Mere discussion or even\n\n        advocacy of a particular cause howsoever unpopular is at the\n\n        heart of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>                 It is only when such discussion or\n\n        advocacy reaches the level of incitement that <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19(2)</a> kicks\n\n        in.3 It is at this stage that a law may be made curtailing the speech\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">3</span>\n          A good example of the difference between advocacy and incitement is Mark Antony’s speech in Shakespeare’s\nimmortal classic Julius Caesar. Mark Antony begins cautiously. Brutus is chastised for calling Julius Caesar ambitious\nand is repeatedly said to be an “honourable man”. He then shows the crowd Caesar’s mantle and describes who struck\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                                             12</span>\n\n         or expression that leads inexorably to or tends to cause public\n\n         disorder or tends to cause or tends to affect the sovereignty &amp;\n\n         integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with\n\n         foreign States, etc. Why it is important to have these three\n\n         concepts in mind is because most of the arguments of both\n\n         petitioners and respondents tended to veer around the expression\n\n         “public order”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">         14.      It is at this point that a word needs to be said about the use\n\n         of American judgments in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>                                            In\n\n         virtually every significant judgment of this Court, reference has\n\n         been made to judgments from across the Atlantic.

It is significant to notice first the differences between the US\n\n\nCaesar where. It is at this point, after the interjection of two citizens from the crowd, that Antony says-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">        “ANTONY- Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\n        To such a sudden flood of mutiny.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">        They that have done this deed are honourable:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\n        That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,\n        And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\n        I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">        I am no orator, as Brutus is;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\n        That love my friend; and that they know full well\n        That gave me public leave to speak of him:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\n        Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\n        To stir men&#x27;s blood: I only speak right on;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">        I tell you that which you yourselves do know;\n        Show you sweet Caesar&#x27;s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,\n        And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,\n        And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\n        Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue\n        In every wound of Caesar that should move\n        The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        ALL- We&#x27;ll mutiny.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                  13</span>\n\nFirst Amendment and <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 19(2).</a> The\n\nfirst important difference is the absoluteness of the U.S. first\n\nAmendment – Congress shall make no law which abridges the\n\nfreedom of speech. Second, whereas the U.S. First Amendment\n\nspeaks of freedom of speech and of the press, without any\n\nreference to “expression”, <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> speaks of freedom of\n\nspeech and expression without any reference to “the press”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">Third, under the US Constitution, speech may be abridged,\n\nwhereas under our Constitution, reasonable restrictions may be\n\nimposed. Fourth, under our Constitution such restrictions have to\n\nbe in the interest of eight designated subject matters - that is any\n\nlaw seeking to impose a restriction on the freedom of speech can\n\nonly pass muster if it is proximately related to any of the eight\n\nsubject matters set out in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">16.   Insofar as the first apparent difference is concerned, the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court has never given literal effect to the declaration that\n\nCongress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.\n\nThe approach of the Court which is succinctly stated in one of the\n\nearly U.S. Supreme Court Judgments, continues even today. In\n\nChaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 86 L. Ed. 1031, Justice Murphy\n\nwho delivered the opinion of the Court put it thus:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      “Allowing the broadest scope to the language and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                 14</span>\n\n      purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is well\n      understood that the right of free speech is not absolute\n      at all times and under all circumstances. There are\n      certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of\n      speech, the prevention and punishment of which has\n      never been thought to raise any Constitutional\n      problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the\n      profane, the libelous, and the insulting or &#x27;fighting&#x27;\n      words—those which by their very utterance inflict injury\n      or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It\n      has been well observed that such utterances are no\n      essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of\n      such slight social value as a step to truth that any\n      benefit that may be derived from them is clearly\n      outweighed by the social interest in order and\n      morality. &#x27;Resort to epithets or personal abuse is not in\n      any proper sense communication of information or\n      opinion safeguarded by the Constitution, and its\n      punishment as a criminal act would raise no question\n      under that instrument.&#x27; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310\n      U.S. 296, 309, 310, <a href=\"/doc/1408526/\" id=\"a_35\">60</a> S.Ct. 900, 906, 84 L.Ed.1213,\n      128 A.L.R. 1352.”       (at page 1035)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">17.   So far as the second apparent difference is concerned, the\n\nAmerican Supreme Court has included “expression” as part of\n\nfreedom of speech and this Court has included “the press” as\n\nbeing covered under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, so that, as a matter of judicial\n\ninterpretation, both the US and India protect the freedom of\n\nspeech and expression as well as press freedom.           Insofar as\n\nabridgement and reasonable restrictions are concerned, both the\n\nU.S. Supreme Court and this Court have held that a restriction in\n\norder to be reasonable must be narrowly tailored or narrowly\n\ninterpreted so as to abridge or restrict only what is absolutely\n\nnecessary. It is only when it comes to the eight subject matters\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                 15</span>\n\nthat there is a vast difference. In the U.S., if there is a compelling\n\nnecessity to achieve an important governmental or societal goal, a\n\nlaw abridging freedom of speech may pass muster. But in India,\n\nsuch law cannot pass muster if it is in the interest of the general\n\npublic. Such law has to be covered by one of the eight subject\n\nmatters set out under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 19(2).</a> If it does not, and is outside\n\nthe pale of 19(2), Indian courts will strike down such law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"687159\" id=\"span_28\">18.   Viewed from the above perspective, American judgments\n\nhave great persuasive value on the content of freedom of speech\n\nand expression and the tests laid down for its infringement. It is\n\nonly when it comes to sub-serving the general public interest that\n\nthere is the world of a difference. This is perhaps why in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/687159/\" id=\"a_38\">Kameshwar Prasad &amp; Ors. v.

Information of all\n\nkinds is roped in – such information may have scientific, literary or\n\nartistic value, it may refer to current events, it may be obscene or\n\nseditious.

The word &quot;reasonable&quot; implies intelligent care\n      and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which\n      reason dictates.

As stated, all the above factors may make a distinction\n\nbetween the print and other media as opposed to the internet and\n\nthe legislature may well, therefore, provide for separate offences\n\nso far as free speech over the internet is concerned. There is,\n\ntherefore, an intelligible differentia having a rational relation to the\n\nobject sought to be achieved – that there can be creation of\n\noffences which are applied to free speech over the internet alone\n\nas opposed to other mediums of communication. Thus, an <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_69\">Article\n\n14</a> challenge has been repelled by us on this ground later in this\n\njudgment. But we do not find anything in the features outlined by\n\nthe learned Additional Solicitor General to relax the Court’s\n\nscrutiny of the curbing of the content of free speech over the\n\ninternet.   While it may be possible to narrowly draw a Section\n\ncreating a new offence, such as <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 69A</a> for instance, relatable\n\nonly to speech over the internet, yet the validity of such a law will\n\nhave to be tested on the touchstone of the tests already indicated\n\nabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">29.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_47\">In fact, this aspect was considered in <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_71\">Secretary Ministry of\n\nInformation &amp; Broadcasting, Government of India v.

What is further, the electronic media is the\n     most powerful media both because of its audio-visual\n     impact and its widest reach covering the section of the\n     society where the print media does not reach. The right\n     to use the airwaves and the content of the\n     programmes, therefore, needs regulation for balancing\n     it and as well as to prevent monopoly of information\n     and views relayed, which is a potential danger flowing\n     from     the    concentration     of    the    right   to\n     broadcast/telecast in the hands either of a central\n     agency or of few private affluent broadcasters. That is\n     why the need to have a central agency representative\n     of all sections of the society free from control both of\n     the Government and the dominant influential sections\n     of the society. This is not disputed. But to contend that\n     on that account the restrictions to be imposed on the\n     right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> should be in addition to\n     those permissible under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 19(2)</a> and dictated by\n     the use of public resources in the best interests of the\n     society at large, is to misconceive both the content of\n     the freedom of speech and expression and the\n     problems posed by the element of public property in,\n     and the alleged scarcity of, the frequencies as well as\n     by the wider reach of the media. If the right to freedom\n     of speech and expression includes the right to\n     disseminate information to as wide a section of the\n     population as is possible, the access which enables\n     the right to be so exercised is also an integral part of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                            28</span>\n\nthe said right. The wider range of circulation of\ninformation or its greater impact cannot restrict the\ncontent of the right nor can it justify its denial. The\nvirtues of the electronic media cannot become its\nenemies. It may warrant a greater regulation over\nlicensing and control and vigilance on the content of\nthe programme telecast. However, this control can only\nbe exercised within the framework of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 19(2)</a> and\nthe dictates of public interests. To plead for other\ngrounds is to plead for unconstitutional measures. It is\nfurther difficult to appreciate such contention on the\npart of the Government in this country when they have\na complete control over the frequencies and the\ncontent of the programme to be telecast. They control\nthe sole agency of telecasting. They are also armed\nwith the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 19(2)</a> and the powers of\npre-censorship under the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_76\">Cinematograph Act</a> and\nRules. The only limitation on the said right is, therefore,\nthe limitation of resources and the need to use them\nfor the benefit of all. When, however, there are surplus\nor unlimited resources and the public interests so\ndemand or in any case do not prevent telecasting, the\nvalidity of the argument based on limitation of\nresources disappears. It is true that to own a frequency\nfor the purposes of broadcasting is a costly affair and\neven when there are surplus or unlimited frequencies,\nonly the affluent few will own them and will be in a\nposition to use it to subserve their own interest by\nmanipulating news and views. That also poses a\ndanger to the freedom of speech and expression of the\nhave-nots by denying them the truthful information on\nall sides of an issue which is so necessary to form a\nsound view on any subject. That is why the doctrine of\nfairness has been evolved in the US in the context of\nthe private broadcasters licensed to share the limited\nfrequencies with the central agency like the FCC to\nregulate the programming. But this phenomenon\noccurs even in the case of the print media of all the\ncountries. Hence the body like the Press Council of\nIndia which is empowered to enforce, however\nimperfectly, the right to reply. The print media further\nenjoys as in our country, freedom from pre-censorship\nunlike the electronic media.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                29</span>\n\nPublic Order\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_51\">30.

Public order was said\n      to embrace more of the community than law and order.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                           31</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">Public order is the even tempo of the life of the\ncommunity taking the country as a whole or even a\nspecified locality. Disturbance of public order is to be\ndistinguished, from acts directed against individuals\nwhich do not disturb the society to the extent of\ncausing a general disturbance of public tranquility. It is\nthe degree of disturbance and its effect upon the life of\nthe community in a locality which determines whether\nthe disturbance amounts only to a breach of law and\norder. Take for instance, a man stabs another. People\nmay be shocked and even disturbed, but the life of the\ncommunity keeps moving at an even tempo, however\nmuch one may dislike the act. Take another case of a\ntown where there is communal tension. A man stabs a\nmember of the other community. This is an act of a\nvery different sort. Its implications are deeper and it\naffects the even tempo of life and public order is\njeopardized because the repercussions of the act\nembrace large Sections of the community and incite\nthem to make further breaches of the law and order\nand to subvert the public order. An act by itself is not\ndeterminant of its own gravity. In its quality it may not\ndiffer from another but in its potentiality it may be very\ndifferent. Take the case of assault on girls. A guest at a\nhotel may kiss or make advances to half a dozen\nchamber maids. He may annoy them and also the\nmanagement but he does not cause disturbance of\npublic order. He may even have a fracas with the\nfriends of one of the girls but even then it would be a\ncase of breach of law and order only. Take another\ncase of a man who molests women in lonely places. As\na result of his activities girls going to colleges and\nschools are in constant danger and fear. Women going\nfor their ordinary business are afraid of being waylaid\nand assaulted. The activity of this man in its essential\nquality is not different from the act of the other man but\nin its potentiality and in its effect upon the public\ntranquility there is a vast difference. The act of the man\nwho molests the girls in lonely places causes a\ndisturbance in the even tempo of living which is the\nfirst requirement of public order. He disturbs the\nsociety and the community. His act makes all the\nwomen apprehensive of their honour and he can be\nsaid to be causing disturbance of public order and not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">\f                                  32</span>\n\n      merely committing individual actions which may be\n      taken note of by the criminal prosecution agencies. It\n      means therefore that the question whether a man has\n      only committed a breach of law and order or has acted\n      in a manner likely to cause a disturbance of the public\n      order is a question of degree and the extent of the\n      reach of the act upon the society. The French\n      distinguish law and order and public order by\n      designating the latter as order publique. The latter\n      expression has been recognised as meaning\n      something more than ordinary maintenance of law and\n      order. Justice Ramaswami in Writ Petition No. 179 of\n      1968 drew a line of demarcation between the serious\n      and aggravated forms of breaches of public order\n      which affect the community or endanger the public\n      interest at large from minor breaches of peace which\n      do not affect the public at large. He drew an analogy\n      between public and private crimes. The analogy is\n      useful but not to be pushed too far. A large number of\n      acts directed against persons or individuals may total\n      up into a breach of public order. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1386353\" id=\"span_60\">In <a href=\"/doc/1386353/\" id=\"a_85\">Dr. Ram Manohar\n      Lohia</a>&#x27;s case examples were given by Sarkar, and\n      Hidayatullah, JJ. They show how similar acts in\n      different contexts affect differently law and order on the\n      one hand and public order on the other. It is always a\n      question of degree of the harm and its effect upon the\n      community. The question to ask is: Does it lead to\n      disturbance of the current of life of the community so\n      as to amount to a disturbance of the public order or\n      does it affect merely an individual leaving the tranquility\n      of the society undisturbed? This question has to be\n      faced in every case on facts. There is no formula by\n      which one case can be distinguished from another.” (at\n      pages 290 and 291).</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">35.   This decision lays down the test that has to be formulated in\n\nall these cases. We have to ask ourselves the question: does a\n\nparticular act lead to disturbance of the current life of the\n\ncommunity or does it merely affect an individual leaving the\n\ntranquility of society undisturbed? Going by this test, it is clear that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                  33</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 66A</a> is intended to punish any person who uses the\n\ninternet to disseminate any information that falls within the\n\nsub-clauses of <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 66A</a>. It will be immediately noticed that the\n\nrecipient of the written word that is sent by the person who is\n\naccused of the offence is not of any importance so far as this\n\nSection is concerned. (Save and except where under sub-clause\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">(c) the addressee or recipient is deceived or misled about the\n\norigin of a particular message.) It is clear, therefore, that the\n\ninformation that is disseminated may be to one individual or\n\nseveral individuals.   The Section makes no distinction between\n\nmass dissemination and dissemination to one person. Further, the\n\nSection does not require that such message should have a clear\n\ntendency to disrupt public order. Such message need not have any\n\npotential which could disturb the community at large. The nexus\n\nbetween the message and action that may be taken based on the\n\nmessage is conspicuously absent – there is no ingredient in this\n\noffence of inciting anybody to do anything which a reasonable man\n\nwould then say would have the tendency of being an immediate\n\nthreat to public safety or tranquility. On all these counts, it is clear\n\nthat the Section has no proximate relationship to public order\n\nwhatsoever. The example of a guest at a hotel `annoying’ girls is\n\ntelling – this Court has held that mere `annoyance’ need not cause\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                                 34</span>\n\ndisturbance of public order. Under <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 66A</a>, the offence is\n\ncomplete by sending a message for the purpose of causing\n\nannoyance, either `persistently’ or otherwise without in any\n\nmanner impacting public order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">Clear and present danger – tendency to affect.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">36.   It will be remembered that Justice Holmes in Schenck v.\n\nUnited States, 63 L. Ed. 470 enunciated the clear and present\n\ndanger test as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      “…The most stringent protection of free speech would\n      not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre\n      and causing a panic. It does not even protect a man\n      from an injunction against uttering words that may\n      have all the effect of force. Gompers v. Buck&#x27;s Stove &amp;\n      Range Co., 221 U.

The question in every\n      case is whether the words used are used in such\n      circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a\n      clear and present danger that they will bring about the\n      substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.\n      It is a question of proximity and degree.” (At page 473,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      474)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">37.   This was further refined in Abrams v. Unites States 250\n\nU.S. 616 (1919), this time in a Holmesian dissent, to be clear and\n\nimminent danger. However, in most of the subsequent judgments\n\nof the U.S. Supreme Court, the test has been understood to mean\n\nto be “clear and present danger”.

Defamation.—Whoever, by words either spoken\n      or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible\n      representations, makes or publishes any imputation\n      concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing\n      or having reason to believe that such imputation will\n      harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in\n      the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">      Explanation 1.—It may amount to defamation to impute\n      anything to a deceased person, if the imputation would\n      harm the reputation of that person if living, and is\n      intended to be hurtful to the feelings of his family or\n      other near relatives.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">      Explanation 2.—It may amount to defamation to make\n      an imputation concerning a company or an association\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">\f                                  38</span>\n\n      or collection of persons as such.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">      Explanation 3.—An imputation in the form of an\n      alternative or expressed ironically, may amount to\n      defamation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">      Explanation 4.—No imputation is said to harm a\n      person&#x27;s reputation, unless that imputation directly or\n      indirectly, in the estimation of others, lowers the moral\n      or intellectual character of that person, or lowers the\n      character of that person in respect of his caste or of his\n      calling, or lowers the credit of that person, or causes it\n      to be believed that the body of that person is in a\n      loathsome state, or in a state generally considered as\n      disgraceful.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">43.   It will be noticed that for something to be defamatory, injury\n\nto reputation is a basic ingredient. <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 66A</a> does not concern\n\nitself with injury to reputation. Something may be grossly offensive\n\nand may annoy or be inconvenient to somebody without at all\n\naffecting his reputation. It is clear therefore that the Section is not\n\naimed at defamatory statements at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">\nIncitement to an offence:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">44.   Equally, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 66A</a> has no proximate connection with\n\nincitement to commit an offence.             Firstly, the information\n\ndisseminated over the internet need not be information which\n\n“incites” anybody at all. Written words may be sent that may be\n\npurely in the realm of “discussion” or “advocacy” of a “particular\n\npoint of view”.      Further, the mere causing of annoyance,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                 39</span>\n\ninconvenience, danger etc., or being grossly offensive or having a\n\nmenacing character are not offences under the Penal Code at all.\n\nThey may be ingredients of certain offences under the Penal Code\n\nbut are not offences in themselves. For these reasons, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_105\">Section\n\n66A</a> has nothing to do with “incitement to an offence”. As <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_106\">Section\n\n66A</a> severely curtails information that may be sent on the internet\n\nbased on whether it is grossly offensive, annoying, inconvenient,\n\netc. and being unrelated to any of the eight subject matters under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 19(2)</a> must, therefore, fall foul of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, and not\n\nbeing saved under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 19(2)</a>, is declared as unconstitutional.\n\n\nDecency or Morality\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623275\" id=\"span_74\">45.

But even\nconsidering the gloss put upon the literal meaning by\nthe Court of Appeals&#x27; restriction of the statute to\ncollections of stories &#x27;so massed as to become\nvehicles for inciting violent and depraved crimes\nagainst the person * * * not necessarily * * * sexual\npassion,&#x27; we find the specification of publications,\nprohibited from distribution, too uncertain and indefinite\nto justify the conviction of this petitioner. Even though\nall detective tales and treatises on criminology are not\nforbidden, and though publications made up of criminal\ndeeds not characterized by bloodshed or lust are\nomitted from the interpretation of the Court of Appeals,\nwe think fair use of collections of pictures and stories\nwould be interdicted because of the utter impossibility\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">\f                                 47</span>\n\n      of the actor or the trier to know where this new\n      standard of guilt would draw the line between the\n      allowable and the forbidden publications. No intent or\n      purpose is required—no indecency or obscenity in any\n      sense heretofore known to the law. &#x27;So massed as to\n      incite to crime&#x27; can become meaningful only by\n      concrete instances. This one example is not enough.\n      The clause proposes to punish the printing and\n      circulation of publications that courts or juries may\n      think influence generally persons to commit crime of\n      violence against the person. No conspiracy to commit\n      a crime is required. See Musser v. State of Utah, 68\n      S.Ct. 397, this Term. It is not an effective notice of new\n      crime.

The Court\n\nreferred to an earlier judgment in United States v.

Vague laws offend several\n      important values. First, because we assume that man\n      is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct,\n      we insist that laws give the person of ordinary\n      intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is\n      prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.

Third, but related, where a\n      vague statute &#x27;abut(s) upon sensitive areas of basic\n      First Amendment freedoms, it ‘operates to inhibit the\n      exercise of (those) freedoms.’ Uncertain meanings\n      inevitably lead citizens to &quot;steer far wider of the\n      unlawful zone&#x27; . . . than if the boundaries of the\n      forbidden areas were clearly marked.&#x27;”(at page\n      227-228)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">58.

Coming to this Court’s judgments, in <a href=\"/doc/882909/\" id=\"a_133\">State of Madhya\n\nPradesh v. Baldeo Prasad</a>, [1961] 1 S.C.R. 970 an inclusive\n\ndefinition of the word “goonda” was held to be vague and the\n\noffence created by <a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 4A</a> of the Goondas Act was, therefore,\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) of the Constitution.       It was\n\nstated:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">      “Incidentally it would also be relevant to point out that\n      the definition of the word &quot;goonda&quot; affords no\n      assistance in deciding which citizen can be put under\n      that category. It is an inclusive definition and it does not\n      indicate which tests have to be applied in deciding\n      whether a person falls in the first part of the definition.\n      Recourse to the dictionary meaning of the word would\n      hardly be of any assistance in this matter. After all it\n      must be borne in mind that the Act authorises the\n      District Magistrate to deprive a citizen of his\n      fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_136\">Art. 19(1)(d)</a> and (e), and\n      though the object of the Act and its purpose would\n      undoubtedly attract the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_137\">Art. 19(5)</a> care\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">\f                             55</span>\n\nmust always be taken in passing such acts that they\nprovide sufficient safeguards against casual, capricious\nor even malicious exercise of the powers conferred by\nthem. It is well known that the relevant provisions of\nthe Act are initially put in motion against a person at a\nlower level than the District magistrate, and so it is\nalways necessary that sufficient safeguards should be\nprovided by the Act to protect the fundamental rights of\ninnocent citizens and to save them from unnecessary\nharassment. That is why we think the definition of the\nword &quot;goonda&quot; should have given necessary\nassistance to the District Magistrate in deciding\nwhether a particular citizen falls under the category of\ngoonda or not; that is another infirmity in the Act. As we\nhave already pointed out s. 4-A suffers from the same\ninfirmities as<a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_138\"> s. 4</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">Having regard to the two infirmities in <a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_139\">Sections 4</a>, 4-A\nrespectively we do not think it would be possible to\naccede to the argument of the Learned\nAdvocate-General that the operative portion of the Act\ncan fall under <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_140\">Art. 19(5)</a> of the Constitution. The person\nagainst whom action can be taken under the Act is not\nentitled to know the source of the information received\nby the District Magistrate; he is only told about his\nprejudicial activities on which the satisfaction of the\nDistrict Magistrate is based that action should be taken\nagainst him under<a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_141\"> s.4</a> or s. 4-A. In such a case it is\nabsolutely essential that the Act must clearly indicate\nby a proper definition or otherwise when and under\nwhat circumstances a person can be called a goonda,\nand it must impose an obligation on the District\nMagistrate to apply his mind to the question as to\nwhether the person against whom complaints are\nreceived is such a goonda or not. It has been urged\nbefore us that such an obligation is implicit in\n<a href=\"/doc/492974/\" id=\"a_142\">Sections 4</a> and 4-A. We are, however, not impressed\nby this argument. Where a statute empowers the\nspecified authorities to take preventive action against\nthe citizens it is essential that it should expressly make\nit a part of the duty of the said authorities to satisfy\nthemselves about the existence of what the statute\nregards as conditions precedent to the exercise of the\nsaid authority. If the statute is silent in respect of one of\nsuch conditions precedent it undoubtedly constitutes a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">\f                                   56</span>\n\n      serious infirmity which would inevitably take it out of\n      the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_143\">Art. 19(5).</a> The result of this infirmity is\n      that it has left to the unguided and unfettered discretion\n      of the authority concerned to treat any citizen as a\n      goonda. In other words, the restrictions which it allows\n      to be imposed on the exercise of the fundamental right\n      of a citizen guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_144\">Art. 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) must in\n      the circumstances be held to be unreasonable.

The provisions\n      were therefore held to be uncertain and vague.\n        The real rule is that if a law is vague or appears to be\n      so, the court must try to construe it, as far as may be,\n      and language permitting, the construction sought to be\n      placed on it, must be in accordance with the intention\n      of the legislature. Thus if the law is open to diverse\n      construction, that construction which accords best with\n      the intention of the legislature and advances the\n      purpose of legislation, is to be preferred. Where\n      however the law admits of no such construction and\n      the persons applying it are in a boundless sea of\n      uncertainty and the law prima facie takes away a\n      guaranteed freedom, the law must be held to offend\n      the Constitution as was done in the case of the\n      <a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_148\">Goonda Act</a>. This is not application of the doctrine of\n      due process. The invalidity arises from the probability\n      of the misuse of the law to the detriment of the\n      individual.

It was stated on behalf\n      of the petitioners that the conditions imposed by\n      sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 27</a> for the grant or renewal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">\f                           58</span>\n\nof licences are uncertain, vague and unintelligible and\nconsequently wide and unfettered power was\nconferred upon the statutory authorities in the matter of\ngrant or renewal of licence. In our opinion this\ncontention is well founded and must be accepted as\ncorrect. <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 27(6)(a)</a> states that in the matter of\nissue or renewal of licences the Administrator shall\nhave regard to “the number of dealers existing in the\nregion in which the applicant intends to carry on\nbusiness as a dealer”. But the word “region” is\nnowhere defined in the Act. Similarly <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 27(6)(b)</a>\nrequires the Administrator to have regard to “the\nanticipated demand, as estimated by him, for\nornaments in that region.” The expression “anticipated\ndemand” is a vague expression which is not capable of\nobjective assessment and is bound to lead to a great\ndeal of uncertainty. Similarly the expression “suitability\nof the applicant” in <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 27(6)(e)</a> and “public\ninterest” in <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 27(6)(g)</a> do not provide any\nobjective standard or norm or guidance. For these\nreasons it must be held that clauses (a),(d),(e) and (g)\nof <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 27(6)</a> impose unreasonable restrictions on\nthe fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on\nbusiness and are constitutionally invalid. It was also\ncontended that there was no reason why the\nconditions for renewal of licence should be as rigorous\nas the conditions for initial grant of licence. The\nrequirement of strict conditions for the renewal of\nlicence renders the entire future of the business of the\ndealer uncertain and subjects it to the caprice and\narbitrary will of the administrative authorities. There is\njustification for this argument and the requirement of\n<a href=\"/doc/402501/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 26</a> of the Act imposing the same conditions for\nthe renewal of the licence as for the initial grant\nappears to be unreasonable. In our opinion clauses\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">(a), (b), (e) and (g) are inextricably bound up with the\nother clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 27(6)</a> and form part of a single\nscheme. The result is that clauses (a), (b), (c), (e) and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">(g) are not severable and the entire <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 27(6)</a> of\nthe Act must be held invalid. <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 27(2)(d)</a> of the Act\nstates that a valid licence issued by the Administrator\n“may contain such conditions, limitations and\nrestrictions as the Administrator may think fit to impose\nand different conditions, limitations and restrictions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">\f                                 59</span>\n\n      may be imposed for different classes of dealers”. On\n      the face of it, this sub-section confers such wide and\n      vague power upon the Administrator that it is difficult to\n      limit its scope. In our opinion <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 27(2)(d)</a> of the\n      Act must be struck down as an unreasonable\n      restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioners to\n      carry on business. It appears, however, to us that if\n      <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 27(2)(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 27(6)</a> of the Act are\n      invalid the licensing scheme contemplated by the rest\n      of <a href=\"/doc/1534498/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 27</a> of the Act cannot be worked in practice. It\n      is, therefore, necessary for Parliament to enact fresh\n      legislation imposing appropriate conditions and\n      restrictions for the grant and renewal of licences to\n      dealers. In the alternative the Central Government may\n      make appropriate rules for the same purpose in\n      exercise of its rule-making power under <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 114</a> of\n      the Act.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">67.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50294192\" id=\"span_105\">In <a href=\"/doc/50294192/\" id=\"a_167\">A.K.

The Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">      “What we have said above in regard to the expressions\n      ‘defence of India’, ‘security of India’, &#x27;security of the\n      State&#x27; and ‘relations of India with foreign powers’\n      cannot apply to the expression “acting in any manner\n      prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services\n      essential to the community” which occurs in <a href=\"/doc/1262152/\" id=\"a_169\">Section\n      3(2)</a> of the Act. Which supplies and services are\n      essential to the community can easily be defined by\n      the legislature and indeed, legislations which regulate\n      the prices and possession of essential commodities\n      either enumerate those commodities or confer upon\n      the appropriate Government the power to do so. In the\n      absence of a definition of ‘supplies and services\n      essential to the community’, the detaining authority will\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">\f                             60</span>\n\nbe free to extend the application of this clause of\nsub-section (2) to any commodities or services the\nmaintenance of supply of which, according to him, is\nessential to the community.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">But that is not all. The Explanation to sub-section (2)\ngives to the particular phrase in that sub-section a\nmeaning which is not only uncertain but which, at any\ngiven point of time, will be difficult to ascertain or fasten\nupon. According to the Explanation, no order of\ndetention can be made under the <a href=\"/doc/190229/\" id=\"a_170\">National Security Act</a>\non any ground on which an order of detention may be\nmade under the <a href=\"/doc/1701160/\" id=\"a_171\">Prevention of Blackmarketing and\nMaintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities\nAct, 1980</a>. The reason for this, which is stated in the\nExplanation itself, is that for the purposes of\nsub-section (2), “acting in any manner prejudicial to the\nmaintenance of supplies essential to the community”\ndoes not include “acting in any manner prejudicial to\nthe maintenance of supplies of commodities essential\nto the community” as defined in the Explanation to\nsub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1980.

Clause (a) relates to committing or\ninstigating any person to commit any offence\npunishable under the Essential Commodities Act, 10 of\n1955, or under any other law for the time being in force\nrelating to the control of the production, supply or\ndistribution of, or trade and commerce in, any\ncommodity essential to the community. Clause (b) of\nthe Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1558162/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act of 1980\nrelates to dealing in any commodity which is an\nessential commodity as defined in the <a href=\"/doc/774360/\" id=\"a_175\">Essential\nCommodities Act, 1955</a>, or with respect to which\nprovisions have been made in any such other law as is\nreferred to in clause (a). We find it quite difficult to\nunderstand as to which are the remaining commodities\noutside the scope of the Act of 1980, in respect of\nwhich it can be said that the maintenance of their\nsupplies is essential to the community. The particular\nclause in sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/682299/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 3</a> of the National\nSecurity Act is, therefore, capable of wanton abuse in\nthat, the detaining authority can place under detention\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">\f                                  61</span>\n\n      any person for possession of any commodity on the\n      basis that the authority is of the opinion that the\n      maintenance of supply of that commodity is essential\n      to the community. We consider the particular clause\n      not only vague and uncertain but, in the context of the\n      Explanation, capable of being extended cavalierly to\n      supplies, the maintenance of which is not essential to\n      the community. To allow the personal liberty of the\n      people to be taken away by the application of that\n      clause would be a flagrant violation of the fairness and\n      justness of procedure which is implicit in the provisions\n      of Article 21.” (at page 325-326)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_108\">68.

Further, under Section 268, the person should be\n\nguilty of an act or omission which is illegal in nature – legal acts\n\nare not within its net. A further ingredient is that injury, danger or\n\nannoyance must be to the public in general.        Injury, danger or\n\nannoyance are not offences by themselves howsoever made and\n\nto whomsoever made. The expression “annoyance” appears also\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_199\">Sections 294</a> and <a href=\"/doc/529653/\" id=\"a_200\">510</a> of the IPC:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">      “294.

If one looks at Section 294, the annoyance that is spoken of\n\nis clearly defined - that is, it has to be caused by obscene\n\nutterances or acts. Equally, under Section 510, the annoyance\n\nthat is caused to a person must only be by another person who is\n\nin a state of intoxication and who annoys such person only in a\n\npublic place or in a place for which it is a trespass for him to enter.\n\nSuch narrowly and closely defined contours of offences made out\n\nunder the Penal Code are conspicuous by their absence in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_201\">Section\n\n66A</a> which in stark contrast uses completely open ended,\n\nundefined and vague language.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">75.

None of the cited judgments dealt\n\nwith a Section creating an offence which is saved despite its being\n\nvague and in capable of any precise definition. In fact, most of the\n\njudgments cited before us did not deal with criminal law at all. The\n\nfew that did are dealt with hereinbelow.     For instance, <a href=\"/doc/1537019/\" id=\"a_206\">Madan\n\nSingh v.

This again was said in the context of\n\na challenge on the ground of legislative competence.            The\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_209\">Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act</a>\n\nwere challenged on the ground that they were outside the\n\nexpression “public order” contained in Entry 1 of List I of the 7 th\n\nSchedule of the Constitution of India. This contention was repelled\n\nby saying that the expression “public order” was wide enough to\n\nencompass cases of “insurgency”.

In fact, two English judgments cited by the learned Additional\n\nSolicitor General would demonstrate how vague the words used in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 66A</a> are. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Collins,\n\n(2006) 1 WLR 2223, the very expression “grossly offensive” is\n\ncontained in Section 127(1)(1) of the U.K. Communications Act,\n\n2003. A 61 year old man made a number of telephone calls over\n\ntwo years to the office of a Member of Parliament.             In these\n\ntelephone calls and recorded messages Mr. Collins who held\n\nstrong views on immigration made a reference to “Wogs”, “Pakis”,\n\n“Black bastards” and “Niggers”.      Mr. Collins was charged with\n\nsending   messages     which    were    grossly   offensive.       The\n\nLeicestershire Justices dismissed the case against Mr. Collins on\n\nthe ground that the telephone calls were offensive but not grossly\n\noffensive. A reasonable person would not so find the calls to be\n\ngrossly offensive. The Queen’s Bench agreed and dismissed the\n\nappeal filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The House of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">\f                                 69</span>\n\nLords reversed the Queen’s Bench stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">      “9. The parties agreed with the rulings of the Divisional\n      Court that it is for the Justices to determine as a\n      question of fact whether a message is grossly\n      offensive, that in making this determination the\n      Justices must apply the standards of an open and just\n      multi-racial society, and that the words must be judged\n      taking account of their context and all relevant\n      circumstances. I would agree also. Usages and\n      sensitivities may change over time. Language\n      otherwise insulting may be used in an unpejorative,\n      even affectionate, way, or may be adopted as a badge\n      of honour (“Old Contemptibles”). There can be no\n      yardstick of gross offensiveness otherwise than by the\n      application of reasonably enlightened, but not\n      perfectionist, contemporary standards to the particular\n      message sent in its particular context. The test is\n      whether a message is couched in terms liable to cause\n      gross offence to those to whom it relates.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">      10. In contrast with section 127(2)(a) and its\n      predecessor subsections, which require proof of an\n      unlawful purpose and a degree of knowledge, section\n      127(1)(a) provides no explicit guidance on the state of\n      mind which must be proved against a defendant to\n      establish an offence against the subsection.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">80.   Similarly in Chambers v. Director of Public Prosecutions,\n\n[2013] 1 W.L.R. 1833, the Queen’s Bench was faced with the\n\nfollowing facts:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">      “Following an alert on the Internet social network,\n      Twitter, the defendant became aware that, due to\n      adverse weather conditions, an airport from which he\n      was due to travel nine days later was closed. He\n      responded by posting several “tweets” on Twitter in his\n      own name, including the following: “Crap1 Robin Hood\n      Airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get\n      your shit together otherwise I am blowing the airport\n      sky high1” None of the defendant’s “followers” who\n      read the posting was alarmed by it at the time. Some\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">\f                                 70</span>\n\n      five days after its posting the defendant’s tweet was\n      read by the duty manager responsible for security at\n      the airport on a general Internet search for tweets\n      relating to the airport. Though not believed to be a\n      credible threat the matter was reported to the police.\n      In interview the defendant asserted that the tweet was\n      a joke and not intended to be menacing.             The\n      defendant was charged with sending by a public\n      electronic communications network a message of a\n      menacing character contrary to section 127(1)(a) of the\n      Communications Act 2003. He was convicted in a\n      magistrates’ court and, on appeal, the Crown Court\n      upheld the conviction, being satisfied that the message\n      was “menacing per se” and that the defendant was, at\n      the very least, aware that his message was of a\n      menacing character.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">81.   The Crown Court was satisfied that the message in question\n\nwas “menacing” stating that an ordinary person seeing the tweet\n\nwould be alarmed and, therefore, such message would be\n\n“menacing”.      The Queen’s Bench Division reversed the Crown\n\nCourt stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">      “31. Before concluding that a message is criminal on\n      the basis that it represents a menace, its precise\n      terms, and any inferences to be drawn from its precise\n      terms, need to be examined in the context in and the\n      means by which the message was sent. The Crown\n      Court was understandably concerned that this\n      message was sent at a time when, as we all know,\n      there is public concern about acts of terrorism and the\n      continuing threat to the security of the country from\n      possible further terrorist attacks.      That is plainly\n      relevant to context, but the offence is not directed to\n      the inconvenience which may be caused by the\n      message. In any event, the more one reflects on it, the\n      clearer it becomes that this message did not represent\n      a terrorist threat, or indeed any other form of threat. It\n      was posted on “Twitter” for widespread reading, a\n      conversation piece for the defendant’s followers,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">\f                                  71</span>\n\n      drawing attention to himself and his predicament.\n      Much more significantly, although it purports to address\n      “you”, meaning those responsible for the airport, it was\n      not sent to anyone at the airport or anyone responsible\n      for airport security, or indeed any form of public\n      security. The grievance addressed by the message is\n      that the airport is closed when the writer wants it to be\n      open. The language and punctuation are inconsistent\n      with the writer intending it to be or it to be taken as a\n      serious warning. Moreover, as Mr. Armson noted, it is\n      unusual for a threat of a terrorist nature to invite the\n      person making it to be readily identified, as this\n      message did. Finally, although we are accustomed to\n      very brief messages by terrorists to indicate that a\n      bomb or explosive device has been put in place and\n      will detonate shortly, it is difficult to imagine a serious\n      threat in which warning of it is given to a large number\n      of tweet “followers” in ample time for the threat to be\n      reported and extinguished.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">82.   These two cases illustrate how judicially trained minds would\n\nfind a person guilty or not guilty depending upon the Judge’s\n\nnotion of what is “grossly offensive” or “menacing”.        In Collins’\n\ncase, both the Leicestershire Justices and two Judges of the\n\nQueen’s Bench would have acquitted Collins whereas the House\n\nof Lords convicted him.      Similarly, in the Chambers case, the\n\nCrown Court would have convicted Chambers whereas the\n\nQueen’s Bench acquitted him. If judicially trained minds can come\n\nto diametrically opposite conclusions on the same set of facts it is\n\nobvious that expressions such as “grossly offensive” or “menacing”\n\nare so vague that there is no manageable standard by which a\n\nperson can be said to have committed an offence or not to have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">\f                                  72</span>\n\ncommitted an offence. Quite obviously, a prospective offender of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 66A</a> and the authorities who are to enforce <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 66A</a>\n\nhave absolutely no manageable standard by which to book a\n\nperson for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 66A</a>. This being the case,\n\nhaving regard also to the two English precedents cited by the\n\nlearned Additional Solicitor General, it is clear that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 66A</a> is\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">      Ultimately, applying the tests referred to in Chintaman Rao\n\nand V.G. Row’s case, referred to earlier in the judgment, it is clear\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 66A</a> arbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately\n\ninvades the right of free speech and upsets the balance between\n\nsuch right and the reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on\n\nsuch right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_148\">Chilling Effect And Overbreadth\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">83.   Information that may be grossly offensive or which causes\n\nannoyance or inconvenience are undefined terms which take into\n\nthe net a very large amount of protected and innocent speech. A\n\nperson may discuss or even advocate by means of writing\n\ndisseminated over the internet information that may be a view or\n\npoint of view pertaining to governmental, literary, scientific or other\n\nmatters which may be unpalatable to certain sections of society. It\n\nis obvious that an expression of a view on any matter may cause\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">\f                                  73</span>\n\nannoyance, inconvenience or may be grossly offensive to some. A\n\nfew examples will suffice.       A certain section of a particular\n\ncommunity     may     be    grossly    offended    or   annoyed     by\n\ncommunications over the internet by “liberal views” – such as the\n\nemancipation of women or the abolition of the caste system or\n\nwhether certain members of a non proselytizing religion should be\n\nallowed to bring persons within their fold who are otherwise\n\noutside the fold. Each one of these things may be grossly\n\noffensive, annoying, inconvenient, insulting or injurious to large\n\nsections of particular communities and would fall within the net\n\ncast by <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 66A</a>. In point of fact, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 66A</a> is cast so widely\n\nthat virtually any opinion on any subject would be covered by it, as\n\nany serious opinion dissenting with the mores of the day would be\n\ncaught within its net. Such is the reach of the Section and if it is to\n\nwithstand the test of constitutionality, the chilling effect on free\n\nspeech would be total.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">84.   Incidentally, some of our judgments have recognized this\n\nchilling effect of free speech. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_126\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_223\">R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N.</a>,\n\n(1994) 6 SCC 632, this Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">      “19. The principle of Sullivan [376 US 254 : 11 L Ed 2d\n      686 (1964)] was carried forward — and this is relevant\n      to the second question arising in this case — in\n      Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers\n      Ltd.

The\narticles were headed “Revealed: Socialist tycoon deals\nwith Labour Chief” and “Bizarre deals of a council\nleader and the media tycoon”. A preliminary issue was\nraised whether the plaintiff has a cause of action\nagainst the defendant. The trial Judge held that such\nan action was maintainable but on appeal the Court of\nAppeal held to the contrary. When the matter reached\nthe House of Lords, it affirmed the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal but on a different ground. Lord Keith\ndelivered the judgment agreed to by all other learned\nLaw Lords. In his opinion, Lord Keith recalled that\nin Attorney General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.

The learned Law Lord referred to the decision\nof the United States Supreme Court in New York\nTimes v. Sullivan [376 US 254 : 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964)]\nand certain other decisions of American Courts and\nobserved — and this is significant for our purposes—\n\n    “while these decisions were related most directly to\nthe provisions of the American Constitution concerned\nwith securing freedom of speech, the public interest\nconsiderations which underlaid them are no less valid\nin this country. What has been described as ‘the\nchilling effect’ induced by the threat of civil actions for\nlibel is very important.

If the complainants\n      vehemently disagreed with the appellant&#x27;s views, then\n      they should have contested her views through the\n      news media or any other public platform.

It first held that demonstrations are a form of\n\nspeech and then held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">      “The approach to the question regarding the\n      constitutionality of the rule should be whether the ban\n      that it imposes on demonstrations would be covered by\n      the limitation of the guaranteed rights contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_233\">Art.\n      19 (2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1723400/\" id=\"a_234\">19(3).</a> In regard to both these clauses the\n      only relevant criteria which has been suggested by the\n      respondent-State is that the rule is framed &quot;in the\n      interest of public order&quot;.

If the rule had confined\n      itself to demonstrations of type which would lead to\n      disorder then the validity of that rule could have been\n      sustained but what the rule does is the imposition of a\n      blanket-ban on all demonstrations of whatever type -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">      innocent as well as otherwise - and in consequence its\n      validity cannot be upheld.” (at page 374)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">89.

The\n     converse must also follow that a statute which is\n     otherwise invalid as being unreasonable cannot be\n     saved by its being administered in a reasonable\n     manner. The constitutional validity of the statute would\n     have to be determined on the basis of its provisions\n     and on the ambit of its operation as reasonably\n     construed.

That section authorised the\n      Provincial Government to prohibit the entry and\n      circulation within the State of a newspaper “for the\n      purpose of securing the public safety or the\n      maintenance of public order.” Subsequent to the\n      enactment of this statute, the Constitution came into\n      force, and the validity of the impugned provision\n      depended on whether it was protected by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_260\">Article\n      19(2)</a>, which saved “existing law insofar as it relates to\n      any matter which undermines the security of or tends\n      to overthrow the State.” It was held by this Court that\n      as the purposes mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1004398/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 9</a>(1-A) of the\n      Madras Act were wider in amplitude than those\n      specified in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_262\">Article 19(2)</a>, and as it was not possible to\n      split up <a href=\"/doc/1004398/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 9</a>(1-A) into what was within and what\n      was without the protection of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_264\">Article 19(2)</a>, the\n      provision must fail in its entirety.

The present being a case of an <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> violation,\n\nRomesh Thappar’s judgment would apply on all fours.            In an\n\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> challenge, there is no question of a law being\n\napplied for purposes not sanctioned by the Constitution for the\n\nsimple reason that the eight subject matters of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 19(2)</a> are\n\nconspicuous by their absence in <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_271\">Article 19(6)</a> which only speaks of\n\nreasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public. The\n\npresent is a case where, as has been held above, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 66A</a>\n\ndoes not fall within any of the subject matters contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_273\">Article\n\n19(2)</a> and the possibility of its being applied for purposes outside\n\nthose subject matters is clear. We therefore hold that no part of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_274\">Section 66A</a> is severable and the provision as a whole must be\n\ndeclared unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_170\">\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_275\">Article 14</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_171\">97.   Counsel for the petitioners have argued that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_276\">Article 14</a> is also\n\ninfringed in that an offence whose ingredients are vague in nature\n\nis arbitrary and unreasonable and would result in arbitrary and\n\ndiscriminatory application of the criminal law. Further, there is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">\f                                 84</span>\n\nintelligible differentia between the medium of print, broadcast, and\n\nreal live speech as opposed to speech on the internet and,\n\ntherefore, new categories of criminal offences cannot be made on\n\nthis ground. Similar offences which are committed on the internet\n\nhave a three year maximum sentence under <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_277\">Section 66A</a> as\n\nopposed to defamation which has a two year maximum sentence.\n\nAlso, defamation is a non-cognizable offence whereas under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\"><a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_278\">Section 66A</a> the offence is cognizable.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_172\">98.   We have already held that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_279\">Section 66A</a> creates an offence\n\nwhich is vague and overbroad, and, therefore, unconstitutional\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and not saved by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 19(2).</a> We have\n\nalso held that the wider range of circulation over the internet\n\ncannot restrict the content of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_282\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> nor\n\ncan it justify its denial. However, when we come to discrimination\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_283\">Article 14</a>, we are unable to agree with counsel for the\n\npetitioners that there is no intelligible differentia between the\n\nmedium of print, broadcast and real live speech as opposed to\n\nspeech on the internet. The intelligible differentia is clear – the\n\ninternet gives any individual a platform which requires very little or\n\nno payment through which to air his views. The learned Additional\n\nSolicitor General has correctly said that something posted on a\n\nsite or website travels like lightning and can reach millions of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">\f                                  85</span>\n\npersons all over the world. If the petitioners were right, this <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_284\">Article\n\n14</a> argument would apply equally to all other offences created by\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_285\">Information Technology Act</a> which are not the subject matter of\n\nchallenge in these petitions. We make it clear that there is an\n\nintelligible differentia between speech on the internet and other\n\nmediums of communication for which separate offences can\n\ncertainly be created by legislation. We find, therefore, that the\n\nchallenge on the ground of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_286\">Article 14</a> must fail.\n\n\nProcedural Unreasonableness\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_173\">99.   One other argument must now be considered. According to\n\nthe petitioners, <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_287\">Section 66A</a> also suffers from the vice of\n\nprocedural unreasonableness.       In that, if, for example, criminal\n\ndefamation is alleged, the safeguards available under <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_288\">Section 199</a>\n\nCr.P.C. would not be available for a like offence committed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_289\">Section 66A</a>.     Such safeguards are that no court shall take\n\ncognizance of such an offence except upon a complaint made by\n\nsome person aggrieved by the offence and that such complaint will\n\nhave to be made within six months from the date on which the\n\noffence is alleged to have been committed. Further, safeguards\n\nthat are to be found in <a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_290\">Sections 95</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164912/\" id=\"a_291\">96</a> of the Cr.P.C. are also\n\nabsent when it comes to <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_292\">Section 66A</a>. For example, where any\n\nnewspaper book or document wherever printed appears to contain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">\f                                  86</span>\n\nmatter which is obscene, hurts the religious feelings of some\n\ncommunity, is seditious in nature, causes enmity or hatred to a\n\ncertain section of the public, or is against national integration, such\n\nbook, newspaper or document may be seized but under Section\n\n96 any person having any interest in such newspaper, book or\n\ndocument may within two months from the date of a publication\n\nseizing such documents, books or newspapers apply to the High\n\ncourt to set aside such declaration. Such matter is to be heard by\n\na Bench consisting of at least three Judges or in High Courts\n\nwhich consist of less than three Judges, such special Bench as\n\nmay be composed of all the Judges of that High Court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\">100.

If matter is to be seized on specific\n\ngrounds which are relatable to the subject matters contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_295\">Article 19(2)</a>, it would be open for persons affected by such seizure\n\nto get a declaration from a High Court consisting of at least three\n\nJudges that in fact publication of the so-called offensive matter\n\ndoes not in fact relate to any of the specified subjects contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">      Further, <a href=\"/doc/967463/\" id=\"a_297\">Section 196</a> of the Cr.P.C. states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">      “196.

In addition, Section 118 would also fall\n\nwithin Entry 1 of List II in that as its marginal note tells us it deals\n\nwith penalties for causing grave violation of public order or danger.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\">104. It is well settled that a statute cannot be dissected and then\n\nexamined as to under what field of legislation each part would\n\nseparately fall. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1057797\" id=\"span_158\">In <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_305\">A.S.

To do that, one must have regard to the\n      enactment as a whole, to its objects and to the scope\n      and effect of its provisions. If on such examination it is\n      found that the legislation is in substance one on a\n      matter assigned to the legislature, then it must be held\n      to be valid in its entirety, even though it might\n      incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its\n      competence. It would be quite an erroneous approach\n      to the question to view such a statute not as an organic\n      whole, but as a mere collection of sections, then\n      disintegrate it into parts, examine under what heads of\n      legislation those parts would severally fall, and by that\n      process determine what portions thereof are intra\n      vires, and what are not.” (at page 410)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_189\">105. It is, therefore, clear that the <a href=\"/doc/93131343/\" id=\"a_306\">Kerala Police Act</a> as a whole\n\nand Section 118 as part thereof falls in pith and substance within\n\nEntry 2 List II, notwithstanding any incidental encroachment that it\n\nmay have made on any other Entry in List I. Even otherwise, the\n\npenalty created for causing annoyance in an indecent manner in\n\npith and substance would fall within Entry 1 List III which speaks of\n\ncriminal law and would thus be within the competence of the State\n\nLegislature in any case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_190\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">106.

Under sub-section\n\n(2) thereof, the 2009 Rules have been framed. Under Rule 3, the\n\nCentral Government shall designate by notification in the official\n\ngazette an officer of the Central Government not below the rank of\n\na Joint Secretary as the Designated Officer for the purpose of\n\nissuing direction for blocking for access by the public any\n\ninformation referable to <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_315\">Section 69A</a> of the Act. Under Rule 4,\n\nevery organization as defined under Rule 2(g), (which refers to the\n\nGovernment of India, State Governments, Union Territories and\n\nagencies of the Central Government as may be notified in the\n\nOfficial Gazette by the Central Government)– is to designate one\n\nof its officers as the “Nodal Officer”. Under Rule 6, any person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">\f                                 92</span>\n\nmay send their complaint to the “Nodal Officer” of the concerned\n\nOrganization for blocking, which complaint will then have to be\n\nexamined by the concerned Organization regard being had to the\n\nparameters <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_316\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/166979650/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 69A(1)</a> and after being so\n\nsatisfied, shall transmit such complaint through its Nodal Officer to\n\nthe Designated Officer in a format specified by the Rules. The\n\nDesignated Officer is not to entertain any complaint or request for\n\nblocking directly from any person. Under Rule 5, the Designated\n\nOfficer may on receiving any such request or complaint from the\n\nNodal Officer of an Organization or from a competent court, by\n\norder direct any intermediary or agency of the Government to\n\nblock any information or part thereof for the reasons specified in\n\n69A(1). Under Rule 7 thereof, the request/complaint shall then be\n\nexamined by a Committee of Government Personnel who under\n\nRule 8 are first to make all reasonable efforts to identify the\n\noriginator or intermediary who has hosted the information. If so\n\nidentified, a notice shall issue to appear and submit their reply at a\n\nspecified date and time which shall not be less than 48 hours from\n\nthe date and time of receipt of notice by such person or\n\nintermediary. The Committee then examines the request and is to\n\nconsider whether the request is covered by 69A(1) and is then to\n\ngive a specific recommendation in writing to the Nodal Officer of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">\f                                 93</span>\n\nthe concerned Organization. It is only thereafter that the\n\nDesignated Officer is to submit the Committee’s recommendation\n\nto the Secretary, Department of Information Technology who is to\n\napprove such requests or complaints. Upon such approval, the\n\nDesignated Officer shall then direct any agency of Government or\n\nintermediary to block the offending information. Rule 9 provides for\n\nblocking of information in cases of emergency where delay caused\n\nwould be fatal in which case the blocking may take place without\n\nany opportunity of hearing. The Designated Officer shall then, not\n\nlater than 48 hours of the issue of the interim direction, bring the\n\nrequest before the Committee referred to earlier, and only on the\n\nrecommendation of the Committee, is the Secretary Department of\n\nInformation Technology to pass the final order. Under Rule 10, in\n\nthe case of an order of a competent court in India, the Designated\n\nOfficer shall, on receipt of a certified copy of a court order, submit\n\nit to the Secretary, Department of Information Technology and then\n\ninitiate action as directed by the Court. In addition to the above\n\nsafeguards, under Rule 14 a Review Committee shall meet at\n\nleast once in two months and record its findings as to whether\n\ndirections issued are in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/166979650/\" id=\"a_318\">Section 69A(1)</a> and if it is\n\nof the contrary opinion, the Review Committee may set aside such\n\ndirections and issue orders to unblock the said information.

Learned      counsel   for   the   petitioners   assailed   the\n\nconstitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_319\">Section 69A</a>, and assailed the validity of\n\nthe 2009 Rules.       According to learned counsel, there is no\n\npre-decisional hearing afforded by the Rules particularly to the\n\n“originator” of information, which is defined under <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_320\">Section 2(za)</a> of\n\nthe Act to mean a person who sends, generates, stores or\n\ntransmits any electronic message; or causes any electronic\n\nmessage to be sent, generated, stored or transmitted to any other\n\nperson. Further, procedural safeguards such as which are\n\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/875455/\" id=\"a_321\">Section 95</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164912/\" id=\"a_322\">96</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure are not available here.         Also, the confidentiality\n\nprovision was assailed stating that it affects the fundamental rights\n\nof the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_195\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">109. It will be noticed that <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_323\">Section 69A</a> unlike <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_324\">Section 66A</a> is a\n\nnarrowly drawn provision with several safeguards.          First and\n\nforemost, blocking can only be resorted to where the Central\n\nGovernment is satisfied that it is necessary so to do. Secondly,\n\nsuch necessity is relatable only to some of the subjects set out in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 19(2).</a> Thirdly, reasons have to be recorded in writing in\n\nsuch blocking order so that they may be assailed in a writ petition\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">\f                                  95</span>\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">110. The Rules further provide for a hearing before the Committee\n\nset up - which Committee then looks into whether or not it is\n\nnecessary to block such information.             It is only when the\n\nCommittee finds that there is such a necessity that a blocking\n\norder is made. It is also clear from an examination of Rule 8 that it\n\nis not merely the intermediary who may be heard. If the “person”\n\ni.e. the originator is identified he is also to be heard before a\n\nblocking order is passed. Above all, it is only after these procedural\n\nsafeguards are met that blocking orders are made and in case\n\nthere is a certified copy of a court order, only then can such\n\nblocking order also be made. It is only an intermediary who finally\n\nfails to comply with the directions issued who is punishable under\n\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_327\">Section 69A</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">111.

Further, no safeguards are provided as in\n\nthe 2009 Rules made under <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_334\">Section 69A</a>.            Also, for the very\n\nreasons that <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_335\">Section 66A</a> is bad, the petitioners assailed sub-rule\n\n(2) of Rule 3 saying that it is vague and over broad and has no\n\nrelation with the subjects specified under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_336\">Article 19(2).</a>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">115. One of the petitioners’ counsel also assailed <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_337\">Section 79(3)(b)</a>\n\nto the extent that it makes the intermediary exercise its own\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">\f                                99</span>\n\njudgment upon receiving actual knowledge that any information is\n\nbeing used to commit unlawful acts.       Further, the expression\n\n“unlawful acts” also goes way beyond the specified subjects\n\ndelineated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_338\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_206\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">116. It must first be appreciated that <a href=\"/doc/844026/\" id=\"a_339\">Section 79</a> is an exemption\n\nprovision. Being an exemption provision, it is closely related to\n\nprovisions which provide for offences including <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 69A</a>. We\n\nhave seen how under <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_341\">Section 69A</a> blocking can take place only by\n\na reasoned order after complying with several procedural\n\nsafeguards including a hearing to the originator and intermediary.\n\nWe have also seen how there are only two ways in which a\n\nblocking order can be passed – one by the Designated Officer\n\nafter complying with the 2009 Rules and the other by the\n\nDesignated Officer when he has to follow an order passed by a\n\ncompetent court. The intermediary applying its own mind to\n\nwhether information should or should not be blocked is noticeably\n\nabsent in <a href=\"/doc/10190353/\" id=\"a_342\">Section 69A</a> read with 2009 Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_208\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">117. <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_343\">Section 79(3)(b)</a> has to be read down to mean that the\n\nintermediary upon receiving actual knowledge that a court order\n\nhas been passed asking it to expeditiously remove or disable\n\naccess to certain material must then fail to expeditiously remove or\n\ndisable access to that material.     This is for the reason that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">\f                                  100</span>\n\notherwise it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google,\n\nFacebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the\n\nintermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are\n\nlegitimate and which are not. We have been informed that in other\n\ncountries worldwide this view has gained acceptance, Argentina\n\nbeing in the forefront. Also, the Court order and/or the notification\n\nby the appropriate Government or its agency must strictly conform\n\nto the subject matters <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_344\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_345\">Article 19(2).</a> Unlawful acts\n\nbeyond what is <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_346\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_347\">Article 19(2)</a> obviously cannot form\n\nany part of <a href=\"/doc/844026/\" id=\"a_348\">Section 79</a>. With these two caveats, we refrain from\n\nstriking down <a href=\"/doc/161852741/\" id=\"a_349\">Section 79(3)(b)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_210\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_211\">118. The learned Additional Solicitor General informed us that it is\n\na common practice worldwide for intermediaries to have user\n\nagreements containing what is stated in Rule 3(2). However, Rule\n\n3(4) needs to be read down in the same manner as <a href=\"/doc/117237824/\" id=\"a_350\">Section 79(3)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">(b). The knowledge spoken of in the said sub-rule must only be\n\nthrough the medium of a court order.          Subject to this, the\n\nInformation Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011\n\nare valid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">119.
