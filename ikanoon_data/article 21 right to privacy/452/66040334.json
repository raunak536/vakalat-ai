In the present case, one such evidence, which has\n\n       been brought by way of charge sheet, is the recorded telephonic\n\n       conversation, from which, it is evident that the petitioner\n\n       demanded Rs. 10,00,000/- in cash and ten cheques of Rs. 10000-\n\n       12000/- from Raj Kumar Agrawal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">                    40. Learned Counsel for the petitioner also argued that\n\n       telephonic conversation recorded without the consent of the\n\n       petitioner cannot be taken as a piece of evidence inasmuch as the\n\n       Central Bureau of Investigation registered First Information\n\n       Report for trap case, based on interception of telegraph and is\n\n       relying on intercepted telegraphic material, but it did not follow at\n\n       all the law as <a href=\"/doc/15799208/\" id=\"a_88\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court for interception of\n\n       the telegraph and the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 5 (2)</a> of the Indian\n\n       Telegraph Act, 1885, and Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph\n\n       Rules, 1956, without which the intercepted telegraphic material is\n\n       not admissible in evidence and all action based on such telegraphic\n\n       material is liable to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">                    41. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1769219\" id=\"span_27\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1769219/\" id=\"a_90\">State (NCT of Delhi) v.

At the time of deciding the petition for\n\n       quashing, only prima facie case is to be seen and the truthfulness\n\n       of the allegations are not to be seen. The learned C.B.I. Court, after\n\n       submission of charge sheet by the Central Bureau of Investigation\n\n       and after finding a prima facie case against the petitioner, has\n\n       taken cognizance of the offence against the petitioner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">                    45.
