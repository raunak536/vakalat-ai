The third respondent has come forward to make a Web series on\n\n                     the life story of Dr.J.Jayalalitha. The third respondent has planned to\n\n                     produce the web serial on the life story of Dr.J.Jayalalitha for his\n\n                     commercial          and     monetary    benefits,   without   the   consent     of    the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff.         The life story of Dr.J.Jayalalitha cannot be filmed\n\n                     without adding the life of the appellant/plaintiff and her relatives as part of\n\n                     the film. In such an event, the same would amount to invading into the\n\n                     privacy of the appellant/plaintiff, more so, the appellant/plaintiff was not\n\n                     aware of the story, script or screen play and dialogue prepared by the\n\n                     respondents in the process of producing the said movie and for the web\n\n                     serial.       The         appellant/plaintiff   apprehends      that      while       the\n\n                     respondents/defendants portray Dr.J.Jayalalitha and her personal life in the\n\n                     life story, the plaintiff&#x27;s part in the life story, may also be depicted by the\n\n                     respondents/defendants in their own version, which may affect the family\n\n                     privacy of the appellant/plaintiff. Therefore, the appellant/plaintiff\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                     Page No.4/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                                            O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     contended that the personality rights of her aunt Dr.J.Jayalalitha and the\n\n                     interest of her family&#x27;s privacy, had to be safeguarded. Hence, it is\n\n                     absolutely necessary that, in the absence of any consent and approval of the\n\n                     story,        script,    screenplay    etc.,    by     the   appellant/plaintiff,     the\n\n                     respondents/defendants should not be permitted to proceed with the\n\n                     production of the said film or web serial or releasing the same for public\n\n                     exhibition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">                               6. The apprehension of the appellant/plaintiff is that, during the\n\n                     production of the film, the respondents/defendants may interpolate the\n\n                     scenes which would affect the dignity and reputation of Dr.J.Jayalalitha,\n\n                     while narrating the story, for their commercial enrichment. Therefore, it is\n\n                     contended by the appellant/plaintiff that it is just and necessary to check the\n\n                     entire        story,    script   and   screen   play     inter-alia   to   direct     the\n\n                     respondents/defendants to get the prior approval of the appellant/plaintiff\n\n                     before releasing the bi-lingual film on the life story of Dr. J. Jayalalitha. It\n\n                     is in those circumstances, the appellant has filed the suit, apart from interim\n\n                     injunction, also for a declaration to declare that the respondents have no\n\n                     legal right, power or authority to make the release, to publish, exhibit\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                     Page No.5/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                                       O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     publicly or privately, sell, enter into film festival, promote, advertise or\n\n                     otherwise producing in any format any film, drama, serial, teleserial, web\n\n                     serial or any other literary or artistic expression in respect of the life of\n\n                     Dr.J.Jayalalitha, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and/or her family\n\n                     members and their direct descendants without the consent of the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                               7.

On notice, the second respondent had filed a counter affidavit\n\n                     contending inter alia that the second respondent is a renowned film\n\n                     producer based from Hyderabad. He started the production unit in the year\n\n                     2011. His first film is based on the life events of N.T.Rama Rao. His next\n\n                     production is a Hindi movie named &quot;83&quot; and the said film is about the 1983\n\n                     world-cup played by Indian Cricket Team. His intention is to produce\n\n                     movies, which have a good inspiring content and the same should be\n\n                     cherished by the audience. He was looking for making the life event of\n\n                     former Chief Minister of Tamilnadu Dr.J.Jayalalitha from the information\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                     Page No.6/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                                  O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     available in &quot;public domain&quot;. He has done research for about two years and\n\n                     made a public announcement in August 2018 and also in February 2019 and\n\n                     in the said process, the first and second respondents have studied various\n\n                     interviews of Dr.J.Jayalalitha, read books on her which are available in\n\n                     public domain. While so, the second respondent during April 2019, met the\n\n                     Publisher of Saaraansh Media Solutions Private Limited, engaged in\n\n                     publishing and advertising business, who has informed that he had\n\n                     purchased the copy-right of the book named &quot;Thalaivi&quot; from the author,\n\n                     named Ajayan Bala @ Balaji.B through an agreement dated 09.07.2018.\n\n                     Therefore, the second respondent requested the said Publisher to assign the\n\n                     copy-right of the book &quot;Thalaivi&quot; in his favour to produce it as a movie.\n\n                     After deliberations, an agreement dated 18.04.2019 was entered into\n\n                     between the second respondent and Saaraansh Media Solutions Private\n\n                     Limited, whereby the publisher has assigned and transferred the exclusive\n\n                     right of the book in favour of the second respondent, to enable him to\n\n                     produce the movie. Thus, it is the contention of the second respondent that\n\n                     he is having exclusive right over the contents of the book titled &quot;Thalaivi&quot;,\n\n                     based on which, he decided to produce the movie. In fact, the shooting of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                     Page No.7/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                                       O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     the movie started in the month of November 2019 and the film was to be\n\n                     shot at different locations at Chennai, Mysore and Hyderabad. As the\n\n                     process of production of the film commenced 18 months ago and the feature\n\n                     film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; has a huge star cast of international technicians, the second\n\n                     respondent has incurred enormous expenses for the film. While so, when\n\n                     the production of the film was in the verge of completion, the instant\n\n                     application as well as the suit were filed by the appellant/plaintiff. The\n\n                     second respondent has no connection with the web-series named, &quot;Queen&quot;,\n\n                     directed by the third respondent herein. The action of the appellant/plaintiff\n\n                     in combining two different disputes together, would cause grave prejudice\n\n                     to the second respondent. Therefore, the suit is also liable to be dismissed\n\n                     on the ground of mis-joinder of parties. Accordingly, the second respondent\n\n                     sought for dismissal of the application for interim injunction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">                               9. The third respondent, who is the Director of the web series &#x27;Queen&#x27;,\n\n                     has filed a separate counter affidavit stating that, the said web series is not\n\n                     intended to be a &quot;biopic&quot; on the life of Dr.J.Jayalalitha.

According to the third respondent, the appellant/plaintiff has filed\n\n                     a composite suit in respect of three different and distinct causes of action\n\n                     against three different parties, which is legally impermissible. The alleged\n\n                     cause of action does not arise from the same act or transaction to enable the\n\n                     plaintiff to maintain the present single suit. The third respondent is a\n\n                     Director of the web-series &quot;Queen&quot;, starring actress Ms. Ramya Krishnan\n\n                     in a titular role. On the other hand, the first and second respondents are\n\n                     producing and/or directing the film titled &quot;Thalaivi&quot; starring actress\n\n                     Ms.Kangana Ranaut in the titular role. Therefore, according to the third\n\n                     respondent, both the productions of the web-series &quot;Queen&quot; and the film\n\n                     directed by the respondents 1 and 2 titled &quot;Thalaivi&quot; are different, distinct\n\n                     and dissimilar with each other. Therefore, the present suit is vitiated by\n\n                     multifariousness and it is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.\n\n                     Further, the body of the plaint does contain only stray averment about the\n\n                     web-series directed by the third respondent. The plaint does not disclose any\n\n                     cause of action as against the third respondent. Hence, the plaint is liable to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                     Page No.9/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                                                    O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     be dismissed under Order VII Rule 11 of Civil Procedure Code (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_1\">CPC</a>). The\n\n                     third respondent is only a Director of the web-series titled &quot;Queen&quot; and he is\n\n                     not a producer of the said web-series as alleged in the plaint. Further, the\n\n                     third respondent is also not a holder of any propriety right or intellectual\n\n                     property right or any other right in connection with the web-series, namely\n\n                     &quot;Queen&quot;. Thus, the present Original Application is liable to be dismissed,\n\n                     in view of the failure of the appellant/plaintiff to seek leave to sue the\n\n                     necessary parties, especially when the producer is outside the jurisdiction of\n\n                     this Court. Furthermore, there is an inordinate delay in the appellant\n\n                     approaching this Court with the present suit. The appellant/plaintiff herself\n\n                     alleged that the cause of action for the suit arose on 24.02.2019 and inspite\n\n                     of the same, the appellant/plaintiff had chosen to wait for almost nine\n\n                     months to institute this suit with the full knowledge that the third\n\n                     respondent and more importantly, the producer were expending their time,\n\n                     money and other resources towards production of the web-series.\n\n                     Therefore, the suit is liable to be dismissed on the ground of acquiescence\n\n                     and laches/delay on the part of the plaintiff. At the fag end of the release of\n\n                     the film, only in order to enrich herself, the present suit as well as the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                     Page No.10/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                                                                      O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     Original Application have been filed by abusing the legal process. The real\n\n                     motive of the appellant/plaintiff is not to safeguard the reputation of the\n\n                     former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu or protect the family privacy right, but\n\n                     otherwise. The appellant/plaintiff has no locus-standi at all to file the\n\n                     present suit, when she was not in close contact with the former Chief\n\n                     Minister of the State when she was alive. On the other hand, the relationship\n\n                     between Dr.Jayalalitha and the appellant/plaintiff had been strained, which\n\n                     was also admitted by the appellant herself in an article dated 18.12.2016,\n\n                     authored by the appellant herself. Therefore, for all the above reasons, the\n\n                     third respondent prayed for dismissal of the Original Application filed by\n\n                     the appellant/plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                               11.   After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the learned\n\n                     Single Judge declined to grant an injunction and dismissed the Original\n\n                     Application filed by the appellant. The relevant portion of the order passed\n\n                     by the learned single Judge reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                      &quot;15. The question that arises for consideration is\n                               whether the Applicant has made out a case for the grant of an\n                               interim injunction either against the first and second\n                               respondents or against the third respondent. As far as the first\n                               and second respondents are concerned, they contended that\n                               they acquired the cinema rights of a book titled &quot;Thalaivi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                     Page No.11/44</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                                                                       O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                               which was published previously and is, in fact, the subject\n                               matter of a registered copyright. Moreover, in paragraph 13 of\n                               the counter affidavit of the second respondent, it is stated\n                               categorically that the proposed film would not cast a stigma on\n                               the applicant and that she would not be depicted in a single\n                               scene in the film. Thus, the privacy rights of the Applicant per\n                               se are addressed.         Nonetheless, the Applicant asserts\n                               posthumous privacy rights and personality rights on behalf of\n                               her aunt. Given that the first and second respondent are\n                               engaged in the production of a biopic, it is pertinent to bear in\n                               mind that the release of the film would be subject to\n                               certification by the Central Board of Film Certification\n                               (CBFC).        During such certification process, if any\n                               objectionable material is contained therein, the CBFC would\n                               raise objections and, if necessary, insist upon excising such\n                               objectionable footage as a pre-requisite for the grant of a\n                               certificate for the exhibition of the film. Therefore, as regards\n                               the first and second respondent, notwithstanding the assertion\n                               of posthumous privacy and personality rights, sufficient\n                               safeguards are in place both in the form of the undertaking and\n                               the requirement of certification. Further, it is stated that the\n                               production of the film and its subsequent release for public\n                               exhibition would take several months. For all these reasons,\n                               even without closely examining the legal issue, no case is\n                               made out for the grant of an interim injunction against the first\n                               and second respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                                      16. The facts with regard to the third respondent are\n                               distinct and, therefore, have to be dealt with separately. The\n                               third respondent has acquired the rights to make a web serial\n                               on the basis of a book titled &quot;Queen&quot;, which was published in\n                               the year 2017, and the author appears to hold the copy right\n                               thereto. It may be noted that the said book is stated to be\n                               inspired by true events. In other words, it is not an historical\n                               novel but merely one that draws inspiration from true events.\n                               The third respondent has taken a categorical stand that the web\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                     Page No.12/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                                                                         O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                               series would be based on the book and that it would be a\n                               fictional rendition. It is also stated that the protagonist of the\n                               web series is called Sakthi Seshadri. In these facts and\n                               circumstances, can it be said that the applicant is entitled to an\n                               order of prior restraint in respect of the proposed web series\n                               because it is probably inspired by the life of the former CM?\n                               Admittedly, the applicant is the niece of the former CM. On\n                               that basis is the applicant entitled to an interim injunction in\n                               the alleged posthumous exercise of the right to privacy or\n                               personality rights on behalf of her late aunt? As regards\n                               personality rights, even on a prima facie basis, it is difficult to\n                               accept that the applicant/plaintiff has inherited the personality\n                               rights of her aunt. Indeed, the question as to whether such\n                               rights are capable of being inherited would have to await trial\n                               and final disposal. The question as to whether the applicant is\n                               entitled to restrain the public exhibition of the web series of\n                               the posthumous right of privacy remains to be considered. In\n                               the R.Rajagopal case, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court recognised\n                               that the right to privacy is both a fundamental right and a right\n                               under common law/Tort law. The Court further held that the\n                               consent or permission of a public figure is not required for the\n                               publication of a work on such public figure if it is based on\n                               public records. However, the said case did not deal with the\n                               question as to whether the right to privacy can be exercised\n                               posthumously by a relative of a deceased public figure. In this\n                               case, two important rights are at issue, namely, the right of\n                               freedom of expression, including artistic expression, and the\n                               right to privacy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_23\">It is the settled position that both the rights\n                               are fundamental rights, albeit the former is an enumerated\n                               right while the latter is derived and read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a>\n                               authoritatively and conclusively in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_3\">K.S.Puttaswamy vs.\n                               Union of India</a> (2017) 10 SCC 1. Consequently, a balance\n                               has to be struck and the boundaries and contours of these two\n                               rights would have to be determined, both tentatively and\n                               definitively, for interlocutory and final disposal purposes,\n                               respectively, in light of the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                     Page No.13/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                                        O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">                                      17. In this case, the Applicant/Plaintiff clearly and\n                               indubitably has both a fundamental and common law right as\n                               regards her privacy. With regard to the first and second\n                               Respondents, as stated earlier, there is an undertaking that not\n                               a single scene would depict the Applicant. The third\n                               Respondent, on the other hand, takes the position that the web\n                               series is fictional and that an undertaking is not warranted.\n                               Nonetheless, on balance, I am of the view that the web series\n                               of the third Respondent should not infringe the privacy of the\n                               Applicant (i.e. by demarcating and differentiating it from the\n                               assertion of posthumous rights) pending determination of the\n                               suit. The assertion of posthumous privacy rights on behalf of\n                               her aunt is, however, a different matter. The Applicant is not a\n                               near relative of the Former CM, i.e. she is not a daughter or\n                               even a member of the same household. In such circumstances,\n                               one has to test, for interlocutory purposes, her asserted right -\n                               to prior restraint of the exhibition of the web series without her\n                               consent or to insist that such series should not be made\n                               without including her in such web series - by weighing it\n                               against the Respondents right to freedom of expression. The\n                               assertion that her aunt&#x27;s life story cannot be told without\n                               including her role in it could be brushed aside as ingenuous\n                               and, in any event, it cannot be said that she has an actionable\n                               right to insist on being included as a character in the web\n                               serial. As regards her right to restrain the exhibition of the\n                               web series without her consent, at this juncture, the Applicant&#x27;s\n                               right to posthumously exercise the right to privacy on behalf of\n                               her late aunt is contested fiercely by the Respondents, by\n                               citing precedent such as the Nakkeeran case, the Veerappan\n                               case, the Kamaraj case and the M.P. Raju case, in that regard,\n                               and such rights appear prima facie to be tenuous. I am unable\n                               to subscribe, in this regard, to the view expressed in the\n                               Jalaram Bapa case that any descendant is entitled to enforce\n                               prior restraint rights. In my view, if that principle were to be\n                               applied, agnates and cognates would emerge from the wood\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                     Page No.14/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                                                       O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                               work and sound the death knell for the freedom of artistic\n                               expression.

The learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff submitted that the\n\n                     appellant is the Class I legal heir (as per Hindu Law) of late.

Therefore, as a Class I legal heir, she is\n\n                     entitled to institute the present suit to safeguard the &quot;posthumous right of\n\n                     privacy&quot; and to protect the dignity and legacy of her Late aunt\n\n                     Dr.J.Jayalalitha. However, the learned Single Judge, on an erroneous\n\n                     consideration, concluded that the appellant/plainatiff is not a close relative\n\n                     of Dr.J.Jayalalitha and therefore, she cannot exercise any posthumous right\n\n                     on behalf of her Late aunt. Such a finding of the learned Single Judge runs\n\n                     contrary to the declaration of her status as Class I legal heir made by the\n\n                     Division Bench of this Court in O.P.No.630 of 2018. To buttress such\n\n                     submission, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff relied on a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                     Page No.16/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                                                                    O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_4\">R.Rajagopal Vs.

As next fold of submission, the learned counsel for the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff submitted that the case of the respondents/defendants that\n\n                     the film and web-series are &#x27;fictional&#x27; works based on the books namely\n\n                     &quot;Queen&quot; written by Anita Sivakumaran and another book by name\n\n                     &quot;Thalaivi, is incorrect. This defence has been accepted by the learned Single\n\n                     Judge, but the fact remains that, the respondents 1 and 2 admitted that the\n\n                     impugned film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; is based on the life of late. Dr. J. Jayalalitha.\n\n                     They have also admitted in their counter affidavit that the impugned film is\n\n                     completely being produced based on the information available in public\n\n                     domain about Late.Dr.J.Jayalalitha only. Therefore, the contention that the\n\n                     web series or film are fictional work based on the book namely &quot;Queen&quot; or\n\n                     &quot;Thalaivi&quot;, cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">                               15. So far as the third respondent is concerned, under the pretext of\n\n                     fiction,      he   has   portrayed   several   personal   life    instances      of\n\n                     Late.Dr.J.Jayalalitha, which are untrue and demeaning to the dignified life\n\n                     led by her aunt. According to the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                     Page No.19/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                                                                   O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     on viewing the web-series, one can notice that the third respondent went to\n\n                     the extent of casting aspersions about her aunt and portrayed her as if she\n\n                     was in a relationship with another actor. The story further unfolds that her\n\n                     aunt was begging her male co-star to marry her and her co-star threatens and\n\n                     insults her by refusing to accede to her request. Later, the story proceeds as\n\n                     though her aunt pursues another man, a movie director, who also rejects her\n\n                     after succumbing to her initial advances. These scenes projected in the web-\n\n                     series, according to the learned counsel for the appellant, are not only\n\n                     untrue, but they are disturbing to be viewed. The aunt of the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff, was also seen to have been cutting her wrists in the\n\n                     movie and she was recommended to approach a Psychiatrist for help.\n\n                     Further, in the web-series, the father of the appellant, brother of\n\n                     Dr.J.Jayalalitha, was depicted as a drug addict and thereby slandered the\n\n                     family member of her aunt. According to the learned counsel for the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff, these are not the real instances and rather, they are\n\n                     exaggerated for unlawful enrichment and thereby, portrayed her aunt and\n\n                     her family members in poor light in the web-series. By trampling upon the\n\n                     personal life of late.Dr.J.Jayallaitha in such a grossly disrespectful manner,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                     Page No.20/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                                                                     O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     the defence of it being wholly fiction, is a smoke-screen, as it seeks to\n\n                     sensationalize the personal life of her aunt Dr.J.Jayalalitha, which is a\n\n                     matter that is outrageous to her dignity and legacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">                               16. The learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff further proceeded\n\n                     to contend that late.Dr.J.Jayalalitha was also a public official and is entitled\n\n                     to right of privacy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_42\">In this regard, he relied on the judgment of the Supreme\n\n                     Court in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_7\">R.Rajagopal</a>&#x27;s case (mentioned supra) and contended that the\n\n                     appellant&#x27;s aunt was a public official and she is also standing on par with\n\n                     common man so far as the &quot;right to private life&quot; is concerned. Such right to\n\n                     privacy of life of an individual, should not be invaded by any one in any\n\n                     manner. The perversion of the personal life of the aunt of the appellant and\n\n                     her family members, is the primary ground raised in the &quot;lis&quot;, but the\n\n                     learned Single Judge did not deal with the consequences of invasion of the\n\n                     private life of the aunt of the appellant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                               17.   The learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff also submitted\n\n                     that it is true that the respondents/defendants have the right to freedom of\n\n                     speech and expression, but such right has to be exercised cautiously without\n\n                     violating the right of others or at the cost of privacy of the aunt of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                     Page No.21/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                                                                                        O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     appellant, which is guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of The Constitution of\n\n                     India. In this regard, reliance is also placed on the decision of this Court in\n\n                     the case in Selvi.J.Jayalalitha Vs. Penguin Books India, reported in\n\n                     (2013) (54) PTC 327 (Mad), wherein it was held that &quot;right of privacy&quot; is\n\n                     an individual right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of The Constitution of India\n\n                     and it is a right to be let alone. Late.Dr.J.Jayalalitha was immensely pro-\n\n                     active in protecting her legacy during her life time and the same has already\n\n                     been protected by this Court in the past. Therefore, the relief sought for by\n\n                     the appellant is with a slight variation to protect the posthumous right of her\n\n                     aunt. In fact, the life of the appellant&#x27;s aunt prior to the entry into public life,\n\n                     has not been verified by the respondents. But, without conducting any\n\n                     private verification or consulting the appellant herein, prior to production of\n\n                     the web series and movies, sought to sensationalize the same by all manner\n\n                     of sleazy and scandalous imputations, to rouse public interest in their works.\n\n                     It is in those context, obtaining prior consent of the appellant is mandatory,\n\n                     which the respondents did not obtain.

The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the\n\n                     learned Single Judge held that the film produced by the respondents 1 and 2,\n\n                     is subject to verification process by the CBFC and if any objectionable\n\n                     material and footage is noticed, it will be verified by the Board. However,\n\n                     the learned Single Judge did not note that the manner of review and\n\n                     censorship done by CBFC, will not in any manner protect the legacy of the\n\n                     appellant&#x27;s aunt or it will preclude her &quot;right of privacy&quot;. Therefore, such an\n\n                     observation of the learned Single Judge to refuse the relief of injunction is\n\n                     legally not sustainable. In support of the contentions raised in this appeal,\n\n                     the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff relied on a judgment of this\n\n                     Court in the case of Shivaji Rao Gaikwad (also known as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                     Page No.23/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                                                                         O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     Mr.Rajinikanth) Vs. M/s.Varsha Producers, reported in 2015 (1) LW\n\n                     701, relevant portion of which reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                          &quot;23. From the reading of the above said judgments, it\n                                   is seen that if any person uses the name of a celebrity\n                                   without his/her permission, the celebrity is entitled for\n                                   injunction, if the said celebrity could be easily identified by\n                                   the use of his name by the others. As observed earlier, in\n                                   the instant case, on seeing the name of Rajinikanth in the\n                                   tile of the impugned movie, the persons, who are coming\n                                   across the tile of the impugned movie, are identifying the\n                                   name only with the plaintiff herein, which is evident from\n                                   the website pages hosted by different persons. Therefore, in\n                                   my opinion, even assuming for a moment that the\n                                   impugned movie is not a biopic of the plaintiff, since the\n                                   name found in the title of the impugned movie is\n                                   identifiable only with the plaintiff, who happens to be a\n                                   celebrity and not with any other person, the defendant is\n                                   not entitled to use the said name without the permission of\n                                   the plaintiff/celebrity, particularly when he had chosen to\n                                   advertise the movie with a title &#x27;Hot Kavita Radheshyam As\n                                   Sex Worker For Rajinikanth&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">                               19. The learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff therefore prayed for\n\n                     setting aside the impugned order of the learned Single Judge and to allow\n\n                     the appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">                               20. Countering the above submissions, Mr.P.S.Raman, learned Senior\n\n                     Counsel appearing for the respondents 1 and 2 contended that the first\n\n                     respondent is the Director of the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; and the second respondent\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                     Page No.24/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                                                                  O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     is the renowned film producer based at Hyderabad. During August 2018,\n\n                     the second respondent announced the making of the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot;, based\n\n                     on the life events of former Chief Minister Late.Dr.J.Jayalalitha from the\n\n                     information available in the public domain. The second respondent had also\n\n                     come to know that one Saaraanash Media Solutions Private Limited is the\n\n                     copy right holder of the book named &quot;Thalaivi&quot; from the original author, by\n\n                     name Ajayan Bala @ Balaji.B through an agreement dated 09.07.2018.\n\n                     Therefore, after deliberations, the second respondent evinced interest to get\n\n                     the copy-right assigned and/or transferred in his favour. Ultimately, an\n\n                     agreement dated 18.04.2019 was entered into, by which the second\n\n                     respondent had become exclusive assignor and/or copy-right owner of the\n\n                     book. Thereafter, the second respondent commenced the production of the\n\n                     film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; during April 2019 and also commenced the shooting of the\n\n                     film by spending Rs.60 crores.      The entire shooting of the film was\n\n                     completed and it is in the pre-production stage awaiting Censor Certificate.\n\n                     Even the teaser of the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; was released on 23.11.2019 itself\n\n                     which was watched by more than a crore people through social media.\n\n                     While so, the appellant/plaintiff, after considerable delay, has filed the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                     Page No.25/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                                                                     O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     instant suit and the application, which are hit by the principles of latches.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                               21. The suit in C.S.No.697 of 2019 had been mainly filed on the\n\n                     allegation that the respondents 1 and 2, without approaching the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff or without taking her consent, are proceeding to release\n\n                     the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot;. Further, the life story of the former Chief Minister\n\n                     cannot be filmed without adding the life of the appellant as part of the film,\n\n                     as the same would interfere with the privacy right of the appellant/plaintiff.\n\n                     In fact, before the learned Single Judge, the second respondent has given an\n\n                     undertaking that the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; will not have single scene portraying\n\n                     the appellant/plaintiff. Thus, the appellant&#x27;s privacy will not be disturbed\n\n                     and her life is not part of the film. In fact, the second respondent had also\n\n                     obtained the right of the book &quot;Thalaivi&quot; on 18.04.2019 for production of\n\n                     the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot;. The appellant/plaintiff had not objected for the\n\n                     publication of the book. The said book also depicts the life story of the\n\n                     former Chief Minister and it was registered under the Copy-right Act.\n\n                     Therefore, there is no question of privacy of the appellant/plaintiff being\n\n                     infringed, inasmuch as every one in Tamil Nadu is aware of the life story of\n\n                     former Chief Minister. It is a matter of &quot;public domain&quot; and the concept of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                     Page No.26/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                                                                     O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     privacy rights, will not arise at all. The life of Dr.J.Jayalalitha is in the\n\n                     public domain through newspapers, books and online for the past 50 years\n\n                     and the film is based on the book &quot;Thalaivi&quot; and also on the basis of the\n\n                     information available in the public domain. In any event, the biopic film of\n\n                     former Chief Minister will only glorify the former Chief Minister. The film\n\n                     will be an inspiration to the present and future generations to know about\n\n                     the struggles confronted by the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; (former Chief Minister\n\n                     Late.Dr.J.Jayalalitha).

By placing reliance on the above decisions, the learned Senior\n\n                     Counsel appearing for the respondents 1 and 2 submitted that the appellant\n\n                     cannot assert posthumous privacy right and personal right on behalf of her\n\n                     aunt late chief Minister. This is more so that the appellant did not enjoy a\n\n                     cordial or close relationship with her aunt during her life time. Above all,\n\n                     the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first and second respondents\n\n                     contended that the film &quot;Thalaivi&quot; will be released subject to the\n\n                     certification to be given by the CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification).\n\n                     During such certification process, if any objectional material is noticed, the\n\n                     CBFC itself would raise objections or if necessary, insist upon removal of\n\n                     such objectional materials as a condition precedent for grant of Censor\n\n                     Certificate. Therefore, sufficient safeguards are made to ensure that the film\n\n                     does not contain any material which will be detrimental to the posthumous\n\n                     personality right of the aunt of the appellant/plaintiff. Further, before release\n\n                     of the film in question, the appellant can very well view the film and she\n\n                     was not prevented from doing so in any manner.

The appellant/plaintiff has not made out any prima facie case\n\n                     and the balance of convenience is not in her favour. The learned Senior\n\n                     Counsel therefore prayed for dismissal of this Appeal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">                               26. Mr.Satish Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\n                     third respondent submitted that the present appeal is an abuse of process of\n\n                     law and the same is liable to be dismissed, insofar as it relates to the third\n\n                     respondent. In fact, the Web-Series &quot;Queen&quot; had already been released on\n\n                     the One OTT platform MX Player on 14.12.2019 itself. Therefore, the relief\n\n                     sought for in this appeal as against the third respondent, has become\n\n                     infructuous. Furthermore, the third respondent is only a Director of the\n\n                     Web Serial titled &quot;Queen&quot; and he is not the producer of the Web Serial.\n\n                     When the Producer is not arraigned as a party, on that score also, the appeal\n\n                     cannot be maintained as against the Director/third respondent. Further, the\n\n                     learned Senior Counsel for the third respondent submitted that the Web\n\n                     serial is in fact an authorised adaptation and fictionalized and dramatized\n\n                     version of the book titled &quot;The Queen&quot; authored by Anita Sivakumaran and\n\n                     published/released on 28.04.2017. The web-series is inspired by true events\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                     Page No.30/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">\f                                                                                    O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     and is a dramatization and fictional recreation of true events. The web-\n\n                     series also carries a &quot;disclaimer&quot; to the effect that the same is not a\n\n                     biography of any character. So far, no action had been initiated by the\n\n                     appellant/plaintiff, inspite of the fact that the book was in the public domain\n\n                     for over three years. Moreover, the &quot;third party interest&quot; had been created in\n\n                     the web series titled &quot;Queen&quot; (in India and internationally) by the producer\n\n                     of the Web Series. The alleged right sought to be enforced by the present\n\n                     appeal is the &quot;posthumous right of privacy&quot; to protect the dignity and legacy\n\n                     of the appellant&#x27;s aunt. It is settled proposition of law that the right of\n\n                     privacy of an individual extinguishes with the human being. Accordingly,\n\n                     any action to exercise the &quot;posthumous right of privacy&quot; is not maintainable.\n\n                     To buttress this submission, reliance was placed on the judgment of the\n\n                     Supreme Court in the case of K.S.Puttaswamy and another vs. union of\n\n                     India and others, reported in 2017 (10) SCC 1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">                               27. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the third respondent\n\n                     further submitted that, though the appellant/plaintiff claimed that she had a\n\n                     close relationship with Dr.J.Jayalalitha, former Chief Minister, it is an\n\n                     admitted position that the appellant/plaintiff was not even in contact with\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                     Page No.31/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">\f                                                                                   O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     the former Chief Minister during her life time and has in fact herself written\n\n                     an article in this regard. By her own admission, the appellant got estranged\n\n                     from her aunt. In fact, &quot;right of privacy&quot; is not an &quot;alienable right&quot; and it\n\n                     cannot be inherited. In support of this contention, he relied ont he judgment\n\n                     in The Managing Director, Makkal Tholai Thodarpu Kuhumam\n\n                     Limited (mentioned supra).        The learned counsel also relied on the\n\n                     judgment reported in the case of Balakrishnanv s. R.

The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the third respondent\n\n                     also submitted that there is no infirmity in the order passed by the learned\n\n                     Single Judge and it is not liable to be interfered with. He contended that it\n\n                     is a settled proposition of law that an appellate Court would not interfere\n\n                     with the exercise of discretionary power by the Court of first instance,\n\n                     except where such discretion has been shown to be exercised arbitrarily,\n\n                     capriciously or perversely or where the Court had ignored the settled\n\n                     proposition of law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunction. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_69\">In\n\n                     this regard, he placed reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_15\">Wander\n\n                     Limited and another Vs.

After the death of a person, the\n\n                     reputation earned cannot be inherited like a movable or immovable property\n\n                     by his or her legal heirs.

Therefore, we are of the opinion that &quot;posthumous right&quot; is not an\n\n                     &quot;alienable right&quot; and the appellant/plaintiff is not entitled for an injunction\n\n                     on the ground that the &quot;posthumous right&quot; of her aunt is sought to be sullied\n\n                     by the respondents/defendants by reason of the release of the film titled as\n\n                     &quot;Thalaivi&quot;. Further, the movie in question is yet to be released. Even prior\n\n                     to that, the appellant/plaintiff is not entitled to seek for an injunction on the\n\n                     ground that her aunt has been depicted in the movie very badly and thereby\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                     Page No.39/44</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">\f                                                                                     O.S.A.No.75 of 2020</span>\n\n                     her image and reputation is attempted to be brought down.
