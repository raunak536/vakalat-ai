FACTS OF THE CASE:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">2.   It is the case of prosecution that, P.W.1-Nagesh, brother\n\nof victim-deceased Rathnamma, filed complaint-Ex.P.1 dated\n\n25.06.2015,    stating      that,    he        is    permanent       resident     of\n\nJavanahalli, Kasaba Hobli, Sira Taluk, Tumakuru District.\n\nRangappa and Rangamma are his parents. He is the elder son\n\nin the family. His elder sister-Lalitha is married. His younger\n\nsister-Rathnamma/victim,            aged       21     years,      completed      her\n\nBachelor Degree in Arts from Badavanahalli Government\n\nCollege.   She had joined computer classes in Badavanahalli.\n\nShe used to return home from computer class at 3.30 pm. As\n\nusual, on 25.06.2015, Rathnamma went to computer class at\n\n10.30 am.     Till evening she did not return home.                       He was\n\nunder the impression that she might have gone to her friends\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 4</span>\n\n\n\n\nhouse. When he was working in the village Dairy, around 6.15\n\npm, people who came to Dairy were talking among themselves\n\nthat some one has murdered a girl by slitting her neck in\n\nDoddahalla situated by the          side   of road   running from\n\nGulagenahalli to Javanahalli.   He along with his uncle&#x27;s son-\n\nPrasanna Kumar went to spot and saw that the girl who was\n\nmurdered was none other than his sister and noticed that\n\nsome miscreants had thrown the chutidar pant, underwear\n\nand veil worn by his sister-Rathnamma on the bush and had\n\nraped her. Under the fear that she may reveal the incident,\n\nthey have murdered her by poking her neck with some\n\nweapon, and had thrown the school bag nearby, which she\n\nused to carry every day. The incident might have happened\n\nbetween 3.00    pm to 5.00 pm.              Therefore, prayed to\n\napprehend the accused and punish in accordance with law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.   The jurisdictional police registered a case in Crime No.\n\n149/2015, drawn the mahazar as per Ex.P.2 and seized\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      5</span>\n\n\n\n\nM.Os.1 to 9, investigated the matter and apprehended the\n\naccused.        Later, recorded the voluntary statement of the\n\naccused as per Ex.P.21, and recovered M.Os.10 to 14.\n\nThereafter, Investigating Officer filed the Charge Sheet.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">4.      After    taking    cognizance      of    the    offence,   learned\n\nMagistrate committed the matter to the learned Sessions\n\nJudge, who, after hearing learned Public Prosecutor and the\n\nlearned defence counsel, framed Charge against accused for\n\nthe offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_5\">376</a> of Indian\n\nPenal Code, read over the same to accused in the language\n\nknown to him who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.      In order to prove its case, prosecution, in all, examined\n\n15   witnesses      as    P.Ws.1   to     15    and    produced    material\n\ndocuments Exs.P.1 to P.27 and material objects, M.Os.1 to 14.\n\nAfter    completion       of   evidence    of   prosecution    witnesses,\n\nstatement of accused as contemplated under the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 313</a> Code of Criminal Procedure was recorded.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        6</span>\n\n\n\n\nAccused        denied    all   incriminating     circumstances        adduced\n\nagainst him by prosecution witnesses, however, did not chose\n\nto adduce any defence evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">6.

Whether the prosecution proves beyond all\n                  reasonable doubt that, on the above said\n                  date, time and place the accused after\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                   7</span>\n\n\n\n\n               having committed the murder of the sister\n               of the complainant, committed rape on her\n               and   thereby      committed        an     offence\n               punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 376</a> of Indian\n               Penal Code?&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">7.   The learned Sessions Judge, considering both oral and\n\ndocumentary evidence on record, recorded a finding that the\n\nprosecution    proved    beyond       reasonable     doubt    that   on\n\n25.06.2015, at 3.00 pm, when the complainant&#x27;s sister was\n\nreturning home after attending computer class on the road\n\nleading from Borasandra to Mogadi, near Doddahalla, accused\n\nheld her, closed her mouth and dragged her to a near by bush\n\nof Jali plants, cut her neck and murdered her and thereby\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> of Indian\n\nPenal Code, and further that, after committing murder,\n\naccused committed rape on her and thereby committed an\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 376</a> of Indian Penal Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Accordingly,   learned   Sessions      Judge,   by      the   impugned\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence, convicted the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                8</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code and sentenced him to undergo rigorous\n\nimprisonment for life and to pay fine of Rs.50,000/- in default,\n\nto undergo simple imprisonment for a period of two years, and\n\nconvicted him for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 376</a> of\n\nIndian Penal Code and sentenced him to undergo rigorous\n\nimprisonment for a period of ten years and to pay fine of\n\nRs.25,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a\n\nperiod of one year.    Hence, present appeal is filed by the\n\nappellant/accused.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">8.   We have heard learned counsel for parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      II.   ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY LEARNED COUNSEL\n                        FOR APPELLANT\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">9.   Sri C.H.Hanumantharaya, learned counsel along with Ms\n\nAbhinaya K and Sri K.V.Manoj, learned counsel for appellant/\n\naccused contended with vehemence that impugned judgment\n\nof conviction and order of sentence convicting the accused for\n\nthe offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_14\">376</a> of Indian\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                               9</span>\n\n\n\n\nPenal Code is erroneous and contrary to material on record,\n\nand therefore, the same cannot be sustained and liable to be\n\nset-aside.   He further contended that though Ex.P.1 -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">complaint was lodged on the date of incident i.e., on\n\n25.06.2015 against unknown persons, accused was arrested\n\non 02.07.2015 after lapse of 07 days.      There is delay in\n\narresting the accused. Thereby, the involvement of accused in\n\nhomicidal death of deceased is doubtful.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">10.   Learned counsel further contended that, entire case of\n\nprosecution is based on the circumstantial evidence and there\n\nare no eye witnesses to the incident. The circumstances from\n\nwhich an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be\n\ncogently and firmly established and those circumstances\n\nshould be of definite tendency unerringly pointing towards\n\nguilt of accused.   The circumstances, taken cumulatively,\n\nshould form a chain, so as to complete that there is no escape\n\nfrom conclusion that with all human probability the crime was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                               10</span>\n\n\n\n\ncommitted by accused and none else.         The circumstantial\n\nevidence, in order to sustain conviction, must be complete and\n\nincapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of\n\nthe guilt of accused and such evidence should not only be\n\nconsistent with the guilt of accused but should be inconsistent\n\nwith his innocence.   Learned counsel contended that, in the\n\npresent case, no such circumstances are proved against\n\naccused   by   prosecution   beyond   reasonable   doubt   and\n\ntherefore, sought to set-aside the impugned judgment of\n\nconviction and order of sentence passed by the learned\n\nSessions Judge.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">11.   Learned counsel further contended that the Charge\n\nframed is that the accused first committed the murder of the\n\ndeceased by cutting her throat so as to attract the provisions\n\nof offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 302</a> of Indian Penal Code\n\nand thereafter, committed rape on the dead body, so as to\n\nattract the offence punishable under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/668722/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   11</span></a>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_17\">376</a> Indian Penal Code.         There are no eye witnesses to the\n\nincident, there is no last seen theory and there is no motive\n\nfor murder of deceased by accused and rape on the dead\n\nbody. Therefore, that does not amounts to an offence, in view\n\nof provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">Thereby, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 376</a> would not attract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">Therefore, learned Sessions Judge is not justified in convicting\n\naccused for the offences made out in the Charge.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">12.    Learned counsel further contended that, P.W.1 who is\n\nthe brother of deceased Rathnamma deposed about lodging of\n\ncomplaint as per Ex.P.1.       He does not implicate any person\n\nincluding accused.      The complaint is against an unknown\n\nperson.   P.Ws.2 to 5, said to be the persons who have last\n\nseen    the   accused   have    turned   hostile   to   the   case   of\n\nprosecution.    P.W.6-Honnappa, speaks about spot mahazar-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">Ex.P.2, but the same does not implicate any one. He further\n\ncontended that, P.W.7-Manjunatha, Revenue Inspector speaks\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 12</span>\n\n\n\n\nabout spot mahazar-Ex.P.9, recovery of M.Os.10 to 13 i.e.,\n\nunderwear, half sleeve shirt, a towel and a knife, from the\n\nhouse of accused. The said recovery has not been duly proved\n\nand have been totally disproved in the cross-examination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">Only on the basis of voluntary statement of the accused, in\n\nthe absence of any other evidence, the learned Sessions Judge\n\nought not to have convicted the accused for the offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_21\">376</a> of the Indian Penal\n\nCode.   Learned counsel for appellant further contended that\n\nevidence of Dr.Ranganatha-P.W.8, who examined the accused\n\nand issued Ex.P.11-wound certificate alone cannot be held to\n\nhave any impact on the case of prosecution.       P.W.9-Dr.Anil\n\nKumar, psychiatrist who examined the mental status of\n\naccused issued the report as per Ex.P.12. The said evidence\n\nclearly depicts that intelligence of accused is below normal and\n\nother aspect of opinion regarding anti social disorder is based\n\non input given to the doctor by the police and not his own\n\nopinion.       He     further    contended     that,   P.W.10-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    13</span>\n\n\n\n\nDr.S.Rudramurthy,      deposed           regarding    post     mortem\n\nexamination conducted on the body of deceased and issued\n\nEx.P.8-post mortem report opining that cause of death was\n\ndue to asphyxia as a result of compression of neck.               It is\n\nfurther stated that signs of recent sexual intercourse is\n\npresent, however, pending chemical analysis report. P.W.11-\n\nC.Kotresh, Police Inspector who received the complaint-Ex.P.1,\n\nregistered    FIR-Ex.P.20.              P.W.12-Chidananda,      Village\n\nAccountant is witness to Ex.P.9-spot mahazar, which is not\n\nduly proved. His evidence is not trustworthy. Their evidence\n\ndoes not help the prosecution to prove the involvement of\n\naccused in the offence.      Learned counsel further contended\n\nthat   defective   investigation        conducted    by   Investigation\n\nOfficers goes to the root of the matter and shakes the\n\nsubstratum of the case of prosecution. The conclusion arrived\n\nat by learned Sessions Judge that blood stains found on the\n\ntowel of the accused matches with the blood group of\n\ndeceased, is not based on any cogent evidence.               Therefore,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      14</span>\n\n\n\n\nfalse    implication   of   accused       in   the   offence    cannot   be\n\nsustained.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">13.     Learned counsel further contended that, conviction based\n\non the recovery made at the instance of accused and relying\n\non his voluntary statement, is impermissible, in view of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.               He also referred to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1289712/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 57(13)</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.

The same is supported by the evidence of P.Ws.7\n\nand 12- mahazar witnesses.

Learned SPP-I further contended that accused has not\n\nexplained as to how he sustained the aforesaid injuries and\n\nhas not cross-examined P.W.8-doctor.       The post-mortem\n\nreport -Ex.P.8 clearly depicts that there were 14 external\n\ninjuries on the dead body of victim-Rathnamma.      Thereby,\n\nprosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused\n\nis not only involved in the homicidal death of Rathnamma, but\n\nalso raped on the dead body of Rathnamma.      Learned SPP-I\n\nfurther contended that, provisions of Section 375(a) and (c),\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_33\">Indian Penal Code</a>, i.e., &quot;sexual offences&quot; was amended\n\nby Act 43 of 1983 with effect from 25.12.1983. Thereby, the\n\nrape on dead body attracts sexual offences and is punishable\n\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 376</a> of Indian Penal Code and\n\nthus, learned Sessions Judge is justified in convicting the\n\naccused for the offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 302</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_36\">376</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                    21</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">18.

Now, by Act 43 of 1983 w.e.f.\n\n25.12.1983 it is amended as &quot;Sexual Offences&quot;.

This Court, by the Order dated 24.03.2023 appointed Sri\n\nNithin Ramesh as amicus curiae to assist the court, who filed\n\nnotes on &#x27;necrophilia&#x27; and would submit that, definition of\n\n&#x27;person&#x27; as provided under <a href=\"/doc/157307482/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 3(42)</a> of the General\n\nClauses Act, includes a body of individuals, a company or a\n\ngroup of individuals whether it is incorporated or not.      The\n\ndefinition of &#x27;person&#x27; as contained in <a href=\"/doc/668722/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 11</a> of Indian Penal\n\nCode includes any company or Association or body of persons,\n\nwhether incorporated or not. Further, under <a href=\"/doc/1980183/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 10</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code, the word &#x27;man&#x27; denotes a male human\n\nbeing of any age, and &#x27;woman&#x27;, denotes a female human being\n\nof any age.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"498126\" id=\"span_28\">21.   Learned amicus curiae further contended that, although\n\nIndian Criminal Laws do not recognize &#x27;necrophilia&#x27; as a crime\n\nin itself, the human rights after death of a person has gained\n\nrecognition.   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, not only\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                23</span>\n\n\n\n\nrecognizes a right to life with dignity and respect, but also\n\ninclude the right to die in a dignified manner and certain rights\n\nof treatment after death, burial etc., as held by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court      in the case of <a href=\"/doc/498126/\" id=\"a_43\">Parmanand Kataria vs.\n\nUnion of India</a> reported in (1989)4 SCC 286 wherein, it is\n\nrecognized that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a> provides the right to life, fair\n\ntreatment and dignity, and these rights extend not only to the\n\nperson alive, but also to their dead bodies.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">22.   He further contended that, <a href=\"/doc/15048/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 297</a> of the Indian\n\nPenal Code remotely covers the act of &#x27;necrophilia&#x27; by stating\n\nthat any person who, &quot;commits any trespass in any place of\n\nworship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart\n\nfrom the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for\n\nthe remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human\n\ncorpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for\n\nthe performance of funeral ceremonies&quot;. This cannot, in itself\n\nsimply be understood as directly addressing or penalizing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                 24</span>\n\n\n\n\n&#x27;necrophilia&#x27;.   Yet, this is the closest penalty that obtains in\n\nIndian Criminal Law. The chapter titles in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_46\">Indian Penal Code</a>\n\ncannot restrict the meaning of the wordings of the specific\n\npenal provisions covered thereunder. In other words, it may\n\nbe argued that as long as the indignity to human corpse is\n\nproved, the offence is constituted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">23.   Learned amicus curiae further contended that, to a\n\nlimited extent, Section 499, Explanation I of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_47\">Indian Penal\n\nCode</a>, provides that defamation of a deceased person can be\n\nan offence, but on closure scrutiny it becomes clear that infact\n\nit is the hurting of feelings of deceased&#x27;s family. That is the\n\nfocus of the penal provision and not the indignity to the dead\n\nbody or person as such.       Further, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_48\">Section\n\n377</a> of the Indian Penal Code begins with the expression\n\n&quot;whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order\n\nof nature with any man, woman or animal...&quot;          Thereby, the\n\nquestion remains whether &#x27;man&#x27; and &#x27;woman&#x27; can include\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                    25</span>\n\n\n\n\n&#x27;dead&#x27;. No doubt, the words &#x27;man&#x27; and &#x27;woman&#x27; defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980183/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 10</a> of the Indian Penal Code, refers to an individual of\n\nthe male or female gender irrespective of age. But as plainly\n\nunderstood &#x27;age&#x27; herein refers to the age concerning the living\n\nperson and not of the dead.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">24.    Learned amicus curiae further contended that, in United\n\nKingdom, Section 70 of the Sexual Offences Act, 2003, makes\n\nit    an   offence   for   a   person   who   intentionally   sexually\n\npenetrates, knowingly or recklessly, any part of his body into\n\nany part of a dead person, and the person guilty of an offence,\n\non conviction on indictment is liable to be sentenced to\n\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.              Section\n\n182 of Criminal Code of Canada, 1985 makes &#x27;necrophilia&#x27;\n\npunishable with imprisonment for a term of not more than five\n\nyears.     <a href=\"/doc/39478395/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 150</a> of Crimes Act, 1961, of New Zealand\n\nprescribes punishment for two years to any person doing any\n\nact on the corpse, whether buried or unburied, to harm its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                 26</span>\n\n\n\n\ndignity. Lastly, he contended that <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 14</a> of the Criminal\n\nLaw (sexual offences and related matters) amendment Act,\n\n2007, of South Africa, prohibits &#x27;necrophilia&#x27;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">                 V.

Accused   was    arrested    on\n\n02.07.2015 i.e., after seven days of the incident.                 The\n\nprosecution examined P.Ws.2, 3, 4 and 5, as last seen\n\nwitnesses.    The said witnesses have stated that they have\n\nseen accused prior to the commission of offence at the spot\n\ni.e., near the land of one Sarojamma near Doddahalla.              But\n\nthey turned hostile to the case of prosecution. Thereby, last\n\nseen theory set up by prosecution is not proved.

Accused cannot be convicted based on the\n\nrecovery made at his instance and based on his voluntary\n\nstatement, in view of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, as\n\npanch witnesses failed to support case of prosecution and no\n\nindependent witnesses have supported case of prosecution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">31.

P.W.10-doctor further deposed that, he\n\nreceived a requisition along with sealed packet from Police\n\nInspector of Sira Police Station for examination of weapon and\n\nto furnish his opinion.     The sealed packet contained one\n\nmetallic knife like weapon made of hacksaw blade piece\n\nmeasuring 11 cm in length and 1 cm in width with one end\n\nsemi circular in shape and blunt with rough one. One edge of\n\nthe weapon was in zig zag pattern and rough and the other\n\nedge was sharp at one half and blunt on other half. Surface of\n\nthe weapon showed reddish brown stains at places. He opined\n\nthat injuries 5 and 6 referred to in Ex.P.8 and injury to trachea\n\nare possible by the type of weapon examined and death due\n\nto this injury, in this case, is not possible.        The evidence of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                 43</span>\n\n\n\n\ndoctor and Ex.P.8-post mortem report clearly depicts the\n\nhomicidal death of deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">34.   Since there are no eye witnesses to the incident, and\n\nhomicidal death is proved, it is for the prosecution to prove\n\nthat accused is involved in homicidal death of deceased. It is\n\nrelevant to state at this stage that the accused was arrested\n\non 02.07.2015.      He was produced before P.W.8-Doctor for\n\nmedical examination on 3.7.2015 at 2.45 pm.            The doctor\n\nissued wound certificate as per Ex.P-11 and same was\n\nrecorded in MLC register of the hospital.          In the cross-\n\nexamination, P.W.8 deposed that accused may not be well\n\nbuilt, but he is moderately built.     He denied the suggestion\n\nthat accused is not even moderately built. He deposed that a\n\nperson aged about 20 years having height of 153 cms and 40\n\nkgs cannot be termed as moderately built, under medical\n\nscience. He further deposed that in the casualty ward of the\n\nhospital,   one   nurse   and   an   attendant   are   working   as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                 44</span>\n\n\n\n\nsupportive staff and denied the suggestion that if a patient is\n\nbrought to the hospital, normally the supportive staff in the\n\nform of nurse will examine the patient and record the findings\n\nand the medical officer mechanically signs the same.          He\n\nfurther   denied   the   suggestion   that   when   accused   was\n\nexamined, MLC was not at all recorded and only while coming\n\nto court for giving evidence, it was created. He further denied\n\nthe suggestion that, in active connivance and collusion with\n\nthe Investigating Officer, he issued false medical certificate as\n\nper Ex.P.11. He also denied the suggestion that he has not at\n\nall examined the accused person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">35.   P.W.9-Dr.Anil Kumar, deposed that on 06.07.2015 he\n\nreceived requisition from police to examine the mental status\n\nof accused-Rangaraju. When he examined, accused was not\n\nanswering most of his questions.        Therefore, he collected\n\ncollateral information from parents and relatives.       He also\n\ncollected some information from police who accompanied the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                     45</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused.    As per the information provided by the father of\n\naccused, accused&#x27;s development achievement was not in\n\naccordance with age, it was delayed. His social skill was also\n\nnot   in   accordance       with   the    age    group      of    20    years.\n\nAcademically    also,   accused      was     not    good         as   per   the\n\ninformation provided, and he had studied upto 8th standard.\n\nConsidering the said aspects, he opined that his intelligence is\n\nborder line. It is further deposed that, as per the information\n\nreceived, accused was not involved in any anti social activities\n\nsuch as stealing, lying etc.,            But, police gave a different\n\nversion    stating   that    accused      was     earlier   suspected        of\n\nmolestation and attempt to rape.                 Only on the basis of\n\ninformation given by police, he diagnosed that accused has\n\ngot anti social personality disorder.           A person having less IQ\n\nlevel does not respond to the situations. He further deposed\n\nthat after examining the accused, he issued a certificate as per\n\nEx.P.12 stating that accused is suffering from border line\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                46</span>\n\n\n\n\nintelligence and antisocial personality disorder.    Admittedly,\n\nP.W.9 has not been cross-examined by the defense.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45763796\" id=\"span_55\">36.   In the cross examination of any of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses, it has not been elicited that accused is of unsound\n\nmind or was incapable of knowing the nature of the act that he\n\nis doing, what is right or what is wrong.           Even in the\n\nstatement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, accused has not offered any such explanation.\n\nAlso he has not stated as to how he sustained injuries.\n\nThereby, an adverse inference has to be drawn against\n\naccused.    Our view is fortified by the dictum of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/45763796/\" id=\"a_66\">Prahlad vs. State of\n\nRajasthan</a> reported in (2019)14 SCC 438, wherein, at\n\nparagraph 11, it is held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      11.

Also,\n      no explanation is there as to what happened after\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                47</span>\n\n\n\n\n      getting the chocolates for the victim. The silence on\n      the part of the accused, in such a matter wherein he\n      is expected to come out with an explanation, leads\n      to an adverse against the accused.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">37.   In the cross-examination of P.W.8-Dr.Ranganatha, there\n\nis no whisper or suggestion as to how accused sustained six\n\nexternal injuries on his body.      P.W.13-Ramakrsihna, Police\n\nInspector, in his evidence deposed that on the information\n\nreceived about the offence, he instructed P.W.11 to register\n\ncase and secure dog squad and finger print experts, and\n\nvisited the spot on the same day, drawn panchanama as per\n\nEx.P.2, seized M.Os.1 to 9, shifted the body to District Hospital\n\nand conducted    inquest mahazar as per Ex.P.7, handed over\n\nthe body to the doctor for examination and deputed staff to\n\napprehend the accused.     On 02.07.2015, at about 9.00 pm\n\naccused was arrested, enquiry was made and his voluntary\n\nstatement was recorded.     Later, he secured P.Ws.7 and 12,\n\nvisited the spot, and conducted spot mahazar. At the instance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                 48</span>\n\n\n\n\nof accused, M.O-10, underwear, M.O.11-shirt, M.O.12-towel,\n\nM.O.13 and 14 hacksaw blade were recovered from the house\n\nof accused.     As per Ex.P.10 mahazar was drawn, conducted\n\nseizure panchanama and produced the same before medical\n\nofficer for examination. Further investigation was handed over\n\nto Sri Gopalakrishna-P.W.14 who received the FSL report as\n\nper Ex.P.17 and handed over to P.W.13-Ramakrishna, Police\n\nInspector.     After investigation , P.W.15-Lakshmaiah filed\n\ncharge sheet. Evidence of P.W.14 and P.W.15- Investigation\n\nOfficers is not seriously challenged.     The blood sample of\n\naccused was taken for DNA profiling. Ex.P.17 is the FSL report\n\nwhich depicts that blood stains were detected on item No.4-\n\nblood stain soil, item No.6 chudidar top and item No.7-\n\nchudidar petticoat.     They are marked as M.Os-5, 6 and 8.\n\nBlood group is recorded as human blood B group in the report-\n\nEx.P.17.     Ex.P.19 is another FSL report obtained in respect of\n\nthe items recovered at the instance of accused. Item No.1 is\n\none short, item No.2 is one shirt, item No.3 is one towel, item\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                49</span>\n\n\n\n\nNo.4 is one hacksaw blade, item No.5 is swab from right and\n\nleft foot, item No.6 is nails from right and left great toe, item\n\nNo.7 is pubic hairs and item No.8 is penile swab. In Ex.P.19,\n\nthe Scientific Office has opined that presence of blood stain\n\nwas detected in item Nos.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; presence of\n\nepithelial cells was not detected in item Nos.7 and 8; blood\n\nstain in item No.3 was of human origin and &#x27;B&#x27; group; and\n\nblood stains in item Nos.1,2,4,5 and 6 were disintegrated.\n\nThe evidence on record clearly depicts that item No.3-towel of\n\nthe accused was stained with human blood B group.           This\n\ncorresponds with blood stains found on item Nos.4,6 and 7\n\ni.e., blood stained soil, chudidar top and chudidar petticoat\n\nbelonging to the victim, as is evident from Ex.P.17. The towel\n\nof the accused is marked as M.O.12 and was recovered at the\n\ninstance of accused, in the presence of P.Ws.7, 12 and 13 who\n\nsupported case of prosecution and thereby, recovery of towel\n\nis established. Thereby it is for the accused to explain as to\n\nhow his towel recovered from his residence was stained with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                               50</span>\n\n\n\n\n&#x27;B&#x27; group human blood.      But accused has not offered any\n\nexplanation either in the statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_68\">Section\n\n313</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure or has not elicited any\n\ninformation   from   the   cross-examination   of   prosecution\n\nwitnesses.    This is the strongest circumstance appearing\n\nagainst accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">38.   Ex.P.25-DNA profiling report of deceased and accused\n\ndepicts that blood stains found on underwear, chudidar,\n\npetticoat, and pubic hair of deceased pertain to human origin\n\nand female sex and is B group blood.     Thereby this clearly\n\nestablishes that clothes of deceased were stained with her own\n\nblood and it was B group. The same blood group was found\n\non towel belonging to accused which was recovered at the\n\ninstance of accused himself. The accused has not offered any\n\nexplanation as to how the blood of deceased was found on\n\nM.O.12-towel recovered from his house at his instance. It is\n\nalso not in dispute that M.O.12 was recovered by P.W.13 at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                               51</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe instance of accused in the presence of P.WS.7 and 12 who\n\nfully supported case of prosecution. The DNA profile does not\n\nestablish blood group of accused and it is entirely different.\n\nAnd therefore, it is for the accused to explain as to under what\n\ncircumstances his towel was stained with human blood &#x27;B&#x27;\n\ngroup and as to how he sustained injuries on his body. But,\n\nthe entire case of accused is total denial.   No doubt, under\n\nEx.P.27, the Certified Forensic Odontologist has opined that,\n\nany conclusion on the degree of certainty of the link between\n\nthe bite mark and the accused person&#x27;s teeth cannot be made\n\ndue to insufficient quality of the bite mark photograph in\n\nterms of lack of scale in the photograph, thereby preventing a\n\n1:1 comparison, or &#x27;life size&#x27; comparison.     Hence, there is\n\ninsufficient quality of evidence to make any statement of\n\nrelationship of the bite mark to the suspected biter&#x27;s teeth.\n\nTherefore, it is inconclusive whether the teeth belonging to the\n\naccused person named Rangaraju has caused the bite mark on\n\nthe deceased female subject Ratnamma.         Thereby, due to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                52</span>\n\n\n\n\ninsufficient quality of evidence, the Odontologist is unable to\n\narrive at a conclusion.   However, same can be ignored since\n\nother circumstances i.e., DNA profiling coupled with FSL report\n\nclearly establish that on the towel belonging to accused, blood\n\nstains of deceased were traced. The injuries found on body of\n\naccused are corresponding to date of offence and the accused\n\nhas not given explanation regarding injuries found on his\n\nbody.      This is also another strong circumstance against\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">39.   This Court is aware that it is for the prosecution to prove\n\nits case beyond reasonable doubt and establish that accused is\n\ninvolved in the homicidal death of deceased, when there are\n\nno eye witnesses and entire case is based on circumstantial\n\nevidence. it cannot be thrown out and conviction under\n\ncircumstantial evidence is permissible.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">40.   In the present case, though P.Ws.2,3,4 and 5 last seen\n\ntheory witnesses have stated that prior to the unfortunate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                53</span>\n\n\n\n\nincident, accused was at the spot, they have turned hostile.\n\nBut P.W.7 and P.W.11 have clearly deposed about spot\n\npanchanama Ex.P.9 and recovery of M.Os 1 to 14 at the\n\ninstance of accused.      The recovery of the belongings of\n\naccused is established and blood stains were found on towel of\n\naccused and accused also sustained injuries during the\n\nincident which is also the evidence of P.W.8 and material\n\ndocument wound certificate- Ex.P.11.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15339999\" id=\"span_63\">41.   Thereby, circumstances stated supra i.e., recovery of\n\nblood stained weapon and clothes from the house of accused\n\nand non explanation of incriminating circumstances by the\n\naccused points towards the accused. Our view is fortified by\n\nthe dictum of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/15339999/\" id=\"a_69\">Ganga\n\nBai vs. State of Rajasthan</a> reported in (2016)15 SCC 645,\n\nwherein, at paragraph 11, 12, 13 and 14 it is held as under:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">      &quot;11.

Since the factual background, as such, is\nalso explained therein, we shall extract the relevant\nparagraph as such: (SCC pp. 730-31, para 27)\n\n\n        &quot;27. The other submission made on behalf\n        of the appellants was with reference to the\n        human blood found on the clothes worn by\n        A-1 and A-4. It was contended that the\n        prosecution failed to satisfactorily establish\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                           55</span>\n\n\n\n\nthrough any independent evidence about\nthe bloodstains found on the clothes of A-1,\nas well as the appellant in Crl.

The\nrelevant part of it reads as under:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">     &#x27;63.    In     the    present        case,    the\n     evidence       of    API     Padwal     in    this\n     respect is not seriously challenged\n     or shattered. After all the accused\n     were arrested under panchnama and\n     at the time of arrest, panchnama of\n     accused Nana bloodstained clothes\n     were seized. It is not in any way\n     contended or for that matter even\n     whispered that IO API Padwal was\n     having       any     rancour    against       the\n     accused or he was motivated or\n     interested in one-sided investigation\n     with the sole object of implicating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                    56</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe accused. As a matter of fact, the\ninvestigation in this case appears to\nbe    totally     impartial.     When     it\ntranspired      that    two    accused   by\nname Sandeep            and Ganesh, the\njuvenile delinquent have not taken\npart in the assault, their names were\ndeleted from the prosecution case\nby filing report under <a href=\"/doc/481610/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 169</a>\nCrPC.      Therefore,          here      the\ninvestigation           has      proceeded\nimpartially and it is also not even for\nthe sake of it, is suggested to API\nPadwal that, no such bloodstained\nclothes were recovered from the\naccused Nana, moreover, as per the\nsettled position of law, there is no\npresumption in law that a police\nofficer   acts    dishonestly     and    his\nevidence     cannot      be   acted   upon.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">Therefore, here the evidence of API\nPadwal is sufficient to prove the\nrecovery of the bloodstained clothes\nof the accused. His evidence also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                      57</span>\n\n\n\n\ngoes to prove that all these articles,\nbloodstained clothes, etc. were sent\nto CA and as per the CA report, Ext.</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">61, the blood was detected on the\nclothes   of    the        accused      and      the\ndeceased and this blood was human\nblood.... In the present case, though\nthe CA report, Ext. 61 shows that\nthe said human blood was of Group\nB, CA report, Ext. 62 about the\nblood sample of the accused states\nthat the blood group could not be\nascertained         as     the    results     were\ninconclusive, moreover, there is no\nCA of the blood sample of the\ndeceased       to    prove        that he        was\nhaving Blood Group B. However, the\nfact   remains           that    the    stains    of\nhuman blood were found on the\nclothes of accused Nana and he has\nnot explained how these bloodstains\nwere on his clothes and therefore,\nas observed in this authority, it\nbecomes             one          more       highly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                           58</span>\n\n\n\n\n          incriminating circumstance against\n          the accused.&#x27;\n\n\nIn fact, as rightly noted by the trial court, it was for\nthe appellants to have explained as to how the\nclothes worn by them contained human blood. In\nSection   313   questioning,    no   explanation    was\nforthcoming     from   the     appellants.   In    these\ncircumstances, the said contention also does not\nmerit any consideration.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">13. The last contention is on parity. It is submitted\nthat Udai Lal, whose clothes were duly recovered,\nalso contained stains of human blood, for which\nalso, there was no explanation and he had also\ngiven disclosure on the recovery of weapon of\noffence. Though we find that the acquittal made by\nthe High Court could require a revisit, in view of the\nfact that there is no appeal by the State against the\nacquittal of Udai Lal and that the incident is of the\nyear 1999, we do not propose to pursue the matter\nas against Udai Lal. However, we may state that\nonly because Udai Lal was acquitted, in view of the\nclinching evidence on the involvement of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                59</span>\n\n\n\n\n      appellant in the offences of murder and destruction\n      of evidence charged against her, she is not entitled\n      for a similar treatment as that of Udai Lal. Merely\n      because one or more of those charged with the\n      substantial offences and also charged under <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_73\">Section\n      34</a> IPC have been acquitted, the one in the group\n      who shared the common intention, in whose case\n      there is conclusive evidence of direct involvement,\n      cannot claim parity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">      14.

Dr.Modi, in his book &quot;The Medical Jurisprudence and\n\nToxicology&quot; has defined Legal Status of Dead as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">  &quot;The personality of a human being may be said to\n  commence existence on birth and cease to exist at\n  death. The dead are no longer persons in the yes of law.\n  Their legal personality comes to an end at their death\n  and they are destitute of rights and liabilities. They have\n  no rights because they have no interests. Yet, although\n  all the rights of a human being perish with him, the law,\n  without conferring rights upon the dead, does in some\n  degree recognise and takes into account his desires and\n  interests. There are three things in respect of which the\n  anxieties of living men extend beyond the period of their\n  deaths and which law takes notice of.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      Firstly, with respect to a person&#x27;s body: Law deems\n      that a living man is interested in the treatment to\n      be awarded to his own dead body. Law secures his\n      desire through criminal law which makes it an\n      offence to violate the grave.&quot; Every dead body has\n      a right to decent burial. Secondly, the reputation of\n      the dead receives some degree of protection from\n      criminal law in that it would be defamation to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                  66</span>\n\n\n\n\n      impute anything to a dead person, if the imputation\n      would harm the reputation of that person if living,\n      and is intended to be hurtful to the feelings of his\n      family or other near relatives. A libel upon a dead\n      man will be punished by law. Thirdly, the most\n      important matter in which the desires of dead man\n      are allowed by law to regulate the actions of the\n      living is that of testamentary succession. Many\n      years after his death his wishes continue to\n      regulate   and    determine     the   disposition    and\n      enjoyment of the property, which he owned while\n      living.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"284216\" id=\"span_77\">50.   The Division Bench of Kerala High Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/284216/\" id=\"a_89\">Kozhipalliyalil Muhammad vs. State</a> reported in 1974\n\nCrl.LJ 204, at para 6 held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      &quot;6. The reasons which weighed with the learned\n      Sessions Judge to acquit the appellant of the offence\n      of murder under Section 302, I. P. C. hold good in\n      acquitting the appellant for the offence of robbery\n      under Section 394. I. P. C. also. The ingredients of the\n      offence of theft shall be present in the offence of\n      robbery. Before theft can amount to robbery the\n      offender must have voluntarily caused or attempted to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                 67</span>\n\n\n\n\ncause to any person death or hurt or wrongful\nrestraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt or\nof instant wrongful restraint. The second ingredient\nnecessary to constitute robbery is that his act must be\nin   order to     the    committing   of   the    theft or in\ncommitting theft in carrying away or attempting to\ncarry away the property obtained by theft. The third\ningredient   is   that    the   offender   must    voluntarily\nattempt to cause to any person hurt for that end in\nview. Nothing of that has been proved in this case.\nThe evidence of P. W. 16, Assistant Surgeon, was that\nthe chopping off of the ear of the victim might be\nbefore or after death. The definite case of the\nprosecution was, so far as it was revealed from the\ncharge as well as from the evidence, that the ears of\nthe victim were chopped off in order to commit theft.\nIn the nature of the evidence adduced on behalf of the\nprosecution, especially that of P. W. 16, it could not be\nsaid that the ears of the victim had been chopped off\nbefore her death. In that case no conviction can be\nheld under Section 394 of the I. P. C. because removal\nof ornaments from the body of the victim after causing\nher death cannot amount to robbery because robbery\nis theft by force and theft is taking away of movables\nout of the possession of a person. But removing\nornaments from a dead body is not taking property\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                   68</span>\n\n\n\n\n      out of the possession of a person. A dead body is not\n      a person. So the prosecution case that the appellant\n      removed the jewels from the body of the deceased\n      before she was murdered could not be accepted and\n      hence an offence under Section 394, I. P. C. could not\n      be sustained.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">51.

The word &quot;death&quot; denotes the death of a\n\nhuman being unless the contrary appears from the context.\n\nRape must be accomplished with a person, not a dead body.\n\nIt must be accomplished against a person&#x27;s will. A dead body\n\ncannot consent to or protest a rape, nor can it be in fear of\n\nimmediate and unlawful bodily injury. The essential of guilt of\n\nrape consists in the outrage to the person and feelings of\n\nvictim of the rape. A dead body has no feelings of outrage.\n\nThe   sexual   intercourse   on    dead   body   is   nothing   but\n\nnecrophilia.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                 69</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">52. &quot;Necrophilia- It is a morbid fascination with death and\n\nthe dead and more particularly, an erotic attraction to corpses.\n\nIt is a psychosexual disorder and DSM-IV classifies it among a\n\ngroup of disorders called &#x27;paraphilias&#x27; including pedophilia,\n\nexhibitionism and sexual masochism and names necrophilia as\n\n&#x27;not otherwise specified&#x27;.

This is not a specific <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_91\">IPC</a> offence categorised under\n\nsexual offences mentioned under the Code, but could be\n\nbrought under Section 297 as causing &quot;indignity to any human\n\ncorpse&quot; by trespass into a place set apart for performance of\n\nfuneral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                      70</span>\n\n\n\n\nSpecific <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_92\">IPC</a> offence with Intention of wounding feelings of any\n\nperson or of insulting any religion, if all the legal ingredients of\n\nintention are satisfied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">53.

But it is the specific\n\ncase of prosecution that, accused, first murdered the victim\n\nand then had sexual intercourse with dead body.

The law has not so far defined a person will include a\n\ndead person.   It, however, has some rights which cannot be\n\ndetached from it, even if the body is deluded of the life, is\n\ntogether forms a human being. The provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1450343/\" id=\"a_110\">Indian\n\nSuccession Act, 1923</a>, provides for execution of the Will of a\n\nperson, after he has died.    A person is also has a right to\n\nprotect his dead body, to be mutilated, wasted or its organs to\n\nbe taken out, except by the consent of the person, when he\n\nwas alive or on the consent of his kith and kin or the State, if\n\nthe body is unclaimed.       The word &#x27;person&#x27; may not be\n\nconstrued narrowly serves to exclude dignity of dead body of\n\nthe human being, who was the person, when alive, which is\n\nnot claimed and which is required to be cremated or buried\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                               79</span>\n\n\n\n\nwith the dignity in accordance with the religious beliefs of the\n\nperson, if such beliefs can be found by establishing his\n\nidentity.   State is obliged in law to maintain sanitation to\n\nremove the body, which becomes dangerous, for the safety of\n\nother living beings for its adequate disposal. Unclaimed dead\n\nbody has to be claimed by the State both for the purpose of\n\ninvestigation of the crime if it was committed on the human\n\nbeing who did not naturally died for scientific investigation or\n\nfor research of medical education. The State is obliged in law\n\nboth under its powers as welfare State, and to protect the\n\nrights of such person in its extended meaning under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India for disposal of dead body for a\n\ndecent and dignified cremation/burial in accordance with the\n\nreligious beliefs that man kept or possessed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">63.   It is our experience that everyday newspapers are\n\ncovered with the reports of group of persons illegally confining\n\nthe dead bodies on the road, or in front of the police stations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                80</span>\n\n\n\n\nholding up traffic for hours making demand of compensation\n\nor for better road safety. The society should not permit such\n\ndisgrace to the dead body.     The State through its agencies\n\nmust take immediate possession of such dead bodies used for\n\nillegal means, for its decent and dignified cremation.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">64.   It is brought to our notice that most of the government\n\nand private hospitals where the dead bodies, especially young\n\nwoman kept in mortuary the attendant who appointed to\n\nguard, have sexual intercourse on the dead body. Thereby it\n\nis high time for the State Government to ensure such crime\n\nshould not happen, thereby maintaining dignity of the dead\n\nbody of the woman.        Unfortunately in India no specific\n\nlegislation enacted including under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_112\">Indian\n\nPenal Code</a> for the purpose of upholding dignity and protecting\n\nrights and crime against the dead body of the woman. In the\n\npresent case, as already stated supra, the charge is the\n\naccused first murdered the victim and had sexual intercourse\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                      81</span>\n\n\n\n\nwith the dead body.        Though it is anunnatural offence, as\n\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 377</a> of IPC, which defined whoever\n\nvoluntarily has carnal inter-course against the order of nature\n\nwith any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with\n\nimprisonment     for   life,    or   with   impris-onment   of   either\n\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten years, and\n\nshall also be liable to fine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">65.   Unfortunately the said provision does not include the\n\nterm &#x27;dead body&#x27;. Thereby most of the crimes against woman\n\non the dead body including hospital mortuaries happening and\n\nit can be considered as sadism or necrophilia and there is no\n\noffence in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_114\">IPC</a> made out to punish such persons who\n\ncommitted sexual intercourse on the dead body of the woman.\n\nTherefore the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 376</a> of IPC would not\n\nattract. The said material aspect has not been considered by\n\nthe learned Sessions Judge, thereby erroneously convicted the\n\naccused under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 376</a> of IPC in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                82</span>\n\n\n\n\nabsence of any provision attracting the offence under the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_117\">Indian Penal Code</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_153\">66.

For the reasons stated above, the first point raised in the\n\npresent criminal appeal is answered in negative holding that\n\nthe accused has not made out any case to interfere with the\n\nimpugned judgment of conviction, convicting the accused for\n\nimprisonment for life for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_119\">Section\n\n302</a> of IPC with fine of Rs.50,000/- with default clause.\n\nAccordingly the second point is answered in negative holding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                83</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat the rape on the dead body of woman will not attract the\n\noffence punishable under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 376</a> of IPC.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">                   VII.
