Seldom, our society realizes or cares to  realize  the  trauma,  agony\nand  pain  which  the  members  of  Transgender   community   undergo,   nor\nappreciates  the  innate  feelings  of  the  members  of   the   Transgender\ncommunity, especially of those whose mind and body disown  their  biological\nsex.  Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender  community  and\nin public places like railway stations,  bus  stands,  schools,  workplaces,\nmalls, theatres, hospitals, they are sidelined and treated as  untouchables,\nforgetting  the  fact  that  the  moral  failure  lies  in   the   society’s\nunwillingness  to  contain  or  embrace  different  gender  identities   and\nexpressions, a mindset which we have to change.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.    We are, in this case, concerned with the grievances of the members  of\nTransgender  Community  (for  short  ‘TG  community’)  who  seek   a   legal\ndeclaration of their gender identity than the one assigned to them, male  or\nfemale, at the time of birth and their prayer  is  that  non-recognition  of\ntheir gender identity violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">21</a>  of  the  Constitution  of\nIndia.   Hijras/Eunuchs, who also fall in that group, claim legal status  as\na third gender with all legal and constitutional protection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The National Legal Services Authority,  constituted  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/26738839/\" id=\"a_3\">Legal\nServices Authority Act, 1997</a>, to provide free legal services to  the  weaker\nand other  marginalized  sections  of  the  society,  has  come  forward  to\nadvocate their cause, by filing Writ Petition  No.  400  of  2012.   Poojaya\nMata Nasib Kaur Ji Women Welfare  Society,  a  registered  association,  has\nalso preferred Writ Petition No. 604 of 2013,  seeking  similar  reliefs  in\nrespect of Kinnar community, a TG community.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Laxmi Narayan Tripathy, claimed to be a Hijra, has also got  impleaded\nso as to effectively put across the cause of the members of the  transgender\ncommunity and Tripathy’s life experiences  also  for  recognition  of  their\nidentity as a third gender, over and above male and female.   Tripathy  says\nthat non-recognition of the identity of Hijras, a TG community, as  a  third\ngender,  denies them  the  right  of  equality  before  the  law  and  equal\nprotection of law guaranteed  under  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article  14</a>  of  the  Constitution  and\nviolates the rights guaranteed to them under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the  Constitution\nof India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.    Shri Raju Ramachandran,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\npetitioner  –  the  National  Legal  Services  Authority,  highlighted   the\ntraumatic  experiences  faced  by  the  members  of  the  TG  community  and\nsubmitted that every person of that community has a legal  right  to  decide\ntheir sex orientation and to espouse and determine their identity.   Learned\nsenior counsel has submitted that since the TGs are neither treated as  male\nor female, nor given the status of a third gender, they are  being  deprived\nof many of the rights and privileges which other persons enjoy  as  citizens\nof this country.  TGs are deprived of social and cultural participation  and\nhence restricted access to education, health care and  public  places  which\ndeprives them of the Constitutional guarantee of  equality  before  law  and\nequal protection of laws.   Further,  it  was  also  pointed  out  that  the\ncommunity also faces discrimination to  contest  election,  right  to  vote,\nemployment, to get licences etc. and, in effect, treated as an  outcast  and\nuntouchable.   Learned senior counsel also submitted that the  State  cannot\ndiscriminate them on the ground of gender, violating <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 14</a> to  16  and\n21 of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.     Shri  Anand  Grover,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing   for   the\nIntervener, traced the historical background of the  third  gender  identity\nin India and the position accorded to them in  the  Hindu  Mythology,  Vedic\nand Puranic literatures, and the prominent role played by them in the  royal\ncourts of the Islamic world etc.  Reference was also made  to  the  repealed\n<a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_7\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a> and explained the inhuman  manner  by  which  they\nwere treated at the time of  the  British  Colonial  rule.   Learned  senior\ncounsel also submitted that various International  Forums  and  U.N.  Bodies\nhave recognized  their  gender  identity  and  referred  to  the  Yogyakarta\nPrinciples and pointed out that those principles  have  been  recognized  by\nvarious countries around  the  world.    Reference  was  also  made  to  few\nlegislations  giving  recognition  to  the  trans-sexual  persons  in  other\ncountries.   Learned senior counsel also submitted that  non-recognition  of\ngender identity  of  the  transgender  community  violates  the  fundamental\nrights guaranteed to them, who are citizens of this country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.    Shri T. Srinivasa Murthy, learned counsel appearing in I.A. No.  2  of\n2013, submitted that transgender persons have to be declared as  a  socially\nand educationally backward classes of citizens  and  must  be  accorded  all\nbenefits available to that class of persons, which  are  being  extended  to\nmale and female genders.  Learned counsel also submitted that the  right  to\nchoose one’s gender identity is integral to the right to lead  a  life  with\ndignity, which is undoubtedly guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of  the  Constitution\nof India.  Learned counsel,  therefore,  submitted  that,  subject  to  such\nrules/regulations/protocols, transgender persons may be afforded  the  right\nof choice to determine whether  to  opt  for  male,  female  or  transgender\nclassification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.    Shri Sanjeev Bhatnagar, learned counsel appearing for  the  petitioner\nin Writ Petition No.604  of  2013,  highlighted  the  cause  of  the  Kinnar\ncommunity  and  submitted  that  they  are  the  most  deprived   group   of\ntransgenders and calls for constitutional as well as  legal  protection  for\ntheir identity and for other socio-economic benefits,  which  are  otherwise\nextended to the members of the male and female genders in the community.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">9.     Shri  Rakesh  K.  Khanna,  learned  Additional   Solicitor   General,\nappearing for the Union of India, submitted that  the  problems  highlighted\nby the transgender community is a sensitive human  issue,  which  calls  for\nserious attention.  Learned ASG pointed out that, under  the  aegis  of  the\nMinistry  of  Social  Justice  and  Empowerment  (for  short   “MOSJE”),   a\nCommittee, called “Expert Committee  on  Issues  relating  to  Transgender”,\nhas been constituted to conduct an in-depth study of the  problems  relating\nto transgender persons to make appropriate recommendations to  MOSJE.   Shri\nKhanna also submitted that due representation would also  be  given  to  the\napplicants, appeared before this Court  in  the  Committee,  so  that  their\nviews also could be heard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">10.   We also heard learned counsel appearing for various States  and  Union\nTerritories who have explained the steps they  have  taken  to  improve  the\nconditions and status of the members of TG  community  in  their  respective\nStates and Union Territories.   Laxmi Narayan Tripathy, a Hijra,  through  a\npetition supported by an affidavit,  highlighted  the  trauma  undergone  by\nTripathy from Tripathy’s birth.   Rather than explaining the same by us,  it\nwould be appropriate to quote in Tripathy’s own words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      “That the Applicant has born as a male.  Growing up as  a  child,  she\n      felt different from the boys of her age and was feminine in her  ways.\n      On account of her femininity, from an early age,  she  faced  repeated\n      sexual harassment, molestation  and  sexual  abuse,  both  within  and\n      outside the family. Due to her being different, she was  isolated  and\n      had no one to talk to or express her feelings while she was coming  to\n      terms with her identity.  She was constantly abused by everyone  as  a\n      ‘chakka’  and ‘hijra’.  Though she felt that there was  no  place  for\n      her in society, she did not succumb to the prejudice.  She started  to\n      dress and appear in public in women’s clothing in her late  teens  but\n      she did not identify  as  a  woman.    Later,  she  joined  the  Hijra\n      community in Mumbai as she identified with the other  hijras  and  for\n      the first time in her life, she felt at home.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      That being a hijra, the Applicant  has  faced  serious  discrimination\n      throughout her life because of her gender identity.  It has been clear\n      to the Applicant that the complete non-recognition of the identity  of\n      hijras/transgender persons by the State has resulted in the  violation\n      of most of  the  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  to  them  under  the\n      Constitution of India….”\n\n      Siddarth Narrain, eunuch, highlights Narrain’s feeling, as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      ”Ever since I can remember, I  have  always  identified  myself  as  a\n      woman.  I lived in Namakkal, a small town in Tamil Nadu.  When  I  was\n      in the 10th standard I realized  that  the  only  way  for  me  to  be\n      comfortable was to join the hijra community.   It  was  then  that  my\n      family found out that I frequently met hijras who lived in  the  city.\n      One day, when my father was away, my brother, encouraged by my mother,\n      started beating me with a cricket bat.  I locked myself in a  room  to\n      escape from the beatings.   My mother and brother then tried to  break\n      into the room to beat me up further.   Some of my relatives intervened\n      and brought me out of the room.  I related my ordeal to  an  uncle  of\n      mine who gave me Rs.50 and asked me to go home.  Instead, I  took  the\n      money and went to live with a group of hijras in Erode.”\n\n      Sachin, a TG, expressed his experiences as follows:\n      “My name is Sachin and I am 23  years  old.    As  a  child  I  always\n      enjoyed putting make-up like ‘vibhuti’ or ‘kum  kum’  and  my  parents\n      always saw me as a girl.   I am male but I only have female  feelings.\n      I used to help my mother in all the housework  like  cooking,  washing\n      and cleaning.  Over the years, I started assuming more of the domestic\n      responsibilities at home.  The neighbours starting teasing  me.   They\n      would call out to me and ask: ‘Why don’t you go out and  work  like  a\n      man?’  or ‘Why are you staying at home like a  girl?’    But  I  liked\n      being a girl.  I felt shy about  going  out  and  working.   Relatives\n      would also mock and scold me on this score.  Every day I would go  out\n      of the house to bring water.  And as I walked back with  the  water  I\n      would always be teased.  I felt very ashamed. I  even  felt  suicidal.\n      How could I live like that?    But my parents never  protested.   They\n      were helpless.”\n\n\n      We have been told and informed of similar life experiences  faced  by\nvarious others who belong to the TG community.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">11.         Transgender is generally described  as  an  umbrella  term  for\npersons whose gender identity,  gender  expression  or  behavior  does  not\nconform to their biological sex. TG may also takes in persons  who  do  not\nidentify with their sex assigned at  birth,  which  include  Hijras/Eunuchs\nwho, in this writ petition, describe themselves as “third gender” and  they\ndo not identify as either male or female.  Hijras are not men by virtue  of\nanatomy appearance and psychologically, they are  also  not  women,  though\nthey are like women with no female reproduction organ and no  menstruation.\n Since Hijras do not have reproduction capacities as either men  or  women,\nthey are neither men nor women and claim  to  be  an  institutional  “third\ngender”.  Among Hijras, there are emasculated (castrated, nirvana) men, non-\nemasculated  men  (not   castrated/akva/akka)   and   inter-sexed   persons\n(hermaphrodites).  TG also includes persons who intend to undergo  Sex  Re-\nAssignment Surgery (SRS) or have undergone SRS to  align  their  biological\nsex with their gender identity in order to become male or female.  They are\ngenerally called transsexual persons. Further, there are persons  who  like\nto  cross-dress  in  clothing  of  opposite  gender,   i.e   transvestites.\nResultantly, the term “transgender”, in contemporary usage, has  become  an\numbrella term that is used to describe  a  wide  range  of  identities  and\nexperiences, including but not limited to pre-operative, post-operative and\nnon-operative transsexual people, who strongly  identify  with  the  gender\nopposite to their biological sex; male and female.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF TRANSGENDERS IN INDIA:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">12.    TG  Community  comprises  of  Hijras,  eunuchs,  Kothis,   Aravanis,\nJogappas, Shiv-Shakthis etc. and they,  as  a  group,  have  got  a  strong\nhistorical presence in  our  country  in  the  Hindu  mythology  and  other\nreligious texts.   The Concept of tritiya prakrti  or  napunsaka  has  also\nbeen  an  integral  part  of  vedic  and  puranic  literatures.   The  word\n‘napunsaka’  has been used to denote  absence  of  procreative  capability.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">13.   Lord Rama, in the epic Ramayana, was  leaving  for  the  forest  upon\nbeing banished from the kingdom for 14 years, turns around to his followers\nand asks all the ‘men  and  women’  to  return  to  the  city.   Among  his\nfollowers, the hijras alone do not feel bound by this direction and  decide\nto stay with him.  Impressed with their devotion, Rama sanctions  them  the\npower to confer blessings on people on auspicious occasions like childbirth\nand marriage, and also at inaugural functions which, it is believed set the\nstage for the custom of badhai in  which  hijras  sing,  dance  and  confer\nblessings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">14.   Aravan, the son of Arjuna and Nagakanya in Mahabharata, offers to  be\nsacrificed to Goddess Kali to ensure the victory of  the  Pandavas  in  the\nKurukshetra war,   the only condition that he made was to  spend  the  last\nnight of his life in matrimony.    Since no woman was willing to marry  one\nwho was doomed to be killed, Krishna assumes the form of a beautiful  woman\ncalled Mohini and marries him.   The Hijras of Tamil Nadu  consider  Aravan\ntheir progenitor and call themselves Aravanis.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">15.   Jain Texts also make a detailed reference to TG  which  mentions  the\nconcept of ‘psychological sex’.  Hijras also played a prominent role in the\nroyal courts of the Islamic world, especially in the  Ottaman  empires  and\nthe Mughal rule in  the  Medieval  India.    A  detailed  analysis  of  the\nhistorical background of the same finds a place  in  the  book  of  Gayatri\nReddy, “With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South  India”  –\nYoda Press (2006).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">16.   We notice that even though historically,  Hijras/transgender  persons\nhad played a prominent role, with the onset of colonial rule from the  18th\ncentury onwards,  the  situation  had  changed  drastically.    During  the\nBritish rule, a legislation was enacted to supervise the deeds of Hijras/TG\ncommunity, called the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_9\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a>, which  deemed  the  entire\ncommunity of Hijras persons as innately ‘criminal’  and  ‘addicted  to  the\nsystematic commission of non-bailable offences’.    <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_10\">The  Act</a>  provided  for\nthe registration, surveillance and control of certain criminal  tribes  and\neunuchs and had penalized eunuchs, who were registered, and appeared to  be\ndressed or ornamented like a woman, in a public street or place, as well as\nthose who danced or played music in a  public  place.   Such  persons  also\ncould be arrested without warrant and sentenced to imprisonment up  to  two\nyears or fine or both.    <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_11\">Under  the  Act</a>,  the  local  government  had  to\nregister the names and residence of all eunuchs residing in  that  area  as\nwell as of their properties, who were reasonably suspected of kidnapping or\ncastrating children, or of committing offences under  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_12\">Section  377</a>  of  the\nIPC, or of abetting the commission of any of the said offences.   <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_13\">Under the\nAct</a>, the act of keeping a boy under 16 years in the charge of a  registered\neunuch was made an offence punishable with imprisonment up to two years  or\nfine and the Act also denuded the registered eunuchs of their civil  rights\nby prohibiting them from acting as guardians to minors, from making a  gift\ndeed or a will, or from adopting a son.  Act has, however, been repealed in\nAugust 1949.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">17.   <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 377</a> of the IPC found a place in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Penal Code</a>,  1860,\nprior to the enactment of Criminal Tribles Act that criminalized all penile-\nnon-vaginal sexual acts between persons, including anal sex and  oral  sex,\nat a time when transgender persons were also typically associated with  the\nprescribed sexual practices.  Reference may be made to the judgment of  the\nAllahabad High Court in Queen Empress v. Khairati (1884)  ILR  6  All  204,\nwherein a transgender person was arrested and prosecuted under Section  377\non the suspicion that he was a ‘habitual sodomite’ and was later  acquitted\non appeal.  In that case, while acquitting him, the Sessions  Judge  stated\nas follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      “This case relates to a person named Khairati, over  whom  the  police\n      seem to have exercised some  sort  of  supervision,  whether  strictly\n      regular or not, as a eunuch.  The man is not a eunuch in  the  literal\n      sense, but he was called for by the police when  on  a  visit  to  his\n      village, and was found singing dressed as a woman among the women of a\n      certain family.  Having been subjected to  examination  by  the  Civil\n      Surgeon (and a subordinate medical man),  he  is  shown  to  have  the\n      characteristic mark of a habitual catamite –  the  distortion  of  the\n      orifice of the anus into the  shape  of  a  trumpet  and  also  to  be\n      affected with syphilis in the same region in a manner which distinctly\n      points to unnatural intercourse within the last few months.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_1\">18.   Even though, he was acquitted on appeal, this case would  demonstrate\nthat Section 377, though associated with specific sexual acts,  highlighted\ncertain identities, including Hijras and  was  used  as  an  instrument  of\nharassment and physical abuse against Hijras and transgender persons.     A\nDivision Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_16\">Suresh Kumar Koushal  and  another  v.  Naz\nFoundation  and  others</a>  [(2014)  1  SCC  1]  has  already  spoken  on  the\nconstitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 377</a> IPC and, hence, we express no  opinion  on\nit since we are in these cases concerned with an altogether different issue\npertaining to the constitutional and other legal rights of the  transgender\ncommunity and their gender identity and sexual orientation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">19.   Gender identity is one of the most-fundamental aspects of life  which\nrefers to a person’s intrinsic sense of being male, female  or  transgender\nor transsexual person.  A person’s sex is usually assigned at birth, but  a\nrelatively small group of persons may born with  bodies  which  incorporate\nboth or certain aspects of both male  and  female  physiology.   At  times,\ngenital anatomy  problems  may  arise  in  certain  persons,  their  innate\nperception of themselves, is not in conformity with  the  sex  assigned  to\nthem at birth and may include pre and  post-operative  transsexual  persons\nand also persons who do not choose to undergo or  do  not  have  access  to\noperation and also include persons who cannot undergo successful operation.\n Countries, all over the world, including  India,  are  grappled  with  the\nquestion of attribution of gender to persons who believe that  they  belong\nto the opposite sex.  Few persons undertake surgical and  other  procedures\nto  alter  their  bodies  and  physical  appearance   to   acquire   gender\ncharacteristics of the sex which conform to  their  perception  of  gender,\nleading to legal and social complications since official  record  of  their\ngender at birth is  found  to  be  at  variance  with  the  assumed  gender\nidentity. Gender identity refers to each person’s deeply felt internal  and\nindividual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond  with  the\nsex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body  which  may\ninvolve a freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or functions  by\nmedical, surgical or other means and other expressions of gender, including\ndress, speech and mannerisms. Gender  identity,  therefore,  refers  to  an\nindividual’s self-identification as a  man,  woman,  transgender  or  other\nidentified category.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">20.   Sexual  orientation  refers  to  an  individual’s  enduring  physical,\nromantic and/or emotional attraction to another person.  Sexual  orientation\nincludes  transgender  and   gender-variant   people   with   heavy   sexual\norientation and their sexual orientation may or may  not  change  during  or\nafter gender transmission,  which  also  includes  homo-sexuals,  bysexuals,\nheterosexuals, asexual etc.  Gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation,  as\nalready indicated,  are  different  concepts.

Various countries have given recognition to the  gender  identity  of\nsuch persons, mostly, in cases where transsexual persons started  asserting\ntheir rights after undergoing SRS of their re-assigned sex.     In  Corbett\nv. Corbett (1970) 2 All ER 33, the Court in England was concerned with  the\ngender of a male to female transsexual in the context of the validity of  a\nmarriage.  Ormrod, J. in that case took the view that the law should  adopt\nthe chromosomal, gonadal and genital tests and if all three are  congruent,\nthat should determine a person’s sex for the purpose of marriage.   Learned\nJudge expressed the view that any operative intervention should be  ignored\nand the biological sexual constitution of an individual is fixed at  birth,\nat the latest, and cannot be changed either by the natural  development  of\norgans of the opposite sex or by medical or surgical means.  Later, in R v.\nTan (1983) QB 1053, 1063-1064, the Court of Appeal applied Corbett approach\nin the context of criminal law.  The Court upheld  convictions  which  were\nimposed on Gloria Greaves, a post-operative  male  to  female  transsexual,\nstill being in law, a man.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">26.   Corbett principle was not found favour by  various  other  countries,\nlike New Zealand, Australia etc. and also attracted  much  criticism,  from\nthe medical profession.  It was felt that the application  of  the  Corbett\napproach would lead to a substantial different outcome in cases of  a  post\noperative inter-sexual person and a post operative transsexual person.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1495454\" id=\"span_2\">In\nNew Zealand in <a href=\"/doc/1495454/\" id=\"a_23\">Attorney-General v. Otahuhu Family</a> Court (1995) 1 NZLR  603,\nJustice Ellis noted that once a transsexual person has  undergone  surgery,\nhe or she is no longer able to operate in his or her original sex.   It was\nheld that there is no social advantage in the law for not  recognizing  the\nvalidity of the marriage of a transsexual in the sex of reassignment.   The\nCourt held that an adequate test is whether  the  person  in  question  has\nundergone surgical and medical procedures that have effectively  given  the\nperson the physical conformation of a person of a  specified  sex.   In  Re\nKevin (Validity of Marriage of Transsexual)  (2001)  Fam  CA  1074,  in  an\nAustralian case, Chisholm J., held that there is no ‘formulaic solution’ to\ndetermine the sex of an individual for the purpose of the law of  marriage.\nIt was held that all relevant matters need to be considered, including  the\nperson’s life experiences and self-perception.   Full Court of the  Federal\nFamily Court in the year 2003 approved the above-mentioned judgment holding\nthat in the relevant Commonwealth marriage  statute  the  words  ‘man’  and\n‘woman’ should be given their ordinary, everyday contemporary  meaning  and\nthat the word ‘man’ includes a post operative female  to  male  transsexual\nperson.  The Full Court also held that there was  a  biological  basis  for\ntranssexualism and that there was no reason to exclude the psyche as one of\nthe relevant factors in determining sex and gender.  The judgment Attorney-\nGeneral for the Commonwealth &amp; “Kevin and  Jennifer”  &amp;  Human  Rights  and\nEqual Opportunity Commission is reported in (2003) Fam CA 94.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">27.

Harris  &amp;  McGuiness  (1988)  17\nNSWLR 158, made an exhaustive review of the various  decisions  with  regard\nto the question of recognition to be accorded by Courts to the gender  of  a\ntranssexual person who had undertaken a  surgical  procedure.    The  Courts\ngenerally in New Zealand held  that  the  decision  in  Corbett  v.  Corbett\n(supra) and R v. Tan (supra) which applied a purely biological test,  should\nnot  be  followed.   In  fact,  Lockhart.  J.  in  SRA  observed  that   the\ndevelopment in surgical and  medical  techniques  in  the  field  of  sexual\nreassignment,  together  with  indications  of  changing  social   attitudes\ntowards transsexuals, would indicate  that  generally  they  should  not  be\nregarded merely as a matter of chromosomes, which is purely a  psychological\nquestion, one of self-perception, and partly a social question, how  society\nperceives the individual.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">28.  A.B. v. Western Australia (2011) HCA 42 was a case concerned  with  the\nGender Reassignment Act, 2000.  In that Act, a person who  had  undergone  a\nreassignment procedure could apply to  Gender  Reassignment  Board  for  the\nissue of a recognition certificate.   Under <a href=\"/doc/111365807/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 15</a> of that  Act,  before\nissuing the certificate, the Board had to be  satisfied,  inter  alia,  that\nthe applicant believed his or her true gender was  the  person’s  reassigned\ngender and had adopted the lifestyle  and  gender  characteristics  of  that\ngender.  Majority of Judges agreed with Lockhart, J.  in  SRA   that  gender\nshould not be regarded merely as a  matter  of  chromosomes,  but  partly  a\npsychological  question,  one  of  self-perception,  and  partly  a   social\nquestion, how society perceives the individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_45\">29.  The House of Lords in Bellinger v. Bellinger (2003) 2 All  ER  593  was\ndealing with the question of a transsexual.  In that  case,  Mrs.  Bellinger\nwas born on 7th September, 1946.  At birth,  she  was  correctly  classified\nand registered as male.  However, she felt more inclined  to  be  a  female.\nDespite her inclinations, and under some pressure, in  1967  she  married  a\nwoman and at that time she was  21  years  old.   Marriage  broke  down  and\nparties separated in 1971 and got divorce in the year 1975.  Mrs.  Bellinger\ndressed and lived like a woman and when she married Mr.  Bellinger,  he  was\nfully aware of her background and throughout had  been  supportive  to  her.\nMr. and Mrs. Bellinger since marriage lived happily as husband and wife  and\npresented  themselves  in  that  fashion  to  the   outside   world.    Mrs.\nBellinger’s primary claim was for a declaration  under  Section  55  of  the\nFamily Law Act, 1986 that her marriage to Mr. Bellinger in 1981 was “at  its\ninception valid marriage”.  The  House  of  Lords  rejected  the  claim  and\ndismissed the appeal. Certainly, the “psychological  factor”  has  not  been\ngiven much prominence in determination of the claim of Mrs. Bellinger.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_46\">30.  The High Court of Kuala  Lumpur  in  Re  JG,  JG  v.  Pengarah  Jabatan\nPendaftaran Negara (2006) 1 MLJ 90,  was  considering  the  question  as  to\nwhether an application to amend or correct gender status stated in  National\nRegistration Identity Card could be allowed after  a  person  has  undergone\nSRS.  It was a case where the plaintiff was born as a male,  but  felt  more\ninclined to be a woman.  In 1996 at Hospital Siroros she underwent a  gender\nreassignment and got the surgery done for changing  the  sex  from  male  to\nfemale and then she lived like a  woman.   She  applied  to  authorities  to\nchange her name and also for a declaration of her gender as female, but  her\nrequest was not favourably considered, but still treated as  a  male.    She\nsought a declaration from the Court that she be declared  as  a  female  and\nthat the Registration Department be directed to change  the  last  digit  of\nher identity card to a digit that reflects a female gender.   The  Malaysian\nCourt  basically  applied  the  principle  laid  down  in  Corbett  (supra),\nhowever, both the prayers sought for were granted, after noticing  that  the\nmedical men have spoken that  the  plaintiff  is  a  female  and  they  have\nconsidered the sex change of the plaintiff as  well  as  her  “psychological\naspect”.   The Court noticed that she feels like a woman,  lives  like  one,\nbehaves as one, has her physical body attuned to one, and most important  of\nall, her “psychological thinking” is that of a woman.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">31.   The Court of Appeal, New South Wales was called  upon  to  decide  the\nquestion whether the Registrar of  Births,  Deaths  and  Marriages  has  the\npower under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Act, 1995 to register a  change\nof sex of a person and the sex recorded on the  register  to  “non-specific”\nor “non-specified”.  The appeal was allowed  and  the  matter  was  remitted\nback to the Tribunal for a  fresh  consideration  in  accordance  with  law,\nafter laying down the law on the  subject.   The  judgment  is  reported  as\nNorrie v. NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages  (2013)  NSWCA  145.\nWhile disposing of the appeal, the Court held as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      “The consequence is that the Appeal Panel (and the  Tribunal  and  the\n      Registrar) were in error in  construing  the  power  in  S.32DC(1)  as\n      limiting the Registrar to registering a person’s change of sex as only\n      male or female.   An  error  in  the  construction  of  the  statutory\n      provision granting the power to register a person’s change of  sex  is\n      an error on a question of law.  Collector  of  Customs  v.  Pozzolanic\n      Enterprises Pty. Ltd. [1993] FCA 322; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287.   This\n      is  so  notwithstanding  that  the   determination   of   the   common\n      understanding of a general word used in the statutory provision  is  a\n      question of  fact.   The  Appeal  Panel  (and  the  Tribunal  and  the\n      Registrar) erred in determining that the current ordinary  meaning  of\n      the word “sex” is limited to the character of  being  either  male  or\n      female. That involved an error on a question of fact.  But the  Appeal\n      Panel’s error in arriving at the  common  understanding  of  the  word\n      “sex” was associated with its error in construction of the  effect  of\n      the  statutory  provision  of  S.32DC  (and  also  of   S.32DA),   and\n      accordingly is of law: Hope v.

United  Kingdom  (Application  No.28957/95  -\nJudgment dated  11th  July,  2002),  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights\nexamined an application alleging violation of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_25\">Articles 8</a><a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_26\">, 12</a><a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_27\">, 13</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_28\">14</a>  of\nthe Convention for Protection of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms,\n1997 in respect of the legal status of transsexuals in UK  and  particularly\ntheir treatment in the sphere of employment, social security,  pensions  and\nmarriage.  Applicant in that case had a tendency to dress as  a  woman  from\nearly childhood and underwent aversion therapy in  1963-64.    In  the  mid-\n1960s she was diagnosed as a transsexual.   Though she married a  woman  and\nthey had four children, her inclination was that her  “brain  sex”  did  not\nfit her body.  From that time until 1984 she dressed as a man for  work  but\nas a woman in  her  free  time.   In  January,  1985,  the  applicant  began\ntreatment at the Gender Identity Clinic.  In October,  1986,  she  underwent\nsurgery to shorten her vocal chords.  In August, 1987, she was  accepted  on\nthe waiting list for gender re-assignment surgery and later  underwent  that\nsurgery  at  a  National  Health  Service  hospital.   The  applicant  later\ndivorced her former wife.   She  claimed  between  1990  and  1992  she  was\nsexually harassed by colleagues at work,  followed  by  other  human  rights\nviolations.   The  Court  after  referring   to   various   provisions   and\nConventions held as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      “Nonetheless, the very essence of the Convention is respect for  human\n      dignity and human freedom.  Under  <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_29\">Article  8</a>  of  the  Convention  in\n      particular, where the notion of  personal  autonomy  is  an  important\n      principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees,  protection\n      is given to the personal sphere of  each  individuals,  including  the\n      right to establish details  of  their  identity  as  individual  human\n      beings (see, inter alia, Pretty  v.  the  United  Kingdom  no.2346/02,\n      judgment of 29 April 2002, 62, and Mikulic  v.

In short, the unsatisfactory situation in which post-\n      operative transsexuals live in an intermediate zone as not  quite  one\n      gender or the other is no longer sustainable.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">33.  The European Court of Human Rights in the case of Van Kuck  v.  Germany\n(Application  No.35968/97  –  Judgment  dated  12.9.2003)  dealt  with   the\napplication alleging that German Court’s decisions refusing the  applicant’s\nclaim for reimbursement of gender  reassignment  measures  and  the  related\nproceedings were in breach of her rights to a fair trial and  of  her  right\nto respect for her private life and that they amounted to discrimination  on\nthe ground  of  her  particular  “psychological  situation”.   Reliance  was\nplaced on <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_30\">Articles 6</a><a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_31\">, 8</a><a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_32\">, 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_33\">14</a>  of  the  Convention  for  Protection  of\nHuman Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms,  1997.   The  Court  held  that  the\nconcept of “private life” covers the physical  and  psychological  integrity\nof a  person,  which  can  sometimes  embrace  aspects  of  an  individual’s\nphysical and social identity.  For  example,  gender  identifications,  name\nand sexual orientation and sexual  life  fall  within  the  personal  sphere\nprotected by <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 8.</a>  The Court also held that  the  notion  of  personal\nidentity is an important principle underlying the interpretation of  various\nguaranteed rights and the very essence of the Convention being  respect  for\nhuman dignity and human  freedom,  protection  is  given  to  the  right  of\ntranssexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">34.   Judgments referred to above are mainly related to  transsexuals,  who,\nwhilst belonging physically to one sex, feel convinced that they  belong  to\nthe other, seek  to  achieve  a  more  integrated  unambiguous  identity  by\nundergoing  medical  and  surgical  operations  to  adapt   their   physical\ncharacteristic to their psychological nature.  When we  examine  the  rights\nof transsexual persons, who have undergone SRS, the test to  be  applied  is\nnot  the  “Biological  test”,  but   the   “Psychological   test”,   because\npsychological factor and thinking of transsexual has  to  be  given  primacy\nthan binary notion of gender of that  person.   Seldom  people  realize  the\ndiscomfort, distress and psychological trauma,  they  undergo  and  many  of\nthem  undergo  “Gender  Dysphoria’  which  may  lead  to  mental   disorder.\nDiscrimination faced by this group in our society,  is  rather  unimaginable\nand their rights have to be  protected,  irrespective  of  chromosomal  sex,\ngenitals,  assigned  birth  sex,  or  implied  gender   role.    Rights   of\ntransgenders, pure and simple, like Hijras, eunuchs, etc. have  also  to  be\nexamined, so also their right to remain as a third gender as well  as  their\nphysical and psychological  integrity.    Before  addressing  those  aspects\nfurther, we may also refer to few legislations enacted  in  other  countries\nrecognizing their rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">LEGISLATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON TGs\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">35.  We notice, following the trend, in the international human rights  law,\nmany countries have enacted  laws  for  recognizing  rights  of  transsexual\npersons, who have undergone either partial/complete  SRS,  including  United\nKingdom, Netherlands, Germany, Australia, Canada,  Argentina,  etc.   United\nKingdom has passed the  General  Recommendation  Act,  2004,  following  the\njudgment in   Christine Goodwin (supra) passed by  the  European  Courts  of\nHuman Rights.   <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_35\">The Act</a> is all encompassing as  not  only  does  it  provide\nlegal recognition to the acquired gender of a person, but it also lays  down\nprovisions highlighting  the  consequences  of  the  newly  acquired  gender\nstatus on their legal rights and entitlements in  various  aspects  such  as\nmarriage, parentage, succession, social security and  pensions  etc.     One\nof the notable features of the Act is  that  it  is  not  necessary  that  a\nperson needs to have undergone or in the process  of  undergoing  a  SRS  to\napply under the Act.  Reference in  this  connection  may  be  made  to  the\nEquality Act, 2010  (UK)  which  has  consolidated,  repealed  and  replaced\naround nine different anti-discrimination  legislations  including  the  Sex\nDiscrimination Act, 1986.   <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_36\">The Act</a> defines certain  characteristics  to  be\n“protected characteristics” and no one shall  be  discriminated  or  treated\nless favourably on grounds that the person possesses  one  or  more  of  the\n“protected characteristics”.  <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_37\">The Act</a> also imposes duties on  Public  Bodies\nto eliminate all kinds  of  discrimination,  harassment  and  victimization.\nGender  reassignment  has  been   declared   as   one   of   the   protected\ncharacteristics under the Act, of course, only the transsexuals  i.e.  those\nwho are proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone the process  of\nthe gender reassignment are protected under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">36.

There\n      are regional variations in the use of terms referred to  Hijras.   For\n      example, Kinnars (Delhi) and Aravanis (Tamil Nadu).  Hijras  may  earn\n      through their traditional work: ‘Badhai’  (clapping  their  hands  and\n      asking for alms), blessing new-born babies, or dancing in  ceremonies.\n      Some proportion of Hijras engage in sex work for  lack  of  other  job\n      opportunities, while some  may  be  self-employed  or  work  for  non-\n      governmental organisations.” (See UNDP India Report (December, 2010).\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">      Eunuch:     Eunuch refers to an emasculated male and intersexed  to  a\n      person whose genitals are ambiguously male-like at birth, but this  is\n      discovered the child previously assigned to the  male  sex,  would  be\n      recategorized as intesexexd – as a Hijra.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">      “Aravanis  and  ‘Thirunangi’  –  Hijras  in  Tamil  Nadu  identify  as\n      “Aravani”.

One  can\n      become a ‘Jogta’ (or Jogti) if it is part of their family tradition or\n      if one finds a ‘Guru’ (or ‘Pujari’) who accepts him/her as  a  ‘Chela’\n      or ‘Shishya’ (disciple).

Usually, Shiv-Shakthis are inducted into the Shiv-\n      Shakti community by senior gurus, who teach them the  norms,  customs,\n      and rituals to be observed by them.  In a ceremony, Shiv-Shakthis  are\n      married to a sword that represents male power or Shiva (deity).  Shiv-\n      Shakthis thus become the bride  of  the  sword.   Occasionally,  Shiv-\n      Shakthis cross-dress  and  use  accessories  and  ornaments  that  are\n      generally/socially meant for women.

The\nReport states  that  the  HIV  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  and  Sexually\nTransmitted   Infections    (STI)    is    now    increasingly    seen    in\nHijras/transgenders population.  The estimated size  of  men  who  have  sex\nwith men (MSM) and male sex workers population in India  (latter  presumably\nincludes Hijras/TG communities) is 2,352,133 and 235,213  respectively.   It\nwas stated that no reliable estimates are  available  for  Hijras/TG  women.\nHIV prevalence among MSM population was 7.4% against the overall  adult  HIV\nprevalence of 0.36%.  It was stated recently Hijras/TG people were  included\nunder the category of MSM in HIV  sentinel  serosurveillance.   It  is  also\nreported in recent studies that Hijras/TG women have indicated a  very  high\nHIV prevalence (17.5% to 41%) among them.   Study  conducted  by  NACO  also\nhighlights a pathetic situation.

Indian Law, on the whole,  only  recognizes  the  paradigm  of  binary\ngenders of male and female, based on  a  person’s  sex  assigned  by  birth,\nwhich permits  gender  system,  including  the  law  relating  to  marriage,\nadoption, inheritance, succession and  taxation  and  welfare  legislations.\nWe  have  exhaustively  referred  to  various  articles  contained  in   the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, the International  Covenant  on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, the  International  Covenant  on\nCivil and Political Rights, 1966  as  well  as  the  Yogyakarta  principles.\nReference was also made to  legislations enacted in other countries  dealing\nwith rights of persons of transgender community.   Unfortunately we have  no\nlegislation  in  this  country  dealing  with  the  rights  of   transgender\ncommunity.  Due to  the  absence  of  suitable  legislation  protecting  the\nrights of  the  members  of  the  transgender  community,  they  are  facing\ndiscrimination in various areas  and  hence  the  necessity  to  follow  the\nInternational Conventions to which India is a party and to give due  respect\nto   other   non-binding   International   Conventions    and    principles.\nConstitution makers could not have  envisaged  that  each  and  every  human\nactivity be guided, controlled, recognized or safeguarded by  laws  made  by\nthe legislature.   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a>  has  been  incorporated  to  safeguard  those\nrights and a constitutional Court cannot be  a  mute  spectator  when  those\nrights are violated, but is expected to safeguard those rights  knowing  the\npulse and feeling of that community,  though  a  minority,  especially  when\ntheir rights have gained universal recognition and acceptance.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">50.   <a href=\"/doc/741672/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 253</a> of the Constitution of India states  that  the  Parliament\nhas the power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory  of\nIndia for implementing any  treaty,  agreement  or  convention.   Generally,\ntherefore, a legislation is  required  for  implementing  the  international\nconventions, unlike the position in the United States of America  where  the\nrules of international law are  applied  by  the  municipal  courts  on  the\ntheory of their implied adoption  by  the  State,  as  a  part  of  its  own\nmunicipal law.

In the United States, however, it is open to the courts to  supersede\nor modify international law in its application or it may be  controlled  by\nthe treaties entered into by the  United  States.   But,  till  an  Act  of\nCongress is passed, the Court is bound by the law of nations, which is part\nof the law of the land.   Such  a  ‘supremacy  clause’  is  absent  in  our\nConstitution.  Courts in India would apply the rules of  International  law\naccording  to  the  principles  of  comity  of  Nations,  unless  they  are\noverridden by clear rules of domestic law.

Equality  includes  the  full  and\nequal enjoyment of all rights and freedom.   Right  to  equality  has  been\ndeclared as the basic feature of the Constitution and treatment  of  equals\nas unequals or unequals as equals will be violative of the basic  structure\nof the Constitution.  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 14</a> of the  Constitution  also  ensures  equal\nprotection and hence a positive obligation on the  State  to  ensure  equal\nprotection of laws by bringing in necessary social and economic changes, so\nthat everyone including TGs may enjoy equal protection of laws  and  nobody\nis denied such protection. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 14</a> does not restrict the  word  ‘person’\nand its application only to male or female. Hijras/transgender persons  who\nare neither male/female fall within the  expression  ‘person’  and,  hence,\nentitled to legal protection of laws in  all  spheres  of  State  activity,\nincluding employment, healthcare, education as  well  as  equal  civil  and\ncitizenship rights, as enjoyed by any other citizen of this country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">55.

Non-recognition  of  the\nidentity of Hijras/transgender persons denies them equal protection of law,\nthereby leaving them  extremely  vulnerable  to  harassment,  violence  and\nsexual assault in public spaces, at home and in jail, also by  the  police.\nSexual assault, including molestation, rape, forced anal and oral sex, gang\nrape and stripping is being committed with impunity and there are  reliable\nstatistics  and  materials  to  support  such  activities.   Further,  non-\nrecognition of identity of Hijras  /transgender  persons  results  in  them\nfacing extreme discrimination in all spheres of society, especially in  the\nfield of employment, education, healthcare etc.  Hijras/transgender persons\nface huge discrimination in  access  to  public  spaces  like  restaurants,\ncinemas, shops, malls etc.   Further, access to public toilets  is  also  a\nserious problem they face quite  often.    Since,  there  are  no  separate\ntoilet facilities for Hijras/transgender persons, they  have  to  use  male\ntoilets  where  they  are  prone  to   sexual   assault   and   harassment.\nDiscrimination on the ground of  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity,\ntherefore, impairs equality before law and  equal  protection  of  law  and\nviolates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\"><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_77\">ARTICLES 15</a> <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_78\">&amp; 16</a> AND TRANSGENDERS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">56.   <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_79\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_80\">16</a> prohibit discrimination  against  any  citizen  on\ncertain enumerated grounds, including the ground of ‘sex’.

Constitution makers, it can be gathered,  gave  emphasis  to\nthe fundamental right against sex  discrimination  so  as  to  prevent  the\ndirect or indirect attitude to treat people differently, for the reason  of\nnot being  in  conformity  with  stereotypical  generalizations  of  binary\ngenders.    Both  gender  and  biological  attributes  constitute  distinct\ncomponents  of  sex.   Biological  characteristics,  of   course,   include\ngenitals, chromosomes and secondary sexual features, but gender  attributes\ninclude one’s self image, the deep  psychological  or  emotional  sense  of\nsexual identity and character. The discrimination on the  ground  of  ‘sex’\nunder <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_86\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_87\">16</a>, therefore, includes discrimination on the  ground\nof gender identity.

We may, in this connection, refer to few judgments of the US  Supreme\nCourts on the rights of TG’s freedom of expression.  The Supreme  Court  of\nthe State of Illinois in the City of Chicago v.

Therefore, plaintiff’s expression is  not  merely  a  personal\n      preference but a necessary symbol of her identity.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">65.   Principles referred to above clearly  indicate  that  the  freedom  of\nexpression  guaranteed  under  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_102\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  includes  the  freedom  to\nexpress one’s chosen gender identity through varied ways and  means  by  way\nof expression, speech, mannerism, clothing etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">66.   Gender identity, therefore,  lies  at  the  core  of  one’s  personal\nidentity, gender expression and presentation and, therefore, it  will  have\nto be protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the  Constitution  of  India.   A\ntransgender’s personality could be expressed by the transgender’s  behavior\nand presentation.

Often the State and its authorities either due to  ignorance\nor otherwise fail to digest the  innate  character  and  identity  of  such\npersons.

Self-identified gender can  be  either  male  or  female  or  a  third\ngender.  Hijras are identified as  persons  of  third  gender  and  are  not\nidentified  either  as  male  or  female.   Gender  identity,   as   already\nindicated, refers to a person’s internal sense of being male,  female  or  a\ntransgender, for example Hijras do not identify as female because  of  their\nlack  of  female  genitalia  or  lack  of  reproductive  capability.    This\ndistinction makes them separate from both male and female genders  and  they\nconsider themselves neither man nor woman, but a  “third  gender”.   Hijras,\ntherefore, belong to a  distinct  socio-religious  and  cultural  group  and\nhave, therefore, to be considered as a “third gender”, apart from  male  and\nfemale. State of Punjab has treated all TGs as male  which  is  not  legally\nsustainable.  State of Tamil Nadu has  taken  lot  of  welfare  measures  to\nsafeguard the rights of TGs, which we have to acknowledge.  Few States  like\nKerala, Tripura, Bihar have referred TGs as “third gender or sex”.   Certain\nStates recognize them as “third category”.   Few  benefits  have  also  been\nextended by certain other  States.

Thus, the people other than ‘men’ and ‘women’,\n      including the people of ‘third gender’ cannot  be  discriminated.

We may remind ourselves of  the  historical  presence  of  the  third\ngender in this country as well as in the neighbouring countries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">74.   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 21</a>, as already  indicated,  protects  one’s  right  of  self-\ndetermination of the gender to which a person  belongs.   Determination  of\ngender to which a person belongs is to be decided by the person  concerned.\nIn other words, gender identity is integral to the dignity of an individual\nand is  at  the  core  of  “personal  autonomy”  and  “self-determination”.\nHijras/Eunuchs, therefore, have to be considered as Third Gender, over  and\nabove binary genders under our Constitution and the laws.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">75.   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_115\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_116\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_117\">, 16</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_118\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_119\">21</a>, above discussion, would indicate,  do\nnot exclude Hijras/Transgenders from its ambit, but Indian law on the whole\nrecognize the paradigm of binary genders of male and female, based on one’s\nbiological sex.   As  already  indicated,  we  cannot  accept  the  Corbett\nprinciple of “Biological Test”, rather we prefer to follow  the  psyche  of\nthe person in determining sex and  gender  and  prefer  the  “Psychological\nTest” instead of “Biological Test”.  Binary notion of  gender  reflects  in\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_120\">Indian Penal Code</a>, for example, <a href=\"/doc/75280406/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/191783789/\" id=\"a_122\">10</a>, etc.  and  also  in  the\nlaws related to marriage, adoption, divorce,  inheritance,  succession  and\nother welfare legislations like NAREGA, 2005, etc.  Non-recognition of  the\nidentity of Hijras/Transgenders in the  various  legislations  denies  them\nequal protection of law and they face wide-spread discrimination.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">76.   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 14</a> has used the expression “person” and the  <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_124\">Article  15</a>  has\nused the expression “citizen” and “sex” so also <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 16.</a>  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 19</a> has\nalso used the expression “citizen”.  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 21</a>  has  used  the  expression\n“person”.   All these expressions, which  are  “gender  neutral”  evidently\nrefer   to   human-beings.    Hence,   they   take   within   their   sweep\nHijras/Transgenders and are not as such limited to male or  female  gender.\nGender identity as already indicated forms the core of one’s personal self,\nbased on self identification, not on surgical or medical procedure.  Gender\nidentity, in our view, is an integral part of sex and  no  citizen  can  be\ndiscriminated on  the  ground  of  gender  identity,  including  those  who\nidentify as third gender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">77.   We, therefore, conclude that discrimination on the  basis  of  sexual\norientation or gender  identity  includes  any  discrimination,  exclusion,\nrestriction  or  preference,  which  has  the  effect  of   nullifying   or\ntransposing equality by the law or the equal protection of laws  guaranteed\nunder  our  Constitution,  and  hence  we  are  inclined  to  give  various\ndirections to safeguard the constitutional rights of the members of the  TG\ncommunity.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">                                                              ..………………………..J\n                                                        (K.S.

I  have  carefully,  and  with  lot  of  interest,  gone  through  the\nperspicuous opinion  of  my  brother  Radhakrishnan,J.   I  am  entirely  in\nagreement with the discussion contained in the  said  judgment  on  all  the\ncardinal issues that have arisen for consideration in these proceedings.  At\nthe same time, having regard to the fact that the  issues  involved  are  of\nseminal importance, I am also inclined to pen down my thoughts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">79.         As is clear, these  petitions  essentially  raise  an  issue  of\n“Gender Identity”, which is the core issue. It has two facets, viz.:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">      “(a)  Whether a person who is  born  as  a  male   with  predominantly\n      female orientation (or vice-versa),  has a right to get himself to  be\n      recognized as a female as per his choice moreso, when  such  a  person\n      after having undergone operational procedure, changes his/her  sex  as\n      well;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">      (b) Whether transgender (TG), who are neither males nor females,  have\n      a right to be identified and categorized as a “third gender”?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">80.   We would hasten to add that it is the second issue with which  we  are\nprimarily concerned in these petitions though in the process of  discussion,\nfirst issue which is somewhat inter-related, has also popped up.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">81.   Indubitably, the issue of  choice  of  gender  identify  has  all  the\ntrappings of a human rights. That  apart,  as  it  becomes  clear  from  the\nreading of the judgment of my esteemed Brother Radhakrishnan,J.,  the  issue\nis not limited to the exercise of choice of gender/sex.  Many  rights  which\nflow from this choice also  come into play, inasmuch  not  giving  them  the\nstatus of a third gender results in depriving the community of TGs  of  many\nof their valuable  rights  and  privileges  which  other  persons  enjoy  as\ncitizens of this Country. There is also deprivation of social  and  cultural\nparticipation which results into eclipsing their  access  to  education  and\nhealth  services.  Radhakrishnan,J.  has  exhaustively  described  the  term\n‘Transgender’ as an umbrella term which embraces within itself a wide  range\nof  identities  and  experiences  including  but   not   limited   to   pre-\noperative/post-operative trans sexual people who strongly identify with  the\ngender opposite to their biological sex i.e.  male/  female.   Therein,  the\nhistory of transgenders in India is also traced and while  doing  so,  there\nis mention of upon the draconian  legislation  enacted  during  the  British\nRule, known as <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_128\">Criminal  Tribes Act, 1871</a> which treated, per se, the  entire\ncommunity of  Hizra  persons  as  innately  ‘criminals’,  ‘addicted  to  the\nsystematic commission of non-bailable offences’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">82.   With these introductory  remarks,  I  revert  to  the  two  facets  of\npivotal importance mentioned above. Before embarking on  the  discussion,  I\nmay clarify that  my  endeavour  would  be  not  to  repeat  the  discussion\ncontained in the judgment of my Brother Radhakrishnan, J., as I  agree  with\nevery word written therein. However, at times, if some of  the  observations\nare re-narrated, that would be only with a view to bring continuity  in  the\nthought process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">      (1)   Re: Right of a person to have the gender of his/her choice.\n      When a child is born, at the time of birth itself, sex is assigned  to\nhim/her. A child would be treated with that sex thereafter,  i.e.  either  a\nmale or a female. However,  as  explained  in  detail  in  the  accompanying\njudgment, some persons, though relatively very small  in  number,  may  born\nwith bodies which incorporate both  or  certain  aspects  of  both  male  or\nfemale physiology. It may also happen that though a  person  is  born  as  a\nmale, because of some genital anatomy problems his innate perception may  be\nthat of a female and all his actions would be female oriented. The  position\nmay be exactly the opposite wherein a person born as female may behave  like\na male person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">83.   In earlier times though one could  observe  such  characteristics,  at\nthe same time the underlying rationale or reason behind such a behavior  was\nnot known. Over a period of time, with in depth study and research  of  such\nphysical and psychological factors bevaviour, the causes of  this  behaviour\nhave become discernable which in turn, has led to some changes  in  societal\nnorms. Society has starting accepting, though slowly,  these  have  accepted\nthe behavioral norms of  such  persons  without  treating  it  as  abnormal.\nFurther, medical science has leaped forward to  such  an  extent  that  even\nphysiology  appearance  of  a  person  can  be  changed   through   surgical\nprocedures, from male to female and vice-versa. In this way,  such   persons\nare able to acquire the body which is in conformity with the  perception  of\ntheir gender/gender characteristics.  In  order  to  ensure  that  law  also\nkeeps  pace  with  the  aforesaid  progress  in  medical  science,   various\ncountries have come out with Legislation conferring rights on  such  persons\nto recognize their gender identity based on reassigned sex after  undergoing\nSex Re-Assignment Surgery (SRS). Law and judgments given by  the  courts  in\nother countries have been exhaustively and grandiloquently traversed  by  my\nlearned Brother in his judgment, discussing amongst others,  the  Yogyakarta\nprinciples, the relevant provisions of the Universal  Declaration  of  Human\nRights 1948 and highlighting the  statutory  framework  operating  in  those\ncountries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">84.   The genesis of this recognition lies in the acknowledgment of  another\nfundamental and universal principal viz.  “right  of  choice”  given  to  an\nindividual which is the inseparable part of human rights.  It  is  a  matter\nof historical significance that the 20th Century is often described as  “the\nage of rights”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">85.   The most important lesson which was  learnt  as  a  result  of  Second\nWorld War was the realization by the Governments of various countries  about\nthe human dignity which needed to be cherished  and  protected.  It  is  for\nthis reason that in the U.N.Charter, 1945,  adopted  immediately  after  the\nSecond World War, dignity of  the  individuals  was  mentioned  as  of  core\nvalue. The almost contemporaneous  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights\n(1948) echoed same sentiments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_136\">86.    The  underlined  message  in   the   aforesaid   documents   is   the\nacknowledgment that human rights are individual and have a definite  linkage\nof human development, both sharing common vision and with a common  purpose.\nRespect for human rights is the root for human development  and  realization\nof  full  potential  of  each  individual,  which  in  turn  leads  to   the\naugmentation of human resources with progress of the nation. Empowerment  of\nthe people through human development is the aim of human rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">87.   There is thus a universal recognition that  human  rights  are  rights\nthat “belong” to every person, and do not depend on  the  specifics  of  the\nindividual or the relationship  between  the  right-holder  and  the  right-\ngrantor. Moreover, human rights exist irrespective of the  question  whether\nthey are granted or recognized by the legal and social system  within  which\nwe live. They are devices to evaluate these existing arrangements:  ideally,\nthese arrangements should not violate human rights. In  other  words,  human\nrights are moral, pre-legal rights. They are not granted by people  nor  can\nthey be taken away by them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">88.   In  international  human  rights  law,  equality  is  found  upon  two\ncomplementary     principles:     non-discrimination     and      reasonable\ndifferentiation. The principle of non-discrimination seeks  to  ensure  that\nall persons can equally enjoy and exercise all their  rights  and  freedoms.\nDiscrimination occurs due to arbitrary denial  of  opportunities  for  equal\nparticipation. For example, when public facilities and services are  set  on\nstandards out of the reach of the TGs, it leads to exclusion and  denial  of\nrights. Equality not only implies preventing  discrimination  (example,  the\nprotection of individuals  against  unfavourable  treatment  by  introducing\nanti- discrimination laws), but  goes  beyond  in  remedying  discrimination\nagainst groups suffering systematic discrimination in society.  In  concrete\nterms, it means embracing the notion of positive rights, affirmative  action\nand reasonable accommodation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">89.   Nevertheless, the Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights  recognizes\nthat all human beings are born free and equal in  dignity  and  rights  and,\nsince the Covenant’s provisions apply  fully  to  all  members  of  society,\npersons with disabilities are clearly entitled to the full range  of  rights\nrecognized in the Covenant. Moreover, the requirement contained  in  <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_129\">Article\n2</a> of the Covenant that the  rights  enunciated  will  be  exercised  without\ndiscrimination of any kind based  on  certain  specified  grounds  or  other\nstatus clearly applies to cover persons with disabilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">90.   India attained independence  within  two  years  of  adoption  of  the\naforesaid U.N.Charter and it was but natural that  such  a  Bill  of  Rights\nwould assume prime importance insofar as thinking  of  the  members  of  the\nConstituent  Assembly  goes.  It  in  fact  did  and  we  found  chapter  on\nfundamental rights in Part-III of the Constitution. It is not necessary  for\nme, keeping in view the topic of today’s discussion, to embark  on  detailed\ndiscussion on Chapter-III. Some of the provisions relevant for our  purposes\nwould be <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 14</a>, 15,16 and 21 of the  Constitution  which  have  already\nbeen adverted to in detail in the accompanying judgment.  At  this  juncture\nit also needs to be emphasized simultaneously is that  in  addition  to  the\nfundamental rights, Constitution makers also  deemed  it  proper  to  impose\ncertain obligations on the State in the form  of  “Directive  Principles  of\nState Policy” (Part-IV) as a mark of good governance. It is this part  which\nprovides an ideal and purpose to our  Constitution  and  delineates  certain\nprinciples  which  are  fundamental  in  the  governance  of  the   country.\nDr.Ambedkar had explained the purpose of these Directive Principles  in  the\nfollowing manner (See Constituent Assembly debates):\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">                  “The Directive Principles  are  like  the  Instruments  of\n           Instructions which were issued to the  Governor-General  and  the\n           Governors of Colonies, and to  those  of  India  by  the  British\n           Government under the 1935 <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_131\">Government of India Act</a>. What is called\n           “Directive Principles” is merely another name for the  Instrument\n           of  Instructions.  The  only  difference   is   that   they   are\n           instructions  to  the  legislature  and  the  executive.  Whoever\n           capture power will not be free to do what he likes  with  it.  In\n           the exercise of it he will have to respect these  instruments  of\n           instructions which are called Directive Principles”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\"> 91.  The basic spirit of our Constitution is  to  provide  each  and  every\n person  of  the  nation  equal  opportunity  to  grow  as  a  human  being,\n irrespective  of  race,  caste,  religion,  community  and  social  status.\n Granville Austin while analyzing the functioning of Indian Constitution  in\n first  50  years  ha  described  three  distinguished  strands  of   Indian\n Constitution: (i)protecting national unity and integrity,  (ii)establishing\n the institution  and  spirit  of  democracy;  and  (iii)  fostering  social\n reforms. The Strands are mutually dependent, and  inextricably  intertwined\n in what he elegantly describes as “a seamless web”.  And  there  cannot  be\n social reforms till it is ensured that  each  and  every  citizen  of  this\n country  is  able  to  exploit  his/her  potentials  to  the  maximum.  The\n Constitution, although drafted by the Constituent Assembly, was  meant  for\n the people of India and that is why it is given by the people to themselves\n as expressed in the opening  words  “We  the  People”.  What  is  the  most\n important  gift  to  the  common  person  given  by  this  Constitution  is\n “fundamental rights” which may be called Human Rights as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">92.

The  common  golden   thread   which   passes   through   all   these\npronouncements is that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_161\">Art.21</a> guarantees enjoyment of life by  all  citizens\nof this country with dignity, viewing this human rights in  terms  of  human\ndevelopment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">98.   The concepts of justice social, economic and  political,  equality  of\nstatus and  of  opportunity  and  of  assuring  dignity  of  the  individual\nincorporated in the Preamble, clearly recognize  the right of  one  and  all\namongst the citizens of  these  basic  essentials  designed  to  flower  the\ncitizen’s personality to its fullest. The  concept  of  equality  helps  the\ncitizens in reaching their highest potential.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">99.   Thus, the emphasis is on the  development  of  an  individual  in  all\nrespects. The basic principle of the dignity and freedom of  the  individual\nis common to all nations,  particularly  those  having  democratic  set  up.\nDemocracy requires us to respect and develop the free spirit of human  being\nwhich is responsible for all progress in human history. Democracy is also  a\nmethod by which we attempt to raise the living standard of  the  people  and\nto give opportunities to every person to develop his/her personality. It  is\nfounded on peaceful co-existence and cooperative  living.  If  democracy  is\nbased on the recognition of the individuality  and  dignity  of  man,  as  a\nfortiori we have to recognize the right of  a  human  being  to  choose  his\nsex/gender identity which is integral his/her personality and is one of  the\nmost basic aspect of self-determination dignity and freedom. In fact,  there\nis a growing recognition that the true measure of development  of  a  nation\nis not economic growth; it is human dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">100.    More than 225 years ago, Immanuel Kant propounded  the  doctrine  of\nfree will, namely the free  willing  individual  as  a  natural  law  ideal.\nWithout going into the detail analysis of his aforesaid  theory  of  justice\n(as we are not concerned with the analysis of  his  jurisprudence)  what  we\nwant to point out is his emphasis on the “freedom” of human  volition.   The\nconcepts of volition  and  freedom  are  “pure”,  that  is  not  drawn  from\nexperience. They are independent of any particular body of  moral  or  legal\nrules. They are presuppositions of all such rules, valid and  necessary  for\nall of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">101.    Over a period of time, two divergent interpretations of the  Kantian\ncriterion of justice came to be discussed.   One  trend  was  an  increasing\nstress on the maximum of individual freedom of action as  the  end  of  law.\nThis may not be accepted and was criticized by the protagonist of  ‘hedonist\nutilitarianism’, notably Benthem. This school of thoughts laid  emphasis  on\nthe welfare of the society rather than  an  individual  by  propounding  the\nprinciple of maximum of happiness to most of  the  people.  Fortunately,  in\nthe instant case,  there  is  no  such  dichotomy  between  the   individual\nfreedom/liberty we are discussing, as against public good. On the  contrary,\ngranting the right to  choose  gender  leads  to  public  good.  The  second\ntendency of Kantian  criterion  of  justice  was  found  in  re-interpreting\n“freedom” in terms not merely of  absence  of  restraint  but  in  terms  of\nattainment of individual perfection. It is this latter trend with  which  we\nare concerned in the present  case  and  this  holds  good  even  today.  As\npointed out above, after the Second World War, in the  form  of  U.N.Charter\nand thereafter there is  more  emphasis  on  the  attainment  of  individual\nperfection. In that united sense at least there is a revival of natural  law\ntheory of justice. Blackstone, in the  opening  pages  in  his    ‘Vattelian\nFashion’ said that the principal aim of society “is to  protect  individuals\nin the enjoyment of those absolute rights which were vested in them  by  the\nimmutable laws of nature……”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">102.  In fact, the recognition that every individual has  fundamental  right\nto achieve the fullest potential, is  founded  on  the  principle  that  all\nround growth of an individual leads to common public good. After all,  human\nbeings are also valuable asset of any country who contribute to  the  growth\nand welfare of their nation and the society. A person who  is  born  with  a\nparticular sex and his forced to grow up identifying with that sex, and  not\na  sex  that  his/her  psychological   behavior   identifies   with,   faces\ninnumerable obstacles in growing up. In an article appeared in the  magazine\n“Eye” of the Sunday Indian Express (March 9-15, 2014) a  person  born  as  a\nboy but with trappings of female ( who  is  now  a  female  after  SRS)  has\nnarrated     these     difficulties     in     the     following     manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">            “The other children treated me as a boy, but I preferred playing\n           with girls. Unfortunately, grown-ups consider that okay  only  as\n           long as you are a small child. The constant inner  conflict  made\n           things difficult for me and, as I  grew  up,  I  began  to  dread\n           social interactions”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">103.    Such a person, carrying dual entity simultaneously, would  encounter\nmental and psychological difficulties  which  would  hinder  his/her  normal\nmental and even physical growth. It is not even easy for such  a  person  to\ntake a decision to undergo SRS procedure which requires strong mental  state\nof affairs. However, once that is decided and the sex  is  changed  in  tune\nwith psychological behavior, it  facilitates  spending  the  life  smoothly.\nEven the process of transition is not smooth.       The  transition  from  a\nman to a woman is not  an  overnight  process.  It  is  a  “painfully”  long\nprocedure that requires a lot of  patience.  A  person  must  first  undergo\nhormone therapy and, if possible, live as a member of the desired sex for  a\nwhile. To be eligible for hormone therapy, the person  needs  at  least  two\npsychiatrists  to  certify  that  he  or  she   is   mentally   sound,   and\nschizophrenia, depression and transvestism have to be ruled out  first.  The\npsychiatric evaluation involved a serious a questions on how  Sunaina  felt,\nwhen she got to know of her confusion and need for sex change,  whether  she\nis a recluse, her socio-economic condition, among other things.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">104.     In the same article appearing in the “Eye”  <a href=\"/doc/595461/\" id=\"a_162\">referred to above</a>,  the\nperson who had undergone the operation and became a complete  girl,  Sunaina\n(name changed) narrates the benefit which ensued because of change  in  sex,\nin harmony with her emotional and psychological character, as is clear  from\nthe following passage in that article:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">            “Like many other single people in the city, she can spend  hours\n          watching Friends, and reading thrillers and Harry Potter.    A new\n          happiness has taken seed in her and she says it does not feel that\n          she ever had a male body. “I am a person who likes to laugh.  Till\n          my surgery, behind every smile of mine, there was a struggle.  Now\n          it’s about time that I laughed  for  real.  I  have  never  had  a\n          relationship in my life, because somewhere, I always wanted to  be\n          treated as a girl.   Now, that I am a woman, I am open  to  a  new\n          life, new relationships. I don’t have to  hide  anymore,  I  don’t\n          feel trapped anymore. I love coding and my job. I love cooking.  I\n          am learning French and when my left foot recovers fully, I plan to\n          learn dancing. And, for the first time this year, I will vote with\n          my new name. I am looking forward to that,” she says.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_167\">105.     If a person has changed his/her sex in  tune  with  his/her  gender\ncharacteristics and perception ,which has become  possible  because  of  the\nadvancement in medical science, and when that is  permitted  by  in  medical\nethics with no legal embargo, we  do  not  find  any  impediment,  legal  or\notherwise, in giving due recognition to the gender  identity  based  on  the\nreassign sex after undergoing SRS.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">106.    For these reasons, we are of the opinion that even  in  the  absence\nof any statutory regime in this  country,  a  person  has  a  constitutional\nright to get the recognition as male or female  after  SRS,  which  was  not\nonly his/her gender characteristic but has become his/her physical  form  as\nwell.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">      (2) Re: Right of  TG  to  be  identified  and  categorized  as  “third\ngender”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_170\">107.    At the outset, it may be clarified that the  term  ‘transgender’  is\nused in a wider sense, in the present age.  Even Gay, Lesbian, bisexual  are\nincluded  by  the  descriptor  ‘transgender’.   Etymologically,   the   term\n‘transgender’ is derived  from  two  words,  namely  ‘trans’  and  ‘gender’.\nFormer is a Latin word which means ‘across’  or  ‘beyond’.  The  grammatical\nmeaning of ‘transgender’, therefore, is across or beyond  gender.  This  has\ncome to be  known  as  umbrella  term  which  includes  Gay  men,  Lesbians,\nbisexuals, and cross dressers within its scope. However, while dealing  with\nthe present issue we are not concerned with this aforesaid wider meaning  of\nthe expression transgender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">108.    It is to be  emphasized  that  Transgender  in  India  have  assumed\ndistinct and separate class/category which is not prevalent in  other  parts\nof the World except in some neighbouring countries .  In  this  country,  TG\ncommunity comprise of  Hijaras, enunch, Kothis,  Aravanis,  Jogappas,  Shiv-\nShakthis etc.  In Indian community transgender are referred as Hizra or  the\nthird gendered  people.  There  exists  wide  range  of  transgender-related\nidentities, cultures, or experience  –including  Hijras,  Aravanis,  Kothis,\njogtas/Jogappas, and Shiv-Shakthis (Hijras: They are  biological  males  who\nreject their masculinity identity in due course of time to  identify  either\nas women,  or  ‘not  men’.  Aravanis:  Hijras  in  Tamil  Nadu  identify  as\n‘Aravani’. Kothi: Kothis are heterogeneous group. Kothis  can  be  described\nas   biological   males   who   show   varying   degrees   of    ‘feminity’.\nJogtas/Jogappas: They are those who are dedicated to  serve  as  servant  of\nGoddess  Renukha  Devi  whose  temples  are  present  in   Maharashtra   and\nKarnataka. Sometimes, Jogti Hijras are used to  denote  such  male-to-female\ntransgender persons who are devotees of Goddess Renukha and  are  also  from\nthe Hijra community. Shiv-Shakthis: They are considered  as  males  who  are\npossessed by or particularly close  to  a  goddess  and  who  have  feminine\ngender expression). The way they behave and acts differs from the  normative\ngender role of a men and women.  For  them,  furthering  life  is  far  more\ndifficult since such people are neither categorized as  men  nor  women  and\nthis deviation is unacceptable to  society’s  vast  majority.  Endeavour  to\nlive a life with dignity is even worse. Obviously transvestites,  the  hijra\nbeg from merchants who quickly, under threat of obscene  abuse,  respond  to\nthe silent demands of such detested  individuals.  On  occasion,  especially\nfestival days, they press their claims with boisterous  and  ribald  singing\nand dancing.( A Right to Exist: Eunuchs and the State in  Nineteenth-Century\nIndia Laurence W. Preston Modern Asian Studies, Vol.21,No.2 (1987),  pp.371-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">387).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_173\">109.    Therefore, we make it clear at  the  outset  that  when  we  discuss\nabout the question of conferring distinct identity, we  are  restrictive  in\nour meaning which has to be given  to  TG  community  i.e.  hijra  etc.,  as\nexplained above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">110.    Their historical background and individual scenario has been  stated\nin detail in the accompanying judgment rendered by my learned  Brother.  Few\nthings which follow from this discussion are summed up below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">      “(a) Though in the past TG in India was treated  with  great  respect,\n      that does not remain the  scenario  any  longer.  Attrition  in  their\n      status was triggered with the passing of the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_163\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a>\n      which deemed the  entire  community  of  Hijara  persons  as  innately\n      ‘criminal’ and ‘adapted to the systematic commission  of  non-bailable\n      offences’. This dogmatism and indoctrination  of  Indian  people  with\n      aforesaid presumption, was totally  capricious  and  nefarious.  There\n      could not have been more  harm  caused  to  this  community  with  the\n      passing of the aforesaid brutal Legislation during British Regime with\n      the vicious and savage this mind set. To add insult to the irreparable\n      injury caused, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code  was  misused  and\n      abused as there was a tendency,  in  British  period,  to  arrest  and\n      prosecute TG persons under Section 377 merely on suspicion. To undergo\n      this sordid historical harm caused to TGs of India, there  is  a  need\n      for incessant efforts with effervescence.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">      (b) There may  have  been  marginal  improvement  in  the  social  and\n      economic condition of TGs  in India. It is still far from satisfactory\n      and these TGs continue to face different kinds  of  economic  blockade\n      and social degradation. They still face multiple forms  of  oppression\n      in this country. Discrimination qua them  is  clearly  discernable  in\n      various fields including health care,  employment,  education,  social\n      cohesion etc.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">      (c) The TGs are also citizens of this country. They  also  have  equal\n      right to achieve their  full  potential  as  human  beings.  For  this\n      purpose, not only  they  are  entitled  to  proper  education,  social\n      assimilation,  access  to  public  and  other  places  but  employment\n      opportunities as well. The discussion above  while  dealing  with  the\n      first issue,  therefore,  equally  applies  to  this  issue  as  well.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">111.     We are of the firm opinion that by recognizing such  TGs  as  third\ngender, they would be able to enjoy their human rights, to  which  they  are\nlargely deprived of for want of this recognition. As  mentioned  above,  the\nissue of transgender is not merely a social or medical issue but there is  a\nneed to adopt human right approach towards transgenders which may  focus  on\nfunctioning as  an  interaction  between  a  person  and  their  environment\nhighlighting the role of society and changing the stigma attached  to  them.\nTGs face many disadvantages due to various reasons, particularly for  gender\nabnormality which in certain level needs to physical and mental  disability.\nUp  till  recently  they  were  subjected  to  cruelty,  pity  or   charity.\nFortunately, there is a  paradigm  shift  in  thinking  from  the  aforesaid\napproach to a rights based approach. Though, this may  be  the  thinking  of\nhuman rights activist, the society has not kept pace with this shift.  There\nappears to be limited public knowledge and understanding of same-sex  sexual\norientation and people whose gender identity and expression are  incongruent\nwith their biological sex. As a result of this approach,  such  persons  are\nsocially excluded from the mainstream of the society  and  they  are  denied\nequal access to those fundamental rights and freedoms that the other  people\nenjoy freely.(See, Hijras/Transgender Women in India: HIV, Human Rights  and\nSocial  Exclusion,  UNDP   report   on   India   Issue:   December,   2010).\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">112.    Some of the  common  and  reported  problem  that  transgender  most\ncommonly suffer are: harassment by the police in public  places,  harassment\nat home, police entrapment, rape, discriminations, abuse  in  public  places\net.al.  The other major problems that the transgender people face  in  their\ndaily life are discrimination,  lack  of  educational  facilities,  lack  of\nmedical facilities, homelessness,  unemployment,  depression,  hormone  pill\nabuse, tobacco and alcohol abuse,  and  problems  related  to  marriage  and\nadoption. In spite of the adoption of Universal Declaration of Human  Rights\n(UDHR) in the year 1948, the inherent dignity, equality, respect and  rights\nof all human beings throughout the world, the transgender are  denied  basic\nhuman rights. This denial is premised on a  prevalent  juridical  assumption\nthat the law should target discrimination based  on  sex  (i.e.,  whether  a\nperson is  anatomically male or female), rather than gender  (i.e.,  whether\na  person  has  qualities  that  society  consider  masculine  or   feminine\n(Katherine M.Franke, The Central Mistake  of  Sex  Discrimination  Law:  the\nDisaggregation of Sex from Gender, 144 U.Pa.Rev.1,3 (1995) (arguing that  by\ndefining sex in biological terms, the law  has  failed  to  distinguish  sex\nfrom  gender,  and  sexual   differentiation   from   sex   discrimination).\nTransgender people are generally excluded from the society and people  think\ntransgenderism as a medical disease. Much  like  the  disability,  which  in\nearlier times was considered as an illness but later on  looked  upon  as  a\nright based approach. The question whether transgenderism is  a  disease  is\nhotly debated in both the transgender and  medical-psychiatric  communities.\nBut a prevalent view regarding this is that transgenderism is not a  disease\nat all, but a benign normal variant of the human experience  akin  to  left-\nhandedness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">113.    Therefore, gender identification becomes  very  essential  component\nwhich is required for enjoying civil rights by this community.  It  is  only\nwith this recognition that many rights attached to  the  sexual  recognition\nas ‘third gender’ would be available to  this  community  more  meaningfully\nviz. the right to vote, the right to own property, the right to  marry,  the\nright to claim a formal identity through a passport and  a  ration  card,  a\ndriver’s license, the right to education, employment, health so on.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_178\">114.    Further, there seems to be no  reason  why  a  transgender  must  be\ndenied of basic human rights which includes Right to life and  liberty  with\ndignity, Right to Privacy and freedom of expression, Right to Education  and\nEmpowerment, Right against violence, Right against  Exploitation  and  Right\nagainst Discrimination. Constitution has fulfilled  its  duty  of  providing\nrights to transgenders.  Now it’s time for  us  to  recognize  this  and  to\nextend and  interpret  the  Constitution  in  such  a  manner  to  ensure  a\ndignified life of transgender people.  All  this  can  be  achieved  if  the\nbeginning is made with the recognition that TG as third gender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">115.    In order to translate the aforesaid rights of TGs into  reality,  it\nbecomes imperative to first assign them their proper  ‘sex’.  As  is  stated\nearlier, at the time of birth of a child itself, sex is  assigned.  However,\nit is either male or female. In the process, the society  as  well  as  law,\nhas completely ignored the basic human right  of  TGs  to  give  them  their\nappropriate sex categorization. Up to now, they have either been treated  as\nmale or female. This is not only improper as  it  is  far  from  truth,  but\nindignified to these   TGs and violates their human rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">116.     Though there may not be any  statutory  regime  recognizing  ‘third\ngender’ for these TGs. However, we find enough  justification  to  recognize\nthis right of theirs in natural law sphere. Further,  such  a  justification\ncan be traced to the  various  provisions  contained  in  Part  III  of  the\nConstitution relating to ‘Fundamental Rights’. In addition to  the  powerful\njustification accomplished  in  the  accompanying  opinion  of  my  esteemed\nBrother,  additional  raison  d’etre   for   this   conclusion   is   stated\nhereinafter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">117.    We are in the age of democracy, that  too  substantive  and  liberal\ndemocracy. Such a democracy is not  based  solely  on  the  rule  of  people\nthrough their representatives’ namely formal democracy. It  also  has  other\npercepts  like  Rule  of  Law,  human  rights,  independence  of  judiciary,\nseparation of powers etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">118.    There is a recognition to the hard realty  that  without  protection\nfor human rights  there  can  be  no  democracy  and  no  justification  for\ndemocracy. In this scenario, while working within the  realm  of  separation\nof powers (which is also fundamental  to  the  substantive  democracy),  the\njudicial role is not only to decide the dispute before  the  Court,  but  to\nuphold the rule of law and ensure access  to  justice  to  the  marginalized\nsection of the  society.  It  cannot  be  denied  that  TGs  belong  to  the\nunprivileged class which is a marginalized section.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">119.  The role of the Court is to understand the central purpose  and  theme\nof the Constitution for the welfare of the society. Our  Constitution,  like\nthe law of the society, is a living organism.  It is based on a factual  and\nsocial realty that is constantly changing. Sometimes a  change  in  the  law\nprecedes societal change and is even intended to stimulate it. Sometimes,  a\nchange in the law is the result in the social realty. When we discuss  about\nthe rights of TGs in the constitutional context, we find that  in  order  to\nbring about complete paradigm shift,  law  has  to  play  more  pre-dominant\nrole. As TGs in India,  are  neither  male  nor  female,  treating  them  as\nbelonging to either of the aforesaid categories,  is  the  denial  of  these\nconstitutional rights. It is the denial of social justice which in turn  has\nthe effect of denying political and economic justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">120.  In Dattatraya Govind Mahajan vs. State of  Maharashtra  (AIR  1977  SC\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">915) this Court observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">                  “Our Constitution is a tryst with destiny,  preamble  with\n           luscent solemnity in the words ‘Justice –  social,  economic  and\n           political.’ The three great branches of Government, as  creatures\n           of  the  Constitution,  must  remember  this  promise  in   their\n           fundamental role and forget it at their peril, for to do so  will\n           be a betrayal of chose high values and goals  which  this  nation\n           set for itself in its objective Resolution  and  whose  elaborate\n           summation appears in Part IV  of  the  Paramount  Parchment.  The\n           history of our country’s struggle for independence was the  story\n           of a battle between the forces of socio-economic exploitation and\n           the  masses  of  deprived  people  of  varying  degrees  and  the\n           Constitution sets the new sights of the  nation…..Once  we  grasp\n           the dharma of the Constitution, the new orientation of the  karma\n           of adjudication becomes clear. Our founding fathers, aware of our\n           social realities,  forged  our  fighting  faith  and  integrating\n           justice in its social,  economic  and  political  aspects.  While\n           contemplating the meaning of the Articles of the Organic Law, the\n           Supreme Court shall not disown Social Justice.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">121.    Oliver Wendlle Holmes said: “the life of law has  been  logical;  it\nhas been experience”.  It may be added that ‘the life of  law  is  not  just\nlogic or experience. The life of law is renewable based  on  experience  and\nlogic, which adapted law to the new social realty’. Recognizing  this  fact,\nthe aforesaid provisions of the Constitution are required to  be  given  new\nand dynamic meaning with the inclusion of rights of TGs  as  well.  In  this\nprocess, the first and foremost right is to recognize TGs as ‘third  gender’\nin law as well. This is a recognition of their right of  equality  enshrined\nin <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_165\">Art.14</a> as well as their human right to life with dignity,  which  is  the\nmandate of the  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_166\">Art.21</a>  of  the  Constitution.  This  interpretation  is  in\nconsonance with new social needs. By doing so, this Court is  only  bridging\nthe gap between the law and life and that is the primary role of  the  Court\nin a democracy. It only amounts to giving purposive  interpretation  to  the\naforesaid provisions of the  Constitution  so  that  it  can  adapt  to  the\nchanges in realty. Law without purpose has no raison d’etre. The purpose  of\nlaw is the evolution of a happy society. As Justice Iyer has aptly put:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">                                                         “The purpose of law\n           is the establishment of the welfare of  society  “and  a  society\n           whose members enjoy welfare and happiness may be described  as  a\n           just society. It is a  negation  of  justice  to  say  that  some\n           members, some groups, some minorities, some  individuals  do  not\n           have welfare: on the other hand they suffer from ill-fare. So  it\n           is axiomatic that law, if it is to fulfil itself, must produce  a\n           contented, dynamic society which is at once meting out justice to\n           its members.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">122.  It is now very well recognized  that  the  Constitution  is  a  living\ncharacter; its interpretation must be dynamic. It must be  understood  in  a\nway that  intricate  and  advances  modern  realty.  The  judiciary  is  the\nguardian of the Constitution and by ensuring to grant legitimate right  that\nis due to TGs, we are simply protecting the Constitution and  the  democracy\ninasmuch as judicial protection  and  democracy  in  general  and  of  human\nrights in particular is a characteristic of our vibrant democracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_188\">123.    As we have pointed out above, our Constitution inheres  liberal  and\nsubstantive democracy with  rule of law  as  an  important  and  fundamental\npillar. It has its own internal morality based on dignity  and  equality  of\nall human beings.  Rule  of  law  demands  protection  of  individual  human\nrights.  Such rights are to be guaranteed to each  and  every  human  being.\nThese TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings  and\ntherefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">124.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"767216\" id=\"span_39\">In <a href=\"/doc/767216/\" id=\"a_167\">National Human Rights Commission vs. State of  Arunachal  Pradesh</a>\n(AIR 1996 SC 1234), This Court observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">                 “We are a  country  governed  by  the  Rule  of  Law.

Every person  is  entitled  to\n           equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_190\">125.    The rule of law is not merely public order.   The  rule  of  law  is\nsocial justice based on public  order.  The  law  exists  to  ensure  proper\nsocial life. Social life, however, is not a goal in itself but  a  means  to\nallow the individual to life in dignity and development himself.  The  human\nbeing and human rights underlie this substantive perception of the  rule  of\nlaw, with a proper balance among the  different  rights  and  between  human\nrights and the proper needs of society. The substantive rule of law “is  the\nrule  of  proper  law,  which  balances  the  needs  of  society   and   the\nindividual.” This is  the  rule  of  law  that  strikes  a  balance  between\nsociety’s  need  for  political  independence,  social  equality,   economic\ndevelopment, and internal order, on the one  hand,  and  the  needs  of  the\nindividual, his personal liberty, and his human dignity on the other. It  is\nthe duty of the Court to protect this rich concept of the rule of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_191\">126.    By  recognizing  TGs  as  third  gender,  this  Court  is  not  only\nupholding the rule of law but also advancing justice to the  class,  so  far\ndeprived of their legitimate  natural  and  constitutional  rights.  It  is,\ntherefore, the only just solution which ensures justice not only to TGs  but\nalso justice to the society as well. Social justice does not  mean  equality\nbefore law in papers but  to  translate  the  spirit  of  the  Constitution,\nenshrined  in  the  Preamble,  the  Fundamental  Rights  and  the  Directive\nPrinciples of State Policy into action, whose arms are long enough to  bring\nwithin its reach and embrace this right of  recognition  to  the  TGs  which\nlegitimately belongs to them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">127.    Aristotle opined that  treating  all  equal  things  equal  and  all\nunequal things unequal amounts to justice. Kant was of the view that at  the\nbasis of all conceptions of justice, no matter  which  culture  or  religion\nhas inspired them, lies the golden rule that you should treat others as  you\nwould want everybody to  treat  everybody  else,  including  yourself.  When\nLocke conceived of individual liberties, the  individuals  he  had  in  mind\nwere independently rich males. Similarly, Kant thought of economically self-\nsufficient males as the only  possible  citizens  of  a  liberal  democratic\nstate. These theories may not be  relevant  in  today’s  context  as  it  is\nperceived that the bias of their perspective is all too obvious  to  us.  In\npost-traditional liberal democratic theories  of   justice,  the  background\nassumption is that  humans  have  equal  value  and  should,  therefore,  be\ntreated as equal, as well as  by  equal  laws.  This  can  be  described  as\n‘Reflective Equilibrium’. The method of  Reflective  Equilibrium  was  first\nintroduced by  Nelson  Goodman  in  ‘Fact,  Fiction  and  Forecast’  (1955).\nHowever,  it  is  John  Rawls  who  elaborated  this  method  of  Reflective\nEquilibrium by introducing the conception of ‘Justice as Fairness’.  In  his\n‘Theory of Justice’, Rawls has proposed a model  of  just  institutions  for\ndemocratic societies. Herein he draws on certain pre-theoretical  elementary\nmoral beliefs (‘considered judgments’), which he  assumes  most  members  of\ndemocratic societies would accept. “[Justice as fairness [….] tries to  draw\nsolely upon basic  intuitive  ideas  that  are  embedded  in  the  political\ninstitutions  of  a  constitutional  democratic  regime   and   the   public\ntraditions of their interpretations. Justice  as  fairness  is  a  political\nconception in part  because  it  starts  from  within  a  certain  political\ntradition. Based on this preliminary understanding of just  institutions  in\na democratic society, Rawls aims at a set of universalistic rules  with  the\nhelp of which the justice of present formal and  informal  institutions  can\nbe assessed. The  ensuing  conception  of  justice  is  called  ‘justice  as\nfairness’.  When we combine Rawls’s notion of Justice as Fairness  with  the\nnotions of Distributive Justice, to which Noble Laureate Prof.  Amartya  Sen\nhas also subscribed, we get jurisprudential basis for doing justice  to  the\nVulnerable Groups which definitely include TGs. Once  it  is  accepted  that\nthe TGs are also part of vulnerable groups and marginalized section  of  the\nsociety, we are only bringing them  within  the  fold  of  aforesaid  rights\nrecognized in respect of other classes falling in  the  marginalized  group.\nThis is the minimum riposte in an attempt to  assuage  the       insult  and\ninjury suffered by them so  far  as  to  pave  way  for  fast  tracking  the\nrealization of their human rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_193\">128.    The aforesaid, thus, are my  reasons  for  treating  TGs  as  ‘third\ngender’ for the purposes of safeguarding and enforcing  appropriately  their\nrights guaranteed under the Constitution. These are my  reasons  in  support\nof our Constitution to the two issues in these petitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">                                                                 …………………….J.\n                                              (A.K.Sikri)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_195\">129.
