It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                             3</span>\n\n\n\n\nbecause these petitioners have been denied such accommodation that\n\nthey are before this Court for an appropriate direction to the\n\nrespondents Central Selection Board i.e respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for\n\nextending the date of physical evaluation test for a reasonable period\n\nso that they are in a position to participate in the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">      Since all these writ petitions raise common issues of interest\n\nand even the relief prayed is common that they have been heard\n\nanalogous and with the consent of the parties are being disposed of at\n\nthe stage of admission itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      The facts are in a very narrow compass. An advertisement was\n\nissued by the respondent Central Selection Board on 31.7.2015, a\n\ncopy of which is enclosed at Annexure-B to the counter affidavit\n\ninviting applications from intending applicants seeking appointment\n\nto the post of Jail Warders in the scale of Rs. 5200-20200 +Grade pay\n\nof 1900. The vacancies were notified at 2649 and the last date for\n\nreceiving application was fixed on 24.9.2015. The mode for selection\n\nprocess was inclusive of a written test as well as physical evaluation\n\ntest which the candidates had to pass besides the medical evaluation\n\non height and other requirements. These petitioners conscious of the\n\nselection process applied against the same. A notice in connection\n\nwith the written test was issued on 30.8.2016 i.e 13 months later,\n\nfixing the date of written examination on 18.9.2016. The petitioners\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                            4</span>\n\n\n\n\nparticipated and were declared successful. Annexure-C is a notice\n\ndeclaring the result of the written test which was put up on the website\n\nand by the same notice the applicants were informed about the\n\nphysical evaluation test to be held on 9.1.2017 for which the\n\nscreening/medical test examination was to take place on 15.12.2016.\n\nThose who could not participate in the same on 15.12.2016 were\n\ngiven to participate on 6th and 7th of January, 2017. As already noted\n\nthe physical evaluation test was to take place on 9.1.2017. Since these\n\npetitioners during the intervening period were well set on way to\n\nmotherhood that they approached the Central Selection Board for\n\naccommodating them by postponement of date of physical evaluation\n\ntest as they were in their advanced stage of pregnancy but their\n\nrequest was not accepted leading to the present batch of writ petitions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">      While the arguments on behalf of the petitioners are led by Mr.\n\nYogesh Chandra Verma, learned Senior counsel who appears along\n\nwith Ms. Prem Sheela Pandey, Mr. Jitendra Kumar Roy and Mr.\n\nRajesh Kumar learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Md. Nadeem\n\nSeraj learned counsel appears for the State in C.W.J.C.No.604 of 2017\n\nand C.W.J.C.No.2267 of 2017, while Mr. Ujjawal Kumar Sinha\n\nlearned assisting counsel to AAG III appears on behalf of the State in\n\nC.W.J.C.No.1167 of 2017. The Central Selection Board (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as „the Board‟) is represented by Mr. Sanjay Pandey in all\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                             5</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe three writ petitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">      It is the argument of learned counsel for the petitioners that\n\neven though the advertisement was issued on 31.7.2015 and duly\n\nintimated the applicants about the tests they had to go through, which\n\nincluded the physical evaluation test but neither the date of written\n\ntest was mentioned in the advertisement nor the applicants were given\n\nany information about the date of the physical evaluation test. It is\n\njointly submitted that it is after more than 13 months delay that the\n\nrespondent „Board‟ notified the date of written test on 30.8.2016 and\n\nit is during this period that these petitioners took a step into\n\nmotherhood and thus made a request for their accommodation on the\n\ndate of physical test. It is submitted that had the date of the written\n\nand physical test been notified in the advertisement, the petitioners\n\nwould have been ready for the challenge but in absence of any definite\n\ninformation in this regard in the advertisement, it is highly unjust for\n\nthe respondents to expect that the petitioners should have avoided the\n\nsituation until the selection process was over. It is submitted that the\n\npetitioners were fully qualified to participate in the two tests on the\n\ndate they filed their respective application(s) and thus their change in\n\nphysical/medical condition in between the date of advertisement and\n\nthe date of written/physical test which was notified after a delay of 13\n\nmonths should not be treated as an obstacle in their career pursuit.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                             6</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">       It is in reference to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nsubmitted that the refusal by the „Board‟ to accommodate the\n\npetitioners in the circumstances existing, strikes at the very root of the\n\nconstitutional guarantee. It is the argument of learned counsel that\n\neven though a woman‟s right to procreate stands recognized under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution but even otherwise, had the respondents\n\nnotified the date of written/physical test in the advertisement itself, the\n\npetitioners could have planned their family but to expect that these\n\npetitioners should have delayed their motherhood until the „Board‟s‟\n\nluxurious announcement came on the tests in question 13 months\n\nlater, is arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">       The arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners have been\n\ncontested by learned State counsel and learned counsel for „the\n\nBoard‟      each of whom have shifted the responsibility on the\n\npetitioners to submit that since the notice at Annexure-C at paragraph\n\n6 clearly stipulated that each of the applicants had to participate in the\n\nphysical evaluation test on the date fixed otherwise they will be held\n\nineligible for appointment and would not be given a second\n\nopportunity, the respondents could not have extended the date of\n\nphysical evaluation test. It is jointly submitted that since these six\n\npetitioners were applicants to the selection process, they ought to have\n\ntaken care of their physical condition so as to be able to participate in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                            7</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe selection test. It is submitted that the „Board‟ cannot have a\n\ndifferent yardstick for different category of applicants and the rule\n\napplies equally to all. It is also the submission of learned counsel for\n\nthe Board that there were 14 such cases before the „Board‟ with each\n\nof them in different stage of pregnancy. It is submitted that accepting\n\ntheir request by the „Board‟ would have delayed the appointment\n\nprocess. It is further submitted that there are no such provisions in the\n\nrule book enabling the „Board‟ to give such relaxation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">      I have heard learned counsel for the parties and I have perused\n\nthe records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">      While <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India clearly stipulates\n\nthat the State shall not deny to any person equality before law or equal\n\nprotection of law within the territory of India, <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 15</a> while\n\nprohibiting a discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or\n\nplace of birth at Clause 3 specifically provides that nothing in the\n\nArticle would prevent the State from making any special provision\n\nfor women and children.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">      <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 16</a> of the constitution of India again while providing for\n\nequality of opportunity in matter of appointment at Clause 2 debars\n\nany discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, descent,\n\nplace of birth, residence or any of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      The all important article which would be relevant for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                            8</span>\n\n\n\n\ncontest at hand is <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a>, which provides that no person shall be\n\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the\n\nprocedure established by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">      These stipulations coming under Part III of the Constitution of\n\nIndia are fundamental to the rights guaranteed to every citizen of this\n\ncountry. There is a corresponding duty cast upon the State under the\n\nDirective Principles and while <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 38</a> provides that the State shall\n\nstrive to promote the welfare of the people, <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 42</a> casts an\n\nobligation on the State to make provision for securing just and\n\nhumane condition of work and for maternity leave.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">      There is absolutely no dispute that once a woman candidate\n\nsecures an employment then she is entitled to all benefits for a secured\n\nmotherhood both pre as well as at the post maternity stage together\n\nwith all lawful entitlements under the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_9\">Maternity Benefit Act</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">      What the respondents have endeavoured to contest is that even\n\nthough these petitioners would be entitled to the benefits of secured\n\nmotherhood after their appointment but there is no provision for grant\n\nof benefits prior thereto and certainly not at the selection stage\n\nbecause any such accommodation would unnecessarily delay the\n\nselection process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      May be the concern of the respondents on maintaining a time\n\nframe to conclude a selection process, is genuine and also sound on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                             9</span>\n\n\n\n\nprinciple but the urgency so canvassed is certainly not seen either in\n\nthe action of the Board or in the advertisement           which neither\n\ndiscloses the date of written test nor makes the applicants aware of the\n\ndate of the physical test. In my opinion until such time that the\n\nadvertisement so published by the respondent „Board‟ would disclose\n\nthe date(s) for written and physical test or carry any such warning\n\nrequiring the applicants to remain in a condition of participation in\n\nthe physical test or disqualifies those who have become temporarily\n\nhandicapped on medical grounds including pregnancy in the\n\nmeanwhile and/or until such time that these petitioners at the stage of\n\nfiling their application form itself, were not in a condition to\n\nparticipate in the physical test, all such objections are only taken to be\n\nrejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      The protection granted to a citizen of this country under\n\nArticles 14,16 and 21 of the Constitution has equal application to the\n\nwoman folk of this country and if a woman candidate was in a fit\n\ncondition to compete on the date of filing of her application form then\n\nher subsequent change in the medical condition on account of\n\npregnancy which prevents her from participation in vigorous physical\n\nactivities, certainly cannot act an impediment on her career pursuit. A\n\nmarried woman candidate besides performing the functions of a home\n\nmaker, has equal right to establish her identity in the society and any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                            10</span>\n\n\n\n\nattempt of the State to restrict this multitasking character of a woman\n\nis anti people and antithesis to the concept of a welfare State. Simply\n\nbecause a woman takes upon herself the responsibility to keep the\n\nsociety going by bearing the pain of motherhood for nine long\n\nmonths, she can neither be treated as child rearing machine nor her\n\nthis important facet can act adverse to her quest for identity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">      The debate so generated has far reaching consequences. A\n\nmotherhood is not to be treated as an issue of self satisfaction rather is\n\nto be seen as a selfless commitment by a woman towards maintaining\n\na social order. The society needs to be indebted to this pious role of a\n\nwoman for it is this important role which a woman exclusively\n\nperforms which keeps the human race clock ticking and it is but for\n\nthis role that the human race would come to an end.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">      Strange are the ways of the State in treating a married woman\n\ncandidate who was fully eligible on the date when she filled up the\n\napplication form with disdain only because she has developed\n\npregnancy in between the indefiniteness of the selection process. With\n\nnothing in the advertisement to inform the married woman\n\ncandidate(s), the date on which she has to participate in the physical\n\nevaluation test, a refusal by the Board from accommodating such\n\nwoman candidate(s) is reprehensible because it is but for the\n\nindefinite approach of the State who have notified the written\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                            11</span>\n\n\n\n\nexamination after a delay of 13 months of the advertisement with the\n\nphysical test notified even later, which has given rise to the present\n\nsituation and which certainly cannot be permitted to act an obstacle on\n\nthe way of the woman candidate. May be, if the date (s) of the written\n\nand physical test were notified in the advertisement itself, perhaps the\n\nmatter would have required a different appreciation but not in the\n\ncircumstances existing in present case. The indefiniteness on the part\n\nof the State to inform the dates of the written/physical test, itself\n\nstands valid ground, to permit the women candidate who have gained\n\nmotherhood in the process, of their participation in the selection\n\nprocess.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      The issue put to debate herein is not an isolated issue rather the\n\nopinion expressed by the Delhi High Court, the Kerala High Court as\n\nwell as the Supreme Court on this pious role of a woman lends\n\nsupport to the views expressed herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_10\">Reference is made to a judgment of the Supreme Court since\n\nreported in AIR 2010 SC 235 (<a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_10\">Suchita Srivastava Vs.

It is important to recognise that\n         reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well\n         as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is\n         that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\n         should be respected. This means that there should be no\n         restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive\n         choices ..................... Taken to their logical conclusion,\n         reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a\n         pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to subsequently\n         raise children.

In\n\nthe opinion of the Division Bench, the effect of refusal on the part of\n\nPublic Service Commission to give extension of time for such woman\n\nto participate in the physical evaluation test would amount to denial of\n\nopportunity to get employment.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"137465042\" id=\"span_15\">The observation of the bench at paragraph 7 would bear a\n\nrelevant consideration for the present case which reads as under\n\n             &quot;7.............................A reasonable modality has to\n          be effectuated synchronising the fundamental rights of all\n          the candidates as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_16\">, 16</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_17\">, 19</a> and\n          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">21</a> and having in view the constitutional values and human\n          right values emanating out of <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_19\">Articles 15(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_20\">42</a> of the\n          Constitution of India and the aforenoted materials in the\n          international domain as understood herein above and in <a href=\"/doc/137465042/\" id=\"a_21\">K.\n          Jayasree</a>&#x27;s (supra).

To conclude that pregnancy amounts to mere\n         unwillingness - as the respondents did in this case- was an\n         indefensible. The choice to bear a child is not only a\n         deeply personal one for a family but is also a physically\n         taxing time for the mother. This right to reproduction and\n         child rearing is an essential facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                 15</span>\n\n\n\n\nConstitution; it is underscored by the commitment of the\nConstitution framers to ensure that circumstances\nconducive to the exercise of this choice are created and\nmaintained by the State at all times. This commitment is\nsignified by <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 42 (&quot;Provision for just</a> and humane\nconditions of work and maternity relief- The State shall\nprovide conditions for securing just and humane\nconditions of work and for maternity relief&quot;) and <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_26\">Article\n45 (&quot;Provision for early childhood care</a> and education to\nchildren below the age of six years- The State shall\nendeavour to provide for early childhood care... &quot;).

There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to\n      make reproductive choices is also a dimension of\n      `personal liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> of\n      the Constitution of India.

This means that there should be no\n       restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\n       reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to\n       refuse participation in sexual activity or\n       alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive\n       methods. Furthermore, women are also free to\n       choose birth-control methods such as undergoing\n       sterilisation procedures.

It would be a travesty of justice if a female public\nemployee were forced to choose between having a child\nand her career. This is exactly what the CRPF‟s position\nentails. Pregnancy is a departure from an employee‟s\n&quot;normal&quot; condition and to equate both sets of public\nemployees- i.e. those who do not have to make such choice\nand those who do (like the petitioner) and apply the same\nstandards mechanically is discriminatory. Unlike plain\nunwillingness- on the part of an officer to undertake the\ncourse, which can possibly entail loss of seniority- the\nchoice exercised by a female employee to become a parent\nstands on an entirely different footing. If the latter is\ntreated as expressing unwillingness, CRPF would clearly\nviolate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21.</a> As between a male official and female\nofficial, there is no distinction, in regard to promotional\navenues; none was asserted. In fact, there is a common pre-\npromotional programme which both have to undergo; both\nbelong to a common cadre. In these circumstances, the\ndenial of seniority benefit to the petitioner amounts to an\ninfraction of <a href=\"/doc/250697/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 16 (1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_34\">(2)</a> of the Constitution,\nwhich guarantee equality to all in matters of public\nemployment, regardless of religion, caste, sex, descent,\nplace of birth, residence etc. A seemingly &quot;neutral&quot; reason\nsuch as inability of the employee, or unwillingness, if not\nprobed closely, would act in a discriminatory manner,\ndirectly impacting her service rights. That is exactly what\nhas happened here: though CRPF asserts that seniority\nbenefit at par with the petitioner‟s colleagues and\nbatchmates (who were able to clear course No. 85) cannot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                           17</span>\n\n\n\n\n          be given to her because she did not attend that course, in\n          truth, her &quot;unwillingness&quot; stemmed from her inability due\n          to her pregnancy. In this present situation the course was in\n          Coimbatore. Travelling and living in an alien area without\n          support was not a feasible proposition for an expecting\n          mother; besides, the CRPF had determined that her\n          medical category was SHAPE III. Mercifully, the CRPF\n          does not contend that its regulations imposed any\n          restrictions on a female employee‟s pregnancy at the stage\n          of the Petitioner‟s career. That the petitioner exercised her\n          right therefore to become a parent should not operate to\n          penalise her, and her „choice‟ to do so was irrelevant, in\n          the circumstances of the case; the CRPF should have taken\n          the reasons for the unwillingness into account given the\n          admitted fact that she was pregnant.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">      In the nature of the expressions so found in the <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_35\">judgments\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_36\">referred to above</a></a>, all that can be said is that the State respondents\n\nincluding the „Board‟ have been rather insensitive in forcing the\n\nwoman candidate(s) to chose between Motherhood and career. The\n\ndecision of the „Board‟ in not extending the date of physical test for\n\nthe pregnant woman candidate runs counter to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 14</a> which grants\n\nequal protection to its citizens; <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> which recognizes the right\n\nof a woman to procreate and <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 15(3)</a> which enable the State to\n\nmake special provision for woman. In my opinion once the right of\n\nwomen in public employment stands recognized then it becomes the\n\nduty of the State to frame appropriate regulations and guidelines to\n\nensure that no woman candidate is disqualified from a selection\n\nprocess because she has acquired motherhood in the meanwhile. The\n\nfailure of the State to take effective steps in this connection rather\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                  18</span>\n\n\n\n\n                    asking the woman candidates to choose between a family and career\n\n                    would not only be a travesty of justice but as I have said, would be an\n\n                    antithesis to the concept of a welfare State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">                           For the reasons and discussions above the prayer of the\n\n                    petitioners for postponement of the date of physical evaluation test on\n\n                    grounds of being in advanced stage of pregnancy, is upheld. Since all\n\n                    these petitioners are now ready to face the challenge of the physical\n\n                    evaluation test, the Central Selection Board would fix up a date for the\n\n                    physical evaluation test within six weeks from the date of\n\n                    receipt/production of a copy of this order and give opportunity of\n\n                    participation therein not only to the petitioners herein but\n\n                    all those women candidates who could not participate in the\n\n                    physical evaluation test due to advanced stage of pregnancy.
