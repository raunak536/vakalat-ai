The law enjoins the police to be scrupulously\nfair to the offender and the Magistracy is to ensure fair\ninvestigation and fair trial to an offender. The purpose\nand object of Magistracy and police are complementary to\neach other. It is unfortunate that these objectives have\nremained   unfulfilled  even   after   40   years  of   our\nConstitution. Aberrations of police officers and police\nexcesses in dealing with the law and order situation have\nbeen subject of adverse comments from this Court as well as\nfrom other courts but it has failed to have any corrective\neffect on it. The police has power to arrest a person even\nwithout obtaining a warrant of arrest from a court. The\namplitude of this power casts an obligation on the police\nand it must bear in mind, as held by this Court that if a\nperson is arrested for a crime, his constitutional and\nfundamental rights must not be violated.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_58\">38 It is imperative to state that it is the sacrosanct duty\nof the police authorities to remember that a citizen while\nin custody is not denuded of his fundamental right under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

He was photographed with the said\nplacard and the photograph was made public. It was also\nfiled in a revenue proceeding by the 7th respondent. The\nHigh Court has recorded that the competent authority of the\nState has conducted an enquiry and found the erring\nofficers to be guilty. The High Court has recorded the\nfindings in the favour of the appellant but left him to\nsubmit a representation to the concerned authorities. This\nCourt,   as  has   been  indicated   earlier,  granted   an\nopportunity to the State to deal with the matter in an\nappropriate manner but it rejected the representation and\nstated that it is not a case of defamation. We may at once\nclarify that we are not at all concerned with defamation as\npostulated under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 499</a> of the IPC. We are really\nconcerned how in a country governed by rule of law and\nwhere <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is treated to be\nsacred, the dignity and social reputation of a citizen has\nbeen affected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">40 As we perceive, from the admitted facts borne out on\nrecord, the appellant has been humiliated. Such treatment\nis basically inhuman and causes mental trauma. In &quot;Kaplan &amp;\nSadock&#x27;s Synopsis of Psychiatry&quot;, while dealing with\ntorture, the learned authors have stated that intentional\nphysical and psychological torture of one human by another\ncan have emotionally damaging effects comparable to, and\npossibly worse than, those seen with combat and other types\nof trauma. Any psychological torture inflicts immense\nmental pain.

It is not to be\n  forgotten that when dignity is lost, the breath of life\n  gets into oblivion. In a society governed by rule of law\n  where humanity has to be a laser beam, as our compassionate\n  constitution has so emphasized, the police authorities\n  cannot show the power or prowess to vivisect and dismember\n  the same.

If in such a situation mercy is shown,\n   the effect would be that people would not knock the door\n   of the Courts to seek justice, but would settle score on\n   the streets, where muscle power and money power would win,\n   and the weak and the meek would suffer.

It may be stated, though it is trite, that\n   nobody is above the law. The fact that the petitioner is\n   an I. A. S. Officer is of no consequence, so far as the\n   sentence is concerned. We would indeed think that if a\n   high officer indulges in an act of contempt, he deserves\n   to be punished more rigorously, so that nobody would take\n   to his head to violate Court&#x27;s order. May we also say that\n   a public officer, being a part of Government, owes higher\n   obligation than an ordinary citizen to advance the cause\n   of public interest, which requires maintenance of rule of\n   law to protect which contemnors are punished.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">(24) The       Apex       Court         has          declared         that          while\n     awarding sentence on a contemnor, the Court\n     does so to uphold the majesty of law, and not\n     with any idea of vindicating the prestige of\n     the Court or to uphold its dignity and it is\n     really to see that unflinching faith of the\n     people         in    the   Courts           remain          intact.           It     is\n     cautioned by the Supreme                          Court        that if the\n     order of even the highest Court of the land is\n     allowed to be flagrantly violated and a person\n     found          guilty      of      contempt            is      let        off        by\n     remitting           sentence          on        plea     of     mercy,           that\n     would send wrong signals to everyone in the\n     country and it will be deleterious to the rule\n     of law. In a situation like this, if mercy is\n     shown, the effect would be that people would\n     not      knock       the    door        of       the     Courts          to      seek\n     justice,            but    would           settle         score           on       the\n     streets, where muscle power and money power\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                     Page 32 of 39</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                                 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 20 20:42:39 IST 2023</span>\n                                                                                          NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n  C/MCA/1067/2022                                      JUDGMENT DATED: 19/10/2023\n\n                                                                                          undefined\n\n\n\n\n     would win, and the weak and the meek would\n     suffer, and that would be a death knell to the\n     rule of law and social justice would receive a\n     fatal          blow.    It    has     been       asserted          that        the\n     Court          cannot    be    a    party        to     it    and,         harsh\n     though it may look, it is duty bound to award\n     proper punishment to uphold the rule of law,\n     how so high a person may be. In the instant\n     case the barbaours act has been videographed\n     and has been widely circulated in media and\n     has not remained confined to Undhela Chowk.\n     The apology tendered cannot be accepted in a\n     routine manner, although the apology may be\n     unconditional and bona fide. If the conduct is\n     so     serious         and    reckless          which     disintegrates\n     the law declared by the highest court of land,\n     and has debilitating                    effect        on the rule of\n     law, the apology cannot be accepted. In the\n     present case, it is not only the majesty of\n     the      Court     that       has     been       degraded,           but       the\n     self-respect of the complainants is blown to\n     smithereens.
