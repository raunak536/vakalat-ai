On 11.12.1992, India ratified the United Nations Convention on the\n\n   Rights of the Children; &#x27;UNCRC&#x27; for short. That Convention\n\n   requires all State Parties to undertake all appropriate measures to\n\n   secure the best interest of the child, even when it is alleged as, or\n\n   accused of, violating any penal law. Such measures require the\n\n   treatment of the child in a manner consistent with the promotion\n\n   of the child&#x27;s sense of dignity and worth, reinforcing the child&#x27;s\n\n   respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others\n\n   and taking into account the child&#x27;s age and desirability of promoting\n\n   the child&#x27;s reintegration and the child&#x27;s assuming a constructive\n\n   role in society. The thrust in those principles were to ensure\n\n   proper care, protection, development, treatment and social re-\n\n   integration of every child in difficult circumstances, by adopting a\n\n   child-friendly approach keeping in mind the best interest of the\n\n   child. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/741672/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 253</a> of the Constitution, the Parliament\n\n   has the overriding exclusive legislative competence and power to\n\n   make laws for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention\n\n   with any other country or countries or any decision made at any\n\n   international conference, association or other body.
