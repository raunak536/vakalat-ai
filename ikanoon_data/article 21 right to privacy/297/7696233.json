SIVA SANKARA RAO        \n\n\nCRIMINAL REVISION CASE No.2346 of 2016      \n\n\nORDER :</pre>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">        The present Criminal Revision Case is filed by Accused No.1\n(for short A.1) of Crime No.217 of 2016 of Women Police Station,\nDD, Hyderabad, aggrieved by the order dated 08.08.2016 in\nCrl.M.P.No.2305 of 2016 passed by the learned XIII Additional\nChief Metropolitan Magistrate (Mahila Court), Hyderabad, allowing\nthe petition filed by the State, represented by the Station House\nOfficer, Womens Police Station, D.D., Hyderabad, and directing the\npetitioner/A.1 to undergo medical test/potency test for Erectile\nDysfunction (for short E.D.) at Osmania General Hospital,\nHyderabad, on 22.08.2016, with a further direction to the\nInvestigating Officer, Women Police Station, DD, City Crime\nStation, Hyderabad, to take necessary steps.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">2.      The contentions in the grounds of revision vis-a-vis the oral\nsubmissions in the course of hearing by the learned counsel for A.1\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">- revision petitioner are that the impugned order of the Court below\nis contrary to law, wholly unsustainable and failure of justice, that\ntoo from the allegations read from FIR against the potency of\npetitioner  A.1, made by the defacto-complainant, it is nothing but\nintruding into the personal liberty and privacy and to compel\npetitioner  A.1 against his wish and such invasive tests will be\ncontrary to and violative of the rights against self-incrimination\nunder <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India, that same is\nsubjecting the petitioner  A.1 to oppressive and degrading\ntreatment, that it is also prohibitive under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India, besides in violation of various\npronouncements of the Honble Apex Court, that the learned Judge\nfailed to see that the test for E.D. requires injection to be given to\nthe private parts and certain extracts made, which is violative of\nRight to Privacy and is contrary to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution\nof India, that the learned Judge failed to see that the offence of\ncheating as to the representation could not in the facts of the case\nrender <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 53</a> of Cr.P.C. applicable, that the object of the police\nin insisting upon the petitioner  A.1 to undergo the potency test is\nmerely a device to harass him and playing in the hands of the\ndefacto-complainant, that the learned Judge failed to see that the\nreason for the ED can also be caused due to psychological reasons,\nlike serious amount of stress, which results in temporary disability\nand any test conducted on the petitioner  A.1 cannot be the basis\nthat the petitioner  A.1 suffered from such ED 4 years earlier and\nhence, sought for dismissal of the impugned order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">3.      Whereas, it is the contention of the learned counsel for\ndefacto-complainant and the learned Public Prosecutor that the\norder of the Court below is well within its scope contemplated by\nlaw and the same is necessary for the effective adjudication of the\ncriminal lis and there is nothing to interfere therewith and it cannot\nbe stated as intruding into the privacy or in effecting of\nFundamental Right, which is not even when absolute, but for\nqualified, that too subject to due process of law to obey to the\norders of the Court in submitting to the requirement of the potency\ntest and hence to dismiss the revision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.      Heard both sides and perused the material on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.      Now, in deciding the revision lis on the correctness of the\nimpugned order of the Court below, the factual background\nnecessary to mention, in nutshell, is that the defacto-complainant \nSmt. Ahalya Meka, w/o. Naveen Krishna Bothireddy (A.1) has  \nsubmitted a report against petitioner A.1, among 4 accused viz.,\nA.2  - Raghava Bothireddy (father of A.1); A.3  Smt. Anuradha\nBothireddy (Mother of A.1); and A.4  Smt. Haritha Bothireddy\n(Sister of A.1), which was registered as Crime No.217 of 2016 of\nWomen Police Station, DD, Hyderabad, registered for the offences\npunishable under Sections 498-A, <a href=\"/doc/664789/\" id=\"a_5\">406</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1099980/\" id=\"a_6\">420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1106740/\" id=\"a_7\">344</a>, 120-B r/w.\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_10\">4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/194071/\" id=\"a_11\">6</a> of Dowry Prohibition Act,\nstating that her marriage with A. 1 - Naveen Krishna Bothireddy\nwas performed on 18.03.2012 as per Hindu rites and customs by \nspending total marriage expenses of Rs.1.45 Crores and after the\nmarriage, she joined the matrimonial home at Chennai, however,\nher marriage was not consummated as A.1 is suffering from\nErectile Dysfunction (ED) and unfit for marital life, that by\nsuppressing said fact, for the sake of her money and properties, A.1\nmarried her, that after the marriage, her parents arranged an\namount of Rs.2.00 Crores in the business of A.1 for the sake of\nmarital life, that A.1 made LW.1 as guarantor/co-applicant to take\nhuge amounts from various banks and made her liable for the\nsame, that A.1 to A.4 used to harass her mentally and physically\nand tortured her for want of money and properties and thrown out\nof the marital house and cheated her by suppressing the health\ncondition of A.1, that A.1 himself agreed said fact in his emails and\nhence requested to take action against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6.      Basing on the above facts, the revision 1st respondent - Police\nin the course of investigation filed the aforesaid Crl.M.P.No.2305 of\n2016 in Crime No.217 of 2016 seeking to send A.1 for medical\ncheck up/potency test to prove whether he is fit for matrimonial life\nor not, and as he is not ready to go for medical examination, the\npotency test is required in directing him to appear before the\nOsmania General Hospital for the same. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.      The same is opposed by A.1 in his counter dated 15.07.2016 \nby denying the averments and by imputing as a false case and by\ndisputing the allegation of marriage not consummated or he is unfit\nfor marital life or he suppressed any such fact or he cheated his\nwife or parents-in-laws and with a contention that the said\nallegations are baseless and made only to malign him with\ncharacter assassination against him and his family and the alleged\ncruelty or harassment from him and his parents is also false, that\nhe had already filed W.P.No.10222 of 2016 before the Honble High\nCourt for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus, as the police are\nfrequently calling him to the Police Station without registering the\nFIR and the said writ petition is still pending, that after receiving\nnotices in the said writ petition, the police registered the present\ncomplaint vide Crime No.217 of 2016 against him and his family\nmembers, that as the marriage took place over four years ago i.e.,\non 18.03.2012 and the alleged dishonest representation/\nsuppression and that E.D. can also be caused by psychological \nreasons, like serious amount of stress, which can be a temporary\ndisability and hence, conducting of such test today and the result\nthereof cannot be the basis to say that the respondent is suffering\nfrom such E.D. four years earlier, that he never had any physical\ndeformity resulting in E.D., which is evident from the medical\nreports given after due tests, that for undergoing such test he has\nto be given injection to the critical parts of the body and the results\nof such test being used in a criminal case is prohibited as it is\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India, besides in\nviolation of various pronouncements of the Apex Court, that as no\nsexual offence has been alleged, the Investigating Agency cannot\ncompel him to undergo such potency test to disprove an offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 420</a> of IPC and hence sought for dismissal of the\npetition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">8.      It is pursuant to which, after hearing arguments of both sides\nand considering the material on record, by the impugned order\ndated 08.08.2016, the learned XIII Additional Chief Metropolitan\nMagistrate, Hyderabad, allowed the application, observing that as\nthe complainant alleges that her marriage was not consummated \nand A.1 is suffering from E.D. since prior to marriage, which was\nalso agreed by A.1 through his emails to her stating that he is\nsuffering from E.D. since prior to marriage and as the case is under\ninvestigation, to prove the case of the defacto-complainant, it is\nnecessary to send A.1 for potency test and to complete the\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">9.      It is impugning the same with the contentions referred supra,\nthe revision is maintained and the submissions of both sides in the\ncourse of hearing reproduced above no way require repetition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">10.

The relevant observations may be quoted: (<a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_30\">KATHI KALU \nOGHADs</a> case  AIR  p-1814  para-10)  \nTo be a witness may be equivalent to furnishing evidence in the\nsense of making oral or written statements, but not in the larger\nsense of the expression so as to include giving of thumb impression\nor impression of palm or foot or fingers or specimen writing or\nexposing a part of the body.

The\ntaking of impressions or parts of the body of an accused person very\noften becomes necessary to help the investigation of a crime.

Case law has gone beyond this strict literal\ninterpretation of the expression which may now bear a wider meaning,\nnamely, bearing testimony in court or out of court by a person accused of\nan offence, orally or in writing.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">        ..            \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">            26.  In SELVIs case, a three Judge Bench of this Court was\nconsidering whether involuntary administration of certain scientific\ntechniques like narco- analysis, polygraph examination and the Brain\nElectrical Activation Profile (BEAP) tests and the results thereof are of a\ntestimonial character attracting the bar of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\nConstitution. This Court considered the protective scope of right against\nself-incrimination, that is whether it extends to the investigation stage and\ncame to the conclusion that even the investigation at the police level is\nembraced by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 20(3).</a> After quoting extensively from Kathi Kalu\nOghad, it was observed that the scope of testimonial compulsion is made\nclear by two premises. The first is that ordinarily it is the oral or written\nstatements which convey the personal knowledge of a person in respect of\nrelevant facts that amount to personal testimony thereby coming within\nthe prohibition contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 20(3).</a> In most cases, such\npersonal testimony can be readily distinguished from material evidence\nsuch as bodily substances and other physical objects. The second premise \nis that in some cases, oral or written statements can be relied upon but\nonly for the purpose of identification or comparison with facts and\nmaterials that are already in the possession of the investigators. The bar\nof <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 20(3)</a> can be invoked when the statements are likely to lead to\nincrimination by themselves or furnish a link in the chain of evidence. It\nwas held that all the three techniques involve testimonial responses. They\nimpede the subjects right to remain silent. The subject is compelled to\nconvey personal knowledge irrespective of his/her own volition. The\nresults of these tests cannot be likened to physical evidence so as to\nexclude them from the protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 20(3).</a> This Court\nconcluded that compulsory administration of the impugned techniques\nviolates the right against self-incrimination. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 20(3)</a> aims to prevent\nthe forcible conveyance of personal knowledge that is relevant to the facts\nin issue. The results obtained from each of the impugned tests bear a\ntestimonial character and they cannot be categorized as material evidence\nsuch as bodily substances and other physical objects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">14.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_37\">DIPANWITA ROY v.

Before discussing further on the facts and law, coming to the\nlegal position on Expert Opinion, when and where generally\nrequired and its value, it is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(a). OPINION EVIDENCE: A witness in order to give an opinion must be \ncompetent (Peritus)-i.e., an Expert in the field and the subject matter must\nbe one in respect of which an opinion is allowed.-See-Section-45-Evidence\nAct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(b). Meaning of Opinion-What a person thinks and reasons in respect of\nthe existence or non-existence of fact is opinion. Whatever is presented to\nthe senses of a witness and of which he receives direct knowledge without\nany process of thinking and reasoning is not opinion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"221867\" id=\"span_12\">(c). As a general rule the opinion or belief of third person is not relevant\nand admissible as the witnesses are allowed to state facts alone of what\nthey themselves saw or heard. However, cases in which the question\ninvolved is beyond the range of common experience and knowledge or \nInvestigating Agency and Court have no special study and necessary\nexperience on the subject and is not in a position to form a correct\nopinion, in such cases help of an expert in that field is necessary as held\nin <a href=\"/doc/221867/\" id=\"a_46\">Sitaram Srigopal vs. Daulati Devi</a> .</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(d). Hearsaydirect evidencecan be tested by actual cross examination\nand there is fear of perjury. Hearsay indirect evidence is thus prohibited\nindirectly or precluded.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(f). Hearsay indirect evidence is inadmissible unless the Statute provides\nfor it. Expert opinion evidence is no way an exception to it being opinion of\na third person inadmissible as a general rule, but for <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_47\">Sections 45-51</a>\nEvidence Act and the like from other provisions. The prerequisite from\n<a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 45</a> Evidence Act is that the witness must be an Expert in the field.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(g). Expertis the person who specifically or specially skilled or practiced\non any subject. Expert evidence is thus the direct evidence of an expert in\nthe field from what he perceived by the senses of perception or in any\nother manner. According to Russell, any person who is skilled or has\nadequate knowledge in a particular field is called Expert.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">(h). RELEVANT PROVISIONS DEALING WITH OPINION EVIDENCE:            \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">(I) <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 45</a> of the Evidence Act, speaks that- for the Court to form an\nopinion the opinion of an expert is relevant. This section is thus an\nexception to the general rule as regards exclusion of opinion evidence. This\nsection no way confined, like in <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 73</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, the\npower of Court during enquiry or trial only, leave about amended <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_51\">Section\n311-A</a> Cr.P.C. filled the gap in <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 73</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">(II) <a href=\"/doc/1610765/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 51</a> says that whenever the opinion of any living person is\nrelevant, the grounds on which such opinion is based are also relevant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">(III) <a href=\"/doc/1458526/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 46</a> makes facts, not otherwise relevant, are relevant- (1). If\nthey support or are inconsistent with the opinions of experts, when such\nopinions are relevant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">(IV) Regarding opinion evidence-the other relevant sections are\nSections.47-50, 73 &amp; 67, among which- \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">(V) Section.50-speaks of relevancy of opinion on relationship for the Court\nto form an opinion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">(VI) Section.49-speaks of relevancy of opinion on usages and tenets of any\nbody of men or family- for the Court to form an opinion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(VII) Section.48-speaks of relevancy of opinion on existence of custom or\nright general or relating to a considerable class of persons for the Court to\nform an opinion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\"> (XIV) Sections 45-51 nowhere speak of requirement of corroboration to\nthe opinion evidence. <a href=\"/doc/838383/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 134</a> Evidence Act-says no particular number\nof witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(XV) Coming to relevancy and evidentiary value of expert opinion and\nevidence, the Latin general maxim is that-EXPERTOCREDE to mean an    \nExpert is to be generally believed. It is because the testimony of an expert\nas to general scientific facts and doctrines which are unintelligible to the\nlay-men, will serve to elucidate the facts in issue. However the general rule\nis that the evidence of an expert has to be tested as any other evidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">Thus the privilege of drawing inferences including in case of expert opinion\nevidence is given to the Courts to appreciate with reference to facts and\ncircumstances of the case and from other evidence available on record for\noverall appreciation to arrive a right conclusion on a fact is proved or not\nproved or disproved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">(XVIII) The cases in which testimony of an expert is admissible are of two\ntypes: 1). When the conclusions to be drawn by the Court depends upon \nthe existence of facts which are not of common knowledge and which are\npeculiarly with in the special knowledge of men whose experience and\nstudy enables them to speak with authority up on the subjects in\nquestion. 2). When the conclusions to be drawn by the Court depends\nboth upon the facts stated as well as the knowledge of the facts themselves\nnot with in the range of ordinary intelligence. In the first class of cases \nthe facts are to be stated by the expert and the conclusion is to be drawn\nby the Court. In the second class of cases  the expert states the facts and\ngive his conclusions in the form of opinion  which may be accepted or\nrejected by the Court from appreciation of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">(XIX) The credibility of the expert witness and his competency to give\nopinion and the reasons given supporting it are the material aspects in the\nappreciation of evidence by the Court concerned:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">(i)         The test to determine competency of an expert is (a). Educational\nbackground in the field, (b). Practical knowledge in the field, (c). Careful\nanalysis in arriving to the conclusion opined &amp; (d). Ability to explain the\nexpertise and how he arrived to the conclusion opined.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">(ii)        The test to determine credibility of an expert is (a). Basis of\nopinion- The\nopinion must be based on facts and reasons there from to support the\nconclusion. How far to rely there from is a matter of appreciation in\nevidence by the Court. The expert furnishes the data with reasons to his\nopinion there from and the Court decides there from and from other\nmaterial in evidence if any.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">(iii)       The correct approach for the Court would be to weigh the reasons on\nwhich the expert report is based and the quality of experts opinion would\nultimately depend upon the soundness of the reasons on which it is\nfounded-held in Uma kant Bajpayee vs. State of UP.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">18.

There the issue was, whether the Narcoanalysis,\nPolygraph (lie-detector test) and BEAP (Brain Electrical Activation\nProfile) Test conducted against the will of a person is legally\npermissible and it was observed that voluntary undertaking of tests\nis different from the tests conducted under compulsion violating\nthe right against self-incrimination and personal liberty under\nArticles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution of India and Right of\nSilence under Section 161 (2) of Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">        (b).  It is observed that as per <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_70\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_71\">54</a>\nCr.P.C., Narcoanalysis, Polygraph and BEAP tests are not included \nand the general expression such other tests used in <a href=\"/doc/1047846/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 53</a> \nExplanation (a) of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_73\">Cr.P.C</a>., cannot be construed as covering of the\nthree tests, because they are not of the same category to which the\ntests specified therein belong, so to include, when the Parliament,\nwhile amending the said Explanation (a) in the year 2005, did not\ninclude those tests, despite the fact that these tests were in\nexistence at that time. The protection of Right of Silence against\ncompulsion violating the right against self-incrimination, when lost,\nin the case of Narcoanalysis, because the said test subjects under\nthe influence of drug (sodium pentothal) injected into his body\nloses control over his verbal responses and, therefore, cannot\ndecide consciously about the question, which he should not\nanswer. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">        (c).

The mental privacy, which is the aspect of personal\nliberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, is intruded\nupon because common feature of these tests is that the test\nsubjects verbal or physiological responses extracted in a manner\nthat he has no conscious control over them.

Even in SELVIs case, it is clearly observed that -- The\nrule under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India against the\ntestimonial compulsion, however, does not prohibit collection of\nmaterial evidence, such as bodily substances and other physical\nobjects and the statement used for comparison with facts already\nknown to investigators. To ascertain whether the statement is\nincriminatory, depends upon the use to which it is put. The\ndistinction, whether the statement is inculpatory or exculpatory is\nto decide at the stage of trial, whereas the Right to remain Silence\nis available even at the stage of investigation in a criminal case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">        (e).  It is observed therefrom with reference to the <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_76\">Sections 53</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_77\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_78\">54</a> Cr.P.C. r/w. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_79\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_80\">21</a> of the Constitution\nof India that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\"><a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 20(3)</a> protects a person who is `formally accused&#x27; of having\ncommitted an offence or even a suspect or a witness who is questioned\nduring an investigation in a criminal case. However, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 20(3)</a> is not\napplicable when a person gives his/her informed consent to undergo any\nof the impugned tests. It has also been described earlier that the `right\nagainst self-incrimination&#x27; does not protect persons who may be\ncompelled to undergo the tests in the course of administrative\nproceedings or any other proceedings which may result in civil liability.\nIt is also conceivable that a person who is forced to undergo these tests\nmay not subsequently face criminal charges. In this context, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_83\">Article\n20(3)</a> will not apply in situations where the test results could become the\nbasis of non-penal consequences for the subject such as custodial\nabuse, police surveillance and harassment among others.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">        In order to account for these possibilities, we must examine whether\nthe involuntary administration of any of these tests is compatible with\nthe constitutional guarantee of `substantive due process&#x27;. The standard\nof `substantive due process&#x27; is of course the threshold for examining the\nvalidity of all categories of governmental action that tend to infringe\nupon the idea of `personal liberty. We will proceed with this inquiry with\nregard to the various dimensions of `personal liberty&#x27; as understood in\nthe context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, which lays down that: `No\nperson shall be deprived of his life and liberty except according to\nprocedure established by law&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">        Since administering the impugned tests entails the physical\nconfinement of the subject, it is important to consider whether they can\nbe read into an existing statutory provision. This is so because any form\nof restraint on personal liberty, howsoever slight it may be, must have a\nbasis in law. However, we have already explained how it would not be\nprudent to read the explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_85\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_86\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_87\">54</a> of the CrPC\nin an expansive manner so as to include the impugned techniques. The\nsecond line of inquiry is whether the involuntary administration of these\ntests offends certain rights that have been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 21</a> by way of\njudicial precedents. The contentions before us have touched on aspects\nsuch as the `right to privacy&#x27; and the `right against cruel, inhuman and\ndegrading treatment&#x27;. The third line of inquiry is structured around the\nright to fair trial which is an essential component of `personal liberty&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">        There are several ways in which the involuntary administration of\neither of the impugned tests could be viewed as a restraint on `personal\nliberty&#x27;. The most obvious indicator of restraint is the use of physical\nforce to ensure that an unwilling person is confined to the premises\nwhere the tests are to be conducted. Furthermore, the drug-induced\nrevelations or the substantive inferences drawn from the measurement\nof the subject&#x27;s physiological responses can be described as an intrusion\ninto the subject&#x27;s mental privacy. It is also quite conceivable that a\nperson could make an incriminating statement on being threatened with\nthe prospective administration of any of these techniques. Conversely, a\nperson who has been forcibly subjected to these techniques could be\nconfronted with the results in a subsequent interrogation, thereby\neliciting incriminating statements.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">        We must also account for circumstances where a person who   \nundergoes the said tests is subsequently exposed to harmful\nconsequences, though not of a penal nature. We have already expressed \nour concern with situations where the contents of the test results could\nprompt investigators to engage in custodial abuse, surveillance or undue\nharassment. We have also been apprised of some instances where the  \ninvestigation agencies have leaked the video-recordings of narcoanalysis\ninterviews to media organisations. This is an especially worrisome\npractice since the public distribution of these recordings can expose the\nsubject to undue social stigma and specific risks. It may even encourage\nacts of vigilantism in addition to a `trial by media&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">        We must remember that the law does provide for some restrictions on\n`personal liberty&#x27; in the routine exercise of police powers. For instance,\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_89\">CrPC</a> incorporates an elaborate scheme prescribing the powers of\narrest, detention, interrogation, search and seizure. A fundamental\npremise of the criminal justice system is that the police and the\njudiciary are empowered to exercise a reasonable degree of coercive\npowers. Hence, the provision that enables Courts to order a person who\nis under arrest to undergo a medical examination also provides for the\nuse of `force as is reasonably necessary&#x27; for this purpose. It is evident\nthat the notion of `personal liberty&#x27; does not grant rights in the absolute\nsense and the validity of restrictions placed on the same needs to be\nevaluated on the basis of criterion such as `fairness, non- arbitrariness,\nand reasonableness&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">        This line of precedents shows that the compelled extraction of blood\nsamples in the course of a medical examination does not amount to\n`conduct that shocks the conscience&#x27;. There is also an endorsement of\nthe view that the use of `force as may be reasonably necessary&#x27; is\nmandated by law and hence it meets the threshold of `procedure\nestablished by law&#x27;. In this light, we must restate two crucial\nconsiderations that are relevant for the case before us. Firstly, the\nrestrictions placed on `personal liberty&#x27; in the course of administering\nthe impugned techniques are not limited to physical confinement and\nthe extraction of bodily substances, all the three techniques in question\nalso involve testimonial responses. Secondly, most of the above-\nmentioned cases were decided in accordance with the threshold of\n`procedure established by law&#x27; for restraining `personal liberty&#x27;. However,\nin this case we must use a broader standard of reasonableness to\nevaluate the validity of the techniques in question. This wider inquiry\ncalls for deciding whether they are compatible with the various\njudicially-recognised dimensions of `personal liberty&#x27; such as the right to\nprivacy, the right against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and\nthe right to fair trial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167495843\" id=\"span_15\">The discussion on the `right to privacy&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/167495843/\" id=\"a_90\">Sharda v.

By way of\nexample, we may refer to <a href=\"/doc/139481594/\" id=\"a_94\">Sections 185</a>, <a href=\"/doc/37876545/\" id=\"a_95\">202</a>, <a href=\"/doc/11563856/\" id=\"a_96\">203</a> and <a href=\"/doc/24716656/\" id=\"a_97\">204</a> of the Motor\nVehicles Act, <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_98\">Sections 53</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_99\">54</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and\n<a href=\"/doc/814675/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 3</a> of the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920. Reference in this\nconnection may also be made to <a href=\"/doc/734195/\" id=\"a_101\">Sections 269</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164731/\" id=\"a_102\">270</a> of the Indian \nPenal Code. Constitutionality of these laws, if challenge is thrown, may\nbe upheld.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">        The National Human Rights Commission which had published   \n`Guidelines relating to administration of Polygraph test (Lie Detector\ntest) on an accused (2000)&#x27;. The relevant extract has been reproduced\nbelow: &quot;... The lie detector test is much too invasive to admit of the\nargument that the authority for Lie Detector tests comes from the\ngeneral power to interrogate and answer questions or make statements.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">(Ss. 160-167 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_103\">CrPC</a>). However, in India we must proceed on the\nassumption of constitutional invasiveness and evidentiary\nimpermissiveness to take the view that such holding of tests is a\nprerogative of the individual, not an empowerment of the police. In as\nmuch as this invasive test is not authorised by law, it must perforce be\nregarded as illegal and unconstitutional unless it is voluntarily\nundertaken under non-coercive circumstances. If the police action of\nconducting a lie detector test is not authorised by law and\nimpermissible, the only basis on which it could be justified is, if it is\nvolunteered. There is a distinction between: (a) volunteering, and (b)\nbeing asked to volunteer. This distinction is of some significance in the\nlight of the statutory and constitutional protections available to any\nperson. There is a vast difference between a person saying, `I wish to\ntake a lie detector test because I wish to clear my name&#x27;, and when a\nperson is told by the police, `If you want to clear your name, take a lie\ndetector test&#x27;. A still worse situation would be where the police say,\n`Take a lie detector test, and we will let you go&#x27;. In the first example, the\nperson voluntarily wants to take the test. It would still have to be\nexamined whether such volunteering was under coercive circumstances  \nor not. In the second and third examples, the police implicitly (in the\nsecond example) and explicitly (in the third example) link up the taking\nof the lie detector test to allowing the accused to go free.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">        While these arguments merit consideration, it must be noted that\nordinarily it is the task of the legislature to arrive at a pragmatic balance\nbetween the often competing interests of `personal liberty&#x27; and public\nsafety. In our capacity as a constitutional court, we can only seek to\npreserve the balance between these competing interests as reflected in\nthe text of the Constitution and its subsequent interpretation. There is\nabsolutely no ambiguity on the status of principles such as the `right\nagainst self-incrimination&#x27; and the various dimensions of `personal\nliberty&#x27;. We have already pointed out that the rights guaranteed in\n<a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_104\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">21</a> of the Constitution of India have been given a non-\nderogable status and they are available to citizens as well as foreigners.\nIt is not within the competence of the judiciary to create exceptions and\nlimitations on the availability of these rights.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">CONCLUSION    \n        In our considered opinion, the compulsory administration of the\nimpugned techniques violates the `right against self- incrimination&#x27;. This\nis because the underlying rationale of the said right is to ensure the\nreliability as well as voluntariness of statements that are admitted as\nevidence. This Court has recognised that the protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_106\">Article\n20(3)</a> extends to the investigative stage in criminal cases and when read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 161(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 it protects\naccused persons, suspects as well as witnesses who are examined   \nduring an investigation. The test results cannot be admitted in evidence\nif they have been obtained through the use of compulsion. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 20(3)</a>\nprotects an individual&#x27;s choice between speaking and remaining silent,\nirrespective of whether the subsequent testimony proves to be\ninculpatory or exculpatory. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 20(3)</a> aims to prevent the forcible\n`conveyance of personal knowledge that is relevant to the facts in issue&#x27;.\nThe results obtained from each of the impugned tests bear a\n`testimonial&#x27; character and they cannot be categorised as material\nevidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">        We are also of the view that forcing an individual to undergo any of\nthe impugned techniques violates the standard of `substantive due\nprocess&#x27; which is required for restraining personal liberty. Such a\nviolation will occur irrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly\nadministered during the course of an investigation or for any other\npurpose since the test results could also expose a person to adverse\nconsequences of a non-penal nature. The impugned techniques cannot  \nbe read into the statutory provisions which enable medical examination\nduring investigation in criminal cases, i.e. the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_110\">Sections\n53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_111\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_112\">54</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Such an\nexpansive interpretation is not feasible in light of the rule of `ejusdem\ngeneris&#x27; and the considerations which govern the interpretation of\nstatutes in relation to scientific advancements. We have also elaborated\nhow the compulsory administration of any of these techniques is an\nunjustified intrusion into the mental privacy of an individual. It would\nalso amount to `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&#x27; with regard to\nthe language of evolving international human rights norms.\nFurthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from these\ntechniques comes into conflict with the `right to fair trial&#x27;. Invocations of\na compelling public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional\nrights such as the `right against self-incrimination&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">        In light of these conclusions, we hold that no individual should be\nforcibly subjected to any of the techniques in question, whether in the\ncontext of investigation in criminal cases or otherwise. Doing so would\namount to an unwarranted intrusion into personal liberty. However, we\ndo leave room for the voluntary administration of the impugned\ntechniques in the context of criminal justice, provided that certain\nsafeguards are in place. Even when the subject has given consent to\nundergo any of these tests, the test results by themselves cannot be\nadmitted as evidence because the subject does not exercise conscious \ncontrol over the responses during the administration of the test.\nHowever, any information or material that is subsequently discovered\nwith the help of voluntary administered test results can be admitted, in\naccordance with <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872. The National\nHuman Rights Commission had published `Guidelines for the  \nAdministration of Polygraph Test (Lie Detector Test) on an Accused&#x27; in\n2000. These guidelines should be strictly adhered to and similar\nsafeguards should be adopted for conducting the `Narcoanalysis\ntechnique&#x27; and the `Brain Electrical Activation Profile&#x27; test. The text of\nthese guidelines has been reproduced below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">(i) No Lie Detector Tests should be administered except on the basis of\nconsent of the accused. An option should be given to the accused\nwhether he wishes to avail such test.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">(ii) If the accused volunteers for a Lie Detector Test, he should be given\naccess to a lawyer and the physical, emotional and legal implication of\nsuch a test should be explained to him by the police and his lawyer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">(iii) The consent should be recorded before a Judicial Magistrate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">(iv) During the hearing before the Magistrate, the person alleged to have\nagreed should be duly represented by a lawyer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">(v) At the hearing, the person in question should also be told in clear\nterms that the statement that is made shall not be a `confessional&#x27;\nstatement to the Magistrate but will have the status of a statement made\nto the police.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">(vi) The Magistrate shall consider all factors relating to the detention\nincluding the length of detention and the nature of the interrogation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">(vii) The actual recording of the Lie Detector Test shall be done by an\nindependent agency (such as a hospital) and conducted in the presence\nof a lawyer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\"> (viii) A full medical and factual narration of the manner of the\ninformation received must be taken on record.\n</blockquote>        \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">20.     From the above, it is to be decided, whether the potency test\nby E.D. is compelled extraction of the samples in the course of\nmedical examination that does not amount to conduct that shocks \nthe conscience. The procedure established by law when provides a\nreasonable force, which may be reasonably necessary, it is\npermissible and the Law Commission also, in this regard, has\ndiscussed supra and observed that, holding of tests contending as\nConstitutional invasiveness is not neither prerogative of the\nindividual nor it is empowerment of the police, if this invasive test,\nif not authorised by law, it must perforcibly be regarded as illegal,\nunless it is voluntarily undertaken to justify. Once it is authorised\nby law, reasonable restriction on the Constitutional guarantee\nwithin the threshold of the procedure established by law, the same\nis permissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">21.     From this, we have to now consider whether the E.D. test is\none of the permissible tests Statutorily provided to enforce even\nagainst the will to compel within the qualified and not absolute\nFundamental Rights of Right to Life, Liberty and Privacy from the\nexpressions supra, within the meaning of procedure established by\nlaw.\n</p>        \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">22.

So far as psychological factors concerned, the mental impulse\ncauses presumption of para-sympathetic impulses to the penis.\nThis causes relaxation of arterioles and corpora cavernosa,\nsinusoids. So far as psychogenic is concerned, generally in 10% it\nis from stress, anxiety and depression and either from organic viz.,\nendoconal disorders or neurogenic disorders, and so far as\narteriogenic impotence is concerned, it is generally in 30% among\ndiabetes or peripheral vascular disease, so far as venogenic\nimpotency is concerned, it is generally among 15% due to penile\nvenus extinction and a combined artiogenic venogenic may be of\n10% and the other causes are from drugs and excessive alcohol,\nsmoking etc. It may be expressed that it is not because of\nimpotency, erectile dysfunction may be the result, but from any of\nthe several other factors, it is premature to go into this aspect, but\nfor soliciting the expert opinion, including capable of giving also\nwith reference to it so to give, as the material shows penile Doppler\nultrasound and other tests are possible to some extent to decipher.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">30.
