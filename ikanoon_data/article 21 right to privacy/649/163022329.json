A/10735 / 2022\n\nRAMESH NAIR :\n\n1.     The present appeal has been filed by the Appellant against Order in\n\nAppeal dated 02.06.2022, by which the terms of provisional release order\n\ndated 06.04.2022 have been upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals) to the\n\nextent it directs the Appellant to furnish a bank guarantee to the extent of\n\n15% of value of seized goods.\n\n\n\n\n2.     The important facts of this case in brief are that the Appellant are a\n\ncompany incorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_1\">Companies Act, 1956</a> and in ordinary\n\ncourse of its business, had imported Copper Cathodes conforming to LME\n                                        2\n                                            CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nGrade ―A‖ from a UAE based supplier viz., NBJ International FZ-LLC, Dubai,\n\nUAE vide 4 Bills of Entry Nos. 7078197 dated 14.01.2022, 7078275 dated\n\n14.01.2022, 7078308 dated 14.01.2022 &amp; 7078318 dated 14.01.2022\n\n\n3.    Import documents as received from the foreign supplier such as\n\ninvoices, Bill of Lading and Country of Origin Certificate(COO), etc. were filed\n\nby the Appellant along with the aforesaid Bills of Entry under <a href=\"/doc/1982368/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 46</a> of\n\nCustoms Act, 1962 (‗the Act‖). The Appellant admittedly have not availed\n\nany duty benefit on the basis of the said COO or otherwise and was willing to\n\npay duty at appropriate rate.\n\n\n4.    During the course of physical examination of the goods imported under\n\nthe Bills of Entry, it was observed by the assessing officer that the said\n\ngoods appear to be of Iran origin and not Zambia and on the basis of the\n\nsaid observation, Inspector Customs, ICD, Tumb under the instruction of the\n\nRespondents issued Detention Memo dated 20.01.2022 informing the\n\nAppellant not to remove, sale or part with or deal with, in any other manner\n\nwithout permission of competent authority of Customs, ICD Tumb.\n\n\n5.    Based on the above, an inquiry was initiated against the Appellant,\n\nand statements of officials were recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1935707/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 108</a> of the Act.\n\nWhile the investigation was ongoing, seizure memo dated 02.02.2022 was\n\nissued by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, ICD Tumb under <a href=\"/doc/97004168/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n\n110(1)</a> of the Act in respect of the four Bills of Entry seizing the goods under\n\nreasonable belief that the same are liable for confiscation under <a href=\"/doc/1907970/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n111(m)</a> of the Act.\n\n\n6.    Subsequently, the Appellant made detailed submissions before the\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Customs, ICD Tumb that the goods imported by the\n\nAppellant are not prohibited goods or subjected to any import restrictions in\n\nterms of Act and prayed for the goods to be released at the earliest.\n                                            3\n                                                CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n7.    Thereafter, Vide letter dated 04.02.2022, the Deputy Commissioner of\n\nCustoms, ICD Tumb allowed provisional release of the seized goods under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 110A</a> of the Act subject to submission of Bond amounting to five\n\ntimes of the value of the goods and bank guarantee amounting to 15% of\n\nthe duty payable.\n\n\n8.    Vide   letter    dated   09.02.2022,     issued   under   the   office   of   the\n\nCommissioner of Customs, the Respondent herein, the provisional release\n\nletter dated 04.02.2022 was cancelled and withdrawn on the grounds that:-\n\n\n      (a)    The origin of the goods is still under examination along with\n\n      verification of authenticity of Certificate of Origin and investigation in\n\n      this regard may require inspection and testing of the goods by the\n\n      experts on the subject, if required.\n\n\n      (b) Provisional release of such goods at this stage is premature in as\n\n      much as the goods appear to be in nature of prohibited goods              .\n\n\n9.    The Appellant being aggrieved by the said letter, requested the\n\nRespondent     to     reconsider   the   aforesaid   decision   and   requested     for\n\nprovisional release of the goods.\n\n\n10.   Pursuant to the above, the Appellant received a letter dated\n\n06.04.2022 from the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, ICD Tumb wherein\n\nit is stated that the competent authority has allowed the provisional release\n\nof goods on they executing a bond covering the full value of the seized\n\ngoods and Bank Guarantee of 15% of the value of the seized goods.\n\n\n11.   An appeal was filed before the Tribunal seeking modification of the\n\norder to the extent it requires the Appellant to furnish a bank guarantee of\n\n15% of value of the seized goods.\n                                             4\n                                                   CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n12.      The above matter was heard on 2nd May 2022 wherein the appellant\n\nsubmitted that the condition to provide bank guarantee was bad in law as\n\nthe appellant was willing to pay the entire amount of duty at the time of\n\nclearance     of   the   goods    and    further   there   was   no    charge   of   any\n\nmisclassification or undervaluation of the imported goods. Looking at the\n\nsubmissions made by both the sides, this Tribunal vide Final Order No.\n\nA/1041/2022 dated 01.05.2022 was pleased to modify the provisional\n\nrelease order dated 06.04.2022 by directing the Appellant to provide a bond\n\nfor full value of the seized imported goods and furnish a bank guarantee of 1\n\ncrore.\n\n\n13.      The department challenged the aforesaid order before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nGujarat High Court on the ground that the Competent Authority in the\n\nmatter     who     had   passed    the    provisional   order    was   the   Additional\n\nCommissioner of Customs and therefore the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to\n\ndecide the matter. The appeal filed by the department was registered as Tax\n\nAppeal No. 237/2022.\n\n\n14.      The Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court vide Order 20.05.2022 was pleased to\n\nset aside the final order dated 10.05.2022 on the ground of jurisdiction and\n\ndirected the Appellant herein to file an appeal before the Commissioner of\n\nCustoms (Appeals) Ahmedabad and on such appeal being filed, the\n\nCommissioner of Customs (Appeals) Ahmedabad was directed to dispose off\n\nthe same within a period of 10 days from the date of filing.\n\n\n15.      An appeal was filed before the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals),\n\nwithin the time limit provided by the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High court, by the\n\nappellant and the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) vide Order in Appeal\n\ndated 02.06.2022 (impugned order) was pleased to dismiss the appeal of\n                                         5\n                                              CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nthe appellant and upheld the conditions prescribed in the provisional release\n\norder dated 06.04.2022.\n\n\n16.   The Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) vide the impugned Order has\n\nrejected the appeal of the appellant by relying upon the decision of\n\n27.01.2022 passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court in the case of\n\nAdditional Director General v. Hazel Mercantile by which the Hon&#x27;ble High\n\nCourt had directed Hazel Mercantile to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 15\n\ncrores for goods valued at Rs. 79 crores to protect the interest of the\n\nRevenue. Being aggrieved by impugned order dated 02.06.2022the present\n\nappeal has been filed before this Tribunal by the appellant.\n\n\n17.   Shri Jitendra Motwani, Learned Counsel appeared on behalf of the\n\nappellant. The Appellant assails the impugned order on the following\n\ngrounds:\n\n\n      (a) The direction to provide 15% of bank guarantee towards the value\n\n      of the goods is without any basis and bad in law inasmuch as the\n\n      appellant at the time of hearing is willing to pay the entire duty\n\n      without claiming benefit under any FTA Regulation.\n\n\n      (b)     Once the entire duty is paid then the question of giving any\n\n      further bank guarantee towards provisional release of goods is\n\n      uncalled for and contrary to the law laid down on the issue. The\n\n      following decisions are relied upon:\n\n\n      (i)    T. G. Enterprise vs. Union of India [2018 (18) G.S.T.L. 17 (Guj.)]\n\n      (ii)   Veer Impex vs. Union of India [2016 (332) E.L.T. 87 (Guj.)]\n\n      (iii) Amit Enterprises vs. Union of India [2011 (269) ELT 314 (P&amp;H)]\n\n      (iv) SRK Manufacturing versus Commissioner of Customs, Ludhiana\n      [2022 (1) TMI 220 - CESTAT CHANDIGARH]\n\n      (v) Om Udyog vs. Joint Commissioner of Customs [2013 (287) E.L.T.\n      48 (P &amp; H)]\n                                        6\n                                             CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n       (vi) Kuber Casting (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India [2013 (297) E.L.T. 4 (P\n       &amp; H)]\n\n       (vii) SadaSukhi Electronics (P) Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Customs\n       (Seaport - Import) [2014 (304) ELT 42 (Madras)]\n\n       (viii) Aban Exim Pvt. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Customs [2014 (309)\n       E.L.T. 485 (Del.)]\n\n       (ix)  Umiya Enterprise vs. Asst. State Tax Officer, SGST Dept.,\n       Palakkad [2020 (35) G.S.T.L. 78 (Ker.)]\n\n       (x) Deenanath Maurya vs. Commissioner of Customs, Lucknow [2021\n       (378) E.L.T. 626 (Tri. - All.)]\n\n\n\n\n17.1 Without prejudice to the aforesaid and in any event, admittedly, vide\n\nletter dated 04.02.2022, the department had permitted clearance of the\n\ngoods imported vide impugned Bills of Entry by furnishing a bank guarantee\n\nequivalent to 15% of the duty payable. The said order was wrongly\n\nwithdrawn by the Additional Commissioner of Customs through the office of\n\nCommissioner of Customs, Ahmedabad, inasmuch as once the provisional\n\nrelease order was passed on 04.02.2022, the office of the Commissioner of\n\nCustoms became functus officio and had no jurisdiction to review its order.\n\n\n17.2 There is no provision under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_7\">Customs Act</a> which gives power to the\n\ndepartment to review the order passed under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 110A</a> of the Customs\n\nAct. Reliance in this regard is placed on the decision:\n\n\n       (i) Dharampal Satyapal Limited vs. Union of India - 2010 (257) E.L.T\n       194 (Gau.)\n\n\n       (ii) Tarun Castings Pvt. Limited vs. Commissioner of C. Ex., Jaipur -\n       2002 (142) E.L.T. 400 (Tri. - Del)\n\n\n\n17.3   The Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in holding that the earlier\n\nProvisional Release order dated 04.02.2022 was executive/interlocutory in\n\nnature as the same was served upon the Appellant and the department had\n                                        7\n                                             CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nno powers to review the same. The Provisional release orders are appealable\n\nin nature and the law is settled in this regard vide following decisions:\n\n\n       (i) Commissioner vs. Gaurav Pharma Ltd [2020 (373) ELT 233 (P &amp;\n       H)]\n\n       (ii) VKC Nuts Pvt Ltd vs. Commissioner of Customs [2019 (370) ELT\n       52]\n\n       (iii) Gaurav Pharma Ltd vs. Commissioner [2015 (326) ELT 561]\n\n       (iv) Commissioner of Customs vs. Narendra Plastic Pvt Ltd [2016\n       (342) ELT 497]\n\n\n\n17.4 There is no difference between provisional release order dated\n\n04.02.2022 and 06.04.2022 and the Counsel for the department before High\n\ncourt in Tax Appeal No. 237/2022 has accepted that the same is appealable\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_9\">Customs Act</a> 1962.\n\n\n17.5 Without prejudice to the above and in any event, it is submitted that\n\nthe department is completely secured in the present case as the appellant is\n\nwilling to deposit the entire amount of duty which was over 25 crores (BCD\n\n+ IGST) and therefore, the direction to impose an onerous condition of\n\nfurnishing bank guarantee to the extent of 15% of the value of goods over\n\nand above the duty being paid at the time of clearance is clearly bad in law.\n\n17.6   The issue on the basis of which the investigation has been initiated is\n\nadmittedly the Country-of-Origin Certificate. The case of the department is\n\nthat the COO appears to be false and the goods have been imported from\n\nIran instead of Zambia. It is submitted that even if the said allegation is\n\ntaken to be true, it is an undisputed fact that the appellant had no role in\n\nissuance of the Country of Origin certificate as the document was submitted\n\nby the appellant before the Customs Authority alongwith the other\n\ndocuments received from the UAE supplier.\n                                        8\n                                            CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n17.7 Further, the said Country of Original certificate has not been used by\n\nthe appellant to avail any duty benefit and no benefit would be accrued to\n\nthe appellant by mis-declaring the Country of Origin. Even if it is assumed\n\nthat the goods are imported from Iran, the same would have no bearing to\n\nthe present case as there is no restriction under the Import Export Policy for\n\nimporting Copper Cathodes from Iran. Para 2.18 of the relevant Foreign\n\nTrade Policy is relevant to the said submission.\n\n\n17.8 On the issue of Country of Origin certificate, it is submitted that while\n\nthe investigation is ongoing, there is no evidence so far to show that the said\n\nCountry of Origin certificate is forged and/or false and therefore keeping in\n\nmind the facts of the case, the order directing furnishing of bank guarantee\n\nto extent of 15% of the value of the seized goods is incorrect more so when\n\nthe entire duty is being paid.\n\n\n17.9 The issue is settled in their case insasmuch as for the consignment of\n\nsimilar goods valued at around 35 crores, the Mumbai Bench of this Tribunal\n\nvide order no. A/85566/2022 dated 17.06.2022 has allowed provisional\n\nrelease on furnishing Bank Guarantee of Rs. 50,00,000/-. It is submitted\n\nthat the issue being identical in nature, the order of the Hon&#x27;ble Mumbai\n\nbench is applicable to the facts of the present case as well.\n\n\n17.10 Since the Appellants have already incurred cost toward heavy\n\ndemurrage and detention charges, submissions were made for early disposal\n\nof Appeal.\n\n\n\n\n18.   Shri Dinesh Prithiani, learned Assistant Commissioner, Authorised\n\nRepresentative appearing on behalf of the revenue, during the hearing,\n\nreiterates the finding in the impugned order. He further submitted that the\n\norder dated 06.04.2022 which was issued after the approval of the\n                                           9\n                                                CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nCompetent Authority is correct and proper in law considering the fact that\n\nthe goods were imported from Iran as against Zambia.\n\n\n19.    We have carefully considered the submissions made by both the sides\n\nand perused the records. In the present case, the appellant herein had\n\nimported Cooper Cathodes under Bills of Entry annexed from Page 23 to\n\nPage 30 of the Appeal Memorandum. The details of the import is reproduced\n\nbelow for the ease and reference.\n\n\n      Sr.    Bill of Entry   Description of Goods     Weight of   Value of the goods\n      No     No. &amp; Date      imported as per import   the goods        (in Rs.)\n                             document                  (in MT)\n      1      7078275 dated   Copper Cathode            496.452      352074983/-\n             14.01.2022      Conforming to LME\n      2      7078197 dated   Grade A                   500.67       355065655/-\n             14.01.2022\n      3      7078308 dated                            350.603       248641497/-\n             14.01.2022\n      4      7078318 dated                            150.105       106451811/-\n             14.01.2022\n                                       Total          1497.83      106,22,33,946/-\n\n\n\n20.    The issue in the present case relates to whether the order dated 2 nd\n\nJune 2022 passed by the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) is correct and\n\nproper in law to the extent it directs the appellant to provide a bank\n\nguarantee to the extent of 15% of the value of seized goods. We find that\n\nbefore the said impugned Order was passed, an order was issued on 4 th\n\nFebruary 2022 by which the goods impugned in the 4 Bills of Entry were\n\nallowed to be provisionally cleared under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_10\">section 110A</a> of the Customs Act on\n\nAppellant furnishing the bank guarantee amounting to 15% of the duty\n\npayable. The said order was withdrawn by the office of the Commissioner of\n\nCustoms, through the office of the Commissioner of Customs, Ahmedabad\n\non the ground that:\n\n\n       (a)     The origin of the goods is still under examination along with\n\n       verification of authenticity of COO and investigation in this regard may\n                                               10\n                                                     CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n      require inspection and testing of the goods by the experts on the\n\n      subject, if required;\n\n\n      (b)    Provisional release of such goods at this stage is premature\n\n      inasmuch as the goods appear to be in the nature of prohibited goods\n\n\n21.   The overall value of goods in the present case is over 100 crores. It is\n\nsubmitted that under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_11\">Customs Act</a>, there is no provision granting power\n\nto the department to review an order passed under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 110A</a> and\n\naccordingly the impugned order is bad in law. Reliance is placed on the\n\ndecision of Gauhati High court in the case of Dharampal Satyapal Limited\n\n(supra) Which reads as under:\n\n\n      &quot;26. It is well settled that a Court or Tribunal or adjudicating authority becomes\n      functus officio (ceases to have control over the matter) once a judgment is pronounced\n      or the order is made. Such judgment and order, when becomes final, cannot be altered,\n      changed, varied or modified unless the statute, where under the Court, Tribunal or the\n      adjudicating authority functions, so permit. There can also be no doubt that the power of\n      review is not an inherent power. The right to seek review of an order is neither natural\n      nor fundamental right of an aggrieved party. Such power must be conferred by law. If\n      there is no power of review, the order cannot be reviewed. However, a Court, having\n      plenary power, is not affected by any statutory restrictions in reviewing its own order. In\n      Patel Narshi Thakershi v. Pradyumansinghji Arjunsinghji, reported in (1971) 3 SCC 844,\n      the Supreme Court, while dealing with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/94641690/\" id=\"a_13\">Saurashtra Land Reforms Act,\n      1951</a>, and referring to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_14\">Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC</a>, held that there is no inherent power of\n      review with the adjudicating authority if it is not conferred by law. The observations\n      read, &quot;It is well settled that the power to review is not an inherent power. It must be\n      conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication. No provision in the Act\n      was brought to (our) notice from which it could be gathered that the Government had\n      power to review its own order, it is obvious that its delegate could not have reviewed its\n      order.&quot; The position of law, so laid down in Patel Narshi Thakershi (supra), has been\n      reiterated by the Supreme Court in other later cases.&quot;\n\n\n\n22.   In the present case, once the provisional release order was passed,\n\nthe Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Ahmedabad, had no\n\njurisdiction under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_15\">Customs Act</a> to review the earlier order dated 4 th\n\nFebruary 2022 granting provisional release to the goods imported vide the\n\nBills of Entry impugned in the present case. The correct approach would\n                                               11\n                                                      CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nhave been for the Respondent to challenge the correctness of the said\n\nprovisional release order before this Tribunal.\n\n\n23.   Further to the above, there have been no reasons provided in the\n\norder dated 6th April 2022 as to why the department has changed its stand\n\nby directing the appellant to furnish a bank guarantee to the extent of 15%\n\nof the value of the seized goods as against the original condition mentioned\n\nin the provisional order dated 4th February 2022 which was to provide a bank\n\nguarantee to the extent of 15% of the duty payable.\n\n\n24.   The Commissioner (Appeals) in his order has negated the aforesaid\n\nsubmission on       the   ground that the          order     dated 04.02.2022        is an\n\nexecutive/interlocutory      order.     The    said    finding   of   the    Commissioner\n\n(appeals) is bad in in law and contrary to law settled by the Larger Bench of\n\nthis Hon&#x27;ble Tribunal in the case of Gaurav Pharma Limited (supra) wherein\n\nit has been held as under:\n\n\n      &quot;46. Having carefully considered the legal provisions, submissions made by appellants\n      and Revenue we hold :-\n\n             (a)    the contention that an order or decision by the Adjudicating Authority\n             under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 110A</a> is administrative or interim in nature is misconceived.\n\n             (b)      provisions of <a href=\"/doc/982108/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 129A(1)(a)</a> clearly authorize an appeal against an\n             order or decision by the Adjudicating Authority issued under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 110A</a>. There\n             is no legal basis to restrict the scope of such appeal in the absence of any\n             restrictive conditions in the provision.\n\n      47. In view of our above findings the reference is answered as follows :\n\n             An appeal lies before this Tribunal against an order passed by Commissioner of\n             Customs under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 110A</a> of the Customs Act, 1962 for provisional release of\n             the goods.&quot;\n\n\n25.   The aforesaid decision of Larger Bench has been upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nPunjab and Haryana High court in the case of Commissioner vs. Gaurav\n\nPharma Limited - 2020 (373) ELT 233 (P &amp; H) wherein it is held as under:\n                                             12\n                                                    CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n         &quot;14. It cannot be disputed that the powers vested with the adjudicating authority\n         to be exercised for considering the prayer for provisional release of goods is\n         circumscribed with well-settled principles of law governing the same. Such an order\n         is not based on any policy, rather on settled principles of law. These orders cannot\n         be issued mechanically, rather many factors are required to be considered such as\n         the nature of goods, seriousness of offence, whether the goods being imported are\n         prohibited, etc. etc. Any such order passed has civil consequences, hence, it cannot\n         be opined that the same is passed by the adjudicating authority in exercise of its\n         administrative powers rather it has rightly been opined by the Tribunal that the\n         exercise of powers by the Commissioner under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 110A</a> of the Act is quasi\n         judicial in nature and so the order passed.\n\n         15. The language of <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 110A(l)(a)</a> of the Customs Act is quite wide in its\n         application to take within its umbrella such an order passed, against which appeal\n         would lie to the Tribunal. Restrictive meaning as is suggested by the Revenue\n         cannot be given to the provisions. Power of judicial review in exercise of\n         extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">226</a> of the Constitution of India is\n         altogether different and cannot be compared with a statutory right of appeal where\n         the scope of interference is larger. The terms used in <a href=\"/doc/543615/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 129(l)(a)</a> of the\n         Customs Act are &#x27;decision&#x27; or &#x27;orders&#x27;. Meaning thereby it is not limited to any final\n         decision.\n\n         16. Similar view has been expressed by Delhi High Court in the case of Gurdeep\n         Kaur passed in WP (C) 4152/2015 on 17-9-2015 [2015 (325) E.L.T. 490 (Del.)] and in\n         Cantex Chemical Fibres Private Limited, 2014 (310) E.L.T. 50, by Rajasthan High\n         Court in the case of Shivmahal Textiles Private Limited in CWP No. 4946/2012,\n         decided on 18-12-2012 and Gentleman Suitings Private Limited, 2012 (12)\n         TMI1001.&quot;\n\n26.   There is no provision under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_25\">Customs Act</a> except <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 110</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_27\">110A</a> of the Customs Act that permits provisional release of goods. The\n\norder dated 04.02.2022 and 06.04.2022 have been issued under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\n\n110A</a> of the Customs Act. Also undisputedly both the orders have been\n\nissued/addressed to the Appellant. To hold that the said order dated\n\n04.02.2022 was interlocutory/ executive will be in teeth of and/or contrary\n\nto the aforesaid settled law. We find that once the order dated 04.02.2022\n\nwas issued by the deputy commissioner of customs he became functious\n\nofficio and could not have reviewed the said order. Also the aforesaid\n\nfindings of the Commissioner (Appeals) is amusing as both order dated\n\n04.02.2022 and 06.04.2022 have been issued under 110<a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_29\">A of the Customs\n\nAct</a> and to hold that one order was executive and accepting appeal against\n\n06.04.2022 is self contradictory stand. In any event as held above the same\n                                               13\n                                                     CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nis contrary to the law settled by larger bench of this Tribunal which was\n\nultimately upheld by the Punjab and Haryana High Court (supra).\n\n\n27.   Without prejudice to our above discussion and in any event, the\n\ncondition of furnishing the bank guarantee to the extent of 15% of the value\n\nof goods or 15% of the duty value itself requires to tested in terms of the\n\nlaw delivered on the issue in the case of T.G. Enterprises (Supra) and\n\nvarious other decisions cited before this Hon&#x27;ble Tribunal.\n\n\n28.   In T.G. Enterprise, the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High court, in a case relating to\n\nalleged mis-declaration of country of Origin, was looking into the challenge\n\nto the provisional release condition by which the Petitioner was directed to\n\nfurnish a Bank Guarantee to the extent of 25% of differential duty amount.\n\nThe High court was pleased to set aside the said condition by observing as\n\nunder:\n\n\n      &quot;These petitions arise in common background. Petitioners attempted to import areca\n      nuts and black pepper claiming Sri Lanka as a point of origination. It is not in dispute\n      that on such goods, as long as the point of origination is Sri Lanka, there are substantial\n      concessions in customs duty. The customs duty is either nil or at heavily reduced rate as\n      compared to the normal duty if the origination of goods is not from any of the\n      neighbouring country with which India has entered into the treaty for such preferential\n      terms.\n\n      &quot;2. Before clearance of goods, the department had preliminary doubt about the true\n      origination of the goods. An inquiry was therefore instituted. During the course of\n      investigation, statements of the importers and several other persons under <a href=\"/doc/877314/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 108</a>\n      of Customs Act were recorded. As per the affidavits filed by the departments, such\n      statements reveal a clandestine attempt to misdeclare the origination of goods as Sri\n      Lanka though the goods originated from Indonesia or Vietnam. According to the\n      departmental authorities, there was thus a clear attempt to evade duty. The goods were\n      seized under seizure memos. The petitioners&#x27; request for provisional release came to be\n      rejected upon which, these petitions are filed.\n\n      3. 4. 5. .................... .....................            ......................\n\n      6. Having heard Learned Counsel for the parties and having perused the documents on\n      record, it prima facie appears that the department&#x27;s case of mis-declaration of\n      origination of goods to evade customs duty is based primarily on the statements of\n      importers and others, recorded under <a href=\"/doc/877314/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act. Of course further\n      investigation is going on and we cannot foresee what further evidence may be collected.\n      Be that as it may, when yet show cause notice for final adjudication has not been issued\n      and even after issuance of show cause notice, completion of the adjudication is bound\n                                              14\n                                                     CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n      to consume time, it would not be in anyone&#x27;s interest to stop the clearance of goods\n      when it is not the case of the department that the import of such materials has any\n      other legal impediment. In other words, the question of correct assessment of duty and\n      related issues such as penalty for misdeclaration if ultimately established and personal\n      penalties would only be the question to be decided eventually. In the meantime,\n      holding back the goods without clearance would invite mounting demurrage. The goods\n      would continue to occupy space in the warehousing godowns. While thus expressing\n      our anxiety to release the goods on provisional basis, we cannot ignore the interest of\n      the revenue. If ultimately the department succeed in establishing the allegations of\n      misdeclaration of origination of goods, the import would invite much higher rate of\n      duty. The penalties may also follow. Under such circumstances, the question of\n      balancing the equities and protecting the interest of the revenue is often times\n      considered by the Courts. The trend during the period of time that has emerged is\n      unless there are special facts, to release the goods on bank guarantee of a certain\n      percentage of the probable differential duty of customs and securing the rest of the\n      amount through personal bond. In this context, we had examined the prima facie\n      material at the command of the department more minutely. What appears is that the\n      department relies heavily on various statements of the petitioners and other persons\n      including Sarfaraz Pathan to contend two things. Firstly, that the goods were not of the\n      origination of Sri Lanka and secondly, that the real importer behind the scene is Sarfaraz\n      Pathan, the present petitioners being mere fronts. We also record that these\n      statements were subsequently, retracted but many of the retractions were themselves\n      retracted.\n\n      7. In view of such facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons noted\n      above, we permit provisional release of the goods in question upon fulfilling following\n      conditions :\n\n             (i)   The petitioners shall give unconditional bank guarantee in favour of the\n             department of 35% of the differential value of the duty;\n\n             (ii)   To furnish personal bond of 125% of the value of the goods;\n\n             ...\n</pre>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1\">29.   In the present case undisputedly, nothing has been placed on record\n\nshowing any undervaluation of goods. While the department has submitted\n\nbefore the Commissioner (Appeals) that the issue of valuation is under\n\ninvestigation, however what cannot be ignored is that the goods imported\n\nare copper cathodes and the value of the same is determined basis the LME\n\nprice. Also the provisional release order dated 06.04.2022 and the seizure\n\nmemo dated 02.02.2022 is totally silent on the aspect of undervaluation.\n\nThe seizure memo in fact gives the complete history of the matter but does\n\nnot contain any allegation about the undervaluation of goods. Given the\n\nabove it is submitted that the condition to furnish BG of 15% of value is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                               15</span>\n                                                      CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nextremely onerous, more so when the Appellant has shown his will to\n\ndeposit entire amount of duty on value declared by it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">30.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75402389\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/75402389/\" id=\"a_32\">Amit Enterprises vs. Union of India</a> (supra), wherein the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nPunjab and Haryana High Court was pleased to modify the condition of\n\nfurnishing of bank guarantee of 25% of the market value of the seized goods\n\non the ground that the petitioner therein had paid duty as per the valuation\n\nof the department. The relevant extract of the said decisions is reproduced\n\nbelow:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;11. We find merit in the contention that requirement of giving a declaration that the\n      petitioner will not challenge the value of the goods, is unreasonable and arbitrary. The\n      petitioner cannot be debarred from asserting its version as to the value and\n      classification of goods. If such a condition is allowed to be imposed, the department can\n      unilaterally allege any valuation and continue to keep the goods under detention unless\n      the affected party agrees to withdraw the challenge to the valuation. This will amount\n      to denial of justice. Similarly, requirement of furnishing bank guarantee equal to 25% of\n      the full market value of the seized goods is also, in the facts and circumstances of the\n      case, arbitrary. Mere fact that condition of 10% of bank guarantee was upheld by this\n      Court in T.L. Verma and M/s. Kundan Rice Mills cannot be justification to impose such\n      conditions in each and every case. In those cases, this Court was satisfied that the\n      importers had adopted fraudulent tactics which, prima facie, justified opinion for\n      confiscation of goods. The said judgments cannot apply to every case of detention.\n      Mere allegation of liability to confiscation is not enough. Circumstances and grounds\n      justifying opinion about liability to confiscation is open to judicial scrutiny.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      12. Power of detention of goods is a drastic power and exercise of such power has to\n      be hedged by safeguards to check its abuse and limit its exercise only to situation where\n      it is intended by law to be exercised. Existence of power and exercise of power are\n      independent. Mere fact that there is a power to confiscate does not mean that such\n      power could be exercised mechanically or arbitrarily. The authority exercising such\n      power must strictly justify the same. Balance has to be maintained between the need\n      for exercise of such power for the purpose for which the same has been conferred and\n      adverse effects on rights of a citizen.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_3\">13. As held in Mapsa Tapes Pvt. Limited, power of search and seizure to check evasion\n      of tax has been upheld as temporary interference with the right of a citizen. At the same\n      time, seizure is not only invasion of right of property but also right of privacy. Such right\n      can be affected only by fair and reasonable procedure as held in <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_33\">Maneka Gandhi v.\n      Union of India</a>, AIR 1978 SC 597.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_4\">Referring to this aspect, in a recent decision in <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_34\">District\n      Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad and Another v.

The petitioner\nalready paid duty even as per valuation of the department. The department has not\nkept in mind guidelines of expeditious investigation and of not detaining the goods on\nsimple dispute of valuation/classification. The department has not shown prima facie\ncase for exercise of power of confiscation and has only relied upon existence of power.\nIn these circumstances, the requirement of bank guarantee equal to 25% of the value of\ngoods is clearly arbitrary and mala fide and the said condition cannot be sustained.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                               17</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">                                                     CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">      16.

The next question would then be as to the legality and propriety of the\n      conditions imposed in the impugned order for provisional release of the goods. The\n      operative portion of the impugned order has already been reproduced above. As per\n      the order the conditions imposed for provisional release are as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             The goods are to be provisionally released:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">              (i) the goods are to be subjected to mutilation so as to render them as scrap\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">              (ii) furnish bond equal to the value of the impugned good.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              (iii) furnish Bank Guarantee equivalent to 30% of the value of the goods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">              (iv) pay the differential duty assessed by the department.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">      29. The Ld. Counsel for importer has submitted that they have no objection to comply\n      with all the above conditions except the condition to furnish Bank Guarantee equivalent\n      to 30% of the value of the goods. It is submitted by him that they have paid the entire\n      duty on the declared value and also willing to pay the differential duty if any assessed by\n      the department. We find that when the importer has made such payments and the\n      goods having been mutilated to render them as scrap so as not to be reused as such for\n      any purpose, the condition to furnish BG in addition to bond is not warranted or\n      justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"111075698\" id=\"span_10\">30.

The cases cited at the Bar indicate the consistent view that release of the\n             consignments be permitted in terms of <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 110A</a> of the Act upon condition\n             that the petitioner directed to remit 30 to 50% of 30% of the differential duty and\n             execute a personal bond for the remaining70%., upon remittance and furnishing\n             of which, the goods shall be released forthwith. On the aspect of under invoicing,\n             the Department is at liberty to initiate proceeding for adjudication that will be\n             concluded after hearing the petitioner and in accordance with law.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">             From the above, it can be seen that the reliance placed by the Commissioner\n             (Appeals) to impose the condition to furnish BG is highly misplaced and\n             misconstrued. In both these decisions, the Hon&#x27;ble Courts have directed to pay\n             20/30 percent of the differential duty. In the present case, the importer having\n             paid duty on the declared value and having accepted to pay the entire differential\n             duty, we are of the considered opinion that in the interest of justice, the condition\n             to furnish Bank Guarantee equivalent to 30% of value of the goods requires to be\n             waived which we hereby do.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">      32. In the result, the impugned order is modified to the limited extent of setting aside\n      the direction to furnish Bank Guarantee of 30% equivalent to the value of the goods.\n      The appeal filed by importer C/60419/2021 is partly allowed in above terms. The appeal\n      filed by Revenue C/60469/2021 is dismissed.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"51491596\" id=\"span_14\">32.   Similar view was taken by the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High court, in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/51491596/\" id=\"a_52\">Veer Impex vs. Union of India</a> -- 2016 (332) E.L.T. 87 (Guj) where the\n\ncondition to provide bank guarantee was set aside.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">33.   We find that in the present case as well, as discussed above and\n\nevident from the Bills of entry, the appellant was always willing to deposit\n\nthe entire duty of BCD + IGST which is over 25 crores and therefore, the\n\ncondition to direct the appellant to furnish a bank guarantee of 15% of the\n\nvalue of the goods which is over 100 crores is excessive and arbitrary more\n\nimportantly when the appellant is willing to deposit the duty payable on the\n\nseized goods. There is no dispute on the valuation or classification of the\n\ngoods as is clear from the impugned provisional order. The provisional\n\nrelease order dated 06.04.2022 and the seizure memo dated 02.02.2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                         19</span>\n                                             CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\ndoes not mention anything about undervaluation as has been argued by the\n\ndepartment    before   the   Commissioner     (Appeals).   The   Commissioner\n\n(appeals) instead of verbatim copying the notes of arguments furnished by\n\nthe department ought to have considered the seizure Memo which clearly\n\nstate in Para 5 read with Para 8 that the case of the department against the\n\nAppellant is limited to mis-declaration of country of origin certificate. Even\n\nletter dated 09.02.2022 which was issued by the Additional Commissioner of\n\ncustoms, withdrawing the provisional release order dated 04.02.2022 states\n\nthat the reason to withdraw the letter is due to ongoing investigation in\n\nrelation to Country of origin certificate furnished by the Appellant. Even\n\nbefore this Hon&#x27;ble Tribunal no evidence has been placed to show any under\n\nvaluation of goods.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">34.   We are further of the view that the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat\n\nHigh Court in the case of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Vs. Hazel\n\nMercantile Ltd., relied upon by the Commissioner (Appeals) is not applicable\n\nto the facts of the present case for more than one reason. In the case of\n\nHazel Mercantile undisputedly it was the case of the department that the\n\nassessee had misclassified the description of the imported goods which had\n\nan impact on the rate of duty, whereas, in the present case, it is an\n\nundisputed fact that there is no issue with regard to the classification of\n\ngoods, description or valuation of the imported goods as declared by the\n\nappellant. The Seizure memo dated 02.02.2022 and the withdrawal order\n\ndated 09.09.2022 clarify that the only issue in the present case is with\n\nrespect to country of origin certificate supplied by the supplier of goods to\n\nthe Appellants. Accordingly, it can be prima facie said that, as on date there\n\nis no Lis between the Appellant and the department in relation to\n\nclassification of the goods, valuation of the goods on which duty is sought to\n\nbe paid and description of the goods.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                       20</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">                                            CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">35.   Apart from the same, the appellant herein has always been willing to\n\npay the entire duty amount of around Rs. 25 crores at the time of clearance\n\nof the goods, which was not the case in Hazel Mercantile case (supra) as in\n\nthe case of Hazel no duty was payable on export goods.          Also, it is an\n\nundisputed fact that the department has alleged mis-declaration on the part\n\nof the appellant based on Country of Origin certificate which in normal cases\n\nis issued by the appropriate authority of the exporting country and the\n\nimporter in India has no role in the issuance of the same. The investigation\n\non this behalf is ongoing and yet to be concluded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">36.   In view thereof, the facts in the present case are completely different\n\nthan the facts in the case of Hazel Mercantile case (supra). Apart from the\n\nabove, a perusal of the Order dated 27.11.2022 passed by the Hon&#x27;ble High\n\ncourt would show that the same was an interim order and was passed by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble High Court keeping in mind the peculiar facts of that case. In the\n\ncase before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court on the date of hearing, 50% of the goods\n\nwas on the verge of being exported and keeping the said fact in mind as an\n\ninterim measure, the High Court was pleased to direct the assessee to\n\nprovide bank guarantee of Rs. 15 crores. While it is a settled law that interim\n\norders have no binding precedent even then the order passed in the Hazel\n\nMercantile (supra) was passed in the peculiar facts of that case. Ultimately\n\nthe Petition was disposed off without deciding the merits of the case as the\n\ngoods were exported and investigation was ongoing. We also find that the\n\nCommissioner of Customs (Appeals) has not appreciated the order dated\n\n21.04.2022 passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court in the same case\n\nreducing the bank guarantee amount from 15 crores to 7 crores. Even in the\n\nsaid order the matter was not discussed on merits and the writ application\n\nwas disposed off on the ground that the goods had been exported and the\n\ninvestigation in the matter was ongoing. In view thereof, considering the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                       21</span>\n                                            CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nfact that the decision in the case of Hazel (supra) was passed concerning\n\nvery different set of facts, the same cannot be applied to the facts of every\n\ncase. The same clearly shows that the order of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court in\n\nHazel cannot be applied to each and every case of provisional release as the\n\nsame is an interim order whereas the decisions relied upon by the Appellants\n\nof the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court and Punjab &amp; Haryana High court has held\n\nthat once the differential amount of duty is paid, the provisional release of\n\ngoods should be permitted on assessee, furnishing a bond full value of the\n\ngoods.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75402389\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75402389\" id=\"span_19\">37.    Looking at the facts of the present case, we find that the law laid down\n\nin the decision of T.G. Enterprise, where the issue like in the present case\n\nrelated to mis-declaration of country of <a href=\"/doc/75402389/\" id=\"a_53\">Origin Certificate, Veer Enterprises</a>\n\n(Supra) and <a href=\"/doc/75402389/\" id=\"a_54\">Amit Enterprise</a> (supra) is squarely applicable to the facts of the\n\npresent case as well and the condition to direct the Appellant to furnish bank\n\nguarantee of 15% of the value of goods is arbitrary, excessive and bad in\n\nlaw.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">38.    We also find that a perusal of the seizure memo clarifies that it is the\n\ncase of the department that the goods in the present case were imported\n\nfrom Iran as against the declared country viz., Zambia. Keeping the above\n\nallegation in mind, the department had seized the goods imported vide 4\n\nimpugned Bills of Entry. The argument of the appellant that no benefit is\n\naccrued to the appellant by allegedly mis-declaring the Country of Origin as\n\nthey were always willing to pay the entire duty payable on these goods\n\nwithout even the considering the said COO cannot be ruled out and have to\n\nborne in mind when conditions for provisional release was decided under the\n\napproval of the Respondent. Also, it is pertinent that the department before\n\nthis Tribunal has not controverted the submissions of the Appellant that in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       22</span>\n                                            CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\nterms of para 2.18 of the Foreign Trade Policy, the goods are freely\n\nimportable even when imported from Iran. In other words it is not even the\n\ncase of the department before us that there was any restriction on import of\n\ngoods from Iran. The said fact can be seen from the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nBombay High court in the case of Global Ace Shipping Lines Inc (supra)\n\nwhere the department has conceded that there is no restriction in import of\n\ngoods from Iran.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">39.   Further it is a settled law that an importer unless proven otherwise\n\nbeyond doubt cannot be said to have any role in the issuance of a COO as\n\nthe same is issued by the competent authority of the originating country.\n\nHowever, at this point in time, it is also important to note that the\n\ninvestigation is ongoing and country of origin of the goods will be\n\ndetermined only after the investigation is concluded. At this point of time, it\n\ncannot be said with certainty that the goods were imported from Iran. Be\n\nthat as it may, the issue before this Tribunal is limited to the provisional\n\nrelease of goods and the same be decided keeping in mind the fact that the\n\nAppellant never intended to avail any benefit basis the COO and were and\n\nare willing to pay the duty on the goods imported vide the 4 bills of entry.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">40.   Having held the above the reliance placed by the Appellants on the\n\ndecision of the Mumbai Bench of this Tribunal cannot be brushed aside\n\neither. The said decision dated 17.06.2022 has been passed in identical facts\n\nand the Tribunal for goods valued at around 35 crores has direct the\n\nAppellant to furnish a bank guarantee of 50 lakhs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">41.   As per our above discussion and finding, we are of the view that the\n\norder of Commissioner (Appeals) is liable to be set aside to the extent it\n\ndirects provision of BG of 15% of value of goods and we do so. Further,\n\nconsidering the facts of the present case and taking the support of various\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                             23</span>\n                                                   CUSTOMS Appeal No. 10292 of 2022-DB\n\n\n     judgments as discussed above, we hold that the ends of justice shall be met\n\n     if the appellant is allowed the provisional release of the subject imported\n\n     goods on execution of Bond of full value of such goods and furnishing the\n\n     bank guarantee of Rs.1 Crore (Rupees One Crore only). Needless to say that\n\n     the appellant shall pay the Customs duty as assessed by the department at\n\n     the time of provisional release of the goods.
