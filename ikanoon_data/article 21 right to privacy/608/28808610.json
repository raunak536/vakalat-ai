Singh, Counsel for the respondents No.4 and 5.\n\n          None for the respondent no.3, though served\n\n          Heard through Video Conferencing.\n\n          The respondents no. 1 and 2 have filed their return. The same\n\nare not on record. The respondents no. 4 and 5 have also filed their\n\nreturn, but the same are not on record.\n\n          Office to verify and upload the same.\n\n          It is submitted by the counsel for the State that a circular has\n\nbeen issued in the year 2014 regarding sharing of information with\n\nmedia and the uncovered faces of an accused can be shared with the\n\nmedia subject to various restrictions as mentioned in the circular\n\nitself.\n\n          It is further submitted that Sub Inspector Dinesh Rajput had\n\nwrongly arrested the petitioner therefore, a news was published in the\n\nnewspaper with the photograph of the Sub Inspector that he has been\n\nplaced under suspension.\n\n          In the previous compliance report, it was disclosed by the\n\nrespondents, that suspension order of said Sub-Inspector was revoked\n\nafter fourteen days, and he has been transferred out of the jurisdiction\n    2     THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    WP No.13057/2020\n            Arun Sharma vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.\n\nof Police Station Bahodapur, but has not placed the copy of his new\n\nposting on record.\n\n       Thus, one thing is clear that just after fourteen days, the\n\nsuspension of the said Sub Inspector was revoked on 28-8-2020,\n\nwhereas the punishment order was passed on 14-10-2020 i.e. just\n\nonly two days prior to filing of first compliance report, whereas\n\nthe notices of this petition were issued on 8-9-2020. The\n\npunishment order has also been placed on record in which it is\n\nmentioned that gross negligence has been committed by the Sub-\n\nInspector and Constable. The respondents have not clarified as to\n\nwhat prompted the revocation of suspension of the Sub Inspector\n\nwho had grossly violated the privacy of the petitioner by projecting\n\nhim as a hard core criminal in the newspaper with his uncovered face.\n\nFurther, the respondents had given due publicity of suspension of the\n\nSub Inspector but thereafter they did not give any publicity to the\n\nrevocation of his suspension order in order to inform the general\n\npublic, that even after committing such serious lapse, the suspension\n\nof the guilty officer was revoked. It is submitted by the counsel for\n\nthe respondents that the concerning Sub Inspector was saddled with\n\nthe punishment of fine of Rs.5000/-. However, the return filed by the\n\nrespondents is completely silent about the fact as to whether violation\n\nof the rights and privacy of an innocent citizen of the country by\n    3     THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    WP No.13057/2020\n            Arun Sharma vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.\n\npublishing his photograph with uncovered face and projecting him as\n\nhard core criminal as well as tarnishing his reputation, is a normal\n\nmistake or is a serious misconduct. Further, the return is completely\n\nsilent on the question of payment of compensation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India. Therefore, the respondents no. 1 to 2 are\n\ndirected to clarify the following aspects.\n\n        (I)      Whether gross violation of rights and privacy of\n        an innocent citizen of India and tarnishing his\n        reputation is a minor mistake or serious misconduct?\n        (II)     Why due publicity of revocation of suspension\n        of the Sub Inspector was not given in the newspaper\n        thereby informing the general public that even in a\n        case of gross violation of rights and privacy of an\n        innocent person, a police officer can get away very\n        easily?\n        (III) Furthermore, once the respondents have already\n        admitted that they have grossly violated the rights and\n        privacy of an innocent person, still then the return is\n        completely silent on the question of payment of\n        compensation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n        India?\n        (IV) Whether any enquiry into the allegations made\n        against the respondents no. 4 and 5 was made or not\n        and if so, its conclusion.\n        (V)      It is mentioned in the punishment order dated\n        14-10-2020, that although the petitioner was not\n        arrested, but he was detained in police station.\n    4       THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP No.13057/2020\n              Arun Sharma vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.\n\n          Whether detention of a person in a police station\n          without his formal arrest was permissible, because\n          according to the respondents no. 1 and 2, the petitioner\n          was detained as a person with similar name was\n          wanted in a criminal case which was registered in the\n          year 2011.\n          (VI) It has also been mentioned in the suspension\n          order, that the news pertaining to the detention and\n          photographs of the petitioner were uploaded on Social\n          Media.    The respondents no.1 and 2 are further\n          directed to clarify that which law permits them to\n          upload the photographs of an accused on Social\n          Media?\n\n       So far as the circular relied upon by the respondents no. 1 to 2\n\nis concerned, an important question of law arises that &quot;whether the\n\nState Govt. by issuing an exeuctive instruction, can violate the\n\nFundamental Rights of an accused as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India, by getting their uncovered faces published\n\nin the News paper or in any other form of media or by parading them\n\nin Society etc.?&quot;\n\n       The Supreme Court in the case of Mehmood Nayyar Azam\n\nVs. State of Chhattisgarh reported in (2012) 8 SCC 1 has held as\n\nunder :\n\n          19. We have referred to the aforesaid paragraphs of\n          D.K. Basu case to highlight that this Court has\n          emphasised on the concept of mental agony when a\n 5    THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                WP No.13057/2020\n        Arun Sharma vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.\n\n    person is confined within the four walls of police\n    station or lock-up. Mental agony stands in\n    contradistinction to infliction of physical pain. In the\n    said case, the two-Judge Bench referred to <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 5</a> of\n    the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948\n    which provides that: &quot;No one shall be subjected to\n    torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\n    punishment.&quot; Thereafter, the Bench adverted to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n    21</a> and proceeded to state that the expression &quot;life or\n    personal liberty&quot; has been held to include the right to\n    live with human dignity and thus, it would also include\n    within itself a guarantee against torture and assault by\n    the State or its functionaries. Reference was made to\n    <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution which postulates that\n    a person accused of an offence shall not be compelled\n    to be a witness against himself.\n    20. It is worthy to note that in D.K. Basu, the concern\n    shown by this Court in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P.\n    was taken note of. In Joginder Kumar case this Court\n    voiced its concern regarding complaints of violation of\n    human rights during and after arrest. It is apt to quote a\n    passage from the same: (Joginder Kumar case, SCC pp.\n    263-64, paras 8-9)\n       &quot;8. The horizon of human rights is expanding. At\n       the same time, the crime rate is also increasing. Of\n       late, this Court has been receiving complaints\n       about violation of human rights because of\n       indiscriminate arrests. How are we to strike a\n       balance between the two?\n       9. A realistic approach should be made in this\n       direction. The law of arrest is one of balancing\n       individual rights, liberties and privileges, on the\n       one hand, and individual duties, obligations and\n       responsibilities on the other; of weighing and\n       balancing the rights, liberties and privileges of the\n       single individual and those of individuals\n       collectively; of simply deciding what is wanted\n       and where to put the weight and the emphasis; of\n       deciding which comes first -- the criminal or\n       society, the law violator or the law abider....&quot;\n    21.

Anand, J.\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">    (as His Lordship then was), dealing with the various\n    facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> in D.K.

If the\n    functionaries of the Government become law-breakers,\n    it is bound to breed contempt for law and would\n    encourage lawlessness and every man would have the\n    tendency to become law unto himself thereby leading\n    to anarchy. No civilised nation can permit that to\n    happen, for a citizen does not shed off his fundamental\n    right to life, the moment a policeman arrests him. The\n    right to life of a citizen cannot be put in abeyance on\n    his arrest. The precious right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a>\n    of the Constitution of India cannot be denied to\n    convicts, undertrials, detenus and other prisoners in\n    custody, except according to the procedure established\n    by law by placing such reasonable restrictions as are\n    permitted by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">                        *      *     *    *\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_2\">25.

The right to life is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a>\n    of the Constitution and a fortiori, it includes the right\n    to live with human dignity and all that goes along with\n    it.

From the aforesaid discussion, there is no\n    shadow of doubt that any treatment meted out to an\n    accused while he is in custody which causes\n    humiliation and mental trauma corrodes the concept of\n    human dignity.

The main objective of police is to apprehend\n       offenders, to investigate crimes and to prosecute\n       them before the courts and also to prevent\n       commission of crime and above all to ensure law\n       and order to protect the citizens&#x27; life and property.\n       The law enjoins the police to be scrupulously fair\n       to the offender and the Magistracy is to ensure\n       fair investigation and fair trial to an offender. The\n       purpose and object of Magistracy and police are\n       complementary to each other. It is unfortunate\n       that these objectives have remained unfulfilled\n       even after 40 years of our Constitution.\n       Aberrations of police officers and police excesses\n       in dealing with the law and order situation have\n       been subject of adverse comments from this\n       Court as well as from other courts but it has\n       failed to have any corrective effect on it.

We\n         may hasten to add that a balance has to be struck and,\n         in this context, we may fruitfully quote a passage from\n         D.K. Basu: (SCC pp. 434-35, para 33)\n            &quot;33. There can be no gainsaying that freedom of\n            an individual must yield to the security of the\n            State. The right of preventive detention of\n            individuals in the interest of security of the State\n            in various situations prescribed under different\n            statutes has been upheld by the courts. The right\n            to interrogate the detenus, culprits or arrestees in\n            the interest of the nation, must take precedence\n            over an individual&#x27;s right to personal liberty. ...\n            The action of the State, however, must be &#x27;right,\n            just and fair&#x27;. Using any form of torture for\n            extracting any kind of information would neither\n            be &#x27;right nor just nor fair&#x27; and, therefore, would\n            be impermissible, being offensive to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21.</a>\n            Such a crime suspect must be interrogated --\n            indeed subjected to sustained and scientific\n            interrogation -- determined in accordance with\n            the provisions of law. He cannot, however, be\n            tortured or subjected to third-degree methods or\n            eliminated with a view to elicit information,\n            extract confession or derive knowledge about his\n            accomplices, weapons, etc. His constitutional\n            right cannot be abridged [except] in the manner\n            permitted by law, though in the very nature of\n            things there would be qualitative difference in the\n            method of interrogation of such a person as\n            compared to an ordinary criminal.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">                                         (emphasis in original)\n\n\n        Accordingly, the Counsel for the State prays for and is granted\n\na week&#x27;s time to file a detailed return.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">        In view of the importance of question which has arisen for\n\nconsideration, this Court think it apposite to request the Advocate\n             11       THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                               WP No.13057/2020</span>\n                       Arun Sharma vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">         General to address this Court.
