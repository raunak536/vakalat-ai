An inmate of a Hostel in Kottayam, Kerala was found dead in the\n                          well on 27.03.1992 and the local police had registered the crime No.\n                          187/92 as &#x27;unnatural death&#x27; on the basis of the statement given by &#x27;X&#x27;.\n                          Though the Central Bureau of Investigation had entertained reasonable\n                          doubt as to whether death of deceased was suicide or homicide as\n                          evident from the final report submitted before the Court on 29.11.1996,\n                          the Kochi unit of the very same investigating agency took a different\n                          stand in concluding that the death was homicide.

As the result of the virginity test\n                          conducted on the petitioner proved counter-productive, officials of\n                          Central Bureau of Investigation with a view to save their face,\n                          fabricated a new story to the effect that the Petitioner has undergone\n                          surgery for suturing of hymen or &quot;hymenoplasty&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          7.

It is\n                          petitioner&#x27;s case that the above reports were made public by the Central\n                          Bureau of Investigation even before the result of the test was submitted\n                          before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate on 02.12.2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">                          8.

Feeling extremely\n                          embarrassed and shocked by the conduct of the officials of Central\n                          Bureau of Investigation, the petitioner on 11.02.2009 preferred a\n                          representation before the Secretary to the Government of India, Public\n                          Grievances Department and the Director, Central Bureau of\n                          Investigation, stating the true facts and sought for their intervention in\n                          the matter and to redress the grievances of the petitioner.

However, in this regard, reliance has been placed upon the\n                          decision of <a href=\"/doc/631068/\" id=\"a_22\">National Institute of Mental Health &amp; Neuro Sciences v.\n                          C.

Essentially, this is an issue which deals with the\n                          fundamental rights of a person, and without any iota of doubt, the Writ\n                          Courts have the mandate to deal with and decide such issues.\n                          Furthermore, this is not the case, or an issue which is directly or\n                          substantially before the matter pending before High Court of Kerala,\n                          which is an appeal against conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 302</a> IPC.

Consequently, doctors\n                                     should not, on the basis of the medical examination\n                                     conclude whether rape had occurred or not. Only findings\n                                     in relation to medical findings should be recorded in the\n                                     medical report.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                                     10. It is crucial to underscore that the size of the vaginal\n                                     introitus has no bearing on a case of sexual assault, and\n                                     therefore a test to ascertain the laxity of the vaginal muscles\n                                     which is commonly referred to as the two-finger test must\n                                     not be conducted. On the basis of this test observations/\n                                     conclusions such as &#x27;habituated to sexual intercourse&#x27;\n                                     should not be made and this is forbidden by law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                                     11. Routinely, there is a lot of attention given to the status\n                                     of hymen. The &quot;finger test&quot; is also conducted to note the\n                                     distensibility of the hymen. However it is largely\n                                     irrelevant because the hymen can be torn due to several\n                                     reasons. An intact hymen does not rule out sexual\n                                     assault, and a torn hymen does not prove previous\n                                     sexual intercourse. Hymen should therefore be treated like\n                                     any other part of the genitals while documenting\n                                     examination findings in cases of sexual assault.

It was\n                                     argued that even though the narcoanalysis technique,\n                                     polygraph examination and the BEAP test have not been\n                                     expressly enumerated, they could be read in by examining\n                                     the legislative intent. Emphasis was placed on the phrase\n                                     `and such other tests&#x27; to argue that the Parliament had\n                                     chosen an approach where the list of `modern and scientific\n                                     techniques&#x27; contemplated was illustrative and not\n                                     exhaustive.

On the other hand, the counsel for the appellants have\n                                     contended that the Parliament was well aware of the\n                                     impugned techniques at the time of the 2005 amendment\n                                     and consciously chose not to include them in the amended\n                                     Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_96\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_97\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_98\">54</a> of the CrPC. It\n                                     was reasoned that this choice recognised the distinction\n                                     between testimonial acts and physical evidence. While\n                                     bodily substances such as blood, semen, sputum, sweat,\n                                     hair and fingernail clippings can be readily characterised as\n                                     physical evidence, the same cannot be said for the\n                                     techniques in question. This argument was supported by\n                                     invoking the rule of `ejusdem generis&#x27; which is used in the\n                                     interpretation of statutes.

In light of the same, it can also be observed and reiterated that\n                          there is no procedure, under any law for the time being, which provides\n                          for &quot;virginity test&quot; of a female accused.

The respect for\n                          human dignity cannot be questioned and it has been recognised as\n                          human right by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court as part of fundamental right\n                          under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 21.</a> In this regard, Apex Court&#x27;s decisions make it clear\n                          that notion of dignity may not be so worded in the Fundamental\n                          Constitutional right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 21</a>, but it has been held to be part of it\n                          and also has been held to be of immense value.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">                          80.    Most shockingly, in the present case the virginity test was used to\n                          determine the truth of the accusation of murder against the petitioner.\n                          Undoubtedly, the test in itself is extremely traumatic for a victim of\n                          sexual assault as well as upon any other women in custody and is bound\n                          to have devastating effect on the psychological as well as physical\n                          health of the person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">                          81.

Further, without an iota of doubt, the same rests on gender bias\n                          and society&#x27;s view and obsession with the false concept of virginity\n                          being equated with purity of a woman. Needless to say, it also amounts\n                          to controlling women&#x27;s body, their sexual behavior and the view that a\n                          woman with the hymen is pure and innocent. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court,\n                          in the most recent case of <a href=\"/doc/196199017/\" id=\"a_142\">State of Jharkhand v.
