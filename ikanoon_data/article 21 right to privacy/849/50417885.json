The respondent, Shri Vinod Kumar, Representative of CPIO/Deputy\nGeneral Manager attended the hearing through video-conferencing. The original\nRTI applicant Shri Harjinder Singh attended the hearing in person.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">5.     The written submissions of the parties are taken on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_2\">6.     The Counsel for the Appellant Banks has referred the reply provided by\nCPIO and order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO, RBI and FAA\nhad violated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to the Appellant Bank before passing their decisions in the matter. No\nreasons were given for not offering personal hearing in the first appeal. The\ncounsel for the appellant prayed before the Commission that the FAA order\nshould be set-aside for want of reasons. The FAA in its order has mentioned\nthat the interim order passed in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_1\">Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal Mistry &amp;\nOrs.</a> would apply only to those banks which are parties to the petition,namely,\nHDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank Limited, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank Limited and\nState Bank of India. As the appellant banks were not a party <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_2\">in that case</a>, it\nwould not be possible for the appellant banks to take benefit of that order.He\nfurther submitted that the information sought by the RTI applicant was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                       Page 3 of 11</span>\n completely exempted as the information sought includes commercial\ninformation received in fiduciary capacity, disclosure of information sought is\nspecifically prohibited under various legislations and is specifically exempted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8 (1) (a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_4\">8 (1) (b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_5\">8(1) (d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_6\">8(1) (g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">8(1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act.\nThe disclosure of personal/ commercial information of the banks and its\ncustomers violated the right to privacy as guaranteed under the Right to life as\nenshrined under the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Such\ndisclosurewould cause serious prejudice to the market value andreputation of\nthe Appellant Bank and its customers. The Counsel has further referred the Full\nBench judgment of this Hon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors. vide order dated 05.05.2022 wherein an\nidentical issue of disclosure of Inspection Report, has remanded the matters to\nthe CPIO for fresh adjudication by keeping in mind principles of natural justice.\nMoreover, considering the fact that several banks have filed inter alia Writ\nPetition No. 1159 of 2019&amp; Ors tagged with it before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt inter-alia impugning the disclosure of their Inspection Reports or parts\nthereof by the RBI under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI Act</a>, this Hon&#x27;ble Commission has also held\nthat any decision by the CPIO in respect of disclosure of Inspection Report\nwould amount to pre-judging the issues pending the admitted Writ Petition (s)\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38822192\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"70304748\" id=\"span_5\">7.     The Counsel for Bank of India further submitted that the CPIO and FAA\nhave passed their decisions in favour of RTI Applicant, ignoring the previous\norder passed by the Hon&#x27;ble CIC in <a href=\"/doc/70304748/\" id=\"a_10\">Amitava Choudhary vs. Canara Bank</a> &amp;\nother Banks, and also the fact that a similar case, which is applicable to these\ncases, is pending before Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court for final consideration, (<a href=\"/doc/38822192/\" id=\"a_11\">Public\nInterest Litigation vs. Housing &amp; Urban Development Corporation &amp; Ors. Writ\nPetition</a> (s) (C) No. 573/2003 and the Hon&#x27;ble Court has accepted he\ninformation of borrowers only through a sealed cover.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">8.     The representative of the Reserve Bank of India while presenting their\ncase inter alia submitted that the applicant, Shri Harjinder Singh, vide his RTI\napplications inter alia, sought, list of defaulters of Appellant Banks etc. They\nfurther submitted that the then CPIO issued the notice under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(1)</a> read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_14\">(RTI Act</a>) to the third\nparty i.e. appellant banks informing that RBI was required to disclose the\ninformation sought by Shri Harjinder Singh enabling appellant to make written\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                        Page 4 of 11</span>\n submission within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice as to whether\nthe information sought by the applicant might be disclosed or not along with\nreasons for the same. After considering the response from Appellant Banks, the\nCPIO decided to disclose the list of defaulters of Appellant Banks etc. to the\napplicant. He further submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RBI vs.\nJayantilal N. Mistry &amp; Ors (2016) 3 SCC 525 observed that :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       &quot;RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI\n       ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might\n       embarrass individual banks. It is duty bound to comply with the\n       provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_15\">RTI Act</a> and disclose the information sought by the\n       applicant.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">The FAA also observed that the list of borrowers as reported under CRILC by\nbanks forms part of the record maintained by the Reserve Bank and the same is\nin the possession of the Reserve Bank. Hence the same may be disclosed by\nRBI. The FAA concluded that there was no merit in the appeal of the appellant\nand accordingly dismissed the bank&#x27;s appeal.The respondent further contended\nthat in order to withhold any information sought by the applicant under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_16\">RTI\nAct</a>, such information should fall within any of the exempted items under\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_18\">9</a> of the RTI Act. The respondent also contended that the list of\nsuch defaulters is reported every quarter along with their names and amount\noutstanding. It is an automatic compilation and such information is readily\navailable with the Reserve Bank of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_7\">9.     The original applicant Mr. Harjinder Singh submitted that the information\nsought should have been provided by the bank within 30 days in compliance\nwith the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">RTI Act, 2005</a> and the orders given by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court,\nHon&#x27;ble Commission. But the above information was knowingly not made\navailable by the bank within the mandatory period of 30 days prescribed in law.\nBy doing so, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_20\">RTI Act, 2005</a> and the order given by the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_21\">Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry &amp; Ors</a>\nbearing T. P. (Civil) No. 91/2015, Contempt Petition No. 928/2016 and the\norder given by the Commission in Appeal no. 23/2019 has been violated by the\nbank.He further submitted that RBI is supposed to uphold public interest and\nnot the interest of individual banks. RBI is clearly not in fiduciary relationship\nwith any bank. RBI has no legal duty to maximize the benefit of any public\nsector or private sector bank and thus there is no relationship of &#x27;trust&#x27; between\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                       Page 5 of 11</span>\n them. RBI has a statutory duty to upload the interest of the public at large, the\ndepositors, the country&#x27;s economy and the banking sector. Thus, RBI ought to\nact with transparency and not hide information that might embarrass individual\nbanks. It is the duty bound to comply with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_22\">RTI Act</a> and\ndisclose the information sought by the applicant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">Decision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">10. The Commission, after hearing the submissions of both the parties and\nafter perusal of records, observes that the original RTI applicant has sought\ninformation regarding the names, address, firm and total amount due (principal\namount of loan taken + Amount of interest payable on loan taken) of the top\n100 bank defaulters of country. He has further asked information regarding the\ntotal number of bank defaulters in the country who have taken a loan of Rs. One\nCrore or more from the banks.The Counsels for the appellant banks have sought\nadjournment on the ground that the copy of second appeal bearing file\nno.CIC/RBIND/A/2020/106462 which is filed by original applicant Shri\nHarjinder Singh has not been received by them. However, the Commission has\ngone through the interim order passed in the said case and found that the copy\nof second appeal in the said case has duly served to the appellant\nbanks.Therefore, the request for adjournment is being rejected and the above\nmentioned matters are being disposed of by way of the present order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">11. The Commission observes that the CPIO, Reserve Bank of India had\nissued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_24\">11(3)</a> to the appellant banks intending to\ndisclose the information. Aggrieved by the decision of the CPIO, the appellant\nbanks had filed first appeal with the First Appellate Authority. The FAA had\nalso dismissed the first appeal of the appellant banks summarily. The\nCommission observes that the RTI applicant had insisted for disclosure of\ninformation as per Jayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case. The Appellant Bank contested\nthat the information sought as a whole is exempted from disclosure under\n<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8 (1) (a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_26\">8 (1) (b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_27\">8(1) (d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_28\">8(1) (g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_29\">8(1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act and that\nthe CPIO/FAA has not passed any reasoned order settling their objections nor\ngave any opportunity of hearing to them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">12. The Commission takes note of the submissions made by the Bank that the\ninformation, proposed to be disclosed is in the nature of credit information and\nthe same was supplied to the Reserve Bank of India in fiduciary capacity as the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                          Page 6 of 11</span>\n Regulator under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_30\">Banking Regulation Act</a> as well as the\n<a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_31\">Credit Information Companies Regulation Act, 2005</a> (CICRA). Under the\nprovisions of CICRA there is a specific bar on the disclosure of such credit\ninformation. Further <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 174 (a)</a> of the Act, clearly mentions that &quot;no credit\ninformation shall be disclosed to any person other than its specified users.&quot;The\nlarge amount of data relating to its clients including their identity, personal\ndetails etc. is shared with the regulator, without any redaction or withholding\nthe information, in good faith that these will be objectively analysed in\ndischarge of their statutory obligations to make fair judgment on their\nfunctioning without affecting their competitive position.To this extent, there is\nan element of trust and confidence in sharing the data, both financial and\noperational, between the RBI and the bank. The information and data of the\nclients in the hands of Bank also has the element of trust and confidence that\nsuch data will not be disclosed or shared against their right to\nprivacy/commercial interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">13. There are apparently two set of such information which have been shared\nby the bank with the regulator under statutory obligation. First is the\ninformation/data of clients relating to their business/commercial operations,\nfinancial transactions, business and commercial strategy which is shared by\nclients with financial institutions in full trust and confidence and is held by them\nin fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_33\">RTI Act</a> in their\nhands. Second set is the information relating to business strategy, decisions,\ntransactions, other operational data etc. of financial institution which may have\nbearing on their competitive position and also enjoys the exemption from\ndisclosure in their hands, if it is a public authority or otherwise, under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_34\">RTI\nAct</a>. The Commission is of the view that the exemption of disclosure of certain\ninformation under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of financial\ninstitutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in good\nfaith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligations. This aspect is not\nthe ratio of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s judgment and\ndecision of the regulator to consider redacting such data/information while\ndisclosing the reports is to be aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts covering such aspects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">14. The Commission further observes that orders simpliciter irrespective of\nthe different objections raised by the appellant banks apparently lacked\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                         Page 7 of 11</span>\n application of mind or reasons on the part of the CPIO. Reasons for rejection or\nacceptance of the specific objections raised by them has not been spelt out in the\norder which has been passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to\nthem.The Commission further observes that the CPIO is free to take decisions\non disclosure of information as per provision of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_36\">RTI Act, 2005</a> giving a\nreasoned orders on the objections filed. The CPIO while issuing notice under\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Appellant Bank to\nfile their objections, if any, against disclosure of information sought but has not\nfound it necessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While not doing so,\nthe CPIO has not passed any reasoned order covering his deliberations on their\nobjections, his understanding of law or jurisprudence in deciding specific\nobjections, in favor of disclosure etc. Order passed by the CPIO is cryptic,\nwithout any reference to objections raised by the Appellant Bank. Similarly, the\nFAA instead of passing a speaking order have also given a cryptic orderto the\nAppellant Bank. The CPIO and the FAA are expected to apply their mind and\npass reasoned order elaborating reasons for accepting /not accepting their\nobjections in his decisionbefore issuing the intent of disclosing the information.\nFurther, no opportunity of personal hearing was given to the appellant nor\nspeaking order have been passed by FAA for not giving such opportunity of\nhearing. The Commission is of the view that every objection should be dealt and\nrejected/accepted with a reason and reasons for not giving opportunity of\npersonal hearing should be well reasoned too in view of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">15. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicant has to\nbe adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Appellant Bank,\nvarious judicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts\nproviding guidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should necessarily\nbe provided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise should be\nreasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, such order should enumerate\nthe principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of list of defaulters of Appellant\nBank or various types of data, personal information, commercially sensitive\ninformation of clients or institution, specifically excluded disclosures under\nvarious Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">16. In light of the above observations and considering all the facts and\ncircumstances of the above mentioned cases, the Commission is of the view that\ncontour of the arguments are identical as held in the Full Bench judgment of this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                        Page 8 of 11</span>\n Hon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors.\nvideorder dated 05.05.2022. It has been observed that there are minor variations\nin the matters in hand when compared with the matters already decided by the\nCommission as above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_12\">17. It has already been stated supra that detailed view in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022 wherein issues of\nredaction, ratio of <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_38\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case and other related issues are discussed\nin detail. Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make\nit clear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right\nto information are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has held that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks may be allowed taking into account the\ncircumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a blanket manner.\nThe Commission advised the CPIO to consider taking the relevant references\nfrom the said order while deciding the above mentioned cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_13\">18. Further, the Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the\nconduct of the CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the\nopinion that due care has to be taken by according opportunity of personal\nhearing and making reasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands\nof the CPIO and later in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the\nCPIO will be required to adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the\nobservations of the Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the\nCPIO will take view on various objections filed by the Appellant and\nsubmissions made by applicant to reach the decision in favor or against on case\nto case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_40\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case, Commission&#x27;s judgment dated 05.05.2022 and other\nrelevant judgments, some of which have been referred in this order as well.\nHence, with these observations the order passed by the CPIO and FAA in these\nmatters is set aside and the case is being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication\nafresh in line with the Commission full bench decision passed in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022.
