Raghunath Amanta of\n\nVillage-Giridharprasad, P.S. Rasol, District-Dhenkanal alleged\n\nthat for a period of about one year, she had been in love with\n\nthe petitioner. Both the petitioner as well as the accused were\n\nvillage mates and classmates. On the day of last Kartika Puja,\n\nthe petitioner went to the house of the informant and taking\n\nadvantage of the fact that she was alone he committed rape on\n\nthe informant and recorded the gruesome episode in his\n\nmobile phone. When the informant warned petitioner that she\n\nwould apprise her parents of the brutal incident and its\n\nserious undertones, the petitioner threatened to kill her as\n\nwell as to make viral the said photos/videos. Further, she has\n\nalleged that since 10.11.2019, the petitioner had maintained\n\nphysical intimacy with the informant. Upon the informant\n\nnarrating the incident to her parents, the petitioner opened a\n\nfake Facebook ID in the name of the informant and uploaded\n\nall the objectionable photos using the said ID in order to\n\nfurther traumatize her. Though the informant disclosed the\n\nsaid fact to the IIC, Rasol P.S.by way of a written complaint on\n\n27.04.2020, the Police has failed to take any step on the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 3</span>\n\n\n\ncomplaint and thereby portrayed unsoundness of the police\n\nsystem. After much difficulty, finally, the informant could get\n\nthe present FIR lodged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that both the\n\nvictim and accused are adults and hence they know the best\n\nwhat is right or wrong. He submits that the petitioner is an ITI\n\nDiploma holder who is in search of a job and hence his\n\ndetention will spoil his career. He further stated that the\n\npetitioner is interested to marry the victim girl unconditionally.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.Per contra, learned counsel for the State submits that the\n\npetitioner had not only forcibly committed sexual intercourse\n\nwith the victim girl, but he had also deviously recorded the\n\nintimate sojourn and uploaded the same on a fake Facebook\n\naccount created by the Petitioner in the name of the victim\n\ngirl. The allegation is very serious since there is specific\n\nallegation of forced sexual intercourse by the accused/\n\npetitioner against the will of the victim. Statement recorded\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/46432913/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 161</a> of Cr. P.C. of the victim girl also clearly\n\ndivulges the fact that the petitioner has been threatening and\n\nblackmailing her stating that if she discloses these facts to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   4</span>\n\n\n\nanybody, he would eliminate her and also make her intimate\n\nscenes viral on the social media. He further submits that the\n\ninvestigation of the case has not yet been completed. The\n\nentire allegation in the FIR as well as the statement recorded\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 161</a> of Cr.P.C read with other materials\n\navailable on records are a pointer to the fact that the crime\n\ncommitted by the petitioner are serious in nature. The victim\n\nhas been at the receiving end of an unabated mental torture\n\ndue to the blackmailing tactics used by the petitioner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5. While examining the pages of the case records, prima facie,\n\nit   appears   that   the   petitioner   has   uploaded   the   said\n\nphotos/videos on a social media platform i.e. Facebook and\n\nwith the intervention of the police, after some days, he deleted\n\nthe said objectionable contents from the Facebook. In fact, the\n\ninformation in the public domain is like toothpaste, once it is\n\nout of the tube one can&#x27;t get it back in and once the\n\ninformation is in the public domain it will never go away.\n\nUnder the Indian Criminal Justice system a strong penal\n\naction is prescribed against the accused for such heinous\n\ncrime but there is no mechanism available with respect to the\n\nright of the victim to get the objectionable photographs deleted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                   5</span>\n\n\n\nfrom the server of the Facebook. The different types of\n\nharassment, threats and assaults that frighten citizens in\n\nregard to their online presence pose serious concerns for\n\ncitizens. There is an unprecedented escalation of such\n\ninsensitive behavior on the social media platforms and the\n\nvictim like the present one could not get those photos deleted\n\npermanently from server of such social media platforms like\n\nfacebook. Though the statute prescribes penal action for the\n\naccused for such crimes, the rights of the victim, especially,\n\nher right to privacy which is intricately linked to her right to\n\nget deleted in so far as those objectionable photos have been\n\nleft   unresolved.   There   is   a   widespread   and   seemingly\n\nconsensual     convergence        towards   an     adoption   and\n\nenshrinement of the right to get deleted or forgotten but hardly\n\nany effort has been undertaken in India till recently, towards\n\nadoption of such a right, despite such an issue has inexorably\n\nposed in the technology dominated world. Presently, there is\n\nno statute in India which provides for the right to be\n\nforgotten/getting the photos erased from the server of the\n\nsocial media platforms permanently. The legal possibilities of\n\nbeing forgotten on line or off line cries for a widespread debate.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        6</span>\n\n\n\nIt is also an undeniable fact that the implementation of right\n\nto be forgotten is a thorny issue in terms of practicality and\n\ntechnological nuances. In fact, it cries for a clear cut\n\ndemarcation of institutional boundaries and redressal of many\n\ndelicate issues which hitherto remain unaddressed in Indian\n\njurisdiction.     The     dynamics         of   hyper    connectivity-       the\n\nabundance, pervasiveness and accessibility of communication\n\nnetwork have redefined the memory and the prescriptive\n\nmandate to include in the technological contours is of pressing\n\nimportance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">6. However, this instant issue has attracted sufficient\n\nattention overseas in the European Union leading to framing of\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which governs the\n\nmanner in which personal data can be collected, processed\n\nand erased. The aspect of right to be forgotten appears in\n\nRecitals 65 and 66 and in Article-17 of the GDPR1,which vests\n\nin the victim a right to erasure of such material after due\n\ndiligence by the controller expeditiously. In addition to this,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 5</a> of the GDPR requires data controllers to take every\n\nreasonable step to ensure that data which is inaccurate is\n\nThe data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller regarding the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1</span>\n\n\nerasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the\ncontroller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 7</span>\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;erased or rectified without delay&quot;. Every single time, it cannot\n\nbe expected that the victim shall approach the court to get the\n\ninaccurate data or information erased which is within the\n\ncontrol of data controllers such as Facebook or Twitter or any\n\nother social media platforms.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">7. A similar issue was raised in England in the Wales High\n\nCourts in NT1 and NT2 Vs. Google LLC2which ordered Google\n\nto delist search results referring to the spent conviction of a\n\nbusinessman known as NT2 but rejected a similar request\n\nmade by a second businessman, NT1. The claimants therein\n\nhad been convicted of certain criminal offences many years\n\nago who complained that search results returned by Google\n\nfeatured links to third-party reports about the convictions in\n\nthe past which were either inaccurate and/or old, irrelevant\n\nand of no public interest or otherwise an illegitimate\n\ninterference with their rights.     The reliefs sought in those\n\ncases were based on the prevailing data protection laws and\n\nEnglish Law principles affording protection in case of tortuous\n\nmisuse of private information.       The Court rejected NT1&#x27;s\n\nrequest based on the fact that he was a public figure with a\n\n\n2[2018]   EWHC 799 (QB).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                8</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n\nrole in public life and thus the crime and its punishment could\n\nnot be considered of a private nature. In contrast, the Court\n\nupheld NT2&#x27;s delisting claim with the reasoning that his crime\n\ndid not involve dishonesty. His punishment had been based on\n\na plea of guilt, and information about the crime and its\n\npunishment had become out of date, irrelevant and of no\n\nsufficient legitimate interest to users of Google to justify its\n\ncontinued availability.3\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">8.In the case of Google Spain SL &amp; another v. Agencia\n\nEspanola de Protection de Datos (AEPD) and another4 the\n\nEuropean Court of Justice ruled that the European citizens\n\nhave a right to request that commercial search engines, such\n\nas Google, that gather personal information for profit should\n\nremove links to private information when asked, provided the\n\ninformation is no longer relevant. The Court in that case ruled\n\nthat the fundamental right to privacy is greater than the\n\neconomic interest of the commercial firm and, in some\n\ncircumstances; the same would even override the public\n\ninterest in access to information. The European Court in the\n\naforesaid case had affirmed the judgment of the Spanish Data\n\n3Para   223 of Judgment\n4C-131/12[2014]    QB 1022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   9</span>\n\n\n\nProtection Agency (SPDA)in a case which concerned a\n\nproceeding relating to bankruptcy which had ordered removal\n\nof material from the offending website by recognizing a\n\nqualified right to be forgotten and held that an individual was\n\nentitled to have Google de-list information of which he\n\ncomplained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">9.Recently, the European Court of Justice, in Google LLC vs.\n\nCNIL5 ruled that &quot;currently there is no obligation under EU law,\n\nfor a search engine operator to carry out such a de-referencing\n\non all the versions of its search engine.&quot; The Court also said\n\nthat the search operator must &quot;take sufficiently effective\n\nmeasures&quot; to prevent searches for differenced information\n\nfrom within the EU. The court specifically held as under:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot;69. That regulatory framework thus provides the\n        national supervisory authorities with the instruments\n        and mechanisms necessary to reconcile a data\n        subject&#x27;s rights to privacy and the protection of\n        personal data with the interest of the whole public\n        throughout the Member States in accessing the\n        information in question and, accordingly, to be able to\n        adopt, where appropriate, a de-referencing decision\n        which covers all searches conducted from the territory\n        of the Union on the basis of that data subject&#x27;s name.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">5Case   C-507/17\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                           10</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">70. In addition, it is for the search engine operator to\ntake, if necessary, sufficiently effective measures to\nensure the effective protection of the data subject&#x27;s\nfundamental rights. Those measures must themselves\nmeet all the legal requirements and have the effect of\npreventing or, at the very least, seriously discouraging\ninternet users in the Member States from gaining\naccess to the links in question using a search\nconducted on the basis of that data subject&#x27;s name\n(see, by analogy, judgments of 27 March 2014, UPC\nTelekabel     Wien,      C-314/12,      EU:C:2014:192,\nparagraph 62, and of 15 September 2016, McFadden,\nC-484/14, EU:C:2016:689, paragraph 96).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">71. It is for the referring court to ascertain whether,\nalso having regard to the recent changes made to its\nsearch engine as set out in paragraph 42 above, the\nmeasures adopted or proposed by Google meet those\nrequirements.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">72. Lastly, it should be emphasized that, while, as\nnoted in paragraph 64 above, EU law does not\ncurrently require that the de-referencing granted\nconcern all versions of the search engine in question,\nit also does not prohibit such a practice. Accordingly,\na supervisory or judicial authority of a Member State\nremains competent to weigh up, in the light of\nnational standards of protection of fundamental rights\n(see, to that effect, judgments of 26 February\n2013, Åkerberg Fransson, C-617/10, EU:C:2013:105,\nparagraph 29, and of 26 February 2013, Melloni,\nC-399/11, EU:C:2013:107, paragraph 60), a data\nsubject&#x27;s right to privacy and the protection of\npersonal data concerning him or her, on the one\nhand, and the right to freedom of information, on the\nother, and, after weighing those rights against each\nother, to order, where appropriate, the operator of that\nsearch engine to carry out a de-referencing concerning\nall versions of that search engine.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">73. In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to\nthe questions referred is that, on a proper\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                11</span>\n\n\n\n     construction of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 12(b)</a> and subparagraph (a) of\n     the first paragraph of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 14</a> of Directive 95/46\n     and <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 17(1)</a> of Regulation 2016/679, where a\n     search engine operator grants a request for de-\n     referencing pursuant to those provisions, that\n     operator is not required to carry out that de-\n     referencing on all versions of its search engine, but on\n     the versions of that search engine corresponding to all\n     the Member States, using, where necessary, measures\n     which, while meeting the legal requirements,\n     effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously\n     discourage an internet user conducting a search from\n     one of the Member States on the basis of a data\n     subject&#x27;s name from gaining access, via the list of\n     results displayed following that search, to the links\n     which are the subject of that request.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">10.Presently, there is no statue which recognizes right to be\n\nforgotten but it is in sync with the right to privacy, which was\n\nhailed by the Apex Court as an integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21 (right\n\nto life)</a> in K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-9J.).6 However, the\n\nMinistry of Law and Justice, on recommendations of Justice\n\nB.N. Srikrishna Committee, has included the Right to be\n\nforgotten which refers to the ability of an individual to limit,\n\ndelink, delete, or correct the disclosure of the personal\n\ninformation on the internet that is misleading, embarrassing, or\n\nirrelevant etc. as a statutory right in Personal Data Protection\n\nBill, 2019. The Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-\n\n9J.)has held right to be let alone as part of essential nature of\n\n\n6(2017)   10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                               12</span>\n\n\n\nprivacy of an individual.

Essential nature of privacy\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">    297. What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy\n    postulates the reservation of a private space for the\n    individual, described as the right to be let alone. The\n    concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual.\n    The ability of an individual to make choices lies at the\n    core of the human personality. The notion of privacy\n    enables the individual to assert and control the\n    human element which is inseparable from the\n    personality of the individual. The inviolable nature of\n    the human personality is manifested in the ability to\n    make decisions on matters intimate to human life.\n    The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n    matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\n    over which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy.\n    The body and the mind are inseparable elements of\n    the human personality. The integrity of the body and\n    the sanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation\n    that each individual possesses an inalienable ability\n    and right to preserve a private space in which the\n    human personality can develop. Without the ability to\n    make choices, the inviolability of the personality\n    would be in doubt. Recognizing a zone of privacy is\n    but an acknowledgment that each individual must be\n    entitled to chart and pursue the course of\n    development of personality. Hence privacy is a\n    postulate of human dignity itself. Thoughts and\n    behavioural patterns which are intimate to an\n    individual are entitled to a zone of privacy where one\n    is free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy,\n    an individual is not judged by others. Privacy enables\n    each individual to take crucial decisions which find\n    expression in the human personality. It enables\n    individuals to preserve their beliefs, thoughts,\n    expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                            13</span>\n\n\n\nagainst societal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is\nan intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of the right of\nthe individual to be different and to stand against the\ntide of conformity in creating a zone of solitude.\nPrivacy protects the individual from the searching\nglare of publicity in matters which are personal to his\nor her life. Privacy attaches to the person and not to\nthe place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes\nthe foundation of all liberty because it is in privacy\nthat the individual can decide how liberty is best\nexercised. Individual dignity and privacy are\ninextricably linked in a pattern woven out of a thread\nof diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     XXXXXXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">402. &quot;Privacy&quot; is &quot;[t]he condition or state of being free\nfrom public attention to intrusion into or interference\nwith one&#x27;s acts or decisions&quot; [Black&#x27;s Law\nDictionary (Bryan Garner Edition) 3783 (2004)] . The\nright to be in this condition has been described as\n&quot;the right to be let alone&quot; [ Samuel D. Warren and\nLouis D. Brandeis, &quot;The Right To Privacy&quot;, 4 Harv L\nRev 193 (1890)] . What seems to be essential to\nprivacy is the power to seclude oneself and keep\nothers from intruding it in any way. These intrusions\nmay be physical or visual, and may take any of several\nforms including peeping over one&#x27;s shoulder to\neavesdropping directly or through instruments,\ndevices or technological aids.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             XXXXXXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">479. Both the learned Attorney General and Shri\nSundaram next argued that the right to privacy is so\nvague and amorphous a concept that it cannot be held\nto be a fundamental right. This again need not detain\nus. Mere absence of a definition which would\nencompass the many contours of the right to privacy\nneed not deter us from recognising privacy interests\nwhen we see them. As this judgment will presently\nshow, these interests are broadly classified into\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                           14</span>\n\n\n\ninterests pertaining to the physical realm and\ninterests pertaining to the mind. As case law, both in\nthe US and India show, this concept has travelled far\nfrom the mere right to be let alone to recognition of a\nlarge number of privacy interests, which apart from\nprivacy of one&#x27;s home and protection from\nunreasonable searches and seizures have been\nextended to protecting an individual&#x27;s interests in\nmaking vital personal choices such as the right to\nabort a foetus; rights of same sex couples--including\nthe right to marry; rights as to procreation,\ncontraception, general family relationships, child-\nbearing, education, data protection, etc. This\nargument again need not detain us any further and is\nrejected.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                  XXXXXXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">560.

The Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices\n\nand Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information)\n\nRules, 2011, India&#x27;s first legal framework recognized the need\n\nto protect the privacy of personal data, but it failed to capture\n\nthe issue of the &quot;Right to be forgotten&quot;. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India in the case of <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_26\">K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of\n\nIndia</a> (supra) held that purpose limitation is integral for\n\nexecutive projects involving data collection - unless prior\n\npermission is provided, third parties cannot be provided access\n\nto personal data.12This principle is embodied in<a href=\"/doc/65305/\" id=\"a_27\"> S.5</a> of the yet-\n\nto-be-implemented          Personal    Data      Protection      Bill,   2019.\n\nPurpose Limitation enhances transparency in data processing\n\nand helps examine the proportionality of the mechanism used\n\nto collect data for a specific purpose. Moreover, it prevents the\n\nemergence        of   permanent       data     &#x27;architectures&#x27;    based    on\n\ninterlinking databases without consent. In the present case\n\nthe proposition of purpose limitation is not applicable as the\n\n11[MANU/GJ/0029/2017]\n12See   Para 166 of K.S.

No person\n\nmuch less a woman would want to create and display gray\n\nshades of her character. In most of the cases, like the present\n\none, the women are the victims. It is their right to enforce the\n\nright to be forgotten as a right in rem. Capturing the images\n\nand videos with consent of the woman cannot justify the\n\nmisuse of such content once the relation between the victim\n\nand accused gets strained as it happened in the present case.\n\nIf the right to be forgotten is not recognized in matters like the\n\npresent one, any accused will surreptitiously outrage the\n\nmodesty of the woman and misuse the same in the cyber\n\nspace unhindered. Undoubtedly, such an act will be contrary\n\nto the larger interest of the protection of the woman against\n\nexploitation and blackmailing, as has happened in the present\n\ncase.   The sloganeering of &quot;betibachao&quot; and women safety\n\nconcerns will be trampled.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">14. <a href=\"/doc/1621547/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 27</a> of the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018\n\ncontains the right to be forgotten. Under <a href=\"/doc/1621547/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 27</a>, a data\n\nprincipal (an individual) has the right to prevent continuing\n\ndisclosure of personal data by a data fiduciary. The aforesaid\n\nprovision which falls under Chapter VI (Data Principal Rights)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                   19</span>\n\n\n\nof the Bill, distinctly carves out the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; in no\n\nuncertain terms. In terms of this provision, every data\n\nprincipal shall have the right to restrict or prevent continuing\n\ndisclosure of personal data (relating to such data principal) by\n\nany data fiduciary if such disclosure meets any one of the\n\nfollowing three conditions, namely if the disclosure of personal\n\ndata:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(i) has served the purpose for which it was made or is no\n\nlonger necessary; or (ii) was made on the basis of the data\n\nprincipal&#x27;s    consent   and   such    consent   has   since   been\n\nwithdrawn; or (iii) was made contrary to the provisions of the\n\nbill or any other law in force.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">        In addition to this, <a href=\"/doc/1954990/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 10</a> of the Bill provides that a\n\ndata fiduciary shall retain personal data only as long as may\n\nbe reasonably necessary to satisfy the purpose for which it is\n\nprocessed. Further, it imposes an obligation on every data\n\nfiduciary to undertake periodic reviews in order to determine\n\nwhether it is necessary to retain the personal data in its\n\npossession. If it is not necessary for personal data to be\n\nretained by a data fiduciary, then such personal data must be\n\ndeleted in a manner as may be specified.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                20</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">15. In the instant case, prima facie, it appears        that the\n\npetitioner has not only committed forcible sexual intercourse\n\nwith the victim girl, but has also deviously recorded the\n\nintimate sojourn and uploaded the same on a fake Facebook\n\naccount. Statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/46432913/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 161</a> of Cr. P.C. of\n\nthe victim girl is also clearly in sync with FIR version.\n\nConsidering the heinousness of the crime, the petitioner does\n\nnot deserve any consideration for bail at this stage. However,\n\nthis Court is of the view that Indian Criminal Justice system is\n\nmore of a sentence oriented system with little emphasis on\n\nthe disgorgement of victim&#x27;s loss and suffering, although the\n\nimpact of crime on the victim       may vary significantly for\n\nperson(s) and case(s)-- for some the impact of crime is short\n\nand intense, for others the impact is long-lasting. Regardless,\n\nmany victims find the criminal justice system complex,\n\nconfusing and intimidating. Many do not know where to turn\n\nfor help. As in the instant case, the rights of the victim to get\n\nthose uploaded photos/videos erased from Facebook server\n\nstill remain unaddressed for want of appropriate legislation.\n\nHowever, allowing such objectionable photos and videos to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                               21</span>\n\n\n\nremain on a social media platform, without the consent of a\n\nwoman, is a direct affront on a woman&#x27;s modesty and, more\n\nimportantly, her right to privacy. In such cases, either the\n\nvictim herself or the prosecution may, if so advised, seek\n\nappropriate orders to protect the victim&#x27;s fundamental right to\n\nprivacy, by seeking appropriate orders to have such offensive\n\nposts erased from the public platform, irrespective of the\n\nongoing criminal process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">16. In view of the foregoing discussion of the case, this Court\n\nis not inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail.
