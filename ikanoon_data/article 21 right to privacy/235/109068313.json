It is asseverated that the petitioner received\n\ninformation from various sources that officials of MCD, NDMC and\n\nother    Government Engineering Departments          entrusted with the\n\nexecution of engineering works under Common Wealth Games have\n\nflouted CVC guidelines and CPWD specifications for their personal\n\ngains at the cost of public exchequer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.      It is urged that the petitioner has submitted numerous complaints\n\nto the higher authorities but the same have fallen on deaf years, the\n\nauthorities have maintained a sphinx-like silence.     Allegations have\n\nbeen made how their favourite officers have allotted work to their\n\nfavourite contractors without following the norms. In this background,\n\nthe aforesaid reliefs have been sought.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.      Be it noted, with regard to allegations made in respect of\n\nsiphoning of funds, Union of India has constituted a Committee\n\nnamely, Shunglu Committee. Today, in two other writ petitions, this\n\nCourt has directed that the Shunglu Committee shall look into the\n\ngrievances put forth and liberty has been granted to the petitioners\n\ntherein to file documents before the Committee. Mr. A.S. Chandhiok,\n\nlearned ASG appearing in those cases had fairly acceded that the\n\nsame shall be looked into by the Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">6.      When this matter was called out first time, a pass over was\n\nsought on behalf of Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned ASG appearing for the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C) 6802/2010                                            Page 3 of 14</span>\n Municipal Corporation of Delhi. After Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned\n\nASG appeared, he submitted that ordinarily he would not have opposed\n\nfor issuance of similar directions but the present petition is an abuse of\n\nthe process of the Court especially by the present NGO, namely,\n\nPaardarshita Public Welfare Foundation, which is represented by its\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.     Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned ASG has brought to our notice the\n\ninformation sought for by the NGO from Public Information Officer,\n\nMCD South Zone, Green Park, New Delhi.

We are not giving any kind of clean chit to Mr.\n\nDeepak Hastir, currently posted as Deputy Commissioner of MCD, but\n\nthe informations which have been asked are          in   the    realm         of\n\nvengeance and clearly exposes the vindictive attitude. In fact, it is a\n\nreflection of extreme vengeance, proclivity in bad taste and definitely\n\nwould not come within the realm of the 2005 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">10.    On a query being made, the petitioner stated without any kind of\n\nhesitation that said Mr. Deepak Hastir had told him that he had been\n\nblackmailing him and, therefore, such informations were sought for by\n\nhim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">11.    We can only note that assuming said Mr. Deepak Hastir had so\n\nstated, the petitioner should have taken recourse to a course of action as\n\nadvised in law but could not have asked for such kind of informations.\n\nAs the General Secretary of Paardarshita Public Welfare Foundation, a\n\nNon-Government Organization, which is supposed to be devoted to the\n\npublic welfare, it was not expected of him to ask for such kind of\n\nunwarranted and uncalled for informations. The informations asked for\n\nare bound to create a storm in any civilized mind. It is unfortunate that\n\nthe General Secretary of the NGO is asking about the sexual disorder,\n\nDNA test between an officer and his surrogate mother, name of his\n\nbiological father and step father, name of his mother and surrogate step\n\nmother and such other aspects which are beyond the perception of\n\ndecency and in fact, an invasion into another man&#x27;s privacy.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P.(C) 6802/2010                                              Page 6 of 14</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"> 12.

On a perusal of the preamble and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act, we\n\nhave no scintilla of doubt that information relating to personal\n\ninformation which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of\n\nthe individual are not to be given unless larger public interest justify the\n\ndisclosure of such information.        The said principle has its own\n\nsacrosanctity. Right to privacy is a sacrosanct facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution as has been held by their Lordships in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_6\">Gobind v.

In\n\nthe case at hand, we really fail to fathom how the information sought by\n\nthe petitioner comes within sufficient public interest. In our considered\n\nopinion, the information sought remotely has no relationship with any\n\npublic activity or interest. In fact, the informations sought are a direct\n\ninvasion in the private life of the individual.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">14.    At this juncture, we are disposed to advert to the concept of\n\npublic interest litigation. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"299215\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/299215/\" id=\"a_8\">Charan Lal Sahu v.

Therefore, conceptually and from the\n              jurisprudential point of view, especially in the\n              background of the preamble to the Constitution of\n              India and the mandate of the directive principles, it\n              was possible to authorise the Central Government\n              to take over the claims of the victims to fight\n              against the multinational corporation in respect of\n              the claims. Because of the situation the victims\n              were under disability in pursuing their claims in\n              the circumstances of the situation fully and\n              properly. On its plain terms the State has taken\n              over the exclusive right to represent and act in\n              place of every person who has made or is entitled\n              to make a claim for all purposes connected with\n              such claim in the same manner and to the same\n              effect as such person. Whether such provision is\n              valid or not in the background of the requirement\n              of the Constitution and <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_9\">the Code of Civil\n              Procedure</a>, is another debate. But there is no\n              prohibition or inhibition, in our opinion,\n              conceptually or jurisprudentially for the Indian\n              State taking over the claims of the victims or for\n              the State acting for the victims as the Act has\n              sought to provide.

From the aforesaid pronouncement in law, it can safely be\n\ndeduced that the public interest litigation in its denotative sense\n\nbasically pertains to interest of the collective at large and such\n\ncollective who are socially so backward and sans means to have access\n\nto Court and at that stage a public spirited person rises to the occasion\n\nto canvass the cause of the marginalized section for their benefit. In\n\naddition to the same, in its connotative expanse, it encapsules and\n\nengulfs such subject matters which are of social importance and\n\ninherently relate to socio-economic, socio-cultural and embedded\n\nhumanitarian facets like environmental pollution, ecological balance,\n\npreservation of national interest, maintenance of roads, hospitals,\n\navailability of facilities of education and such other categories which\n\nclearly point to the public interest without any kind of design.

But, it can be said with certitude\n\nthat the public interest litigation was never conceived of to settle scores\n\nin a Court of law or to give vent to personal causes to pyramid an\n\neventuality in the guise of fight against the `City Halls&#x27;, to ascribe\n\nutterances in the name of loss to the exchequer.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">21.
