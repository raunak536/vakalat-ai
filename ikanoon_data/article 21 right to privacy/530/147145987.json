In general, the\n\ngrievance is against the notices issued by the authorities of the\n\nIncome Tax Department, asking the petitioners/Co-operative\n\nBanks to furnish details of cash deposit in &#x27;Savings Bank\n\nAccounts&#x27;, aggregating to Rs.5 lakhs during the financial years\n\n2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13 and also to furnish details of\n\npayment of interest exceeding Rs.10,000/- to the depositors\n\nincluding in the case of fixed deposits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">     2.

W.P.(C).No. 10334 of 2014 is treated as the\n\nlead case, wherein a detailed counter affidavit has been filed from\n\nthe part of the Department and the petitioners have filed a reply\n\naffidavit as well. It is stated that, no factual dispute is involved\n\nand the contentions raised in the lead case from both the sides\n\nare pressed into service in the other cases as well.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">     3. Mr. Mariarputham, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner in W.P.(C). No. 10334 of 2014 led the\n\narguments on behalf of the petitioners, supported by other\n\nlearned lawyers concerned.      The arguments on behalf of the\n\nDepartment/Revenue were led by Sri. P.K.R Menon, learned\n\nSenior Central Government Counsel (Taxes), supported by Mr.\n\nJose Joseph, the learned Standing Counsel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     4. History runs back to the time when steps were taken by\n\nthe respondent/Income Tax Department (Department in short)\n\nto collect particulars of deposits made and interest paid by the\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 3</span>\n\nCo-operative Banks, as part of some project/survey, issuing\n\nnotice under <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 133 (6)</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\nSeveral Co-operative Banks approached this Court earlier,\n\nchallenging the said proceedings, mainly contending that, the\n\nprovisions did not enable the Department to have issued notice to\n\nthe petitioners who were Co-operative Banks governed by the\n\nrelevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_3\">Kerala Co-operative Societies Act</a>\n\n&amp;Rules and further that, many of them were Primary Agricultural\n\nCredit Co-operative Societies       having exemption from the\n\noperation of the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_4\">Income Tax Act</a>. In\n\nsome cases, Certificates issued by the authorities under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_5\">Kerala Co-operative Societies Act</a>/Rules were produced, as to the\n\nnature of the Society, to have the benefit of exemption. In some\n\ncases, it was contended that, the term &quot;any person&quot; under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 133(6)</a> did not relate to the petitioners&#x27; Co-operative\n\nBanks. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"971033\" id=\"span_3\">It was also contended that, no such notice could have\n\nbeen issued invoking the said power, as it was never part of any\n\n&#x27;enquiry&#x27; or &#x27;proceeding&#x27; under the Act and no specific insinuation\n\nwas made against any individual or the Society.       Yet another\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 4</span>\n\ncontention was raised to the effect that, notices were issued by\n\nthe Income Tax officers or such other authorities who did not\n\nhave the power, jurisdiction or competence to have invoked the\n\nsaid power, in view of the clear stipulation under the &#x27;2nd proviso&#x27;\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 133(6)</a>, to the effect that, in       a case where no\n\nproceeding was pending, the power could have been invoked only\n\nwith &#x27;prior approval&#x27; of the Director or Commissioner as the case\n\nmay be, simultaneously contending that no such prior permission\n\nwas obtained, to have issued the notice.            After detailed\n\nexamination of the facts and figures, it was held by this Court (as\n\nper the judgment delivered by me in Chala Service Co-\n\noperative <a href=\"/doc/971033/\" id=\"a_8\">Bank Ltd. vs. Income Tax Officer</a> [2010 (1) KLT\n\nS.N. 77, Case No.92]) that, the term &quot;any person&quot; included a\n\nCo-operative Bank as well.     After meeting all the contentions,\n\ninterference was declined and the writ petitions were dismissed.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"332467\" id=\"span_5\">5.  Thereafter, the matter came to be considered by a\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in another case, wherein interference\n\nwas declined and ultimately the matter reached the Apex Court.\n\nThe Apex Court declined interference, clearly holding that, the\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                   5</span>\n\npower under <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 133(6)</a> could be invoked against Co-\n\noperative Banks as well, and that there was nothing wrong,\n\narbitrary or illegal on the part of the Department in having issued\n\nthe impugned notices. Accordingly, the cases before the Apex\n\nCourt were dismissed as per the decision reported in <a href=\"/doc/332467/\" id=\"a_10\">Kathiroor\n\nService Co-operative Bank Ltd. &amp; Others V. Commissioner\n\nof Income Tax &amp; Others</a> [(2013) 263 CTR (SC) 129]. On\n\nattaining finality, by virtue of the verdict passed by the Apex\n\nCourt, the respondent Department proceeded with further steps\n\nin this regard.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"332467\" id=\"span_7\">This made the petitioners herein to challenge the\n\nnotices, mainly raising challenge against the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the amended provisions incorporating the words\n\n&#x27;enquiry or&#x27; and the 2nd proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 133(6)</a>, pointing out\n\nthat, constitutional validity of the provision was never under\n\nchallenge before the Apex Court and hence that the Court had no\n\nneed, necessity or occasion to have considered it while passing\n\nthe judgment in <a href=\"/doc/332467/\" id=\"a_12\">Kathiroor</a> case cited supra.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">      6.   Coming back to the case in hand, admittedly, the\n\npetitioners are engaged in the field of Banking business,\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  6</span>\n\naccepting deposits and extending loan facilities to the members\n\nunder various heads, which are essentially stated as in relation to\n\nagricultural activities. There is a contention that, the petitioner\n\nBank is an Agricultural Credit Society for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_13\">Banking\n\nRegulation Act</a> 1949 and by virtue of Section &#x27;3&#x27;, it is excluded\n\nfrom the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_14\">Banking Regulation Act</a> ( which will be dealt\n\nwith in the due course). By virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 133(6)</a> of the\n\nIncome Tax Act, 1961, the Department has power to call for\n\ninformation in relation to such points or matters which would be\n\nuseful for, or relevant to any proceeding under the Act, from &#x27;any\n\nperson&#x27; including a &#x27;Banking Company&#x27; or &#x27;any Officer&#x27; thereon.\n\nLater, an amendment was introduced as per the <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_16\">Finance Act,\n\n1995</a> whereby, the words &quot;enquiry or&quot; were inserted before the\n\nword &quot;proceeding&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 133(6)</a>, also adding the &#x27;2nd proviso&#x27;\n\nto the said provision, with effect from 1.7.1995. The effect of the\n\nsaid amendment is that, the power to call for information under\n\nthe unamended Act, which was confined only in relation to a\n\n&#x27;pending proceeding&#x27; came to be widened, and even in a case\n\nwhere no proceeding was pending, such information could be\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                  7</span>\n\ncalled for as part of the enquiry, subject to the rider that, such\n\npower was not to be exercised by any income tax authority below\n\nthe rank of Director or Commissioner without the prior approval\n\nof the Director or the Commissioner, as the case may be. The\n\nsaid amendment was brought about as a measure to tackle tax\n\nevasion effectively, as clarified by the Central Board of Direct\n\nTaxes (CBDT) vide Circular No. 717 dated 14.8.1995.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">       7. The main contention is that, it intrudes into &#x27;privacy&#x27; of\n\nthe members of the petitioner Banks and that the right of privacy\n\nis an integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, which\n\nin turn is violated. The rights and interest of the petitioners to\n\nconduct free trade/business as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>\n\nare also stated as infringed.      Unbridled    power/discretion is\n\nvested with the authorities of the Income Tax Department and\n\nthat the contents of the notice clearly reveal that, it has no nexus\n\nat all, with the object to be achieved under the Act, as no tax\n\nliability could be mulcted upon a person having a deposit of Rs.5\n\nlakhs or in respect of a person to whom interest has been paid to\n\nan extent of Rs.10,000/-. This in turn, is cited as a clear instance\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 8</span>\n\nof arbitrariness and patent violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_11\">8. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submits that,\n\nthe State cannot have any unrestricted access to seek\n\ninformation about the financial records maintained by the\n\npetitioner Banks without any reliable basis to seek such\n\ninformation. Though the right of privacy has not been explicitly\n\nincorporated in the Constitution or by way of any specific\n\nlegislation, it has now been incorporated as part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>,\n\nthrough various judicial precedents, including <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_22\">Govind v. State\n\nof Madhya Pradesh &amp; Another</a>([1975) 2 SCC 148], MR.X vs.\n\nHospital &#x27;Z&#x27;.</span><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15059075\" id=\"span_12\">(1998) 8 SCC 296) and People Union for <a href=\"/doc/15059075/\" id=\"a_23\">Civil\n\nLiberty v. Union of India &amp; another</a> (2003) 4 SCC 399).\n\nThus, it is contended that, right to privacy is an integral part of\n\nfundamental rights guaranteed under part III of the Constitution\n\nof India and as such, the attempt made by the concerned\n\nrespondent is liable to be intercepted by this Court.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      9.  Reliance is also sought to be placed on the decision\n\nrendered by the Apex Court in Ramjethmalani v. Union of\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                  9</span>\n\nIndia (2011) 8 SCC 1 pointing out that the fundamental right to\n\nprivacy cannot be subverted in the attempt to tackle the menace\n\nof curbing the problem of black money, which is cited as the\n\nmotive for the drive. Reference is also made to the observation\n\nof the Apex Court in Ramjethmalani&#x27;s case to the effect that,\n\nsolution for the problem of abrogation of one zone of\n\nconstitutional values, cannot be the creation of another zone of\n\nabrogation of other constitutional values.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">      10.    Referring to the observation of the Apex Court in\n\nSudheerchandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron and Steel Company\n\nLtd (1984) 3 SCC 369) holding that,             absolute discretion,\n\nuncontrolled by guidelines may permit denial of equality before\n\nlaw, which is anti-thesis of rule of law, the learned counsel points\n\nout that, there is absolutely no mechanism, as provided under\n\nthe statute, to examine whether the wide discretion granted is\n\nexercised correctly or not. In the absence of any guidelines or\n\ncriteria for the exercise of powers, the impugned provisions suffer\n\nfrom the wise of arbitrariness, is the crux of the contention.\n\nVarious other decisions are also cited across the Bar, including\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_14\">10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 10</span>\n\nthe one rendered by the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_24\">Maneka Gandhi v.

The contention of the petitioners that there is\n\nabsolutely no insinuation against the petitioners to have\n\nproceeded against, is not at all relevant, nor is there any\n\nsignificance in this regard. For the time being, it is true that\n\nthere is no insinuation against the petitioners to the effect that\n\nthey are accepting clandestine deposits involving black money or\n\nthat they are effecting     payment of interest enabling the\n\npetitioners to enjoy the same without meeting the tax burden.\n\nThe attempt of the Department is to see whether any undue\n\nbenefit is being   enjoyed   by any of the depositors     without\n\nmeeting the tax obligation and it is in the said context, that\n\nnecessary data has been decided to be collected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">      22.

If such\n\na depositor is having similar deposits and is drawing         interest\n\nfrom other Banks/Co-operative Banks, still not satisfying tax on\n\nthe total receipt of income/interest, is a person to be proceeded\n\nagainst, in terms of the relevant provisions of law. Unless the\n\nrequisite data is collected from different Banks/institutions, it\n\nmay not be possible for the respondent /Department to create\n\nsufficient data- base to be cross checked, whenever they get\n\nsufficient material/information as to the instance of tax evasion.\n\nViewed in the above perspective, there cannot be any genuine\n\nheart burn for the petitioners in furnishing the data as required\n\nby the respondents and it cannot cause any prejudice in this\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                23</span>\n\nregard. Their apprehension that there is a chance for withdrawal\n\nof deposits by depositors , draining out the financial base of the\n\nSociety/Bank, is also devoid of any merit, for the reason that\n\ndata is being collected by the respondent Banks as part of\n\nimplementation of the project from all the available sources and\n\nno Co-operative Bank is exempted or spared in this attempt.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">      23. Yet another contention raised by the petitioners is that,\n\nfor meeting the requirement, the petitioners may have to deploy\n\nseveral employees to furnish the information, virtually for no\n\nreturn, and thus incurring   huge expenses.     This Court is not\n\nmuch impressed with the above contention, for the reason that\n\nthe petitioners being establishments doing banking business,\n\nare supposed to maintain all the relevant records and there is a\n\n&#x27;public duty&#x27; cast upon them as well, to see that they are not\n\nmade instrumental by any unscrupulous individual, who wants to\n\npursue tax evasion, undermining the economic backbone of the\n\ncountry.

With regard to the contention of the petitioners that\n\nthere is no nexus for the information to be furnished as per the\n\nimpugned notices, with the purpose sought to be achieved, the\n\nobservation made by a Division Bench of this Court in          <a href=\"/doc/1250771/\" id=\"a_51\">M.V.\n\nRajendran vs. ITO</a>[(2003) 180 CTR (Kerala) 369= 260 ITR\n\n442] is very relevant and hence extracted below:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                 &quot;The Society by itself cannot have any\n\n           grievance against the notice because       the\n\n           notice does not contemplate any action\n\n           against the society..

Therefore, a\n\n           survey or investigation conducted to trace\n\n           black money is absolutely within the powers of\n\n           the income-tax authorities and co-operative\n\n           societies or banks cannot claim any immunity\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                    25</span>\n\n            for hoarding black money. Even though not\n\n            specifically conceded by the petitioners , their\n\n            case is that unless societies enjoy immunity\n\n            from    <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_52\">section    133(6)</a>   proceedings     and\n\n            information on deposits and depositors        is\n\n            kept   out    of  reach   of  the   Income-tax\n\n            Department, they will not get deposits, or the\n\n            existing depositors will withdraw the deposits\n\n            leading to liquidity problem for them.

The question to be\n\nconsidered is, whether such exercise being pursued by the\n\nDepartment is having the support of law or not, which cannot but\n\nbe answered in the positive.       It is for the Department to work\n\nout the strategy, device the tools and measures and to achieve\n\nthe goal in a phased manner, which cannot be deprecated by\n\nthis Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_39\">27.

This,\n\nof course, acts as a check measure, to provide transparency in\n\nthe proceedings.    It involves various steps for getting &#x27;prior\n\napproval&#x27; of the Director/Commissioner.     The file has to move\n\nthrough different levels, till it reaches the approving authority,\n\nwho has to be told of the situation under which circumstance, the\n\nenquiry is necessitated .

This\n\nensures    proper invocation of the power to see that nobody\n\ninvokes the power based on his own whims and fancies and this\n\nacts as an inbuilt mechanism/guideline.

In so far\n\nas &#x27;Explanation (2)&#x27; to <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 132</a> of the Income Tax Act, dealing\n\nwith search and seizure, categorically states that the word\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                 36</span>\n\n&#x27;proceeding&#x27; includes a future proceeding as well; the inclusion\n\nof the word &#x27;enquiry or&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 133(6)</a> of the Act, by\n\nthe law makers     as per the <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_73\">Finance Act, 1995</a>, is having more\n\nsignificance and it is incidental to the scope and object to be\n\nachieved , which cannot be nullified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">      33. The petitioners have no dispute with regard to the\n\nlegislative competence of the Parliament.The dispute is only with\n\nregard to the alleged intrusion into the right to privacy.\n\nPetitioners have attempted to equate the right to privacy with\n\nright to life guaranteed under the Constitution of India and have\n\nsought to picturize    the same as part of fundamental right,\n\ncontending that there is violation of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 19\n\n(1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India stipulates that all citizens\n\nshall have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any\n\noccupation, trade or business. In what way the impugned notice\n\nissued by the respondent Dept. violates the fundamental right of\n\nthe petitioners to conduct business/trade is not discernible; more\n\nso when the provision of      law is applicable  not only to the\n\npetitioners   herein, but also to all other banking/non-banking\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                  37</span>\n\nfinancial institutions having a bearing on the tax liability of the\n\ndepositors. That apart, in the words of the Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt as per     the decision in    Govind vs. State of Madhya\n\nPradesh and another (AIR 1975 SC 1378= (1975) 2 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">148), even assuming that the right to privacy is itself a\n\nfundamental right, such fundamental right must be subject to\n\nrestriction, on the basis of compelling &#x27;public interest&#x27;. There is no\n\nprohibition on the State in gathering information for preventing\n\ntax evasion and curb black money. The petitioners cannot field\n\nthe wrongdoers,if any, and unless necessary information is\n\nfurnished, the data collection will become impossible and no\n\nproceedings can be pursued against wrongdoers to guard\n\neconomy of the country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">      34. A Constitution Bench of the Apex Court has held in\n\nVivian Joseph Ferreira and another vs. Municipal\n\nCorporation of Greater Bombay and others [(1972) 1 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033021\" id=\"span_53\">70) that, taxing statute will become valid, if it is within the\n\nlegislative competence, if it is for public purpose and further, if it\n\ndoes not violate the fundamental right guaranteed under Part III\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                38</span>\n\nof the Constitution of India. All the said three requirements are\n\nsatisfied in the instant case and as such, the challenge raised by\n\nthe petitioners cannot be held good; more so when the Apex\n\nCourt has made it clear in     <a href=\"/doc/1033021/\" id=\"a_76\">R.K. Garg vs. Union of India</a>.\n\n[(1981) 4 SCC 675],         that the laws relating   to economic\n\nactivities should be viewed with greater latitude, than the laws\n\ntouching civil rights, such as freedom of speech or religion etc.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1693454\" id=\"span_55\">Further, in view of the law declared by the Apex Court in\n\nPunjab Distilling industries <a href=\"/doc/1693454/\" id=\"a_77\">Ltd. vs. Commissioner of\n\nIncome Tax, Punjab</a> [AIR 1965 SC 1862], constitutional\n\nvalidity of an Act can be supported on the ground that it was\n\nenacted to prevent evasion of tax.      The amendment brought\n\nabout as per the <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_78\">Finance Act</a> 1995, adding the words &#x27;enquiry\n\nor&#x27; and also the &#x27;second proviso&#x27; is quite incidental to the &#x27;main\n\nprovision&#x27; and hence beyond challenge.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">      35. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"856631\" id=\"span_56\">In testing the validity of a statute, particularly fiscal\n\nstatute, the Court has to maintain more self- restraint, as held in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/856631/\" id=\"a_79\">Government of Andhra Pradesh vs. Laxmi Devi</a> [(2008) 4\n\nSCC 720]. The apprehension expressed from the part of the\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos. 10334 OF 2014 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                  39</span>\n\npetitioners that, if the information as sought for is given to the\n\nrespondent Department, there is a chance for misuse/abuse, is\n\nwithout any basis.       The confidentiality   of the information\n\ngathered by the Income Tax Department is well taken care of\n\nby <a href=\"/doc/1448409/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 138</a> of the Income Tax Act, as discussed already.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">      36.     The further contention of the petitioners       that\n\nconferring of absolute powers on the officers of the Government\n\nis rather arbitrary, is not correct as such. With reference to the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/29709391/\" id=\"a_81\">KGST Act</a>, particularly Section 29A, a Division\n\nBench of this Court in P.K. Aboobacker &amp; other vs. State of\n\nKerala [1979(44) STC 250 Kerala ] has held that           a mere\n\npossibility of abuse by the official on whom power is conferred is\n\nnot a ground to strike down the statutory provision.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"913336\" id=\"span_58\">37.   It is well settled that the &#x27;taxation entry&#x27; confers\n\npowers upon the legislature to legislate for matters &#x27;ancillary or\n\nincidental&#x27;, including the provisions for evasion of tax. This has\n\nbeen made clear by a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/913336/\" id=\"a_82\">Commissioner of Commercial Tax vs. R.S. Jhavar</a> [(67) 20\n\nSTC 453].
