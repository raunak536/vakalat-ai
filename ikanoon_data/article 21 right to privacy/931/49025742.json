They contended that they did not access the screen story of\n\n&#x27;SLUM SOCCER&#x27; registered by the plaintiff with the Telangana Film\n\nWriters Association and there is no question of copyright\n\ninfringement by the defendants of the plaintiff&#x27;s story.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\">21.

They alleged that\n\nthe petitioner/plaintiff despite all the said information being in public\n\ndomain, waited till 13-05-2020 to file this instant suit, just prior to the\n\nrelease of the film and that too at a belated stage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">22.

They pleaded that the factors of irreparable\n\ninjury and balance of convenience tilt heavily in favour of the\n\ndefendants, who would be severely prejudiced if any of the reliefs\n\nsought in the suit are granted.

They claim that the film\n\nintroduces fictionalized events also and contended that incidents in\n\nrelation to the 1st defendant can also be used by them since no person\n\ncan claim monopoly over any facts or events that are available or\n\nknown in public domain.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_7\">                                      ::12::                      MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                           cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">26.

They also asserted that the film is partly inspired by the real life\n\nstory of the 2nd defendant and no case is made out for copyright\n\ninfringement by the plaintiff.         They contended that they are not\n\nrequired to provide the DVD version of the film as it is a work of\n\nfiction and reiterated that the principal protagonist in the film is based\n\non the 2nd defendant.        According to them, facts are not subject matter\n\nof copyright protection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">30.

It held that strict burden of proof cannot be based on the\n\nplaintiff to prove that there is infringement of copyright; and standard\n\nof proof appears to be &#x27;prima facie proof&#x27; by relying on the decision\n\nof the Bombay High court in <a href=\"/doc/150832588/\" id=\"a_3\">Jyoti Kapoor &amp; Another v.

It held that allegation made by the plaintiff against the\n\ndefendants are true and there is every likelihood of prima facie\n\ninfringement and breach of copyright.          It rejected the plea of the\n\ndefendants that burden of proof on the plaintiff is heavier in QUIA\n\nTIMET actions by observing that there appears to be collusion among\n\nthe defendants with the 1st defendant; and there are similarities in\n\ndepiction which are apparent even from the teaser of the film\n\n&quot;JHUND&quot; itself and the defendants were refusing to assist the Court\n\nby giving further details of their movie.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">49.

It concluded that the teaser of the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; from its contents\n\nprima facie shows that there are distinct similarities in the plot,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">1</span>\n    2015 SCC online Bom.3373\n                                    ::19::                    MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                       cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\ndepiction and the life and story of the protagonist of the film as with\n\nthe registered script of &#x27;SLUM SOCCER&#x27; of the plaintiff. Though\n\nsuch specific similarities are mentioned by the plaintiff, there is no\n\nspecific denial regarding them by the contesting defendants and the\n\nmobile conversations Exs.P17 to P19 support the plaintiff&#x27;s case and\n\nthey tilt the case in favour of the plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">51.    It then concluded that if no interim order is granted in favour of\n\nthe plaintiff, the defendants would go ahead and release their film and\n\nin such event, the plaintiff would suffer more than the defendants, for\n\nwhich he cannot be compensated in terms of money.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">52.    It therefore directed maintenance of status quo against the\n\ndefendants in I.A.No.829 of 2020.

Before we deal with the merits of these CMAs, we wish to\n\nstate that whatever findings and observations we make in this\n\norder are only intended for the disposal of these appeals and are\n\nnot intended to be final expression of opinion on the respective\n\ncontentions of the parties and the trial court should decide the suit\n\nuninfluenced by them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">\nConsideration by the Court\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">57.     The suit is essentially based on alleged breach of copyright\n\nsaid to be vested with the plaintiff in the real life story/events\n\nconnected with the 1st defendant. It is the plaintiff&#x27;s case that they\n\nwere assigned to him exclusively by the 1st defendant under Ex.P1\n\ndt.19.11.2017 and Ex.P3 agreement dt. 19.3.2018 entered into by the\n\nplaintiff with the defendant no.1. The existence of these agreements is\n\nnot disputed by the defendants. Based on them, the plaintiff claims to\n\nhave got a script registered with the Telangana Cinema Writers\n\nAssociation with the title &#x27;Slum Soccer&#x27; under Ex.P7 dt.11.7.2018.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_11\">                                    ::21::                       MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                          cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_96\">58.   The counsel for the appellants/defendants 3,5,6 and 7 contended\n\nthat the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; was based on the life of the 2nd defendant, the\n\ncoach of the 1st defendant, and there is no character in the said film\n\nrelatable to the 1st defendant; and the plaintiff&#x27;s claims in the plaint\n\nand the I.A.s are based on the false and baseless assumption that the\n\nfilm is based on the life of 1st defendant. According to them, the\n\ncharacter / image / identity of 1st defendant is not at all a part of the\n\nfilm, which is a work of fiction and they did not depict the character\n\nof 1st defendant in any manner whatsoever (para no.24 of the counter).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">59.   But, in the counter-affidavit, in para no.8.1.2., the defendants 3,\n\n5 to 7 say that the film is partly inspired by the real life story of the 2nd\n\ndefendant, weaving into it several fictionalized characters and\n\nsequences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_99\">60.    So the plea in the arguments about the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; being\n\nbased only the life story of the defendant no.2 is not supported by the\n\npleading in the counter affidavit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_101\">61.   Further the plea of the appellants/ defendants 3,5,6 and 7 is also\n\nbelied by the transcripts of the mobile phone conversations between\n\nthe plaintiff and the 3rd defendant (who was the director of the said\n\nfilm)- which have been filed as Ex.P17. In the conversations, the 3rd\n\ndefendant admitted in July 2018 that there is a big role in the film for\n\nthe character of the 1st defendant. He also stated that if the plaintiff\n                                   ::22::                      MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                        cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\nwere to give legal notice to him ( defendant 3), he would respond that\n\nthat the character of 1st defendant is not there.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_102\">62.   Again in August,2018, the plaintiff had a conversation on\n\nmobile phone with Sri Shiv Chanana, the Senior Vice President of T\n\nSeries ( 7th respondent) ( part of Ex.P18 transcipts) where the latter\n\nadmitted that the 3rd defendant had taken the rights of the 1st defendant\n\nto make the film and there was also an agreement entered into by\n\ndefendant No.3 with defendant no.1 , and stated that if required, he\n\nwill change the character of the 1st defendant in the film and bring in\n\nanother character. By implication he too thus admitted that there was a\n\ncharacter in the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; based on 1st defendant.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">63.   In September, 2019, the plaintiff&#x27;s potential producer one Vijay\n\nRam had a conversation on a mobile phone with Ms.Savita Raj, also\n\nan employee of 5th respondent (part of Ex.P18 transcripts) where the\n\nlatter admitted that 1st defendant had transferred his life story details\n\nto them and that they have his rights too, and that the character of\n\nAkhilesh Paul (1st defendant) is there in the film.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">64.   In para nos.16 and 17 of the plaint / I.A. there is specific\n\nreference to these conversations between the plaintiff and defendants\n\n3, 7 and 8, but in the counter-affidavit filed by respondent nos.3, 5, 6\n\nand 7, there is an evasive denial at para no.21 and 22 to the effect that\n\nthere is want of knowledge and the petitioner is put to strict\n\ndocumentary proof. It is also stated that the contents of para nos.16\n                                    ::23::                    MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                       cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\nand 17 are completely divorced from the facts of the matter. The\n\nabsence of specific denial about these conversations by defendants\n\nnos.3, 5, 6 and 7 is an important circumstance against them.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_105\">65.       In fact we may say that when the counsel for the appellants/\n\ndefendants nos.3, 5, 6 and 7 first addressed arguments before us, they\n\ndid not mention any of these conversations and deal with them. Only\n\nafter the counsel for the plaintiff drew our attention to these\n\nconversations, during reply arguments they sought to explain them.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">66.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190304090\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/190304090/\" id=\"a_4\">Jaspal Kaur Cheema vs. Industrial Trade Links2</a>, the\n\nSupreme Court held that a defendant is required in terms of Order\n\nVIII Rule 3 to deny or dispute the statements made in the plaint\n\ncategorically, as evasive denial would amount to an admission of the\n\nallegation made in the plaint in terms of Order VIII Rule 5 of the\n\nCode.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69790\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"633831\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1994047\" id=\"span_6\">It referred to the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/1994047/\" id=\"a_5\">Badat and Co. vs. East India\n\nTrading Company3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/633831/\" id=\"a_6\">Sushil Kumar vs. Rakesh Kumar4</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/69790/\" id=\"a_7\">M.

We may also point out that though the 1st defendant gave\n\nEx.P10 legal notice on 22.11.2017 to 3rd defendant asking the latter to\n\nclarify whether his character would be part of the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; and\n\ngave a copy of it to the plaintiff, later when the plaintiff got issued\n\nEx.P-20 legal notice to the 1st defendant, he started defending and\n\nsupporting defendant Nos.2 to 12 stating that the film &quot;Jhund&quot; started\n\nin 2018 and the plaintiff was making vexatious claims. The conduct of\n\nthe 1st defendant in initially assuring plaintiff that he did not assign his\n\ntrue life story events nor did he permit the 3rd defendant to exploit the\n\nsame, but subsequently revealing his transactions with the 3rd\n\ndefendant also is a factor in accepting the plaintiff&#x27;s case prima-facie.\n\nIt suggests collusion between the defendant no.1 and the defendants 3,\n\n5, 6 and 7.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">69.    In our opinion, there is prima-facie material on record in the\n\nform of Exs.P.17 and P.19 to show that the character of 1st defendant\n\nexists in the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; being made by the defendants 3, 5 and 7,\n\nand that the 1st defendant, after he entered into the agreement\n\nEx.P1 dt.19.11.2017 and Ex.P3 dt.19.3.2018 with the plaintiff\n                                   ::25::                      MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                        cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\nexclusively selling his life story events to him, also sold his life story\n\nrights to the defendant no.3 for use by defendants 5 and 7.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">70.   Therefore, prima facie, the case set up by the plaintiff in the\n\nplaint/IAs appears to be true and the case set up by defendants 3, 5 to\n\n7 in the counter-affidavit appears to be not true.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">71.

Also the advent of COVID-19 and the disruption\n\nof proceedings caused by it in the courts below since 24.3.2020 on\n\naccount of lock down declared by the State and Central Governments\n\nis also a valid reason to explain the reason for filing the suit on\n\n13.5.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">104. The inaction of defendants 3, 5, 6 and 7 from October 2019 till\n\nMay, 2020 appears to be deliberate and it gives an impression that\n\nthey intended to lull the plaintiff into a false sense of security,\n\ncomplete the film in the meantime, and then plead equities thereafter.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">105. More particularly it is to be noted that the movie &#x27;Jhund&#x27; had\n\nnot been released on any platform till the order was passed on\n\n17-09-2020 in I.A.Nos.829 and 830 of 2020 by the court below and\n\nthere was also no prior ex parte temporary injunction granted by the\n\nCourt from 13-05-2020 till 17-09-2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">106. Therefore prima facie they are not entitled to contend that there\n\nwere any laches on the part of the plaintiff in approaching the Court\n\nfor appropriate relief.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_17\">                                  ::40::                     MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                      cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">107. The fact that the 1st defendant had shared in confidence his life\n\nstory events with the plaintiff under Ex.P3 dt.19.3.2018 and also prior\n\nthereto under Ex.P1 dt.19.11.2017 is on record.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">108. In Jyoti Kapoor and Another ( 1supra), the Bombay High\n\nCourt held that at an Interlocutory Stage, the Court has to see if there\n\nis an arguable case as to use of confidential information by the\n\ndefendant, whether there are circumstances to show that it was\n\nunlikely that the defendant could have, around the time he did, on his\n\nown come to the same combination of key elements or similarities. It\n\nobserved that these aspects can be brought out more fully at the trial\n\nbut at the Interlocutory stage, Courts have made a distinction between\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">(a) the existence of the right (imparting of confidential information to\n\nthe defendant), and (b) its infringement by the defendant. It held that\n\nwhile there must be a strong prima facie case as to the existence of\n\na right but, for infringement, it is necessary to show simply a\n\nprima facie case and reasonable likelihood of success at the trial.\n\nIt also observed that the use of the material by the defendant need not\n\nbe dishonest or even deliberate and it would be sufficient to show that\n\nthere could be even an unintentional use of the material by the\n\ndefendant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_177\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">       It observed that in the case of violation of copyright in an\n\nunpublished work of the plaintiff, which is sought to be made into a\n\ncinematograph film, if the defendants were permitted to exhibit and\n\ndistribute their film, whatever novelty is there in the plaintiff&#x27;s\n                                  ::41::                       MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                        cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\nscreenplay and script, it would be lost altogether; and it is difficult in\n\nsuch a case to work out the damages suffered by the plaintiffs. It held\n\nthat such damages would be irretrievable and not capable of being\n\ncompensated in money and the only remedy for the plaintiff is to\n\nsecure an interim injunction restraining the defendants from releasing\n\nthe offending film.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">109. Prima facie, we agree with the view of the court below that the\n\nteaser of the film &#x27;Jhund&#x27; from its contents shows that there are\n\ndistinct similarities in the plot, depiction and the life and story of the\n\nprotagonist of the film as with the registered script of &#x27;SLUM\n\nSOCCER&#x27; of the plaintiff; though such specific similarities are\n\nmentioned by the plaintiff, there is no specific denial regarding them\n\nby the contesting defendants and the mobile conversations Exs.P17 to\n\nP19 support the plaintiff&#x27;s case and they tilt the case in favour of the\n\nplaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">110. We are of the opinion, the plaintiff, in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the instant case, has shown a strong prima facie case\n\nas to the existence of a right and also a prima facie case as regards\n\ninfringement, and that he has reasonable likelihood of success at the\n\ntrial. We also hold that if the defendants are permitted to exhibit and\n\ndistribute their film, whatever novelty there is in the plaintiff&#x27;s\n\nscreenplay and script would be lost, and it would be difficult to\n\ncompensate him by way of damages.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_18\">                                  ::42::                       MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                        cma_355_2020 &amp;batch\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\">111. We accordingly find no error in the common order passed by\n\nthe court below in IA.No.s 1829 and 1830 of 2020 in O.S.NO.62 of\n\n2020 of the XV Additional District Judge, Ranga Reddy District\n\nwarranting our interference in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">112.
