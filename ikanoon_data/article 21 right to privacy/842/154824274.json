Adv. Anand Shankar Jha (Counsel for the Appellant Bank) attended the\nhearing in person. The respondent, Shri Abhay Kumar, CPIO/General Manager\nattended the hearing through video-conferencing. The original RTI applicant\nwas not present despite notice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.

The Counsel for the appellant has referred the reply provided by CPIO\nand order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO, RBI and FAA had\nviolated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to the Appellant Bank before passing their decisions in the matter. No\nreasons were given for not offering personal hearing in the first appeal. The\ncounsel for the appellant prayed before the Commission that the FAA order\ndated 16.05.2020 should be set-aside for want of reasons and/or should wait for\nthe outcome of the decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in W.P. No. 1159/2019.\nThe FAA in its order has mentioned that the interim order passed in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_1\">Reserve\nBank of India vs. Jayantilal Mistry &amp; Ors.</a> would apply only to those banks\nwhich are parties to the petition, namely, HDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank\nLimited, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank Limited and State Bank of India. As the\nappellant was not a party <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_2\">in that case</a>, it would not be possible for the appellant\nto take benefit of that order. He further submitted that the information sought by\nthe RTI applicant was completely exempted as the information sought includes\ncommercial information received in fiduciary capacity, disclosure of\ninformation sought is specifically prohibited under various legislations and is\nspecifically exempted under Section 8 (1) (b), Section 8 (l) (d) and Section 8(1)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">(h) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">RTI Act</a>.

The representative of the Reserve Bank of India while presenting their\ncase inter alia submitted that the applicant, Shri Kabir Agarwal, vide RTI\napplication dated 25.11.2019 inter alia, sought, details of top 100 accounts of\nloan defaulters with highest amounts of outstanding debt as on 31.10.2019 etc.\nThey further submitted that the then CPIO issued the notice under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 11(1)</a>\nread with <a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">(RTI Act</a>) to the\nthird party i.e. appellant bank informing that RBI was required to disclose the\ninformation sought by Shri Kabir Agarwal, enabling appellant to make written\nsubmission within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice as to whether\nthe information sought by the applicant might be disclosed or not along with\nreasons for the same. After considering the response from Appellant Bank, the\nCPIO decided to disclose the list of top 100 accounts of loan defaulters with\nhighest amounts of outstanding debt as on 31.10.2019 etc. to the applicant. He\nfurther submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RBI vs. Jayantilal N.\nMistry &amp; Ors (2016) 3 SCC 525 observed that :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       &quot;RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI\n       ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might\n       embarrass individual banks. It is duty bound to comply with the\n       provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act</a> and disclose the information sought by the\n       applicant.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">The FAA also observed that the list of borrowers as reported under CRILC by\nbanks forms part of the record maintained by the Reserve Bank and the same is\nin the possession of the Reserve Bank. Hence the same may be disclosed by\nRBI. The FAA concluded that there was no merit in the appeal of the appellant\nand accordingly dismissed the bank&#x27;s appeal.The respondent further contended\nthat in order to withhold any information sought by the applicant under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI\nAct</a>, such information should fall within any of the exempted items under\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_11\">9</a> of the RTI Act. The respondent also contended that the list of\nsuch defaulters is reported every quarter along with their names and amount\noutstanding. It is an automatic compilation and such information is readily\navailable with the Reserve Bank of India.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                     Page 3 of 15</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\"> Decision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">7.     The Commission, after hearing the submissions of both the parties and\nafter perusal of records, observes that the original RTI applicant has sought\ninformation regarding names and details of top 100 accounts of loan defaulters\nwith highest amounts of outstanding debt as on 31.10.2019. Further, he has\nasked for top 100 non-performing asset accounts with highest amounts of\noutstanding debt as on 31.10.2019 with details of total amounts that are owed\nby non-performing asset accounts in the country.The CPIO, Reserve Bank of\nIndia had issued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_13\">11(3)</a> to the appellant bank\nintending to disclose the information. Aggrieved by the decision of the CPIO,\nthe appellant bank had filed first appeal with the First Appellate Authority. The\nFAA had also dismissed the first appeal of the appellant bank summarily. The\nCommission observes that the RTI applicant had insisted for disclosure of\ninformation as per Jayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case. The Appellant Bank contested\nthat the information sought as a whole is exempted from disclosure under\n<a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8 (1) (b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1) (d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_16\">8(1) (h)</a> of the RTI Act and that the\nCPIO/FAA has not passed any reasoned order settling their objections nor gave\nany opportunity of hearing to them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">8.     The Commission takes note of the submissions made by the Bank that the\ninformation, proposed to be disclosed is in the nature of credit information and\nthe same was supplied to the Reserve Bank of India in fiduciary capacity as the\nRegulator under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_17\">Banking Regulation Act</a> as well as the\n<a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_18\">Credit Information Companies Regulation Act, 2005</a> (CICRA). Under the\nprovisions of CICRA there is a specific bar on the disclosure of such credit\ninformation. Further <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 174 (a)</a> of the Act, clearly mentions that &quot;no credit\ninformation shall be disclosed to any person other than its specified users.&quot;The\nlarge amount of data relating to its clients including their identity, personal\ndetails etc. is shared with the regulator, without any redaction or withholding\nthe information, in good faith that these will be objectively analysed in\ndischarge of their statutory obligations to make fair judgment on their\nfunctioning without affecting their competitive position.To this extent, there is\nan element of trust and confidence in sharing the data, both financial and\noperational, between the RBI and the bank. The information and data of the\nclients in the hands of Bank also has the element of trust and confidence that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                       Page 4 of 15</span>\n such data will not be disclosed or shared against their right to\nprivacy/commercial interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">9.    The Commission further noted the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\nReserve Bank of India V/s Jayantilal N. Mistry case made observations\nwhich read as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259252\" id=\"span_6\">&quot;79. In another case, where the respondent P.P. Kapoor sought\n      information inter alia about the details of default in loans taken from\n      public sector banks by industrialists, out of the list of defaulters, top 100\n      defaulters, names of the businessmen, firm name, principal amount,\n      interest amount, date of default and date of availing the loan etc. The said\n      information was denied by the CPIO mainly on the basis that it was held\n      in fiduciary capacity and was exempt from disclosure of such\n      information. Allowing the appeal, the CIC directed for the disclosure of\n      such information. The CIC in the impugned order has rightly observed as\n      under:-I wish government and its instrumentalities would remember that\n      all information held by them is owned by citizens, who are sovereign.\n      Further, it is often seen that banks and financial institutions continue to\n      provide loans to industrialists despite their default in repayment of an\n      earlier loan.&quot; This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259252/\" id=\"a_20\">UP Financial Corporation vs. Gem Cap\n      India Pvt.Ltd.</a>, AIR 1993 SC 1435 has noted that:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">             &quot;Promoting industrialization at the cost of public funds does not\n             serve the public interest, it merely amounts to transferring public\n             money to private account&#x27;. Such practices have led citizens to\n             believe that defaulters can get away and play fraud on public\n             funds. There is no doubt that information regarding top\n             industrialists who have defaulted in repayment of loans must be\n             brought to citizens&#x27; knowledge; there is certainly a larger public\n             interest that could be served on ....disclosure of the same. In fact,\n             information about industrialists who are loan defaulters of the\n             country may put pressure on such persons to pay their dues. This\n             would have the impact of alerting Citizens about those who are\n             defaulting in payments and could also have some impact in\n             shaming them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">It clarifies that the functional relationship between a regulator and a regulated\nentity is not fiduciary. On the other hand the relationship is based on a statutory\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                        Page 5 of 15</span>\n obligation to ensure operational discipline and support remedial framework.\nHence its observations, guidance, directions or remedial actions are an outcome\nof own functioning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_8\">10. Keeping in view the broader nature of business carried out between a\ncustomer and the bank, the Commission takes note of the observations passed\nby the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_21\">Central Board Of Sec. Education &amp;Anr. vs Aditya\nBandopadhyay&amp;Ors</a> [2011 (8) SCC 497] vide order dated 09.08.2011\nexamined and explained the expression &#x27;fiduciary relationship&#x27;, and have\nillustrated a few relationships where parties were involved in an act of fiduciary\ncapacity including &#x27;customers&#x27; in the following words:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        &quot;20. The term `fiduciary&#x27; and `fiduciary relationship&#x27; refer to different\n        capacities and relationship, involving a common duty or obligation. 20.1)\n        Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (7th Edition, Page 640) defines `fiduciary\n        relationship&#x27; thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      A relationship in which one person is under a duty to act for the benefit of\n      the other on matters within the scope of the relationship. Fiduciary\n      relationships - such as trustee-beneficiary, guardian-ward, agent-\n      principal, and attorney-client - require the highest duty of care. Fiduciary\n      relationships usually arise in one of four situations : (1) when one person\n      places trust in the faithful integrity of another, who as a result gains\n      superiority or influence over the first, (2) when one person assumes\n      control and responsibility over another, (3) when one person has a duty\n      to act for or give advice to another on matters falling within the scope of\n      the relationship, or (4) when there is a specific relationship that has\n      traditionally been recognized as involving fiduciary duties, as with a\n      lawyer and a client or a stockbroker and a customer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      &quot;39. The term &quot;fiduciary&quot; refers to a person having a duty to act for the\n      benefit of another, showing good faith and candour, where such other\n      person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or\n      discharging the duty. The term &quot;fiduciary relationship&quot; is used to\n      describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places\n      complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                       Page 6 of 15</span>\n       business or transaction(s). The term also refers to a person who holds a\n      thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in\n      confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use\n      good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things\n      belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to\n      the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard\n      to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in\n      confidence and is expected not to disclose the thing or information to any\n      third party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_10\">While taking into consideration the fact that the customers give their financial\ninformation to the banks in confidence and with complete faith that may not be\ndivulged as a result of disclosure by others, the following observations passed\nby the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_22\">Bihar Public Service Commission v. SaiyedHussain\nAbbas Rizwi and Anr.</a>[ (2012) 13 SCC 61] may be relied upon:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      &quot;The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities objectively and\n      the &quot;consequences of such disclosure have to be weighed with regard to\n      the circumstances of a given case. The decision has to be based on\n      objective satisfaction recorded for ensuring that larger public interest\n      outweighs unwarranted invasion of privacy or other factors stated in the\n      provision. Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\n      required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may come\n      to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give\n      that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and\n      fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it\n      within the ambit of fiduciary capacity. Similarly, there may be cases\n      where the disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest\n      or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual.\n      All these protections have to be given their due implementation as they\n      spring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between\n      private interest and public interest. It is a matter where a constitutional\n      protection is available to a person with regard to the right to privacy.\n      Thus, the public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the\n      balance factor between right to privacy and right to information with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                         Page 7 of 15</span>\n       purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served in\n      the larger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge\n      from the constitutional values under the Constitution of India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_12\">As emphasized by the Supreme Court in the judgment of Central Public\nInformation Officer, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_23\">India vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a>\nin its judgment dated 13.11.2019, right to privacy and right to information have\nto be treated as co-equals and none can take precedence over the other, rather a\nbalance needs to be struck.

Puttaswamy (supra), is\n      essential for liberty and dignity. Therefore, individuals have the need to\n      preserve an intrusion-free zone for their personality and family. This\n      facilitates individual freedom. On the question of invasion of personal\n      liberty, the main judgment has referred to a three-fold requirement in the\n      form of - (i) legality, which postulates the existence of law (RTI Act in the\n      present case); (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate State aim; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      (iii) proportionality, which ensures a rational nexus between the objects\n      and the means to be adopted to achieve them.

If the\n      nature of information is such that disclosure of which may have the\n      propensity of harming one&#x27;s competitive interests, it would not be\n      necessary to specifically show as to how disclosure of such information\n      would, in fact, harm the competitive interest of a third party. In order to\n      test the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act it is necessary to first\n      and foremost determine the nature of information and if the nature of\n      information is confidential information relating to the affairs of a private\n      entity that is not obliged to be placed in public domain, then it is\n      necessary to consider whether its disclosure can possibly have an adverse\n      effect on third parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192776100\" id=\"span_16\">The Supreme Court while deciding upon issues relating to personal\ninformation of an individual in terms of his income tax returns passed the\nfollowing observations in <a href=\"/doc/192776100/\" id=\"a_30\">GirishRamchandra Deshpande v. Central\nInformation Commr.</a> [(2013) 1 SCC 212] :</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">      &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show-cause\n      notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third respondent from his\n      employer and also details viz. movable and immovable properties and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                        Page 9 of 15</span>\n       also the details of his investments, lending and borrowing from banks and\n      other financial institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of\n      gifts stated to have been accepted by the third respondent, his family\n      members and friends and relatives at the marriage of his son. The\n      information mostly sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of\n      the third respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n      &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI\n      Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the\n      details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to\n      the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n      censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information as\n      defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The performance\n      of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter\n      between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects\n      are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression\n      &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has no relationship\n      to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the\n      disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of\n      that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public\n      Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer of the\n      Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest\n      justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders\n      could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a\n      matter of right.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">      14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n      &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure under\n      clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger\n      public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the\n      State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n      satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n      such information.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">The aforementioned observations make it clear that the data has been shared by\nthe individuals with the Income Tax Department which is seeking such\ninformation as a statutory authority but while analyzing and assessing their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                       Page 10 of 15</span>\n income keeps this data secured in the fiduciary capacity and hence it is\nprotected from disclosure. It is applicable not only for individuals but for other\nlegal entities recognizable under <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_34\">Income Tax Act</a>. Further, it has been observed\nthat the information in the hands of public authority even in the discharge of\nstatutory obligations is protected under fiduciary relationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">12. There are apparently two set of such information which have been shared\nby the bank with the regulator under statutory obligation. First is the\ninformation/data of clients relating to their business/commercial operations,\nfinancial transactions, business and commercial strategy which is shared by\nclients with financial institutions in full trust and confidence and is held by them\nin fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_35\">RTI Act</a> in their\nhands. Second set is the information relating to business strategy, decisions,\ntransactions, other operational data etc. of financial institution which may have\nbearing on their competitive position and also enjoys the exemption from\ndisclosure in their hands, if it is a public authority or otherwise, under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_36\">RTI\nAct</a>. The Commission is of the view that the exemption of disclosure of certain\ninformation under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of financial\ninstitutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in good\nfaith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligations. This aspect is not\nthe ratio of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s judgment and\ndecision of the regulator to consider redacting such data/information while\ndisclosing the reports is to be aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts covering such aspects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">13. The Commission further observes that orders simpliciter irrespective of\nthe different objections raised by the appellant bank apparently lacked\napplication of mind or reasons on the part of the CPIO. Rejection or acceptance\nof the specific objections raised by them was not spelt out in the order which\nhave been passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to them. The\nCommission further observes that the CPIO is at best free to take decisions on\ndisclosure of information as per provision of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_38\">RTI Act, 2005</a> giving a reasoned\norders on the objections filed. The CPIO while issuing notice under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 11</a>\nof the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Appellant Bank to file their\nobjections, if any, against disclosure of information sought but has not found it\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                        Page 11 of 15</span>\n necessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While not doing so, the CPIO\nhas not passed any reasoned order covering his deliberations on their objections,\nhis understanding of law or jurisprudence in deciding specific objections, in\nfavor of disclosure etc. Order passed by the CPIO is cryptic, without any\nreference to objections raised by the Appellant Bank. Similarly, the FAA\ninstead of passing a speaking order have also given a cryptic order to the\nAppellant Bank. The CPIO and the FAA are expected to apply their mind\nbefore issuing the order of intent of disclosing the information. Further, no\nopportunity of personal hearing was given to the appellant nor speaking order\nhave been passed by FAA for not giving opportunity of hearing or elaborating\nreasons for accepting /not accepting their objections in his decision in the\nappeal. The Commission is of the view that every objection should be dealt and\nrejected/accepted with a reason and reasons for not giving opportunity of\npersonal hearing should be well reasoned too in view of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">14. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicant has to\nbe adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institution,various\njudicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts providing\nguidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should necessarily be\nprovided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise should be\nreasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, such order should enumerate\nthe principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of details of top 100 accounts of\nloan defaulters or various types of data, personal information, commercially\nsensitive information of clients or institution, specifically excluded disclosures\nunder various Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165184810\" id=\"span_20\">15. The Commission in this context refer to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\nDelhi High Court in decision in <a href=\"/doc/165184810/\" id=\"a_40\">J P Aggarwal v. Union of India (WP (C</a>) no.\n7232/2009 it has held that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">          &quot;The PIO is expected to apply his / her mind, duly analyse the\n          material before him / her and then either disclose the information\n          sought or give grounds for non-disclosure.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">          Furthermore, in OM No. 20/10/23/2007-IR dated 09.07.2009, while\n          elaborating on the duties and responsibilities of the FAA, it was stated\n          that:\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                       Page 12 of 15</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            &quot;3. Deciding appeals under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_41\">RTI Act</a> is a quasi judicial function. It\n           is, therefore, necessary that the appellate authority should see that the\n           justice is not only done but it should also appear to have been done. In\n           order to do so, the order passed by the appellate authority should be a\n           speaking order giving justification for the decision arrived at.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">           5..............................<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_42\">The Act</a> provides that the first appellate authority\n           would be an officer senior in rank to the CPIO. Thus, the appellate\n           authority, as per provisions of the Act, would be an officer in a\n           commanding position vis a vis&#x27; the CPIO. Nevertheless, if, in any\n           case, the CPIO does not implement the order passed by the appellate\n           authority and the appellate authority feels that intervention of higher\n           authority is required to get his order implemented, he should bring the\n           matter to the notice of the officer in the public authority competent to\n           take against the CPIO. Such competent officer shall take necessary\n           action so as to ensure implementation of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_43\">RTI Act</a>. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_22\">16. The Commission has also taken a detailed view in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022 wherein issues of\nredaction, ratio of <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_44\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case and other related issues are discussed\nin detail. Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make\nit clear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right\nto information are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India hasheld that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks and financial institutions may be allowed taking\ninto account the circumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a\nblanket manner. The Commission advised the CPIO to consider taking the\nrelevant references from the said order while deciding the cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_23\">17. The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of the\nCPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and\nlater in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                Page 13 of 15</span>\n required to adjudicate such RTI application in the light of the observations of\nthe Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take\nview on various objections filed by the Bank and submissions made by\napplicant to reach the decision in favor or against on case to case basis. He has\nto factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_46\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case,\nCommission&#x27;s judgment dated 05.05.2022 and other relevant judgments, some\nof which have been referred in this order as well. Hence, with these\nobservations the order passed by the CPIO and FAA in this matter is set aside\nand the case is being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh.The above\ndirections of the Commission should be complied within a period of 30 days\nfrom the date of receipt of this order. In case, the appellant/applicant is\naggrieved with the order of the CPIO, they are at the liberty to file first appeal\nbefore the First Appellate Authority and afterwards second appeal before the\nCommission.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">18.
