(J) Case No. 362/2024, arising out of Title Suit\nNo. 204/2024.\n\n4.    It is to be noted here that vide impugned ex-parte interim order, dated\n19.04.2024, the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division) No. 3, Kamrup (M) at\nGuwahati     had   directed    the   opposite   parties/defendants,   their     agents,\nrepresentative, assigns or any other person related to them from posting,\npublishing or circulating any posts that amounts to disparagement of services of\npetitioner/plaintiff as well as immediately take down the impugned articles dated\n12.03.2024, 14.03.2024 &amp; 18.03.2024, or any other similar article or any other\nposts, write up or material concerning or in relation to these impugned articles\nagainst the petitioner till next date fixed.\n\nBackground Facts:-</pre>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\">5.    The background facts, leading to filing of the present appeal, are\nadumbrated herein below:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;The respondent/opposite party as plaintiff has instituted a title suit,\n      being Title Suit No. 204/2024, with a prayer for permanent and mandatory\n      injuction and damages on account of defamation and disparagement,\n      against the defendants, i.e. the present appellants. The contention of the\n      respondent before the learned trial court is that it is a registered company\n      which deal with imparting quality education in order to help students secure\n      admissions in various premier institutes, like Indian Institute of Technology,\n      across India especially for training students for competitive examinations\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                              Page 4 of 32</span>\n and it has 78 numbers of centre all over India and also has centers in Doha\nand Bahrain, which has nearly sixty thousand students with approximately\nthree thousand employees. It also provides online classes, test papers etc.\nfor the students of Assam and North East at present. Whereas, the\ndefendants/appellants deal with providing news in text and through video\nanalysis, data and tools on investing across diverse asset classes, personal\nfinance, the business sector and the economy as well as operate multiple\nsocial media pages being Facebook, LinkdIn, X (erstwhile Twitter) etc.\n\nThe     defendants/appellants   had    published   series   of   articles   dated\n12.03.2024, 14.03.2024 &amp; 18.03.2024. The respondent on 12.03.2024,\nreceived an email at 7:38 AM regarding an article to be published on\nappellant&#x27;s platform, titled:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot;FIITJEE holds employee salaries for second month in a\nrow, calls it a &#x27;wake-up call&#x27; to make them work harder.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">        It is stated that appellant No.2, in the said email also requested for\nclarification on 13 points of queries by 10 A.M. on the same day, on the\nsubject matter of the said mail. In the Article dated 12th March, 2024, the\nappellants also made a reference to respondent&#x27;s competitors, such as\nAllen, Aakash, Physics Wallah and Unacademy referring to them as new-\nage edtech and use their names with # as &quot;#Physics Wallah&quot; and\n&quot;#Unacademy, which gives an inference that these articles are motivated.\nThereafter, on 14th March 2024, two more articles were published,\nintensifying the attack on them. The first, at 10:42 AM, questioned the\nsalary issue, while the second, at 5:25 PM, criticized respondent&#x27;s stance:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;Brazenly wrong! FIITJEE founder&#x27;s &#x27;salary is not a right&#x27;\nemail     not   legally    sound,     say   experts&quot;   And the second one\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                       Page 5 of 32</span>\n published on 14th January, 2024 at 05.25 pm titled; &quot;FIITJEE मैसैलरी\nमाां गना गलत है , फाउां डरनेऐसादियाजवाबदि िममचाररयोिादिलिहलगया&#x27; with\na click-bait image which reads: में सैलरी माां गनेवालोां िी खैरनही ां\nFIITJEE.      Thereafter, continuing on 18th March 2024, the Appellants\npublished   another    article   titled:-   &quot;FIITJEE    slammed      for     ad\n&#x27;belittling&#x27; student who quit institute and got 99.99 in JEE\nGains: &#x27;Disgusting.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">        By publishing these articles, according to respondent, the appellants\nhad attempted to damage respondent&#x27;s reputation, suggesting financial\ninstability and unethical practices, despite being baseless. The respondent\nalso alleges that the deliberate timing and publication of Article in Hindi\namplify the defamation and disparagement of the respondent&#x27;s business\nand reputation and that such actions aim to alter public perception of the\nrespondent and benefit appellants herein above monetarily. It is also\nalleged that these articles have led &quot;Digitup&quot; to put the plan of opening a\nFranchisee Study Centre at Guwahati on hold till further clarification from\nthe respondent/plaintiff. In that connection, a later on behalf of &#x27;Digitup&#x27;\nwas addressed to COO of the respondent on 25.03.2024, wherein they have\nspecifically cited articles published by Money Control being the reason of\ntheir partner&#x27;s apprehensions and on account of such publication, the\nreputation of the respondent/plaintiff has lowered in the eye of general\npublic and among its employees. It is also stated that the damaging impact\nextends beyond reputational harm, inflicting financial losses and irreparable\ndamage to the respondent&#x27;s business. By spreading false information about\nthe institution&#x27;s reputation and credibility, the appellants seek to manipulate\nthe admissions process, depriving deserving students of access to quality\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                     Page 6 of 32</span>\n education. Further, Articles are not confined to appellant&#x27;s website and have\nspread across various social media platforms, amplifying the damaging\neffects of false allegations. The virility of these articles exacerbates the\nharm to the respondent&#x27;s reputation and underscores the urgent need for\ncorrective action.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">      Being aggrieved of such publication, the respondent/plaintiff had\ninstituted Title Suit No. 204/2024, before the learned Civil Judge (Senior\nDivision) No. 3, Kamrup (M) at Guwahati, with the following prayers:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      a.    Pass a decree of permanent injunction thereby restraining the\n            defendants, their agents, representatives, assigns or any other\n            persons related to them from posting, publishing or circulating\n            any defamatory articles/posts against the plaintiff herein;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      b.    Pass a decree of permanent injunction thereby restraining the\n            defendants, their agents, representatives, assigns or any other\n            persons related to them from posting, publishing or circulating\n            any posts that amounts to disparagement of plaintiff&#x27;s services;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      c.    Pass a decree of mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiffs\n            and against all circulating the impugned Articles against the\n            plaintiff herein;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      d.    Pass a decree of damages on account of defamation of plaintiff\n            and disparagement of plaintiff&#x27;s services in favour of the\n            plaintiff and against the defendants to the extent of Rs.\n            5,00,00,000/-;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                    Page 7 of 32</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       e.    Pass any other further orders as the Court may deem fit and\n            proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, in favour of\n            the plaintiff,\n\n      In the said Title Suit, the respondent also filed a petition, being\npetition No. 2518/2024, dated 19.04.2024, under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 151</a> of the C.P.C., for granting ad-interim injunction restraining\nthe opposite parties/defendants, their agents, representative, assigns or any\nother person related to them from posting publishing or circulating any\nposts that amount to disparagement of services of petitioner/plaintiff as well\nas immediately take down the impugned articles dated 12.03.2024,\n14.03.2024 &amp; 18.03.2024, or any other similar article or any other posts,\nwrite up or material concerning or in relation to these impugned articles\nagainst the petitioner.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">      Upon the said petition, the learned trial court has registered a Misc.\n(J) Case No. 362/2024.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      Thereafter, considering the relevant documents placed on record and\nhearing learned counsel for the respondent, the learned trial court had\npassed ad-interim injunction order as aforesaid, having found the triple test\nin granting injunction i.e. prima-facie case, balance of convenience and\nirreparable loss, satisfied with, in favour of the respondent/plaintiff. The\noperative part of the impugned order read as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      &quot;10. Upon hearing and perusal of the petition as well as\n      the relevant documents filed by the petitioner, it\n      transpires that there were series of publications in\n      moneycontrol.com portal and in other social media\n      including Facebook, LinkedIn, X (erstwhile Twitter)\n      about the petitioner&#x27;s institute/company regarding\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                    Page 8 of 32</span>\n             withholding of employee&#x27;s salary and touching upon the\n            petitioner&#x27;s bankruptcy as alleged by the petitioner. It\n            also appears that tuition-cum-coaching institute namely\n            DIGITUP who were intending to open a FIITJEE franchise\n            in Guwahati for upcoming academic session sought\n            clarification on 25.03.2024 from the petitioner company\n            about the said development thereby causing harm to the\n            reputation of the petitioner. It appears that there is a\n            Prima Facie case to be heard. Besides, if the\n            OP/defendant continue to publishing in moneycontrol.com\n            portal and in other social media including Facebook,\n            LinkedIn, X (erstwhile Twitter) about the petitioner&#x27;s\n            institute/company the petitioner or intends to continue\n            or repeat the alleged publication there is a prospect of\n            such   immediate   further   pressing   injury   to  the\n            petitioner. Thus, the balance of convenience lies in\n            favour of the petitioner/plaintiff. Further, in the\n            event of petitioner/plaintiff is not protected in the\n            interim as prayed for, the petitioner/plaintiff will\n            suffer   from    irreparable   loss   and    injury.   On\n            consideration of the facts and circumstances and the\n            above triple test, I am of the considered opinion that\n            the relief claimed by the petitioner is urgent in nature\n            and the purpose of injunction is likely to be defeated\n            by delay. As such, in the interim the OPs/defendants,\n            their agents, representative, assigns or any other\n            person related to them are restrained from posting,\n            publishing or circulating any posts that amount to\n            disparagement of petitioner/plaintiff&#x27;s services as well\n            as immediately take down the impugned articles dated\n            12th March/2024, 14th March/2024 and 18th March/2024 or\n            any other similar article or any other posts, write up\n            or material concerning or in relation to these impugned\n            articles against the petitioner till next date fixed.‛\nGrounds:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                             Page 9 of 32</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\"> 6.      Being highly aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid ad-interim\ninjunction order, the appellants/defendants have preferred this present appeal\nwith a prayer for staying the impugned ex-parte order, on the following grounds:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(i)     That, the impugned ex-parte interim injunction order was passed without\n        following the principle laid down by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and without\n        exercising caution in granting pre-trial injunction, especially in defamation\n        cases, to avoid impeding free speech;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(ii)    That, the injunction should be reserved for exceptional cases where the\n        answering defendant&#x27;s defence is bound to fail and that unreasoned\n        censorship through ex-parte injunctions should be avoided and that the\n        impugned order was passed without appreciating the articles in question,\n        which are fair and bonafide comment on a matter of public interest\n        pertaining to the financial matter concerning the respondent;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(iii)   That, the impugned ex-parte interim injunction dated 19.04.2024, is bad in\n        law, arbitrary, perverse and passed without taking into account the\n        statements of the four articles/news reports, which are based on truth,\n        supported by documents/evidence including internal emails of the appellant\n        company and interviews/statements of persons from the appellant\n        company;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(iv)    That, the impugned order was passed without evaluating the meticulous\n        three-fold test for granting interim relief, i.e. prima facie case, balance of\n        convenience and irreparable loss and that the learned trial court applied the\n        threefold test mechanically without assigning detailed reasons for granting\n        the said injunction and without meticulously examining the said four\n        articles;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                           Page 10 of 32</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"> (v)    That, the impugned order was passed without even discussing the prima-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">       facie strength of the respondent&#x27;s case, merits of the plaint, and\n       unreasoned censorship which cannot be countenanced, non-giving of legal\n       notice by the respondent to the appellant and the learned trial court has not\n       considered the balance of right to freedom of free speech with right to\n       reputation and privacy and other factors;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">(vi)   That, the learned trial court had failed to appreciate the fact that the suit\n       filed by the respondent, which seeks the reliefs on the ground of\n       defamation is not maintainable as it does not discloses any cause of action,\n       as the defamatory words/sentence are required to be set forth ad-verbatim\n       in the plaint, falling which the plaint is liable to be dismissed;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">(vii) That, the impugned ex-parte interim injunction order, dated 19.04.2024, is\n       violative of the appellants&#x27; fundamental right to freedom of speech and\n       fundamental right to know the truth in the matter of public interest and\n       public importance guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and the suit is strategic\n       litigation against public participation;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">(viii) That, the prayers for damages are imaginary and factionary and the\n       respondent had failed to demonstrate with relevant material/actual proof as\n       to how the said articles have caused direct or indirect harm to their\n       reputation or business in any manner whatsoever;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">(ix)   That, despite no office and no cause of action within the territorial\n       jurisdiction of Kamrup (M), the Suit and Misc.

Thereafter, the respondent moved before the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court against the interim order, dated 12.06.2024 passed by this\nCourt by way of filing SLP (C) No. 13996/2024 (Fiitjee Limited Vs- E Eighteen.Com\nLtd &amp; 2 Others) and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court declined to entertain the Special\nLeave Petition as the matter is pending before this Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                           Page 12 of 32</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">       Thereafter the respondent has filed an Interlocutory Application (I.A.) No.\n2175/2024 filed by respondent/plaintiff for vacating the interim order dated\n12.06.2024 passed in F.A.O No.31/2024. The respondent also raised following\npreliminary objections:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      A.    The first objection is about the maintainability of the FAO. It is stated\n            that despite having served the copy of suit papers and the injunction\n            order, the appellants failed to place on record and concealed material\n            documents while moving the F.A.O before this court. It is stated that\n            Article No.3 (Hindi version) has not been made as an Annexure in the\n            F.A.O Further, all the social media post including Face book, X etc,\n            are not annexed in the F.A.O. And on material concealment, this FAO\n            is not maintainable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      B.    The appellants have not complied with the impugned ex-parte interim\n            injunction order dated 19.04.2024. To that effect the respondent had\n            filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 2A before the Trial Court\n            and also filed an affidavit pointing out non-compliance of injunction\n            order. And because of this act of contempt disentitles the appellants\n            from any relief.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      C.    The impugned ex-parte interim injunction order dated 19.04.2024 is a\n            reasoned order. The Appellants are seeking to re-assessment to the\n            material to reach a different conclusion which is not permissible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">Submissions:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">7.    Mr. Das, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants, while\nreiterating the grounds mentioned in the memo of appeal, submits that there is no\nconcealment of the fact and non-compliance of the impugned ex-parte interim\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                          Page 13 of 32</span>\n order dated 19.04.2024. Mr. Das further submits that before publishing the Article\nNo. 1, one email was sent to the respondent asking their response, but no\nresponse was received and therefore, Article No. 1 was published, subsequently\nthe Articles Nos. 2, 3 were published and that Article No.4 was published only\nafter publication of the same by some other organizations. Mr. Das, further\nsubmits that the learned trial court has granted mandatory injunction without\naffording any opportunity to the other side and while doing so the learned trial\ncourt had not taken into account the principles laid down by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in the case of Bloomberg Television Production Services India\nPrivate Limited and Others -Vs- Zee Entertainment Enterprises\nLimited reported in 2024 SCC Online SC 426. Mr. Das also submits that\nthere was no discussion in the impugned order about the three golden principles\nof granting ad-interim injunction i.e. (i) prima facie case, (ii) balance of\nconvenience and (iii) irreparable loss. Mr. Das, learned Senior Counsel also\nsubmits that no prima-facie case is made out here and the learned trial court had\nfailed to appreciate Page No. 52-57 of the List of Documents at Sl. No.11\nsubmitted by the Respondent/Plaintiff before the Hon&#x27;ble Court i.e., emails dated\n27.02.2024, 03.03.2024 &amp; 08.03.2024 which were issued by the Managing\nDirector of Respondent/Plaintiff (Fiitjee) Mr. D.K. Goel to his team, and the\nlearned trial court had mechanically recorded that the balance of convenience is in\nfavour of the respondent herein. It had failed to come to any conclusion that\nwhether, the articles published or posts so uploaded are false and as such, same\nwill cause injury. There is no finding to that effect and therefore, considering the\nbalance of convenience mechanically in favour of respondent/plaintiff is nothing\nbut perverse, arbitrary and bad in law. The respondent is required to prove that\nirreparable injury would be caused if no injunction is granted. But, when the\nrespondent had already quantified the damage in that case, the question of not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                         Page 14 of 32</span>\n granting any injunction will not make any damage to the respondent/plaintiff.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"95304362\" id=\"span_12\">That being so, the learned Court ought to have issued notice before granting any\nex-parte interim injunction and should provide an opportunity to the appellants to\nplace their case by way of objection and to justify the allegation. As the same has\nnot been done the impugned ex-parte interim injunction Order dated 19.04.2024\nis arbitrary and bad in law as the learned trial court had failed to take into account\nthat the contents of the four Articles were neither malicious nor false and as such\nthe impugned order is violative of right to free speech as guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n19(1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India and as such liable to be set aside. Mr. Das\nalso submits that herein this case the learned trial court had granted mandatory\ninjunction. By referring to a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/95304362/\" id=\"a_6\">Tek\nSingh vs. Shashi Verma and Another</a>, reported in (2019) 10 SCC 678,\nMr. Das submits that for granting mandatory injunction much more than a mere\nprima-facie case requires to be established by the party, which the respondent herein\nhad failed to establish.</span>   Mr. Das also submits that complying of the order of\ninjunction before filing appeal is not the requirement of law and in support of his\nsubmission he has referred to a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and also in the\ncase of Modern Food Industries (India) Limited vs. Sachidanand Dass\nand Another, reported in 1995 Supp (4) SCC 465. Referring to\nanother decision of Supreme Court in Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">-Vs- Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel and Others reported in (2006) 8 SCC\n726 (Para 128), Mr. Das submits that when the learned Trial Court exercised\nthe discretion arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely ignoring the settled principles of\nlaw regulating the grant or refusal of interlocutory injunction, the appellate court\ncan interfere with such order. Mr. Das also submits that herein this case allowing\nthe interlocutory application amounts to allowing the whole suit and on such count\nalso the impugned order is not sustainable. It is further submitted that there is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                           Page 15 of 32</span>\n also delay filing the Title Suit, and that all relevant papers were place on record\nand even though some papers could not be annexed, the same would have no\nbearing at all in the finding of the appeal. Therefore, Mr. Das has contended to\nallow the appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"43284183\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"945120\" id=\"span_15\">8.    Per contra, Mr. Hazarika, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\nrespondent submits that he has two preliminary objections in respect of\nmaintainability of the appeal. Firstly, Mr. Hazarika submits that there was\nconcealment of fact, as the appellant had deliberately not enclosed 15 numbers of\ndocuments out of 21 documents, which were submitted by the respondent before\nthe learned trial court with the suit. Relying upon following three decisions, in\n<a href=\"/doc/945120/\" id=\"a_7\">General Manager, Haryana Roadways vs. Jai Bhagwan &amp; Anr</a>, reported\nin   (<a href=\"/doc/43284183/\" id=\"a_8\">2008)    4    SCC   127   and   K.   Jayaram     &amp;   Ors.    vs.   Bangalore\nDevelopment Authorities &amp; Ors</a>, reported in (2022) 12 SCC 815, and\nRamjas Foundation &amp; Another vs. Union of India and Others reported\nin (2010) 14 SCC 38, Mr. Hazarika submits that on account of suppression of\nmaterial fact the appellants are not entitled to any relief. Secondly, Mr. Hazarika\nsubmits that there is no compliance of the order of injunction of the learned trial\ncourt and even after the order of the learned trial court, the appellant has\npublished the article No. 4 and it had not taken down the Article No.1, 2 &amp; 3 from\nthe website.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1272928\" id=\"span_16\">Mr. Hazarika pointed out that while the order was passed on\n09.04.2024, the same was communicated to the appellant on 22.04.2024, and in\nview of decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1272928/\" id=\"a_9\">Prestige Lights Limited vs.\nState Bank of India</a>, reported in (2007) 8 SCC 449, no relief could be\ngranted to the appellants.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_17\">Referring another decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nthe case of and <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_10\">Wander Limited and Another vs. Antox India Private\nLimited</a>, reported in 1990 (Supp) SCC 727, Mr. Hazarika submits that the\npower of appellate court is very limited in interfering with the order of trial court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                          Page 16 of 32</span>\n being passed in exercise of discretionary power and unless arbitrariness is shown\nin exercise of such discretion the appellate court cannot interfere and in the case\nin hand no such arbitrariness is shown.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"79649288\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"39567084\" id=\"span_20\">Mr. Hazarika also submits that the suit\nfiled before the learned trial court was not only for defamation, but also for\ncommercial disparagement for levelling unfounded allegations, and that the action\nfor disparagement and defamation is distinct and this aspect has been dealt with\nby High Court of Delhi in the case of <a href=\"/doc/39567084/\" id=\"a_11\">Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing\nFederation Ltd. and Another vs. Akshar Foods and Beverages and\nAnother</a> reported in 2022 SCC OnLine Del 4899, and by Bombay High Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/79649288/\" id=\"a_12\">Marico Limited vs. Abhijeet Bhansali</a> reported in (2022) SCC OnLine\nBOM 60, and that the learned trial court also in the impugned order of the had\ndealt with disparagement, but the appeal is preferred only for defamation and on\nsuch count also the appeal is not maintainable. Mr. Hazarika further pointed out\nthat before publishing the Article No. 1, the appellant had sought for response\nfrom the respondent, but, the e-mail was sent to the respondent at about 7:38\na.m. in the morning, but the office of the respondent opens at about 10:00 a.m.\nand before filing any reply, the appellants published the Article at about 10:42\na.m. and the time given to response is inadequate and publishing the Article\nbefore the response being received indicate the intention of the appellants. Mr.\nHazarika also submits that Annexure 11, 13 &amp; 14 are not part of the record and\ntherefore, the same cannot be looked into. Mr. Hazarika further pointed out that a\nprima-facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is also in favour of\nthe respondent and there is irreparable loss and having been satisfied with the\naforesaid triple test, the learned trial court has rightly restrained circulating further\ndisparagement article against the respondent, otherwise it would be an otiose,\nand it had assigned reason for granting the same and being speaking and\nreasoned order, the same warrants no interference of this court.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_21\">It is the further\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                             Page 17 of 32</span>\n submission of Mr. Hazarika that the decision in <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_13\">Bloomberg                Television\nProduction Services India Private Limited and Others</a>, (supra),\nreferred by the learned counsel for the appellant is not applicable in the case in\nhand as the said case relates to only defamation and the case in hand is not only\nfor defamation, but also for disparagement. Mr. Hazarika also submits that there\nis no delay in approaching the court and every moment subsequent to published\nthe Article, the cause of action has arisen as the Articles are in website and at any\npoint of time one can see the same and also share with others. Under the\naforementioned facts and circumstances, Mr. Hazarika has contended to dismiss\nthe appeal.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">9.

This requirement is\n      consistent with the principle, that a party to a suit, who is\n      being restrained from exercising a right which such party\n      claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common\n      law, must be informed why instead of following the\n      requirement of Rule 3, the procedure prescribed under the\n      proviso has been followed. The party which invokes the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                                    Page 19 of 32</span>\n jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restrain\nagainst a party, without affording an opportunity to him of\nbeing heard, must satisfy the court about the gravity of the\nsituation and court has to consider briefly these factors in\nthe ex parte order. We are quite conscious of the fact that\nthere are other statutes which contain similar provisions\nrequiring the court or the authority concerned to record\nreasons before exercising power vested in them. In respect of\nsome of such provisions it has been held that they are\nrequired to be complied with but non-compliance therewith\nwill not vitiate the order so passed. But same cannot be said\nin respect of the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39. The\nParliament has prescribed a particular procedure for passing\nof an order of injunction without notice to the other side,\nunder exceptional circumstances. Such ex parte orders have\nfar-reaching effect, as such a condition has been imposed\nthat court must record reasons before passing such order. If\nit is held that the compliance with the proviso aforesaid is\noptional and not obligatory, then the introduction of the\nproviso by the Parliament shall be a futile exercise and that\npart of Rule 3 will be a surplusage for all practical\npurposes. Proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code, attracts\nthe principle, that if a statute requires a thing to be done\nin a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or\nnot all. This principle was approved and accepted in well-\nknown cases of Taylor v. Taylor [(1875) 1 Ch D 426 : 45 LJ Ch\n373] , and Nazir Ahmed v. Emperor [AIR 1936 PC 253(2) : 63 IA\n372 : 37 Cri LJ 897] . <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1986616\" id=\"span_27\">This Court has also expressed the same\nview in respect of procedural requirement of the <a href=\"/doc/117675938/\" id=\"a_16\">Bombay\nTenancy and Agricultural Lands Act</a> in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1986616/\" id=\"a_17\">Ramchandra\nKeshav Adke v.

Generally stated these guidelines are:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      (1)   The plaintiff has a strong case for trial.

Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or\n            refusal of an interlocutory mandatory injunction shall\n            ultimately rest in the sound judicial discretion of the\n            court to be exercised in the light of the facts and\n            circumstances in each case. Though the above guidelines\n            are neither exhaustive nor complete or absolute rules,\n            and there may be exceptional circumstances needing\n            action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or\n            refusal of such injunctions would be a sound exercise of\n            a judicial discretion.‛\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">13.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95304362\" id=\"span_30\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/95304362/\" id=\"a_19\">Tek Singh</a> (supra) also it has been held by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt that much more than a mere prima facie case has to be made out.

It is well settled that grant of an interlocutory injunction is in exercise of\ndiscretionary power. Usually the appellate court will not interfere with it. But when\nthe discretion is exercised arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely ignoring the settled\nprinciples of law regulating the grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions the\nappellate court can interfere with such order of granting injunction. Reference in\nthis context can be made to a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Ramdev Food\nProducts (P) Ltd (supra). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_33\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_21\">Wander Limited and Another</a>\n(supra) Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that unless it has been shown to have\nexercised the discretion arbitrarily by the learned trial court, the appellate court\nwould not interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial court.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_34\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_22\">Wander Ltd.</a>(supra), Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has also\nheld that:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      14. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the\n      exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such\n      appeals, the appellate court will not interfere with the\n      exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and\n      substitute its own discretion except where the discretion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                           Page 22 of 32</span>\n       has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or\n      capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored\n      the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal\n      of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of\n      discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate\n      court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a\n      conclusion different from the one reached by the court\n      below if the one reached by that court was reasonably\n      possible on the material. The appellate court would\n      normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise\n      of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it\n      had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have\n      come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been\n      exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial\n      manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a\n      different view may not justify interference with the trial\n      court&#x27;s exercise of discretion. ..........‛\n\n\nAppreciation:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">16.   Now,    adverting   to   the   facts   herein   this   case   I   find   that    the\ndefendants/appellants had published series of articles, within a span of six days,\ndated 12.03.2024, 14.03.2024 &amp; 18.03.2024. The first Article was published on\n12.03.2024, with the titled: &quot;FIITJEE holds employee salaries for second\nmonth in a row, calls it a &#x27;wake-up call&#x27; to make them work\nharder.&quot;     The appellants, in the said Article also made a reference to\nrespondent&#x27;s competitors, such as Allen, Aakash, Physics Wallah and Unacademy\nreferring to them as new- age edtech and use their names with # as &quot;#Physics\nWallah&quot; and &quot;#Unacademy. Thereafter, on 14th March 2024, two more articles\nwere published. The first, at 10:42 AM, questioning the salary issue, titled -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;Brazenly wrong! FIITJEE founder&#x27;s &#x27;salary is not a right&#x27; email\nnot legally sound, say experts&quot; And the second one published on 14th\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                               Page 23 of 32</span>\n January, 2024 at 05.25 pm criticizing the stance of the respondent, titled;\n&quot;FIITJEE मैसैलरी माांगना गलत है , फाउां डरनेऐसादियाजवाबदि िममचाररयोिा दिल\nिहलगया&#x27; with a click-bait image which reads: में सैलरी माांगनेवालोां िी\n\nखैरनही ां FIITJEE.       And thereafter, on 18th March 2024, the Appellants\npublished another article titled:- &quot;FIITJEE slammed for ad &#x27;belittling&#x27;\nstudent    who    quit     institute    and      got   99.99   in   JEE     Gains:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">&#x27;Disgusting.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">17.   It also appears that the respondent had received an email at 7:38 AM from\nthe Appellant No.2, wherein clarification was sought for on 13 points of queries\nby 10:00 noon, on the same day and can wait till 12:00 noon, on the subject\nmatter of the said mail, i.e. &quot;FIITJEE holds employee salaries for\nsecond month in a row, calls it a &#x27;wake-up call&#x27; to make them\nwork harder.&quot; It is the categorical contention of the respondent that the time\ngiven for response by the Appellant No.2 is quite inadequate and unrealistic as\nbecause the office of the respondent open only at 10 AM. It also appears that the\nrespondent had sent the reply at 14:34:17 PM. But, before that the appellants\nhad published the Article in their portal, i.e. Moneycontrol.Com at about 11:10\na.m., which has 5 lacs registered subscribers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">18.   A careful perusal of the said Articles and also the time of publishing the\nsame, the contention of the respondent that the said Articles were gives an\ninference that they are motivated, cannot said to be without any basis, as because\nin the said Articles the financial incapacity of the respondent having been\nhighlighted, which not only adversely impacted the reputation, but also the\nbusiness of the respondent.     It is stated that one DIGITUP, a Tuition-cum-\nCoaching Institute of Guwahati had contemplated to open a franchise of FIITJEE,\nthe respondent herein, for upcoming academic session, but after publication of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                          Page 24 of 32</span>\n the Articles; it had put on hold such venture and sought clarification on\n25.03.2024 from the respondent by writing a letter. Thus, the letter of DIGITUP\ndated 25.03.2024 is a fait accompli of harming the reputation and also causing\ncommercial disparagement to the respondent. Mr. U. Hazarika, the learned senior\ncounsel for the respondent, has rightly pointed this out and I find substance in his\nsubmission. The learned trial court also, in the impugned order, had referred the\nsame, though of-course, briefly. Under such circumstances the learned trial court\nhad rightly found the prima-facie case in favour of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">19.    Further, it appears that having published the first Article on 12.03.2024, the\nappellants continued to publish the Articles in Moneycontrol.com portal and in\nother social media including Facebook, LinkedIn, X (erstwhile Twitter) about the\npetitioner&#x27;s institute/company the petitioner, till 18th March 2024. The learned trial\ncourt had found that if they continued to publish the same or repeat the alleged\npublication, there is a prospect of further pressing injury to the respondent and as\nsuch the learned trial court, to the considered opinion of this court, had rightly\nfound the balance of convenience and irreparable injury in favour of the\nrespondent herein. Thus, it appears that the learned trial court had rightly found\nthe triple test of granting injunction satisfied. Further, the learned trial court had\nfound the relief claimed by the petitioner urgent in nature, and the purpose of\ninjunction is likely to be defeated by delay, in the event of respondent herein is\nnot protected by granting interim relief (s) the respondent will suffer from\nirreparable loss and injury. Only thereafter, the learned trial court had granted the\ninterim relief till date fixed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"863497\" id=\"span_38\">20.    Thus, it appears that the learned trial court had assigned reason while\ngranting the ad-interim relief. Mr. Hazarika, the learned counsel for the\nrespondent has rightly submitted that the impugned order is a well reasoned\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                                           Page 25 of 32</span>\n order and rightly so. It is a fact that discussion on the factual aspect and the\nreason assigned are brief. But, there is no requirement of extensive and elaborate\ndiscussion of the factual aspect as well as reasoning. As held in the case of <a href=\"/doc/863497/\" id=\"a_23\">Shiv\nKumar Chadha</a> (supra) the party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for\ngrant of an order of restraint against a party, without affording an opportunity to\nhim of being heard, must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and\ncourt has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order. Thus, this court is\nunable to agree with the submission of Mr. Das, the learned counsel for the\nappellant that the order impugned is a cryptic order bereft of any reason.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1120137\" id=\"span_40\">21.    Thus, I find that the factors, which should weigh with the court in the grant\nof ex-parte injunction, so <a href=\"/doc/863497/\" id=\"a_24\">laid down in</a> the case of <a href=\"/doc/1120137/\" id=\"a_25\">Morgon Stanley Fund</a>\n(supra), were taken note of by the learned trial court. In no uncertain term, the\nlearned trial court, in the impugned order, had held that- in the event of\npetitioner/plaintiff is not protected in the interim as prayed\nfor; the petitioner/plaintiff will suffer from irreparable loss\nand injury. The learned trial court also held that- on consideration of the\nfacts and circumstances and the above triple test, I am of the\nconsidered opinion that the relief claimed by the petitioner is\nurgent in nature and the purpose of injunction is likely to be\ndefeated by delay. It also appears that the learned Trial Court had granted\nthe relief for a limited period i.e. till next date.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">22.    It is however a fact that there is some delay in filing the suit. While the last\nArticle was published in on 18.03.2024, the respondent had approached the court\nonly on 19.04.2024. But, the fact remained that unlike any paper publication, the\npublication on the internet and website are available as well as accessible to the\nviewers all the time and the same can be shared in social media platforms and it\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                            Page 26 of 32</span>\n continued to repeat every day and capable to download by any viewer and\nthereafter, can be cross-posted to other social media platform and this fact is\napparent from the document annexed with the plaint (Page No. 58 to 109). Mr.\nHazarika, the learned counsel for the respondent has rightly pointed this out at\nthe time of hearing and there appears to be sufficient force in the same.\nTherefore, the injury being caused to the respondent is a continuing one and on\nsuch count it cannot be said that there is delay in approaching the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_42\">23.   Though Mr. Das, the learned counsel for the appellants submits that the\nlearned trial court, before granting ad-interim relief, had not complied with the\nproposition of law <a href=\"/doc/1120137/\" id=\"a_26\">laid down in</a> the case of <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_27\">Bloomberg Television Production\nServices India Private Limited and Others</a>, (supra), yet in view of\nthe discussion and finding of this court herein above, I am unable to agree with\nthe submission of Mr. Das. Besides, the submission is controverted by Mr.\nHazarika, the learned counsel for the respondent on the ground that the said\ncase relates to only defamation, whereas, the case in hand is of not only\ndefamation, but also for disparagement and that being so the ratio cannot be\napplied to the facts herein this case. Having adjudged the submissions of both\nthe parties in the light of facts and circumstances on the record, this court is of\nthe view that there is force in the submission of Mr. Hazarika, the learned counsel\nfor the respondent.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"95304362\" id=\"span_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1822024\" id=\"span_44\">24.   Indisputably in the impugned order, the learned trial court had directed to\nthe appellants to take down the Articles from the web-site. This is in mandatory\nform. Mr. Das, the learned counsel for the appellants has rightly argued on this\npoint. There is substance in his submission that in case of granting mandatory\ninjunction the satisfaction of the court in respect of prima-facie case is much\nhigher in degree than the ordinary prima-facie case. This is well settled in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                         Page 27 of 32</span>\n case of <a href=\"/doc/1822024/\" id=\"a_28\">Dorab Cawasji Warden</a> (supra) and also in the case of <a href=\"/doc/95304362/\" id=\"a_29\">Tek\nSingh</a> (supra) where it has been held that the plaintiff&#x27;s case shall be of a higher\nstandard than a prima facie case that is normally required for a prohibitory\ninjunction.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_46\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_30\">Bloomberg Television Production Services\nIndia Private Limited and Others</a>, (supra) it has been held that in\nsuits concerning defamation by media platforms and/or journalists, an additional\nconsideration of balancing the fundamental right to free speech with the right to\nreputation and privacy must be borne in mind. It is also held that:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">      ‚9. In essence, the grant of a pre-trial injunction\n      against the publication of an article may have severe\n      ramifications on the right to freedom of speech of the\n      author and the public&#x27;s right to know. An injunction,\n      particularly ex-parte, should not be granted without\n      establishing that the content sought to be restricted is\n      &#x27;malicious&#x27; or &#x27;palpably false&#x27;. Granting interim\n      injunctions, before the trial commences, in a cavalier\n      manner results in the stifling of public debate. In other\n      words, courts should not grant ex-parte injunctions\n      except in exceptional cases where the defence advanced by\n      the respondent would undoubtedly fail at trial. In all\n      other cases, injunctions against the publication of\n      material should be granted only after a full-fledged\n      trial is conducted or in exceptional cases, after the\n      respondent is given a chance to make their submissions.‛\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">25.   In the case in hand, though the learned trial court, while granting ad-\ninterim injunction, had not specifically weighed the degree of satisfaction, yet,\nhaving gone through the materials placed on record this court is of the\nconsidered view that respondent herein has a strong case for trial which is higher\nin standard than of an ordinary prima facie case. Indisputably, the appellants had\npublished the first Article without the consent of the respondent. Though the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                         Page 28 of 32</span>\n appellants had sent an e-mail to the respondent seeking response, yet sufficient\ntime was not given to the respondent to respond in respect of the Article being\nproposed to publish and thereafter got the same published before the response\nof the respondent. That, the intention of the appellants to cause harm to the\nreputation and causing disparagement to the respondent becomes fait-\naccompli from its conduct of publishing the Article before the response being\nreceived and also from the timing of publishing the Articles at a time when the\nparents and students were pondering upon taking a decision to choose the test\npreparation centers and also its decision to publish one Article in Hindi, so as to\noutreach the consumers of diverse socio-economic background of the respondent\nand also making reference to the competitors of the respondent, such as Allen,\nAakash, Physics Wallah and Unacademy referring to them as new- age edtech\nand use their names with # as &quot;#Physics Wallah&quot; and &quot;#Unacademy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_48\">26.   Even for the sake of argument, if it is accepted that the trial court had not\nrecorded the higher degree of satisfaction yet, it appears that the learned trial\ncourt had exercised the discretion and in view of limited scope of appellate court\nto interfere with the same, as held by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of\nRamdev Food Products (P) Ltd (supra) and also in <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_31\">Wander Limited and\nAnother</a> (supra), this court is of the view that in absence of arbitrariness being\nshown in exercising such discretion by the learned trial court, no interference in\nthe same is warranted.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">27.   Further, it appears that the respondent had responded to the email sent to\nit by its emails on the same day at about 14:34:17 p.m. explaining the reason of\nfinancial re-structuring and incentive schemes leading to holding the salaries. But,\nthe same were not considered by the appellants.
