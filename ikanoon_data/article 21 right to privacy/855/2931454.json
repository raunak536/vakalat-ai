It is stated that in the suit property, there is a ventilator at\n            the left side of suit property which was also got closed by the\n            acts of respondent as he did not allow appellant to use common\n            passage in the toilet and was obstructing common passage,\n            common toilet and use of the ventilator.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       4.

In the grounds of appeal, appellant has stated that Ld.\n            Trial Court failed to appreciate that appellant being lawful and\n            absolute owner of suit property has every right to access to his\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">MCA No. 09/13                                                             Page No. 4 of 15</span>\n             property at any time during day or night.         It is stated that\n            respondent is restraining appellant/his family members from\n            ingress and egress to suit property. It is stated that if interim\n            injunction is not granted, appellant would be deprived of his\n            legal right to use suit property at his will despite being lawful\n            owner thereof.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160789\" id=\"span_5\">8.

It is stated that Ld. Trial Court gravely erred in\n            holding that allowing the interim application would tantamount to\n            decreeing the suit.

And then there may be converse cases\n                  where withholding of an interim relief would\n                  tantamount to dismissal of main petition itself; for, by\n                  the time main matter comes up for hearing there\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">MCA No. 09/13                                                          Page No. 5 of 15</span>\n                 would be nothing left to be allowed as relief to the\n                petitioner thought all the findings may be in his\n                favour. In such cases the availability of a very strong\n                prima facie case of a standard much higher than just\n                prima facie case, the considerations of balance of\n                convenience and irreparable injury forcefully titling\n                the balance of case totally in favour of the applicant\n                may persuade the Court to grant an interim relief\n                through it amounts to granting the final relief itself. Of\n                course, such would be rare and exceptional cases.\n                The Court would grant such an interim relief only if\n                satisfied that withholding of it would prick the\n                conscience of the Court and do violence to the sese\n                of justice, resulting in injustice being perpetuated\n                throughout the hearing, and at the end the Court\n                would not be able to vindicate the cause of justice.\n                Obviously such would be rare cases accompanied\n                by compelling circumstances, where the injury\n                complained of is immediate and pressing and would\n                cause extreme hardship.

In affidavit filed by appellant\n             under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_17\">Order 19 Rule 1 CPC</a>, appellant has mentioned that\n             appellant purchased suit property on 26.06.2000 and prior to its\n             purchase, appellant was a tenant in suit property and using the\n             same since year 1991. Appellant has annexed copy of rent\n             receipt in this regard alongwith his affidavit.   Appellant has\n             further mentioned in the affidavit that father of respondent\n             received Rs.40,000/- from him as Pagrdi on 14.04.1992 with\n             regard to suit property and has filed receipt in this regard\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">MCA No. 09/13                                                        Page No. 9 of 15</span>\n            alongwith affidavit. Appellant has mentioned in the affidavit that\n           he purchased portable Genset on the same address on\n           19.07.1993 (copy of bill annexed). Appellant has further\n           mentioned that sales tax number has been allotted by sales tax\n           department w.e.f. 15.04.1994 (photocopy of Form ST-8 filed by\n           appellant with affidavit). During course of arguments, counsel for\n           appellant was inquired about purpose of filing of this affidavit by\n           appellant to which counsel for appellant submitted that the same\n           has been filed by appellant in order to show that appellant is in\n           possession of suit property since 1991 and that ventilator in the\n           suit property is existing since then. First of all, let me make it\n           clear that documents filed by appellant alongwith his affidavit are\n           not the documents which show any subsequent event. These\n           documents were very much in possession of appellant even at\n           the time when he filed suit. Appellant should have filed the same\n           alongwith suit. Further all these documents if taken into account\n           merely prima facie show that appellant might be in possession\n           of suit property since year 1992. All these documents do not\n           show that ventilator on common wall of suit property as well as\n           property of respondent existed since year 1992. Counsel for\n           appellant during course of arguments submitted that appellant is\n           claiming relief with regard to ventilator on the ground of\n           acquiring easementry rights by appellant for more than 20 years\n           with regard to air which appellant has been using from ventilator\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">MCA No. 09/13                                                       Page No. 10 of 15</span>\n            since last more than 20 years without interruption. Appellant in\n           para no. 2 of plaint filed by him before Ld. Trial Court has\n           mentioned that defendant/respondent is owner of property\n           bearing MCD No. 49 (Front side of the property) part of Khasra\n           No. 898/567 of Mauja Aliganj, Masjid Road, Jangpura, Bhogal,\n           New Delhi and has a common wall to the suit property of\n           plaintiff/appellant having a ventilator on it after death of his\n           father. As per pleadings of appellant himself in the plaint filed by\n           him, ventilator on the common wall was created/made after\n           death of father of defendant/respondent. As per pleadings of\n           appellant, appellant purchased suit property from father of\n           respondent on 26.06.2000 meaning thereby that father of\n           respondent was alive on 26.06.2000 and must have been\n           remained alive thereafter till his death. In any eventuality, as per\n           pleadings of appellant himself, ventilator was created/made on\n           common wall after death of father of defendant/respondent and\n           in these circumstances, it cannot be said at this stage that\n           appellant was/is using ventilator for air for last more than 20\n           years uninterruptedly. Further even if, this pleading of appellant\n           is ignored, appellant has not annexed any document which can\n           show that ventilator existed in the common wall of suit property\n           and property of respondent since 1991/92 i.e. for more than 20\n           years on basis of which he is claiming easementry right. Further\n           ventilator admittedly is on common wall of property of appellant\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">MCA No. 09/13                                                        Page No. 11 of 15</span>\n            and respondent meaning thereby that both appellant as well as\n           respondent may peep into property of each other.</span>           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95513255\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/95513255/\" id=\"a_18\">&#x27;Abk\n           Prasad Vs.

Appellant has referred to judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n             Court of India in case titled as &#x27;Deoraj Vs. State of\n             Maharashtra (Supra)&#x27;. No WS has been filed by respondent till\n             hearing of arguments of present appeal as apparent from TCR.\n             Though respondent during course of arguments did not admit\n             ownership of appellant with regard to suit property, still on the\n             basis of copy of sell deed filed by appellant, prima facie,\n             appellant appears to be owner of suit property. A person having\n             ownership of a property normally should have access to his\n             property at any time during course of the day. Any restriction on\n             his movement to enter into his property may in a given set of\n             circumstances amount to wrongful restraint. Counsel for\n             respondent    during   course    of   arguments    admitted     that\n             respondent puts a lock on gate from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am in the\n             morning. Respondent when inquired during course of arguments\n             regarding the same, respondent submitted that he locks the gate\n             for safety purpose as he alongwith his family resides on upper\n             portion of basement. It has not been disputed that the gate\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">MCA No. 09/13                                                         Page No. 13 of 15</span>\n            which is locked by respondent during night is only way to go to\n           suit property and there is no other way to go to suit property. To\n           my mind, Ld. Trial Court wrongly appreciated facts in this regard\n           and held that allowing the application would tantamount to\n           decreeing the suit at preliminary stage without trial of suit on\n           merits. Ld. Trial Court wrongly appreciated and observed that\n           no   exceptional    ground   has    been    shown    to   exist    by\n           plaintiff/appellant in his favour for granting main relief sought in\n           the suit at interim stage. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"160789\" id=\"span_18\">As per judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n           in <a href=\"/doc/160789/\" id=\"a_20\">Deoraj</a>&#x27;s Case (Supra), the availability of a very strong prima\n           facie case of a standard much higher than just prima facie case,\n           the considerations of balance of convenience and irreparable\n           injury forcefully tilting balance of case totally in favour of\n           applicant may persuade the Court to grant an interim relief\n           though it amounts to granting of final relief itself. Applying ratio\n           of this case to facts of present case, I am of the opinion that\n           appellant has prima facie shown ownership of suit property and\n           being owner of suit property, appellant has strong prima facie\n           right to enter into his property at any juncture of time. Balance\n           of convenience lies in favour of appellant as a person has every\n           right to enter into his property at any point of time. Irreparable\n           injury   shall   be caused to appellant        which cannot be\n           compensated in terms of money by restricting his movement to\n           enter into his property. Therefore I hold that order of Ld. Trial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">MCA No. 09/13                                                        Page No. 14 of 15</span>\n            Court to this relief sought by appellant is not sustainable in law\n           and is accordingly set aside. Exceptional circumstances have\n           been shown to exist in favour of appellant as movement of a\n           person to go into his property cannot be restricted by a private\n           person, State though in certain circumstances may curtail right\n           of movement of a person. Respondent / agent / servants /\n           employees or any one acting on behalf of respondent is\n           restrained from obstructing ingress and egress of appellant and\n           his family members/employees in suit property till disposal of\n           suit. Keeping in mind security aspect as agitated on behalf of\n           respondent, a solution to this problem may be respondent giving\n           a duplicate key of the lock of the gate to appellant. With these\n           observations, appeal filed by appellant is partly allowed and\n           partly dismissed.
