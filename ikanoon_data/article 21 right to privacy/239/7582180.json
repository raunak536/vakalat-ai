It would be pertinent to give          a brief conspectus of\n\nthe facts of the present case to decide the present\n\napplication. The plaintiff has filed the present suit for\n\npermanent        injunction     restraining   infringement         of   its\n\ntrademark/name, passing off, defamation, rendition of\n\naccounts, damages etc. against the defendants inter-alia on\n\nthe grounds            that the plaintiff is the   owner/exclusive\n\nlicencee of legendary brands including BATA, Marie Claire,\n\nHush Puppies, Scholl, North Star, Power, Bubblegummers,\n\nComfit, Koolkids, Sparx etc., and the said trademark and\n\nlogo BATA is registered in the name of the plaintiff since\n\n14th April, 1969, the same being valid and subsisting up to\n\n2014. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is a\n\nglobally renowned trade name             in the footwear products\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                Page 2 of 66</span>\n and the plaintiff enjoys high reputation for its honest and\n\nprincipled conduct, quality and reliability of their products.\n\nThe     plaintiff      claims    that   its   retail   outlets        serve\n\napproximately 1 million customers per day and the plaintiff\n\noperates around 1200 retail stores and provides direct and\n\nindirect employment to thousands of people in India. The\n\nplaintiff also claims to be the recipient of various national\n\nand international awards. The main grievance of the\n\nplaintiff against the defendants is for the alleged offending\n\nsong       &quot;Mehngai&quot;            in   their    forthcoming             movie\n\n&quot;Chakravyuh&quot;. As per the plaintiff, the said song is being\n\nused to promote the film Chakravyuh on YouTube and the\n\nsaid movie is likely to be released in various cinemas very\n\nshortly. As per the plaintiff, the following lyrics in the said\n\nsong are offending so as             to cause serious harm to the\n\nreputation and goodwill of the plaintiff:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">              &quot;Birla Ho Ya Tata Ambani Ho Ya Bata,\n              Apne Apne Chakar Mein Desh Ko Hai Kata\n              Birla Ho Ya Tata Ambani Ho Ya Bata\n              Apne Apne Chakar Mein Desh Ko Hai Kata&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                   Page 3 of 66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">               Are humre hi khoon se inka engine chale\n              dhakadhak, Aam admi ki jeb ho gai hai safa\n              chat, aam aadmi ki jeb ho gai safachat.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">3.     As per the plaintiff‟ the lyrics used in the said song\n\nare per se defamatory and the transmission of the same\n\neither through promos or in the film or through CDs etc by\n\nthe defendants for their own commercial and profitable\n\nmotives     will disparage     and    dilute   the    goodwill and\n\nreputation of the plaintiff amongst the common people. The\n\nplaintiff has also averred that under the pretext of\n\ncondemning corruption, the defendants have publically\n\ncondemned the plaintiff in order to generate public hatred\n\nand contempt towards the plaintiff, purely for the sake of\n\nprofit,   with no other intention and without there                 being\n\nany foundation or basis for the same. Based on these facts,\n\nthe plaintiff has claimed        the grant of an ad interim\n\ninjunction to restrain the defendants,          their employees,\n\nservants,      agents,   etc   from     releasing,      distributing,\n\nexhibiting, performing or communicating to the public by\n\nany means or technology including but                not limited to\n\nmaking available on the internet the words or any aural or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                 Page 4 of 66</span>\n audiovisual performance of the song &quot;Mehngai&quot; which\n\nwould have the effect of defaming the plaintiff                       or\n\ndamaging its reputation and goodwill amongst the public at\n\nlarge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.       Arguing       the    stay application, Mr. Neeraj K. Kaul,\n\nlearned       Senior Advocate appearing for the                 plaintiff\n\nsubmitted        that        the particular lines   in the   offending\n\nsong are per se defamatory              in nature, disparaging       the\n\nlong established reputation             of the plaintiff,    which     is\n\nrenowned in the global market catering to the needs of\n\nboth poor and the rich for the last more than 100 years.\n\nThe counsel also submitted that the plaintiff has a\n\nproprietary right over the trademark and logo „BATA‟ and\n\nthe same is registered since 1969.                  Counsel further\n\nsubmitted that the plaintiff is suffering and stands to suffer\n\nirreparable and unquantifiable loss since the plaintiff‟s\n\nentire business depends upon                its     good name and\n\nreputation in the market. The counsel also contended that\n\nthe goodwill that the plaintiff enjoys both in India and\n\nabroad has been built up by              over eighty years of hard\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                  Page 5 of 66</span>\n work, and the same would be irreparably damaged if the\n\ndefendants are allowed to use the said trade name in the\n\nsaid song in their upcoming movie.          The counsel further\n\nsubmitted that the fundamental right of freedom of\n\nexpression cannot be abused to malign the reputation of\n\nany person/company and the prime duty of the Court is to\n\nbalance      and       harmonize   the two and then decide in a\n\ngiven case whether          the freedom of expression has been\n\ntransgressed or not. Counsel further         submitted that the\n\nplaintiff has no quarrel with so far the raising of social\n\nand political      issues by the defendants in the movie or in\n\nthe song raising voice against the price rise and other ills\n\nplaguing the society is concerned,          but certainly,        they\n\nhave      no right to calumniate         the reputation         of the\n\nplaintiff,      without there being        any    factual basis.\n\nCounsel further submitted that there is a direct imputation\n\nby the defendants in the said offending song and it is not a\n\ncase where something has to be inferred which could have\n\nthe effect of tarnishing one‟s reputation. The counsel also\n\nstated that the lines that include the plaintiff‟s trade name\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                             Page 6 of 66</span>\n are    the    centerpiece       of    the   song,   repeatedly         laying\n\nemphasis on the plaintiff‟s trade name, recklessly boasting\n\nand disparaging the reputation that the plaintiff has earned\n\nover the years. The counsel further submitted that literally\n\ntranslating the said lines it raises allegations like                    the\n\nplaintiff    being in pursuit of profits, has           carved up the\n\nnation and it is the blood of the general public at large that\n\njaunts their engines and the common man‟s pocket is\n\ncleared out bare just to make the life of the plaintiff\n\nendurable,        which    is        completely     manipulative         and\n\nobnoxious.       The learned          counsel     submitted that         the\n\ndefendants        have    the absolute right to           project their\n\nCinematographic skills through critical comments on the\n\nsociety      or even using a satire         on the social and political\n\nsystem with            analytical overtones but         certainly        the\n\ndefendants cannot be said to have any right to trample\n\nand wantonly denigrate the reputation                  of the plaintiff.\n\nThe counsel submitted that it is a totally irresponsible and\n\ndishonest act on the part of the defendants and the same\n\nappears to be          done out of malice as the defendants\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                    Page 7 of 66</span>\n have used derogatory expressions in the said song to the\n\nextent     of suggesting        that   the plaintiff     is one of the\n\nblood suckers          of the people and has looted the nation;\n\nwhich expression is derogatory on the very                    face of it.\n\nThe counsel thus stated that there is no public or societal\n\ninterest involved, therefore to use such nasty expressions\n\nin the said song, that too at the cost of reputation of the\n\nplaintiff is against moral and legal ethics.             Counsel also\n\nsubmitted that in the facts of such like case, the court can\n\nalways restrain        the defendants       from   further displaying\n\nor viewing the said song as the defendants cannot be\n\nheard to      say that      the grant of damages         would afford\n\nadequate relief         to the plaintiff. Counsel also submitted\n\nthat     the expressions used in the said song cannot be\n\nmerely       referred      to    as    an irksome or unreasonable\n\ncomment which is common                and can be ignored but the\n\nsame are per se defamatory             and cannot be bulwarked on\n\nthe touchstone of right of the defendants to freedom of\n\nexpression. Counsel further submitted that under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_2\">Article\n\n19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India, the right of freedom of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                   Page 8 of 66</span>\n expression cannot be abused to the extent of defaming and\n\ndisparaging       the   reputation      of   others.     Counsel       also\n\nsubmitted that the canvas of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution\n\nis wide open for the defendants to express their creativity\n\nbut one cannot use that freedom for maligning the\n\nreputation of others.       In support of his arguments, counsel\n\nfor the plaintiff placed reliance on the definition                      of\n\ndefamatory        statement given in „Salmond and Heuston‟\n\non the Law of torts, Twentieth Edition, which states\n\nas under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot; A defamatory statement is one, which has a\n        tendency to injure the reputation of the person\n        to whom it refers; which tends, that is to say,\n        to lower him in the estimation of right- thinking\n        members of the society generally and in\n        particular to cause him to be regarded with\n        feelings of hatred, contempt, ridicule, fear,\n        dislike, or disesteem. The statement is judged\n        by the standard of an ordinary, right- thinking\n        member of society. Hence the test is an\n        objective one, and it is no defense to say that\n        the statement was not intended to be\n        defamatory, or uttered by way of a joke. A\n        tendency to injure or lower the reputation of\n        the plaintiff suffices, for if words are used which\n        impute discreditable conduct of my friend, he\n        has been defamed to me, although I do not\n        believe the imputation, and may even know\n        that it is untrue. Hence, it is settled that a\n        statement may be defamatory although no one\n        to whom it is published believes it to be true.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                    Page 9 of 66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"> The counsel for the plaintiff also placed reliance on\n\nHalsbury‟s Laws of England, Fourth                       Edition, Vol. 28\n\nwhich also defines the defamatory statement as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        &quot; A defamatory statement is a statement which\n        tends to lower a person in the estimation of right\n        thinking members of the society generally or to\n        cause him to be shunned or avoided or to expose\n        him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to convey an\n        imputation on him disparaging or injurious to him in\n        his office, profession, calling , trade or business.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">To further define defamation, the counsel for the plaintiff\n\nplaced reliance on the Fifth Edition of Carter Ruck on\n\nLibel and Slander           wherein the defamatory is defined as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        &quot; (1) a statement concerning any person which\n        exposes him to hatred, ridicule, or contempt or\n        which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or\n        which has a tendency to injure him in his office,\n        professional or trade.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        (2) A false statement about a man to his discredit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        (3) Would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the\n        estimation of right thinking members of society\n        generally.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.

Mr. Sandeep Sethi, the learned Senior Advocate\n\nappearing        for defendant nos. 1 to 3 vehemently refuted\n\nthe contentions raised by the learned Senior counsel for\n\nthe    plaintiff.The      learned     counsel      submitted      that    the\n\nplaintiff has not placed the correct facts before this court\n\nwith mala fide designs for the purpose of obtaining ex-\n\nparte interim injunction against the defendants. The\n\nlearned counsel further submitted that revising committee\n\nof the Central Board of Film Certificate(CBFC) vide order\n\ndated     1.10.2012        has       duly    certified    the    said     film\n\n&quot;Chakravyuh&quot; in            which the        alleged      song     has been\n\nsung      for          public exhibition. The counsel                further\n\nsubmitted that           the promos of the said film were duly\n\ncertified     by       the CBFC vide order dated            5.7.2012 and\n\nsince then the promos of the film, as well as, of the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                      Page 11 of 66</span>\n song are being displayed on „YouTube‟ and other media\n\nsites. The counsel also submitted that earlier the CBFC\n\nhad     not approved displaying and picturisation             of the\n\nsaid song referring to the names of the industrial houses\n\nat the first instance, but the Revising Committee of the\n\nCBFC after giving due consideration          to the explanation\n\nadvanced by the defendant no.2 and after the defendant\n\nno.2 having agreed to put a disclaimer, has permitted the\n\nrelease     of the same for the public.       The counsel thus\n\nsubmitted that with         „disclaimer‟ being added, now          the\n\nplaintiff     cannot take a plea that the reference to their\n\nname in the song          is disparaging their reputation. The\n\ncounsel also submitted that reference to these industrial\n\nhouses        in the said song        is only illustrative and\n\ndenominative and not with a view to          harm or disparage\n\nthe reputation         of the plaintiff.   The    counsel         also\n\nsubmitted that         this court   has to examine      the entire\n\ncontext       in which the          said   song       has         been\n\nconceptualized as the ire of the Maoists,         who are shown\n\nto have raised         their voice against the capitalists        and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                              Page 12 of 66</span>\n industrial houses for their ongoing sufferings. Advancing\n\nthe arguments further counsel laid emphasis on the\n\ncontention that the usage of the names of industrial houses\n\nin the song is only symbolic            but otherwise the same are\n\nneither defamatory nor can be treated as any kind of\n\ninfringement           of trade mark of the plaintiff. The counsel\n\nfurther submitted           that the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_7\">Cinematographic Act</a>            is a\n\ncomplete Code in itself and referring to <a href=\"/doc/1770445/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1098494/\" id=\"a_9\">4</a> , <a href=\"/doc/1120161/\" id=\"a_10\">5A</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/441329/\" id=\"a_11\">5B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_12\">6</a> of the said Act, counsel submitted that the CBFC\n\ncomprises of           experts who have given certification not\n\nonly after viewing the film but after having gone through\n\neach and every aspect of the film including the lyrics of\n\nthe song in question. The            counsel further submitted that\n\nthe matter was also examined by the revising committee\n\nof the     Board and        it is    only after the decision of the\n\nrevising committee, that the necessary certification of the\n\nfilm and      the promos       of the film     were given a green\n\nsignal. Counsel also submitted that even otherwise, there is\n\na specific remedy          provided under      <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 6</a> of the Act\n\nwhich remedy has not                been exhausted by the plaintiff\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                Page 13 of 66</span>\n and     the remedy of the plaintiff    to file a civil suit is\n\nclearly barred. Counsel further submitted that the lines\n\nin the song were actually sung by Jan Natya Mandli of\n\ntribal and street performances and the same              actually\n\nreflected the feelings of the Maoists and accordingly the\n\nsame     have been manifested       as a result   thereof. The\n\ncounsel further submitted that     even   earlier in the year\n\n1978, the same kind of expressions were used in a movie\n\ncalled „Hiralal Pannalal‟, but the plaintiff never raised any\n\nsuch objections against the         said song. The learned\n\ncounsel thus submitted that it is not for the first time that a\n\nreference is being made to the leading industrial houses\n\nby the film makers, as     earlier also the same names were\n\nused in the said movie symbolically.       The counsel         also\n\nplaced reliance on <a href=\"/doc/441329/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 5 B </a>of Cinematographic Act,\n\n1952 to support his argument, that the certification           to a\n\nfilm is granted by the Board after they are satisfied that\n\nthe film is suitable for public exploitation and wherever\n\nthe Board finds that the exhibition of the film or any part\n\nthereof     is against   the interests of the sovereignty and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                           Page 14 of 66</span>\n the integrity          of India, the security of State, friendly\n\nrelations with foreign states,            public order,   decency      or\n\nmorality or the same involves defamation or contempt of\n\ncourt or, is likely        to   incite      the commission       of any\n\noffence, then the film          will be    denied   certification      for\n\npublic exhibition. The learned counsel for the defendants\n\nfurther argued          that the parameters         envisaged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/441329/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5B</a>        are     in para-materia to the restrictions laid\n\ndown under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. The\n\ncounsel thus urged that after the said Board has gone\n\ninto the issue of alleged defamation of the plaintiff in the\n\nsaid song then this court will not sit in           appeal to review\n\nthe decision of an expert body.             Counsel   also submitted\n\nthat in any case the plaintiff has not approached                     the\n\nCentral       Government              under <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_17\">Section          6</a> of the\n\nCinematographic Act 1952            against the alleged offending\n\nand defamatory lyrics           in the said song. The counsel also\n\nsubmitted that the remedy of revision is available to any\n\nindividual/institution       if aggrieved by the decision of the\n\nsaid Board or its revising authority. The counsel                     also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                  Page 15 of 66</span>\n submitted that           the plaintiff     has not challenged          the\n\ncertification      of the     Board       in the present        suit and\n\ntherefore also the plaintiff is not entitled to the grant of\n\nany relief.            The learned Senior Advocate also invited\n\nattention     of this court to the guideline (XVIII) in the said\n\nAct in support of his argument that before granting\n\ncertification the Central Board of Film Certification has\n\nfully   gone into the         issue of examining       whether         the\n\nvisuals     or words used         in the     movie or     in any song\n\ntherein involves defamation of an individual or a body of\n\nindividuals, or contempt of              court   and   once the Board\n\nhas     gone into         all these aspects and finds           no such\n\ndefamatory       material     in the     movie or in the song, then\n\nthe views      of such expert body cannot be brushed aside.\n\nThe counsel        also argued     that the defendants         have not\n\ntravelled beyond          the freedom available to them under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India and in exercise of\n\nthe     right of       „freedom of expression‟ in a democratic\n\nsociety such a precious right of the defendants               cannot be\n\nsnatched      away       by the grant of pre-emptory         injunction.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                   Page 16 of 66</span>\n The counsel further submitted that the large parts of the\n\ncountry are infested with the activities of the Maoists and\n\nthrough the said film, the defendants have demonstrated\n\nand displayed the views               of the Maoists and also          the\n\nmiseries of the common man and such a debate cannot be\n\nstultified    and      rather   the    same   is   required       to   be\n\nencouraged. The counsel further argued that                at best the\n\nremedy available to the plaintiff is to maintain a suit for\n\ndefamation and not to seek a pre-emptory injunction.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">7.     The learned counsel further submitted that the said\n\nfilm raises certain social issues          laying more emphasis as\n\nto how the industrial class and the political system as a\n\nwhole have failed         the downtrodden and the impoverished\n\nclass. The        counsel further submitted that the film is\n\npresenting two competing views, and one of the views, is\n\nof the       protagonists       amongst     the Maoists       who      are\n\nsinging the said song and expressing their anger                against\n\nthe price rise and the way they have been exploited                    by\n\nthe business houses. Counsel thus             submitted, that it is in\n\nthis context in which the song has been conceptualized\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                  Page 17 of 66</span>\n and picturized         which would matter and not merely the\n\nlyrics alone.      The counsel also submitted that prior to the\n\nfiling of the present       suit, the plaintiff did not issue any\n\nnotice to the defendants although the promos of the said\n\nmovie were certified as long back as on 7.9.2012.                       In\n\nsupport of his arguments, counsel for the defendants\n\nplaced reliance on the following judgments:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_21\">1. <a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_19\">Khushwant Singh V.

Counsel further submitted that ordinarily                the\n\ncourts may not grant pre-emptory              injunction,    but when\n\nex-facie there is something disparaging, then injunction is\n\nthe only efficacious remedy,         like in Shilpa Shetty‟s case\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                  Page 19 of 66</span>\n (Supra),      wherein the injunction was granted and the\n\ndefendants        were   restrained     from   publishing        any\n\ndefamatory material.

Since times immemorial, the Indian cinema has not\n\nonly been a source of entertainment but has also been\n\nresponsible for bringing to the fore various political, socio-\n\neconomic issues. Movies play a very significant role in\n\nthe life of a common man and any issue based movie leaves\n\na great impact on the minds of the viewers and influences\n\ntheir mind set and attitude.          Films have the capacity to\n\ngalvanize a human mind, as the human psyche                       is\n\nvulnerable and due to being star struck the mind of a\n\ncommon man germinates with the ideas shown in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                             Page 20 of 66</span>\n movies. How the movies motivate our thoughts and actions\n\nwas elucidated         in <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_24\">S. Rangarajan vs P. Jagjivan Ram</a>,\n\n1989 SCC (2) 574 in the following words:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">             &quot;10. Movie doubtless enjoys the guaranty under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> but there is one significant\n             difference between the movie and other modes of\n             communication. The movie cannot function in a free\n             market place like the newspaper, magazine or\n             advertisement. Movie motivates thought and action\n             and assures a high degree of attention and\n             retention. It makes its impact simultaneously\n             arousing the visual and aural senses. The focusing\n             of an intense light on a screen with the dramatizing\n             of facts and opinion makes the ideas more effective.\n             The combination of act and speech, sight and sound\n             in semi-darkness of the theatre with elimination of\n             all distracting ideas will have an impact in the minds\n             of spectators. In some cases, it will have a complete\n             and immediate influence on, and appeal for\n             everyone who sees it. In view of the scientific\n             improvements in photography and production the\n             present      movie    is    a  powerful    means    of\n             communication. It is said: &quot;as an instrument of\n             education it has unusual power to impart\n             information, to influence specific attitudes towards\n             objects of social value, to affect emotions either in\n             gross or in microscopic proportions, to affect health\n             in a minor degree through sleep disturbance, and to\n             affect profoundly the patterns of conduct of\n             children.&quot; (See Reader in Public Opinion and\n             Communication Second Edition by Bernard Betelson\n             and Morris Janowitz p. 390). The authors of this\n             Book have demonstrated (at 391 to 401) by\n             scientific tests the potential of the motion pictures\n             in formation of opinion by spectators and also on\n             their attitudes. These tests have also shown that\n             the effect of motion pictures is cumulative. It is\n             proved that even though one movie relating to a\n             social issue may not significantly affect the attitude\n             of an individual or group, continual exposure to\n             films of a similar character will produce a change. It\n             can, therefore, be said that the movie has unique\n             capacity to disturb and arouse feelings. It has as\n             much potential for evil as it has for good. It has an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                       Page 21 of 66</span>\n              equal potential to instil or cultivate violent or good\n             behaviour. With these qualities and since it caters\n             for mass audience who are generally not selective\n             about what they watch, the movie cannot be\n             equated with other modes of communication. It\n             cannot be allowed to function in a free market place\n             just as does the newspapers or magazines.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">             Censorship by prior restraint is, therefore, not only\n             desirable but also necessary.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">The plaintiff has filed the present suit against the\n\ndefendants        for       permanent       injunction         to     restrain\n\ninfringement           of   trademark,     passing      off,    defamation,\n\nrendition of accounts, damages etc. This suit was taken up\n\nby this Court on 4th October, 2012 and as the plaintiff had\n\nfiled an application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_26\">Order 6 Rule 17 CPC</a>, to seek\n\namendment of the plaint which was not yet listed before\n\nthe Court, on the request of the counsel for the plaintiff,\n\nthe matter was accordingly adjourned for 5th October,\n\n2012.

The court also explained the\n\ndefenses of truth, fair comment and privilege available in a\n\nsuit for defamation as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        &quot;95. Traditional defenses to an action for defamation have now\n        become fairly crystallized and can be compartmentalized in 3\n        compartments : truth, fair comment and privilege. Truth, or\n        justification, is a complete defense. The standard of proof of\n        truth is not absolute but is limited to establishing that what was\n        spoken was &#x27;substantially correct&#x27;. Fair comment offers\n        protection for the expression of opinions. Standard of proof is\n        not that the Court has to agree with the opinion, but is limited\n        to determine whether the views could honestly have been held\n        by a fair-minded person on facts known at the time. Unlike\n        defense of truth, defense based on fair comment can be\n        defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defamer acted with\n        malice. Similar is the situation where the defense is of qualified\n        privilege. Privilege is designed to protect expression made for\n        the public good. Protection of qualified privilege is lost if actual\n        malice is established. In public interest, absolute privilege is a\n        complete defense. Rationale of absolute privilege being\n        restricted to Court proceedings or proceedings before Tribunals\n        which have all the trappings of a Civil Court and Parliamentary\n        proceedings is that if threat of defamation suits loom large over\n        the heads of lawyers, litigants, witnesses, Judges and\n        Parliamentarians it would prohibit them from speaking freely\n        and public interest would suffer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">15.

We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the\n       above discussion:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">       (1)The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\n       guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21.</a> It is a\n       &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to safeguard the\n       privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood,\n       child-bearing and education among other matters. None can\n       publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent\n       whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If\n       he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person\n       concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position\n       may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself\n       into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                       Page 31 of 66</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">        (2)The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n       publication     concerning      the    aforesaid     aspects    becomes\n       unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records\n       including court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\n       becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n       subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press\n       and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in\n       the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(2)</a> an exception must be carved\n       out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\n       kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\n       to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\n       press/media. (3)There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\n       above - indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In\n       the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n       matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available\n       with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of\n       their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based\n       upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the official\n       establishes that the publication was made (by the defendant) with\n       reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for\n       the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he\n       acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary\n       for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where\n       the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n       personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and\n       would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters\n       not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys\n       the same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and\n       (2) above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected\n       by the power to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and\n       legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_41\">Articles 105</a> and\n       <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_42\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions\n       to this rule.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">       (4)So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and\n       institutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they\n       cannot maintain a suit for damages for defaming them.\n\n       (5)Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_43\">Official Secrets Act,\n       1923</a>, or any similar enactment or provision having the force of law\n       does not bind the press or media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">        (6)There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit,\n       or to impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1719619\" id=\"span_46\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1719619/\" id=\"a_44\">K.A.

The court also took\n\na view that the censorship is prevalent                 the world over\n\nin some form or the other and pre censorship also plays a\n\npart where the motion pictures are involved, shows the\n\ndesirability of censorship in this field. The court further\n\ntook a view that the treatment of motion pictures must be\n\ndifferent from that of other form of art and expression as\n\na person reading a book or other writing or hearing a\n\nspeech or viewing a painting or sculpture is not so deeply\n\nstirred as by seeing the motion picture.                    It would be\n\nworthwhile to reproduce the relevant paras of the same as\n\nunder:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           &quot;19. The first question is whether the films need censorship\n           at all&#x27; Pre-censorship is but an aspect of censorship and\n           bears the same relationship in quality to the material as\n           censorship after the motion picture has had a run. The only\n           difference is one of the stage at which the State interposes\n           its regulations between the individual and his freedom.\n           Beyond this there is no vital difference. That censorship is\n           prevalent all the world over in some form or other and pre-\n           censorship also plays a part where motion pictures are\n           involved, shows the desirability of censorship in this field.\n           The Khosla Committee has given a description generally of\n           the regulations for censorship (including pre- censorship)\n           obtaining in other countries and Hunning&#x27;s book deals with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                     Page 33 of 66</span>\n            these topics in detail separately for each country. The\n           method changes, the rules &#x27;are different and censorship is\n           more strict in some Dlaces than in others, but censorship is\n           universal. Indeed the petitioner himself pronounced strongly\n           in favour of it in a paper entitled &#x27;Creative Expression&#x27; written\n           by him. This is what he said: &quot;But even if we believe that a\n           novelist or a painter or a musician should be free to write,\n           paint and compose music without the interference of the\n           State machinery, I doubt if anyone will advocate the same\n           freedom to be extended to the commercial exploitation of a\n           powerful medium of expression and entertainment like the\n           cinema. One can imagine the results if an unbridled\n           commerical cinema is allowed to cater to the lowest common\n           denominator of popular taste, specially in a country which,\n           after two centuries of political and cultural domination, is still\n           suffering from a confusion and debasement of cultural\n           values.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           Freedom of expression cannot, and should not, be\n           interpreted as a licence for the cinemagnates to make money\n           by pandering to, and thereby propagating, shoddy and vulgar\n           taste&#x27;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           20. Further it has been almost universally recognised that\n           the treatment of motion pictures must be different from that\n           of other forms of art and expression. This arises from the\n           instant appeal of the motion picture, its versatility, realism\n           (often surrealism), and its coordination of the visual and\n           aural senses. The art of the cameraman, with trick\n           photography,        vistavision    and    three    dimensional\n           representation thrown in, _ has made the cinema picture\n           more true to life than even the theatre or indeed any other\n           form of representative art. The motion picture is able to stir\n           up emotions more deeply than any other product of art. Its\n           effect particularly on children and adolescents is very great\n           since their immaturity makes them more willingly suspend\n           their disbelief than mature men and women. They also\n           remember the action in the picture and try to emulate or\n           imitate what they have seen. Therefore, classification of films\n           into two categories of &#x27;U&#x27; films and &#x27;A&#x27; films is a reasonable\n           classification. It is also for this reason that motion picture\n           must be regarded differently from other forms of speech and\n           expression. A person reading a book or other writing or\n           hearing a speech or viewing a painting or sculpture is not so\n           deeply stirred as by seeing a motion picture. Therefore the\n           treatment of the latter on a different footing is also a valid\n           classification.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                         Page 34 of 66</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">            41.

Abbas v. The Union of\n           India</a>, [1971] 2 SCR 446 wherein Chief Justice Hidayatullah\n           exhaustively dealt with the question of prior restraint in the\n           context of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/237570/\" id=\"a_49\">Constitution and the Act</a>. The\n           learned Chief Justice after setting out the various provisions\n           to which we have already adverted posed the questions;\n           `How far can these restrictions go and how are these to be\n           imposed&#x27;? The documentary film ` A tale of four cities&#x27; made\n           by K.A. Abbas portrayed the contrast between the luxuious\n           life of the rich and the squalor and poverty of the poor in the\n           four principal cities of the country and included therein shots\n           from the red light district of Bombay showing scantily\n           dressed women soliciting customers by standing near the\n           doors and windows. The Board of Film Censors granted `A&#x27;\n           certificate to the film and refused the `U&#x27; certificate sought\n           by Abbas. This was on the ground that the film dealt with\n           relations between sexes in such a manner as to depict\n           immoral traffic in women and because the film contained\n           incidents unsuitable for young persons. Abbas challenged the\n           Board&#x27;s decision on the ground (i) that pre-censorship cannot\n           be tolerated as it was in violation of the freedom of speech\n           and expression and (ii) even if it is considered legitimate it\n           must be exercised on well-defined principles leaving no room\n           for arbitrary decisions. This Court held that censorship in\n           Indian had full justification in the field of exhibition of films\n           since it was in the interest of society and if the legitimate\n           power in abused it can be struck down. While dealing with\n           the grounds on which the `U&#x27; certificate was refused, the\n           learned Chief Justice observed: &quot;The task of the censor is\n           extremely delicate and his duties cannot be the subject of an\n           exhaustive set of commands established by prior\n           ratiocination. But direction is necessary of him so that he\n           does not sweep within the terms of the directions vast areas\n           of thought, speech and expression of artistic quality and\n           social purpose and interest.

The standards that we set for our censors must\n           make a substantial allowance in favour of freedom thus\n           leaving a vast area for creative art to interpret life and\n           society with some of its foibles along with what is good.

This Court after referring to the observations of\n           Hidayatullah, CJ. in K.A. Abbas proceeded to state as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">           &quot;It is no doubt true that the motion picture is a powerful\n           instrument with a much stronger impact on the visual and\n           aural sense of the spectators than any other medium of\n           communication; likewise, it is also true that the television,\n           the range of which has vastly developed in our country in the\n           past few years, now reaches out to the remotest corners of\n           the country catering to the not so sophisticated, literary or\n           educated masses of people living in distant villages. But the\n           argument overlooks that the potency of the motion picture is\n           as much for good as for evil. If some scenes of violence,\n           some nuances of expression or some events in the film can\n           stir up certain feelings in the spectator, an equally deep\n           strong, lasting and beneficial impression can be conveyed by\n           scenes revealing the machinations of selfish interest, scenes\n           depicting mutual respect and tolerance, scenes showing\n           comradeship, help and kindness which transcend the barriers\n           of religion. Unfortunately, modern developments both in the\n           field of cinema as well as in the field of national and\n           international politics have rendered it inevitable for peopleto\n           face realities of internecine conflicts, inter alia, in the name\n           of religion. Even contemporary news bulletins very often\n           carry scenes of pitched battle or violence. What is necessary\n           sometimes is to penetrate behind the scenes and analyse the\n           causes of such conflicts.

It is possible only for a\n           motion picture to convey such a message in depth and if it is\n           able to do this, it will be an achievement of great social\n           value.&quot; This Court upheld the finding of the Bombay high\n           Court that the serial viewed in its entirety is capable of\n           creating a lasting impression of this massage of peace and\n           co-existence and there is no fear of the people being\n           obsessed, overwhelmed or carried away by scenes of\n           violence of fanaticism shown in the film.&#x27;\n\n           Every right has a corresponding duty or obligation and so has\n           the fundamental right of speech and expression.

A citizen who exercises this right must remain\n           conscious that his fellow citizen too has a similar right.\n           Therefore, the right must be so exercised as not to come to\n           direct conflict with the right of another citizen.

Freedom of expression is one of the most cherished\n          values of a free democratic society. It is indispensable to\n          the operation of a democratic society whose basic postulate\n          is that the government shall be based on the consent of the\n          governed. But, such a consent implies not only that the\n          consent shall be free but also that it shall be grounded on\n          adequate information, discussion and aided by the widest\n          possible dissemination of information and opinions from\n          diverse and antagonistic sources. Freedom of expression\n          which includes freedom of the press has a capacious content\n          and is not restricted to expression of thoughts and ideas\n          which are accepted and acceptable but also to those which\n          offend or shock any section of the population. It also\n          includes the right to receive information and ideas of all\n          kinds from different sources. In essence, the freedom of\n          expression embodies the right to know. However, under our\n          Constitution no right in Part III is absolute. Freedom of\n          expression is not an absolute value under our Constitution.\n          It must not be forgotten that no single value, no matter\n          exalted, can bear the full burden of upholding a democratic\n          system of government. Underlying our Constitutional\n          system are a number of important values, all of which help\n          to guarantee our liberties, but in ways which sometimes\n          conflict. Under our Constitution, probably, no values are\n          absolute. All important values, therefore, must be qualified\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                      Page 39 of 66</span>\n           and balanced against, other important, and often\n          competing, values. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_56\">This process of definition, qualification\n          and balancing is as much required with respect to the value\n          of freedom of expression as it is for other values.\n          Consequently, free speech, in appropriate cases, has got to\n          correlate with fair trial. It also follows that in appropriate\n          case one right [say freedom of expression] may have to\n          yield to the other right like right to a fair trial.

The fundamental right enshrined in the\n            Constitution itself being made subject to reasonable\n            restrictions, the laws so enacted to specify certain\n            restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and\n            expression have to be construed meaningfully and with\n            the constitutional object in mind. For instance, the\n            right to freedom of speech and expression is not\n            violated by a law which requires that name of the\n            printer and publisher and the place of printing and\n            publication should be printed legibly on every book or\n            paper.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">            10. Thus, there is a marked distinction in the language\n            of law, its possible interpretation and application under\n            the Indian and the US laws. It is significant to note\n            that the freedom of speech is the bulwark of\n            democratic Government. This freedom is essential for\n            proper functioning of the democratic process. The\n            freedom of speech and expression is regarded as the\n            first condition of liberty. It occupies a preferred\n            position in the hierarchy of liberties, giving succour\n            and protection to all other liberties. It has been truly\n            said that it is the mother of all other liberties. Freedom\n            of speech plays a crucial role in the formation of public\n            opinion on social, political and economic matters. It\n            has been described as human right natural right and\n            the like. With the development of law in India, the\n            right to freedom of speech and expression has taken\n            within its ambit the right to receive information as well\n            as the right of press.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                        Page 44 of 66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"945336\" id=\"span_67\">21.    In    common       law,     an    injunction     against         the\n\napprehended legal wrong              is known    as     „quia         timet\n\n‟injunction, the purpose of             which   is to prevent an\n\napprehended legal wrong. Undoubtedly, the power to grant\n\nsuch an injunction can be exercised only in a case where\n\nthe party approaching the Court strongly makes out a case\n\nfor the grant of an injunction to prevent irreparable and\n\nserious injury to his rights.

The Appellate Court itself has found that\n       publishing a defamatory matter gives remedy of two\n       types, one is criminal prosecution for defamation and the\n       other, suit for damages. In my opinion, <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 19</a>,\n       Constitution of India does not give a free hand under the\n       guise of free expression and freedom of press a right to go\n       on publishing defamatory matter, which is a criminal Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1179987\" id=\"span_69\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1179987/\" id=\"a_80\">K.V.

In Shilpa S.Shetty‟s Case (supra) the defendants\n\ntherein were restrained from publishing the articles which\n\nwere about the personal life of the actor which called her\n\nnames and were regarded as per se defamatory. The\n\nrelevant paras of the same are reproduced as under:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">        &quot;7. I have heard both the learned Counsel at length and\n        considered the submissions canvassed by them. No doubt,\n        it is true that the plaintiff did write her article or gave\n        interview first against another actor and. therefore, the\n        journal cannot be criticized for printing the reaction of the\n        concerned actor to her interview. The question is whether\n        the defendants were entitled to write anything thereafter\n        particularly about her personal life as to whether she was\n        having a relationship with a third actor or whether she\n        was having a relationship with a married man and then to\n        call her a &#x27;maniser&#x27; in the manner in which men are called\n        &#x27;womanisers&#x27;. The answer will have to be in the negative.\n        The articles are not on plaintiff performance as an artist\n        and cannot be defended as a part of film journalism on\n        that count also. The articles bring down the reputation of\n        the plaintiff and have the impact on her personal life and\n        show her in an undesirable manner to the world at large.\n        The authority relied upon by Mr. Tulzapurkar in the case\n        of Woodward v. Hutchins (supra) is in a situation where a\n        Pop Group itself had appointed a Public Relation Officer\n        and that officer has subsequently gone to the Press and\n        printed the articles. It is in that context that the House of\n        Lord has observed that &quot;In these cases of confidential\n        information it is a question of balancing the public interest\n        in maintaining the confidence against the public interest in\n        knowing the truth&quot; and then it is observed that &quot;The\n        reason is because the interest of the public in knowing the\n        truth outweights the interest of a plaintiff in maintaining\n        his reputation&quot; and further that &quot;These Courts rarely, if\n        ever, grant an injunction when a defendant says he is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                        Page 49 of 66</span>\n          going to Justify.&quot; In the present case, the plaintiff having\n         given an interview herself, she exposed herself to reaction\n         by the concerned actor. To that limited extent the\n         submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar is right and the plaintiff\n         cannot make a grievance on that. Question is whether\n         some others like the defendants, who are third parties,\n         have a right to write further articles and dwell upon the\n         private life of the plaintiff and as to whether she has\n         relationship with some others including another married\n         man. Here again, what one has to see is whether it is in\n         public interest in the sense that whether it is the interest\n         of society that such articles ought to be printed about the\n         private life. The answer will have to be in the negative.\n         The three articles are per-se defamatory as claimed by\n         the plaintiff and the defendants cannot be permitted to go\n         ahead to print any further articles of the like nature.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_75\">8. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that the prayer made in the\n         present Motion is a wide one and it will have to be\n         curtailed. The submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar in this behalf\n         is well taken, but at the same time, the tenor of the\n         articles has to be seen, what is indicated in those articles\n         has to he noted and it cannot be ignored that the prayer\n         has been sought in that context. The injunction sought by\n         the plaintiff will therefore be granted in a modified form.\n         Therefore, as directed In the case of <a href=\"/doc/223504/\" id=\"a_86\">Indian Express\n         Newspapers</a> (supra), a modified injunction is hereby\n         granted restraining the defendants from republishing the\n         three articles and/or from writing and publishing any\n         defamatory article in the nature of the three articles\n         (which are disputed in the present suit) alleging that the\n         plaintiff is having relationship with other actors or a\n         married man, which will operate till the disposal of the\n         suit. It is for the defendants to justify these articles when\n         the suit is heard and decided but in the meanwhile, the\n         above-referred injunction will continue to operate.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">23.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1460053\" id=\"span_76\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1460053/\" id=\"a_87\">Cadbury (India) Ltd.</a>(supra) this\n\nCourt also restrained the defendant from publishing or\n\nrepublishing or making any oral or written statement or\n\ngiving     any     interview       containing       any     allegations      or\n\ndefamatory statements with regard to Nickel contents in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                         Page 50 of 66</span>\n chocolates manufactured by the plaintiff.

The tenor of such\n\nexpressions        suggests that the engines of the industries\n\nof the plaintiff are run by the blood of the common public.\n\nSuch expressions undoubtedly have the propensity to cause\n\nlasting damage to the well established reputation of the\n\nplaintiff and in my view the use of the said expression\n\nwould certainly harm and jeopardize the credibility and\n\nreputation of the plaintiff in the estimation of the common\n\npublic. This Court also cannot find any justification for the\n\nuse of such derogatory expressions       in the song and such\n\nexpressions prima facie cannot stand the test of either fair\n\ncomment or based on truth or in the public or societal\n\ninterest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_67\">26.    In the backdrop of the aforesaid legal position, let me\n\ndeal with the contentions raised by the counsel for the\n\ndefendant nos. 1 to 3. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior\n\nAdvocate laid strong emphasis on the fact that the film\n\n&quot;Chakravayuh&quot; along with the promos            has been duly\n\ncertified     by the Board of Film Certification in terms of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                           Page 54 of 66</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/1120161/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 5A</a> of the Cinematographic                Act 1952 vide          their\n\norder dated 1.10.2012 and since then the promos of the\n\nfilm as well as the song in question             are being displayed\n\non „Youtube‟ and other media sites. Counsel also took a\n\nstand that even the Revising Committee of the CBFC has\n\ncleared      the said song after the defendant                no.2       had\n\nagreed      to         insert   a   disclaimer   clarifying     that     the\n\nappearance of the names of the industrial houses in the\n\nsong     are merely         symbolic and denominative.            Counsel\n\nalso submitted that the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_94\">Cinematographic Act, 1952</a> is a\n\ncomplete code in itself and the remedy                  to the plaintiff\n\nwas available under <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 6</a> of the Cinematographic Act\n\nwhich deals with revisional                power        of the Central\n\nGovernment         to revise the decision         of the Board either\n\nsuo motu or on being approached                  by any individual to\n\nchallenge        the decision        of the Board.      The contention\n\nraised    by the counsel            for the defendant     was that the\n\nremedy of the plaintiff to file a civil suit is barred, in the\n\nlight of the remedy             provided under the         said special\n\nstatute for the            redressal     of any grievance          of any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                    Page 55 of 66</span>\n individual        against     the decision of the Board of Film\n\nCertification. Counsel also argued that the Members of the\n\nBoard of Film Certification are experts and this court will\n\nnot sit over the decision taken by the expert body. Counsel\n\nalso submitted         that   the defendants   have not travelled\n\nbeyond the freedom guaranteed to them under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 19</a>\n\nof the Constitution           of India and their right to freely\n\nexpress       their views through the          medium of cinema\n\ncannot be snatched            away by the   grant of preemptory\n\ninjunction. Counsel also submitted that the defendants in\n\nthe said      movie have demonstrated          and displayed       the\n\nviews of Maoists         on    one hand and     the common man\n\nsuffering from the price rise and their exploitation at the\n\nhands of the industrial houses on the other and it is with\n\na view to express the feelings of the common man there is\n\na mentioning of the name of the plaintiff            which is only\n\nsymbolic, denominative and not with a view to disrepute\n\nor disparage the reputation of the plaintiff. The counsel\n\nalso took a stand that the plaintiff has not challenged the\n\ndecision of the CBFC in the present suit and therefore, in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                               Page 56 of 66</span>\n the absence of any such challenge the decision               of the\n\nBoard cannot be set aside by this court. The counsel also\n\nplaced strong reliance on the guideline (xviii<a href=\"/doc/211801/\" id=\"a_97\">) <a href=\"/doc/211801/\" id=\"a_98\">laid down in</a></a>\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_99\">Cinematographic Act</a> to support his contention                that\n\nbefore granting        certification,the CBFC has fully gone into\n\nall the aspects including the lyrics of the said song. In my\n\nconsidered view, none of the above contentions raised by\n\nthe counsel for the defendants could justify the act of\n\nthe defendants in using the name of the plaintiff                with\n\nsuch a disparagement to the extent of attributing that the\n\nplaintiff has looted the country and that they are running\n\ntheir industry by the blood of the people. This is no doubt\n\na serious attack on the reputation and goodwill of the\n\nplaintiff    and with the use of such defamatory expressions\n\nthe defendants cannot take shelter by using the same with\n\na disclaimer. Even otherwise it is inconceivable that the\n\nuse of a        disclaimer       in any way can help so far\n\ntransmitting of the said song on You-Tube, through CDs or\n\nother media sites is concerned as the disclaimer will\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                             Page 57 of 66</span>\n confine to the viewers of the film and not to all those who\n\nwill merely listen the song.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">27.     This court also does not find any merit                  in the\n\ncontention raised by the counsel for the defendant that\n\nthe remedy of the plaintiff to file a civil suit is barred due\n\nto the remedy available to the plaintiff under <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_100\">Section                6</a>\n\nof the Cinematographic Act 1952.

It is a settled legal position that a provision of law\n\nousting the jurisdiction of the civil court must be strictly\n\nconstrued and exclusion of the jurisdiction cannot be easily\n\ninferred unless such exclusion is either explicitly expressed\n\nor clearly implied.        This court also does      not find        any\n\nspecific provision in the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_102\">Cinematographic Act</a> which can\n\ngrant an urgent and immediate relief to the grievance of\n\nan individual          in a case    like   the present where         the\n\ngrievance of the individual pertains to intending loss of\n\nits reputation           and goodwill.

In the absence of any\n\npeculiar provision in the said Act, this court has no\n\nhesitation in taking a view that the present suit filed by\n\nthe plaintiff      being a   civil suit is maintainable     under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 9</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure.       Ordinarily, the\n\ncourts do not interfere with the decision taken by expert\n\nbodies, but that would not imply that the citizen whose\n\nfundamental rights are violated is left remediless and that\n\nthe recourse to approach the court to challenge the\n\ndecision of the expert body is not available. The court also\n\ndoes not find any merit in the contention of the defendants\n\nthat the defendants have taken the lyrics of the said song\n\nfrom the Jan Natya Mandali of tribal for the street\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                            Page 59 of 66</span>\n performances and the same actually reflect the feeling of\n\nthe Maoists, as ultimately the responsibility lies with the\n\nfilmmakers so as to what to exhibit    keeping in view the\n\nvarious parameters <a href=\"/doc/211801/\" id=\"a_106\">laid down in</a> the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_107\">Cinematographic Act</a>\n\n1952, and at the same time, not to impinge upon the\n\nfundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">28.    This court also does not find any merit in the\n\ncontention of the counsel for the defendants                 that\n\nreference to the name of the plaintiff in the lyrics is only\n\nsymbolic or denominative. As already discussed above, it\n\nis not merely use of names in the said song but the\n\ndamaging and offending     expressions which are put forth,\n\nleveling serious attributions against the plaintiff which are\n\nper se defamatory in nature and therefore, the defendants\n\ncannot be permitted to use the name of the plaintiff in\n\norder to disparage its reputation by holding them guilty of\n\nlooting the nation and running their engine by the blood of\n\nthe general public. Various judgments     were cited by the\n\ncounsel for the defendants to support their case, but none\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                         Page 60 of 66</span>\n of the judgments relied upon by the defendants aptly brace\n\nin the facts of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">29.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_91\">In <a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_108\">Khushwant Singh</a> (Supra) on which reliance\n\nhas been placed by the counsel for the defendants,                   the\n\ncourt was dealing           with an autobiography of a well-known\n\nauthor Khushwant Singh, which was yet to be published\n\nwherein references             were made to     personal lives        of\n\npublic figures, wherein the court           took a view that an\n\nautobiography deals not only with the individual by whom\n\nit is written but about the people whom he claims to have\n\ninteracted with and this is a matter          between the author\n\nand the people who want to read it and fetters cannot be\n\nput on to what an author should or should not write.                The\n\ncourt also took a view that the book             has not yet been\n\npublished and therefore the court felt that it was not a\n\nmatter where           the author    should be restrained           from\n\npublishing the same            when he is willing    to    take      the\n\nconsequences           of    any civil action for damages       and is\n\nstanding       by what he has written.        In the present case,\n\nadmittedly, the promos of the song               are already          on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                                Page 61 of 66</span>\n YouTube and the use of the offending lyrics cannot stand\n\nthe test of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 19 (2)</a> of the Constitution of India, the\n\nsame being per se defamatory.</span>           Another    case on which\n\nreliance has been placed by the defendants of Tata Sons\n\n(Supra),       also stands on an entirely different footing as in\n\nthe facts of the said case Greenpeace India which was\n\nengaged        in protecting and conserving the environment\n\nand was known for raising environmental issues devised a\n\ngame turtle versus Tata to focus public           attention to the\n\npotential environmental dangers posed             by the project\n\nlaunched by the group companies of Tata and the game\n\nin question depicting the challenges            that Olive Ridley\n\nturtles would have to overcome in order to survive in spite\n\nof the project.        It is in the background of those facts that\n\nthe court took a view that          injunction would freeze       the\n\nentire public debate on the effect of the port project on the\n\nhabitat of Olive Ridley turtles and therefore the same\n\nwould not be in the public interest. The other judgments\n\ncited      by the counsel for the defendants              are also\n\ndistinguishable and would not be attracted to the case at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                              Page 62 of 66</span>\n hand as it is a settled   legal position that the ratio of any\n\ndecision must be understood in the backdrop of that\n\nparticular case and the ratio of any judgment is not to be\n\napplied like „Elucid theorem‟ to the facts of the case in\n\nhand. A case is only an authority for what it actually\n\ndecides or not what logically flows from it.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">30.    At omega, this court would like to observe that\n\ncinema is not only an entertainment industry but also a\n\npotent weapon for social change. From a six to a sixty year\n\nold, everyone derives and takes home something from a\n\nmovie and it has the power to evoke emotions and shape\n\nthe outlook of the common man towards various issues like\n\nnone other. The film makers have since yore mirrored\n\nsocial ills plaguing the society which movement continues\n\ntill date with igniting the minds and being responsible for\n\nvarious social movements leading to monumental changes\n\nin the social setup. However with this responsibility to\n\nbring to the public domain the realities of our diverse\n\nnation, there comes a duty to act cautiously not to make\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                           Page 63 of 66</span>\n inroads in the lives and dignity of people and institutions\n\nalike in the garb of being the messiahs of social change.\n\nThus the film makers have no unbridled right       to tarnish\n\nthe image and reputation of any individual or institution,\n\nthat too in the absence of any foundation for the same.\n\nOne cannot be oblivious of the fact that the main stay of\n\nthe film industry is not only entertainment but also\n\ncommercial gains and in this pursuit to earn huge profits\n\nthe cinema makers      have no    right to trample upon,\n\ndisrepute or disparage the reputation of others.       To cull\n\nout a passage from the famous Othello which states; A\n\ngood name is worth more than good riches. (Shakespear&#x27;s\n\nOthello, Act-II, Scene III, pp.167):- Good name in man and\n\nwoman, dear my Lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls;\n\nWho steals my purse, steals trash; Its something nothing;\n\nT&#x27;was mine, t&#x27;is, and has been slave to thousands; But he\n\nthat filches from me my good name, Robs me of that which\n\nnot enriches him And makes me poor indeed. Thus as\n\nrightly said, reputation is the only jewel that cannot be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">CS(OS) No. 3010/2012                        Page 64 of 66</span>\n bought and is built over the years and a person who is\n\nrobbed of it is no less than a destitute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">31.
