In India from time immemorial,\n\nsages     had   proscribed     gambling    as    a   sinful   and\n\npernicious      vice.   Sage    Kanvasha        Ailusha   (Aksha\n\nMaujavant) had composed a cautionary poem/hymn in\n\nRig Veda (10.34) which is titled &quot;The Gambler&#x27;s Lament&quot;.\n\nIt comprises monologue of a repentant gambler who\n\ngrieves the ruin brought on him because of addiction to\n\nthe game of dice; this Veda (10.34) has a hymn which\n\nnearly translates to: a gambler&#x27;s wife is left forlorn and\n\nwretched; the mother mourns the son who wanders\n\nhomeless, in constant fear, in debt and seeking money by\n\ntheft in the dark of night.

Kaatyaayana Smriti states that gambling, if\n\ncannot be stopped in the kingdom, should be discouraged\n\nby imposing tax. Manusmriti injuncts that gambling &amp;\n\nbetting, the king shall exclude from his realm since those\n\ntwo vices may cause the destruction of kingdom; a wise\n\nman should not practise them even for amusement.\n\nKautilya of arthashaastr fame treats all gamblers as\n\ncheats and therefore suggests severe punishment.

The definition of\n     &#x27;prize competition&#x27; in<a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_130\"> s. 2(d)</a> is wide and\n     unqualified in its terms. There is nothing in the\n     working of it, which limits it to competitions in\n     which success does not depend to any\n     substantial extent on skill but on chance...that\n     competitions in which success depends to a\n     substantial extent on skill and competitions in\n     which it does not so depend, form two distinct\n     and separate categories ... The distinction\n     between the two classes of competitions has\n     long been recognised in the legislative practice\n     of both the United Kingdom and this country,\n     and the Courts have, time and again, pointed\n     out      the      characteristic   features    which\n     differentiate them.

SATYANARAYANA, the Apex Court was\n\nexamining as to whether the rummy was a game of\n\nchance       or   a   game       of   skill.   Strangely,\n\nCHAMARBAUGWALAS I &amp; II do not find a reference in\n\nthis decision; however, what the Court observed being\n\nconsistent with the said decisions and the following\n\nobservations are profitably reproduced:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">            &quot;12. ... The game of rummy is not a game\n     entirely of chance like the &quot;three-card&quot; game\n     mentioned in the Madras case to which we\n     were referred. The &quot;three card game which\n     goes under different names such as &quot;flush&quot;,\n     &quot;brag&quot; etc. Is a game of pure chance. Rummy,\n     on the other hand, requires certain amount of\n     skill because the fall of the cards has to be\n     memorised and the building up of Rummy\n     requires considerable skill in holding and\n     discarding cards. WE cannot, therefore, say\n     that the game of rummy is a game of entire\n     chance. It is mainly and preponderantly a\n     game of skill. The chance in Rummy is of the\n     same character as the chance in a deal at a\n     game of bridge. In fact in all games in which\n     cards are shuffled and dealt out, there is an\n     element of chance, because the distribution of\n     the card is not according to any set pattern\n     but is dependent upon how the cards find\n     their place in the shuffled pack. From this\n     alone it cannot be said that Rummy is a game\n     of chance and there is no skill involved in\n     it...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">                              - 52 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">      (iv)    In K.R.

Gambling in a nut-shell is payment\n    of a price for a chance to win a prize. Games\n    may be of chance, or of skill or of skill and\n    chance combined. A game of chance is\n    determined entirely or in part by lot or mere\n    luck. The throw of the dice, the turning of the\n    wheel, the shuffling of the cards, are all\n    modes of chance. In these games the result is\n    wholly uncertain and doubtful. No human\n    mind knows or can know what it will be until\n    the dice is thrown, the wheel stops its\n    revolution or the dealer has dealt with the\n    cards. A game of skill, on the other hand -\n    although the element of chance necessarily\n    cannot be entirely eliminated- is one in which\n    success depends principally upon the\n    superior knowledge, training, attention,\n    experience and adroitness of the player.&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">          &quot;33.

It is staking on chance where\n    chance is the controlling factor. `Gaming&#x27; in the\n    two Acts would, therefore, mean wagering or\n    betting on games of chance. It would not include\n    games of skill like horse-racing. ... We,\n    therefore, hold that wagering or betting on\n    horse-racing - a game of skill - does not come\n    within the definition of `gaming&#x27; under the two\n    Acts. 34... Even if there is wagering or betting\n    with the Club it is on a game of mere skill and\n    as such it would not be &#x27;gaming&#x27; under the two\n    Acts.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">    X.

This decision cannot be construed\n\nrepugnant          to    Chamarbaugwala          jurisprudence    as\n\nexplained in K.R.LAKSHMANAN. We are of a considered\n\nview that the games of skill do not metamorphise into\n\ngames of chance merely because they are played online,\n\nceteris paribus.

Whether online or offline, they are\n\ndesigned to entertain as well as to inform. Games have\n\nemotive content whose effects tend more toward the\n\ncognitive. The thin line between entertainment and\n\ninformation often becomes elusive.

Second, video games often have\n     aesthetic value. The architecture depicted in a\n     video game, for example, can be magnificent,\n     squalid, or both. Indeed, many schools now\n     teach the art and science of creating interactive\n     video games.

However, more recent studies specific to\n     online gambling, most conducted since the\n     advent of legal and regulated online gambling,\n     have indicated that online gambling does not\n     inherently encourage excessive gambling. Most\n     gamblers placed fewer than four bets per day,\n     and sports gamblers tended to moderate their\n     play based on their wins and losses; i.e., they\n     played less often when they lost money and\n     more often when they won money. Also, a large-\n     scale British study in 2007 found no increase in\n     the rate of problem gambling in the United\n     Kingdom since 1999 despite a large increase in\n     the number of new gambling opportunities... We\n     believe that regulators should be able to design\n     sufficient protections to prevent any significant\n     growth in problem gambling that results from\n     legalization. Moreover, a proportion of the tax\n     revenues and licensing fees derived from the\n     U.S.-based industry could be used to\n     substantially bolster the level of support for\n     educational programs and services....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">     (iv)      Mr. Shridhar Prabhu appearing for the\n\nIntervener   draws   our   attention   to   the   following\n\nobservations of European Court of Justice in CARMEN\n\nMEDIA GROUP LTD VS.

AS TO MANIFEST ARBITRARINESS AND\nVOIDING OF PLENARY LEGISLATIONS:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_255\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">      (a)   The expression &quot;pure game of skill&quot; as\n\nemployed in legislations of the kind i.e., Section 176 of\n\nthe Principal Act has been judicially construed to be\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">                            - 115 -\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">&quot;mere skill&quot; and that the games mainly &amp; preponderantly\n\ninvolving skill, fall into this class. The expanded meaning\n\nof &#x27;gaming&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 2(7)</a> as amended, broods\n\nthrough the entirety of the Amendment Act, which paints\n\n&#x27;games of skill&#x27; and &#x27;games of chance&#x27;     with the same\n\nbrush. However, Section 176 of the Principal Act even\n\npost amendment continues to maintain the distinction\n\nbetween these two classes of games. The original heading\n\nof this section &#x27;Saving of games of skill&#x27;&#x27; now also\n\ncontinues. In English Parliamentary practice, &#x27;headings\n\nand   marginal   notes   are   not voted   or   passed   by\n\nParliament, but are inserted after the Bill has become law&#x27;\n\nstates Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edn.\n\nButterworths at page 11. Of course, since 2011, there is\n\nchange in practice. In India, even headings are part of\n\nthe Bill and are voted in the legislature. They provide the\n\ncontext for the substantive part of the section. They are\n\nthere for guidance. Therefore, they cannot be ignored.\n\nDue significance has to be attached to the heading of a\n\nsection in a statute. The substantive text of Section 176\n\nmakes the penal provisions enacted in <a href=\"/doc/844026/\" id=\"a_231\">Sections 79</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/78044/\" id=\"a_232\">80</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">                             - 116 -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">\n\ninapplicable to &#x27;any pure game of skill&#x27; i.e., a game\n\npredominantly     involving     skill.    However,           the\n\nAmendment Act deletes the term &quot;and to wagering by\n\nperson taking part in such games of skill&quot; from the text of\n\nthis section. Thus the amended definition of &#x27;gaming&#x27;\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 2(7)</a> to the extent it does not admit the\n\ndifference between skill games and chance games, is in\n\ndirect contradiction to the amended Section 176 which\n\nintends to maintain such a difference. The very definition\n\nof &#x27;gaming&#x27; as amended, suffers from the vice of over-\n\ninclusiveness/over-broadness of the idea of gaming as\n\nenacted in   the charging provisions of the Act that are\n\nanimated by CHAMARBAUGWALA Jurisprudence. The\n\ncontent of &#x27;gaming&#x27; as capsuled under <a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_234\">Section 2(7)</a> thus\n\nbruises the legislative intent enacted in Section 176 ab\n\ninceptio and continued post-amendment, for protecting a\n\nclass of citizens who plays the games of skill and\n\ntherefore, fits into the text &amp; context of this provision.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">                                - 117 -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_113\">(b)    In <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_235\">SHAYARA BANO vs. UNION OF INDIA62</a>,\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court broke a new ground i.e.,\n\n&#x27;manifest arbitrariness&#x27; for the invalidation of plenary\n\nlegislations, as well.
