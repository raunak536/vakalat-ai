The Sixth Respondent, viz., New India Assurance Co., Ltd., had received\n\n                 notice in a proceeding before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal claiming\n\n                 compensation for the victim in an accident involving the vehicle bearing\n\n                 Registration No. TN-07-A5 6214 said to have been insured with it.

The erstwhile\n\n                 practice followed had been that such investigators engaged by the insurers\n\n                 would collect copies of the required documents from the concerned persons and\n\n                 police authorities and submit their investigation report for enabling the insurers\n\n                 to effectively conduct the proceedings before the Motor Accident Claims\n\n                 Tribunal.

According to the Petitioner, most of the documents required by the\n\n                 Sixth Respondent had not been hosted in the CCTNS portal of the Police\n\n                 Department in the internet, which necessitated the Petitioner to make\n\n                 application dated 28.01.2019 to the police authorities, who are the Second to\n\n                 Fifth Respondents in this Writ Petition, under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">Right to\n\n                 Information Act, 2005</a>, for furnishing manual copies of the required documents,\n\n                 but that request has been declined.

During the course of hearing, it is highlighted by the Learned Counsel for\n\n                 the Petitioner that though the police authorities now claim to have made\n\n                 available the required documents in their website in the internet in the present\n\n                 case, the undeniable reality is that in respect of most of the accidents,\n\n                 documents are leisurely uploaded on piece-meal basis in the respective police\n\n                 stations as a result of which the insurers are not able to provide timely\n\n                 instructions to their Advocates to prepare Counters so as to effectively conduct\n\n                 the cases before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals where it is found difficult\n\n                 to seek extension of time to file the same beyond the stipulated period. It is\n\n                 further explained that on account of reduction of staff strength to curtail\n\n                 operational costs coupled with time constraints, there has been severe dearth of\n\n                 manpower for the insurers to even download the required documents and in that\n\n                 piquant situation, the engagement of investigators, like the Petitioner, for the\n\n                 purpose of collecting manual copies of the required documents from the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                 5/22</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                                     W.P.

In this scenario, it is implored\n\n                 that when there is no facilitating option for the investigators, like the Petitioner,\n\n                 to download the required documents from the CCTNS portal of the Police\n\n                 Department in the internet, their availing of the machinery endowed under the\n\n                 beneficent provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>, for that purpose\n\n                 cannot be denied, much less faulted, by the police authorities.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">                 5.

In that statute,\n\n                 Chapter XI containing Sections 145 to 164 relates to `Insurance of Motor\n\n                 Vehicles against Third Party Risks’ and Chapter XII containing Sections 165 to\n\n                 176 relates to `Claims Tribunal’. It could be inferred from Sections 158(6) and\n\n                 160 of that enactment read with Rule 150 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules,\n\n                 1989, that there is an entitlement, as of right, conferred on the insurer to be\n\n                 furnished with particulars required of the vehicle said to have been insured with\n\n                 it and of the accident in which it is reported to be involved, by the concerned\n\n                 police authorities, and that would necessarily also mean supplying copies of\n\n                 relevant documents in proof thereof.

In other words, it follows that there is definitely a functional system\n\n                 in place as on date in the digitalized mode for the police authorities to discharge\n\n                 their obligations to the insurers in terms of <a href=\"/doc/74970700/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 158(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/56265335/\" id=\"a_8\">160</a> of the\n\n                 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                 8/22</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                                   W.P.

Having arrived at that conclusion, the query arises as to whether despite\n\n                 the availability of the aforesaid mechanism, is it not also permissible in law to\n\n                 obtain the required documents from the police authorities by invoking the\n\n                 provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. It would suffice for this\n\n                 purpose to refer to the binding ruling of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in\n\n                 Chief Information Commissioner –vs- High Court of Gujarat (Order dated\n\n                 04.03.2020 in Civil Appeal Nos. 1966-1967 of 2020). It has been held therein\n\n                 that when a particular statute provides for access to information by prescribing\n\n                 a procedure in that regard, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>,\n\n                 shall not be invoked for the same purpose and that the overriding effect in\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1443302/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 31</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005, cannot have any application\n\n                 in the absence of inherent inconsistency between that enactment and the other\n\n                 law. Another facet of the matter, which has relevance to the dispute involved in\n\n                 this case, as pointed out in that decision, is that <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Right to\n\n                 Information Act, 2005, excludes disclosure of personal information which (i)\n\n                 has no relationship to any public interest or activity; or (ii) would cause\n\n                 unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. It is beyond cavil that\n\n                 the documents required by the insurer from the police authorities regarding the\n\n                 accident and the vehicle involved undoubtedly pertain to personal information\n\n                 either of the victim or the vehicle owner which would fall under that exception.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                 9/22</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                                                   W.P. No. 10230 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                 It may also be remembered here that a Nine Judge Bench of the Hon’ble\n\n                 Supreme Court of India in K.S.Puttaswamy –vs- Union of India [(2017) 10\n\n                 SCC 1] has in no unmistakable terms recognized that the right to privacy is\n\n                 protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the\n\n                 Constitution. Viewed from that perspective, it must be held that when the right\n\n                 has been created for the insurer to obtain the required documents from the\n\n                 police authorities in a certain way under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_14\">Motor Vehicles Act, 1988</a>, such\n\n                 right must be exercised only in that way and that other modes (including\n\n                 invocation of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_15\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>) for seeking\n\n                 that relief, stand necessarily forbidden.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">                 8.       The focus next turns to the locus standi of an investigator, like the\n\n                 Petitioner in this case, to correspond with police authorities and prosecute\n\n                 litigation relating to the documents required by the insurer. It is axiomatic that\n\n                 the relationship between an insurer and an investigator appointed by that\n\n                 insurer to collect documents and make enquiries regarding the accident\n\n                 involving the vehicle said to have been insured with that insurer, is simply that\n\n                 of principal and agent. It is an elementary principle of law that an agent, in his\n\n                 own personal capacity, cannot enforce the rights of his principal as against third\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                 10/22</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                                                   W.P. No. 10230 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                 persons and at best, he can act or represent on behalf of his principal for that\n\n                 purpose depending upon the extent of his authority in that regard, but that\n\n                 would not, by any stretch of imagination, entitle the agent to act independent of\n\n                 his disclosed principal. It cannot be forgotten here that the insurer collects\n\n                 funds from the public as vehicle owners in the form of insurance premia for\n\n                 meeting the claims for compensation arising out of motor accidents in\n\n                 pursuance of the requirement imposed by law. As a corollary, the role of the\n\n                 insurer in defending third party claims arising out of motor accidents is that of a\n\n                 trustee of public funds and as such, it is one of the essential duties required to\n\n                 be performed by the hierarchy of officials in the organizational structure of the\n\n                 insurer, which responsibility ought not to be abdicated by ingenious methods of\n\n                 outsourcing those functions to freelancers appointed as investigators under the\n\n                 ruse of lack of manpower. It is, no doubt, true that in the absence of any\n\n                 prohibition, the hiring of services of individuals on contract basis for carrying\n\n                 out specific tasks of a business entity due to exigencies would be permissible\n\n                 for supplementing the performance of work, but that arrangement cannot lead\n\n                 to absurd consequences of supplanting the essential functions of the insurer\n\n                 itself. It is probably in that factual backdrop, the right of access to the CCTNS\n\n                 portal has been thoughtfully restricted only to stakeholders (which undoubtedly\n\n                 includes the insurer) on payment of prescribed fee, and it cannot be carped that\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                 11/22</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                                                                     W.P.

That being so, it is really inconceivable as to how the Petitioner in\n\n                 this case could independently assert rights against the police authorities to\n\n                 produce documents required by the Sixth Respondent and further prosecute this\n\n                 Writ Petition in his personal capacity for such object.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">                 9.
