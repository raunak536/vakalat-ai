It has many facets      as canvassed by the respective counsels\nappearing for the petitioners-original borrowers, inter alia, that the banks\nhave no power to publish photograph and they have referred to the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_3\">SARFAESI Act</a> read with the Security Interest\n(Enforcement) Rules, 2002 (for short &#x27;the Rules&#x27;) to contend that it only\nrefers to the procedure with regard to issuance of notice before exercising\nthe powers for possession and sale of the secured assets.        It is also\ncontended that since the provisions of the SARFAEI Act or the rules do\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 Page 2 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                        3 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nnot expressly provide for publication of photograph, it cannot be read that\nthe bank can resort to such publication of photograph which cause\nprejudice to the reputation of the borrowers. It is also contended that it\nhas to be considered in light of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Art. 21</a> which refers to the Right to Life.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">3.    The learned counsels have, referring to the right to life under Art.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">21, emphasised that it encompasses right to live with dignity and\ntherefore the reputation or dignity of the borrower who has defaulted in\nrepayment cannot be prejudiced. The learned counsels have therefore\npointedly referred to these provisions including some guidelines by the\nbank and alternatively it has also been argued that even if the power is\nassumed, it cannot have any unfettered power or discretion and therefore\nthe guideline known as the Bank Codes and the Standards Board of India\nrefers to the standards which include the privacy and confidentiality of\nthe borrower as a customer. Therefore, it has also been contended that\nthe bank could not disclose or publish the photograph in view of such\nguidelines with regard to privacy and confidentiality as they cannot cause\nany harm to the reputation of the borrower by publishing information and\nthe photograph of the borrower. It was emphasised that as it has been\nspecifically stated in this Code that &quot;your privacy would be respected&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">would not justify any such publication of the photograph. The learned\ncounsels have have tried to emphasise that even if it is assumed for the\nsake of argument that there is a power, still, it is subject to some\nmechanism or guideline and as there is no detailed guideline with regard\nto the same by RBI, the photograph could not be permitted to be\npublished causing harm to the reputation of the borrower. The learned\ncounsels have submitted that merely because the person may have\ncommitted a default in repayment he is not necessarily a person without\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  Page 3 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                          4 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                  JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nreputation. In support of these submissions, they have referred to and\nrelied upon the judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court reported in AIR\n1996 SC 2124 in the case of State of Manipur v. Thingujam Brojen Meetei,\n(1996) 11 SCC 399 in the case of Om Prakash Gargi v. State of Punjab\nand ors., (1985) 2 SCC 412 in the case of Chief of Army Staff and ors. v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"847250\" id=\"span_8\">Major Dharam Pal Kukrety and (2009) 9 SCC 447 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/847250/\" id=\"a_5\">Y.\nSatyanarayan Reddy v.

Per contra, the learned counsels appearing for the banks contended\nthat there is no right, much less any fundamental right. It was submitted\nthat the publication of such photograph along with the notice is in\nexercise of statutory right as provided under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_6\">SARFAESI\nAct</a>.   They have pointedly referred to the notice under <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_7\">sec.13(2)</a> of\nSARFAESI Act read with the Rules and submitted that it clearly provides\nfor taking action for recovery of the dues. Merely because it is not\nexpressly stated about publication of notice with photograph it does not\nnecessarily mean that every detail has to be provided in the statute itself\nabout the mode or the manner of publication of the notice. The learned\ncounsels have submitted that the notice may include the notice with\nphotograph as in these days in many cases photograph is required to be\naffixed to the forms like the account opening form, etc. It was submitted\nthat when the statute provides and it does not expressly prohibit it can\nhardly be said that there is any breach or violation of any right. The\nlearned counsels have stated that therefore the manner and modalities of\npublication of notice cannot be an issue once the statute empowers the\nbank to publish such notice. It was submitted that it gives right to the\nbank, provides an opportunity to the borrower to comply with the notice\nand at the same time the published notice also puts the public at large to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                 Page 4 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                       5 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                   JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nnotice about the property in question which is involved and which is\nmortgaged to the bank as a security. It was therefore submitted that it is\nin public interest and so long as it is not offending or prohibited by any\nlaw or rules the exercise of statutory powers by the bank cannot be\ncurtailed or regulated in exercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Art. 226</a> by the\ncourt. The manner of publication of notice cannot be questioned before\nthe court in exercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_9\">Art. 226.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"399224\" id=\"span_10\">5.    The learned counsels for the respondent banks have also referred to\nand relied upon the judgments reported in AIR 1995 SC 264 in the case\nof R. Rajagopal alias R.R. Gopal and anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu and ors.,\nand AIR 2007 MP 45 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/399224/\" id=\"a_10\">Ku. Archana Chauhan v. State Bank of\nIndia, Jabalpur</a>, which has referred to this very exercise of statutory\npower under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_11\">SARFAESI Act</a> read with the Rules and submitted that,\non the contrary, it is an exercise of statutory power under the Act which\nenables the bank to take steps for speedy recovery of the loans.</span> They\nhave also referred to and relied upon the judgment of the Bombay High\nCourt in the case of D.J. Exim (India) Pvt. Ltd. &amp; ors. v. State Bank of\nIndia &amp; ors., being Writ Petition (L) No. 2808 of 2013 dated 28.11.2013\nand also the judgment of the Madras High Court reported in (2006) 4\n1877 in the case of K.J. Doraisamy v. State Bank of India. The learned\ncounsels have stated that the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_12\">SARFAESI Act</a> has been enacted to expedite\nthe recovery of outstanding dues of the bank and reduce the NPA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">6.    The learned counsels have, therefore, stated that the grievance\nmade with regard to privacy or the rules of natural justice is also\nmisconceived as the rules of natural justice could not be attracted as there\nis no punishment or any order which can be said to have been passed\nwhich would require an opportunity of hearing. It was submitted that in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                 Page 5 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                        6 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nfact the borrower having agreed and accepted at the time of taking the\nadvances from the bank stated that the notice could be given in a\nparticular manner with photograph now cannot challenge the powers of\nthe bank as it is not open to approbate and reprobate challenging the\npowers of the bank to publish such notice with photograph in exercise of\nstatutory powers.          The learned counsels have stated that in fact the\npetitioners are estopped on the principle of promissory estoppel from\nraising such issues having got the advantage of finance and thereafter\nwhen they fail to repay the amount are trying to raise contentions about\nthe authority or the power of the bank to publish the notice with\nphotograph. It was therefore submitted that there is no justification and\nthere may not be any violation of the rules of natural justice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">7.    Similarly, it has been emphasised that the petitioners cannot make\nany grievance having themselves agreed under an agreement or\nundertaking that such a notice with photograph would be published. It\nwas submitted that the right is exercised by the bank pursuant to such\nagreement or the undertaking between the parties de hors the statutory\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_13\">SARFAESI Act</a> and therefore there is no question of raising\nany contention about the power of the bank to publish such notice with\nphotograph. It was also emphasised that the issue with regard to the right\nof privacy or reputation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Art. 21</a> are misconceived.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">Special Civil Application No. 8323 of 2013\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">8.    Learned Sr. Counsel Shri S.I. Nanavati appearing with learned\nadvocate Ms. Anuja Nanavati has referred to the notice at Annexure-A\nand submitted that the submissions are two-fold. One one hand, he has\ntried to submit with regard to the very power or jurisdiction to publish\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      Page 6 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                         7 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                  JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nsuch notice with photograph. However, learned Sr. Counsel Shri Nanavati\nsubmitted that assuming that there is such power the notice has already\nbeen published without photograph and the petitioners are ready and\nwilling to offer the property secured by way of mortgage for the sale and\ntherefore there is no justification to give any advertisement with\nphotograph.     He emphasised that it reflects the attitude of the bank to\ncause prejudice to the reputation of the petitioner. He submitted that it\nhas to be seen what purpose it could now serve with publication of notice\nand the photograph. He submitted that the petitioner has not objected to\nthe exercise of power by the bank for recovery of the amount by sale of\nmortgaged property. Therefore, it was submitted that the exercise of\nstatutory power under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_15\">SARFAESI Act</a> read with the Rules to recover\nthe outstanding dues of the bank is not challenged or objected and they\ncan proceed to recover the amount by resorting to such statutory\nprovisions for sale of the secured property.       However, it does not\nempower the bank to publish the photograph which has a tendency to\ncause prejudice to the reputation of the person.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">9.    Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Nanavati referred to the papers and\npointedly referred to the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India\n(for short &#x27;the Codes&#x27;) which is produced on record and submitted that it\nalso includes a clause/para regarding privacy and confidentiality.\nLearned Sr. Counsel Shri Nanavati has pointedly referred to this and\nsubmitted that the bank has evolved this guideline to protect the\nreputation of the borrower who has defaulted and it has been specifically\nobserved,\n\n\n                     &quot;Your privacy would be respected&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                 Page 7 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                                                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"176333521\" id=\"span_14\">8 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                   JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nHe, therefore, submitted that the &#x27;Codes&#x27; provide for a broad code of\nconduct for both the bank as well as the borrower. He submitted that the\nclause regarding privacy and confidentiality would be meaningless if\nsuch notice with photograph is permitted to be published. He has referred\nto and relied upon the judgment of the Kerala High Court reported in\n[(2014) (1) DRTC 93 (Ker.)] in the case of <a href=\"/doc/176333521/\" id=\"a_16\">Venu v. State Bank of India</a> to\nemphasise the observation,\n\n\n      &quot;...The practice of exhibiting a photograph of a person and shaming\n      him in public for the sin of being in an impecunious condition\n      cannot be encouraged in a civilised society like ours.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">He has also referred to other judgments and submitted that apart from the\nchallenge to the power the court may also consider the alternative\nargument whether there is any justification to publish the notice with\nphotograph.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">Special Civil Application No. 1661 of 2013\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">10.   Learned advocate Shri P.A. Mehd adopted the submissions made\nby learned Sr. Counsel Shri S.I. Nanavati on the aspect of the power or\nauthority of the bank to publish such notice with photograph and also the\nright to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Art. 21</a> to emphasise that the right to life\nencompasses the right to live with dignity. He submitted that it affects\nthe dignity and reputation of a person and therefore it is offending the\nfundamental right of the petitioner. He has also submitted that in any\ncase when the petitioner has shown willingness to repay the amount such\nexercise of statutory power would not be justified. Learned advocate Shri\nMehd also referred to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_18\">SARFAESI Act</a> and submitted\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                Page 8 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                      9 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                   JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nthat in fact every outstanding due does not make the borrower a &quot;willful\ndefaulter&quot;. He submitted that &quot;willful defaulter&quot; has to be examined and\nthereafter the authority can take the decision. He submitted the authority\nis required to take action as per the law and it cannot go beyond the\nprovisions of law. He submitted that it has to function within the\nprovisions of law like the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_19\">SARFAESI Act</a>. Learned advocate Shri Mehd\nsubmitted that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_20\">SARFAESI Act</a> or the Rules do not\nprovide for such publication of photograph and therefore it cannot be read\nwhile publishing the notice under <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_21\">sec. 13(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/26129616/\" id=\"a_22\">sec. 13(4)</a> of the\nSARFAESI Act that photograph also could be published. He has also\nreferred to Appendix IV and rule 8 of the Rules. He submitted that the\nbank can publish the notice as per the provision of rule 8 and it refers to\nthe immovable property and it is a possession notice with regard to the\npossession of immovable property to be taken over and it does not speak\nabout the photograph. He submitted that this is the only statutory power\nfor publication of any notice under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_23\">SARFAESI Act</a>.                Learned\nadvocate Shri Mehd submitted that under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_24\">SARFAESI Act</a> and the\nRules the powers of the bank are restricted to publication of notice in the\nmanner provided by the Act and the Rules. He emphasised that the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_25\">SARFAESI Act</a> read with the Rules do not expressly\nprovide for such publication of photograph. He therefore submitted that\nthe publication of photograph under <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_26\">SARFAESI Act</a> is not contemplated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">11.   Learned advocate Shri Mehd also submitted that there is no circular\nor notification by the RBI which provide for publication of photograph\nwith the notice under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_27\">SARFAESI Act</a> like <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_28\">sec. 13(2)</a> of the\nSARFAESI Act. He therefore submitted that in fact for the purpose of\nstatutory power under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_29\">SARFAESI Act</a> it may also be examined as to\nwho will bear the cost and the cost cannot be debited to the account of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 Page 9 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                        10 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                       JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nborrower/defaulter. He submitted that the submission of the bank at the\nhighest that they have the power to publish photograph with the notice\ncan be made subject to the agreement which he has referred to produced\non record. Learned advocate Shri Mehd therefore submitted that it affects\nthe right of privacy of the petitioner. He submitted that the person has a\nright to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Art. 21</a> which encompasses the right to live with\ndignity. He submitted that publication of such photograph will have a\nbearing on the reputation and prejudice could be caused to the reputation\nof a person which is not permissible. In support of this contention he has\nreferred to and relied upon the judgment reported in AIR 1996 SC 2124\n(para 9) and also the judgment reported in (1996) 11 SCC 399 (para 4).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">Special Civil Application No. 2260 of 2014\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">12.   Learned advocate Shri Gupta referred to the papers and submitted\nthat he would adopt the submissions made by learned Sr. Counsel Shri\nNanavati as well as learned advocate Shri Mehd. He also referred to the\nimpugned notice at Annexure-A and submitted that the notice is without\nany power. He also submitted that in fact the notice is not as required by\nthe statute inasmuch as the provisions of law empower a particular officer\n(Chief Manager) and the notice is given by the Asst. General Manager.\nRule 2(a) defines the &quot;authorised officer&quot; and the notice is not by the\nauthorised officer and therefore it is not as per the requirement of law. He\nsubmitted that the powers are given to the Chief Manager or the\nauthorised officer and as the notice at Annexure-A is not given by such\nofficer, it is not a valid notice. He submitted that there is nothing that\nsuggests that the mind of the Chief Manager or the authorised officer has\nbeen applied before issuing the notice.          Similarly, he referred to the\nprovisions of the Rules and submitted that it provides for the borrower\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                 Page 10 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                          11 of 25\n           C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nand when he could be said to be a willful defaulter. Learned advocate\nShri Gupta emphasised that every borrower who commits default in\nrepayment is not a willful defaulter. Learned advocate Shri Gupta also\nreferred to the master circular of the RBI and submitted that none of the\nconditions for willful default as prescribed are fulfilled.     Therefore, as\nthe petitioner is not a willful defaulter it will not have any application.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">13.     Similarly, learned advocate Shri Gupta adopted the submissions\nwith regard to the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Art. 21</a> which includes the right to\nlive with dignity and has adopted the submissions made by other learned\nadvocates. He has also referred to and relied upon the judgment of the\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court reported in (2012) 5 SCC 1. It was submitted that if\nthe Act requires it to be done in a particular manner it should be done by\nthe authorised officer as per the law and not as prescribed subsequently\nby any instructions or circular. He therefore submitted that as the statute\ndoes not provide for publication of notice with the photograph, it cannot\nbe read into it by the subsequent circular or instructions issued by the\nbank.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">14.     In view of these rival submissions, it is required to be considered\nwhether the present petitions require consideration and whether the\nsubmissions made by the learned counsels for the petitioners raising\nobjection regarding the power or authority of the respondent banks to\npublish photographs in the notice can be sustained.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">15.     As recorded hereinabove, there are divergent views by different\nHigh Courts. However, before referring to the same, while appreciating\nthe submissions, the emphasis given by learned counsels Shri Nanavati,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                  Page 11 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                              12 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                   JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nShri Mehd and Shri Gupta referring to Appendix IV under Rule 8(1) is\nrequired to be considered. The submissions have been made at length\nthat under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_32\">SARFAESI Act</a> or the Rules the bank can publish the\nnotice for auction or sale of the immovable property under rule 8, but it\ndoes not speak about the photograph. The emphasis has been made that\nwhat is required is the procedure for recovery of the amount by sale of the\nproperty, but it does not speak of publication of the photograph which\nmay have an adverse impact on the reputation of the person.     It    was,\ntherefore, submitted that the publication of photograph under the\n<a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_33\">SARFAESI Act</a> or the Rules is not contemplated, nor is there any rule or\ncircular or guideline which permit the publication of photograph.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">16.   However, in order to appreciate these submissions, the Statement\nof Objects and Reasons of the SARFAESI Act is required to be kept in\nmind. The Statement of Objects and Reasons clearly focus on the need\nfor such Act that there was no legal provision for facilitating\nsecuritisation of financial assets of banks and financial institutions. It\nwas also felt that unlike international banks, the banks and financial\ninstitutions in India do not have power to take possession of securities\nand sell them. Therefore, in order to provide a legal framework to keep\npace with the changing commercial practices and financial sector reforms\nthe Act has been brought as suggested and recommended by the\nNarasimham Committee and Andhyarujina Committee constituted by the\nCentral Government.       One of the objects which was sought to be\nachieved, as referred to in the Bill which is highlighted is, &quot;empowering\nthe banks and financial institutions to take possession of the securities\ngiven for financial assistance and sell or lease the same or take over\nmanagement in the event of default, i.e., classification of the borrower&#x27;s\naccount as non-performing asset in accordance with the directions given\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                Page 12 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                       13 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nor guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">17.   In this background, if the scheme of the Act is considered, Chapter\nIII <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_34\">Sec. 13</a> refers to &#x27;Enforcement of security interest&#x27; and detailed\nprocedure has been provided. <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 13(2)</a> provides that the secured\ncreditor may require the borrower by notice to discharge his liabilities.\n<a href=\"/doc/26129616/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 13(4)</a> refers to the procedure where the borrower fails to\ndischarge the liability and <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_37\">sec. 14</a> refers to taking over the possession.\nThe notice as referred to in this group of matters, therefore, are issued in\nexercise of the statutory powers. Therefore, the only aspect is whether\nthe notice could be with the photograph of the borrower who has\ndefaulted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">18.   Though the contentions have been raised, as submitted by the\nlearned counsels for the respective banks, it is not only the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_38\">SARFAESI Act</a> but it is also independently agreed and accepted by\nthe borrower at the time of taking the advances by executing the writing\nor the agreement which empower and permit the bank to publish the\nnotice with the photograph as agreed and accepted by the borrower at the\ntime of taking the advance. Learned counsel Ms. Dharmishta Raval\nappearing for learned advocate Ms. Kalpana Raval for the respondent\nbank in SCA No. 8323 of 2013 and other learned advocates appearing for\nthe banks have pointedly referred to this aspect and the undertaking or the\nagreement executed by the borrowers, who are the petitioners in the\npresent cases.    It has been emphasised that the petitioners-borrowers had\nat the time of taking the loan or advance have agreed and accepted,\n\n\n      &quot;Accordingly, we hereby agree and give consent for the disclosure\n      by the SBI Consortium of all or any such\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                 Page 13 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                        14 of 25\n           C/SCA/8323/2013                                           JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">      (a)      information and date relating to us,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">      (b)      the information or data relating to any credit facility\n               availed of/to be availed by us, and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">      (c)      default, if any, committed by us in discharge of our such\n               obligation .......\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">      I/We hereby further agree as precondition of the loan/advance\n      given to me/us by the Bank that in case I/We commit default in\n      repayment of the loan/advances or in the repayment of the interest\n      thereon or any of the agreed installment of the loan on due date/s,\n      the bank and/or the Reserve Bank of India will have an unequalled\n      right to disclose or publish my/our name or the name of our\n      company/firm/unit         and     its   directors/partners,    properties    as\n      defaulters in such manner and through such medium, as the Banks\n      or Reserve Bank of India in their absolute discretion may think\n      fit.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">19.   Thus, it has been agreed and accepted that the bank could publish\nthe name in such a manner and through such a medium as per the\ndiscretion of the bank or the RBI. Therefore, the submission that though\nthe notice could be given it should not be with the photograph and there\nis nothing in the provision of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_39\">SARFAESI Act</a> or the Rules which\nprovide for publication of the photograph cannot be accepted on two\ncounts,\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">(a)   that every detail need not be provided in the Act or the Rules once\nit refers to the publication of notice, meaning thereby, the underlying idea\nor the object is to give information to the public about the\ndefaulter/borrower with regard to the transactions.</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                      Page 14 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                                  15 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                        JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">(b)   Further, de hors the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_40\">SARFAESI Act</a> and the\nRules, as rightly submitted, it is pursuant to the independent\nagreement/writing agreed and accepted by the borrower at the time of\ntaking the advance which empower the bank pursuant to such mutual\nagreement between the parties the publication of the notice with\nphotograph is sought to be made.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">20.   As stated above, it has been accepted that the bank will have\nunqualified discretion to publish in such a manner and through such a\nmedium as may be decided by the bank. Therefore, what is emphasised\nis publication of the name and it does not necessarily confine to the\nmanner of publication that the notice may be published but the\nphotograph could not be published. As it is submitted, what is relevant is\npublication with the discretion of the bank which may in turn include\n&quot;with photograph&quot;. It is a commonly accepted norm that even for filling\nup of the form for opening of an account, the photograph of the applicant\nis required to be affixed. In the same way, the notice could be with the\nphotograph as may be decided by the bank in its discretion which cannot\nbe questioned. As stated above, there is no question of lack of authority\nor power with the bank in publishing such notice with photograph both\nby virtue of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_41\">SARFAESI Act</a> which provide for\npublication   of     notice   coupled    with     the   fact   that   when   the\nborrower/defaulter like the petitioners having agreed and accepted by\nway of agreement or writing at the time of taking advance giving absolute\ndiscretion to the bank to publish the details in the mode and the manner at\nthe discretion of the bank, now it can hardly be questioned. In fact, it\nwould otherwise amount to wriggling out of the contractual obligation or\nthe undertaking which is not permissible. It is well accepted that a person\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                  Page 15 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                             16 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nhas to accept the agreement with all its obligations and cannot be\npermitted to approbate and reprobate and say that it will only take the\nadvantages under the contract but will not fulfill the obligations agreed\nand accepted under the same agreement. In other words, once the\npublication of the notice is justified and permissible under the law as well\nas by an agreement between the parties, the Court would decline to\ninterfere in exercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_42\">Art. 226</a> as it is a matter of policy\nfor the bank to have recourse to enforcement of the security for recovery\nof the amount either under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_43\">SARFAESI Act</a> or de\nhors such provision under a mutual agreement executed by the borrower\nat the time of availing the advance.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">21.   Another facet of the submissions which have been canvassed very\nforcefully referring to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Art. 21</a> with much emphasis is the right to life\nwhich include the right to privacy or the right to reputation etc. It must be\nstated that by the judicial interpretation, the scope and meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Art. 21</a>\nhas been expanded and they have added             facets to the right to life\nincorporated under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, there is no\nquarrel with regard to the multifaceted meaning with different shades\ngiven to right to life under the Constitution with the interpretative process\nby the higher courts including the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court. However, at the\nsame time, it has also been well accepted that such a right cannot be\nclaimed as an absolute right.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">22.   There are divergent views on this issue with regard to publication\nof photograph and the powers of the bank to publish notice with\nphotograph. The Kerala High Court has decided that it is not permissible\nas it entrenches upon the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Art. 21</a> as it has an impact on\nthe reputation of the borrower, whereas the Hon&#x27;ble High Courts of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  Page 16 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                          17 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nMadras and Madhya Pradesh have taken different views with specific\nobservations referring to this very aspect. The High Court of Bombay in\na judgment in the case of D.J. Exim (India) Pvt Ltd. &amp; ors. (supra) has\nfocused on this very issue with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Art. 21</a> and right to reputation\nor right to privacy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_24\">23.   In such circumstances, there may be conflicting claims which need\nto be balanced. On one hand person&#x27;s right to privacy or &quot;right to be let\nalone&quot; with another person&#x27;s &quot;right to be informed&quot; has to be considered.\nThe bank as a public body subject to control by RBI is obliged to have\ncertain information which may have to be made public in public interest.\nTherefore, the right of privacy is an essential component of right to life as\nenvisaged by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">Art. 21.</a> However, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in a judgment\nreported in (1998) 8 SCC 296 in the case <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_50\">Mr. &#x27;X&#x27; v. Hospital &#x27;Z</a>&#x27;, has made\nclear that the right to privacy is not an absolute right. It has observed.</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      &quot;the right, however, is not absolute and may be lawfully restricted\n      for the prevention of crime, disorder or protection of health or\n      morals or protection of rights and freedom of others.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110957682\" id=\"span_25\">Similarly, in another judgment in the case of People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/110957682/\" id=\"a_51\">Civil\nLiberties v. Union of India</a>, reported in (2003) 4 SCC 399, arising out of a\nchallenge to the constitutional validity of the Representation of People\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 2002 dealing with the disclosure of information\nby a candidate, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court held,\n\n\n      &quot;by declaration of a fact, which is a matter of public record, that a\n      candidate was involved in various criminal cases, there is no\n      question of infringement of any right of privacy.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">24.   Similarly, it has been observed that declaration with regard to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                  Page 17 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                             18 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nassets or the income no such right could be claimed and it has to be\nconsidered with reference to the right to information by the people.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">25.   It is in this background, as stated above, the banks have, pursuant\nto the RBI circular or their own circular, evolved a mechanism by which\nevery defaulter&#x27;s name is not published with photograph and it is only\nafter proper scrutiny at the higher level and with the approval of the Chief\nManager, such publication of notice with photograph is permitted.\nTherefore, it cannot be said to be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Art. 21</a>, particularly when it\nis required to be balanced between the right of an individual like the\ndefaulter and the right of the bank or the public in general.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">26.   Again, while considering the right to privacy it is required to be\nstated that the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in a judgment in case of R. Rajagopal\nalias R.R. Gopal and anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu and ors., reported in\n(1994) 6 SCC 632 : AIR 1995 SC 264 has succinctly considered this\naspect that the right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept\noriginated in the field of Tort law which has now been recognized as an\nabsolute right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Art. 21.</a> Therefore, the right has two aspects\nor are two faces of the same coin,\n\n\n(1)   the general law of privacy which affords a tort action for damages\nresulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy, and\n\n\n(2)   the constitutional recognition given to the right to privacy which\nprotects personal privacy against unlawful Governmental invasion.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_28\">27.   Therefore, what we are concerned with is the second facet of the\nright where constitutional recognition is sought to be given to such right\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                 Page 18 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                         19 of 25\n         C/SCA/8323/2013                                       JUDGMENT\n\n\n\nof privacy.     Though the right to privacy is not enumerated as a\nfundamental right in our Constitution, it has been inferred from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Art. 21</a>\nwith the interpretative process by various pronouncements of the Hon&#x27;ble\nApex Court for which a useful reference can also be made to the\njudgment of the Apex Court reported in AIR 1975 SC 1378 in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_55\">Gobind v. State of M.P.</a> and AIR 1963 SC 1295 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_56\">Kharak\nSingh v. State of U.P</a> and ors.. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of R.\nRajagopal (supra) has clearly observed laying down broad guidelines,\n\n\n\n(1)   the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\n      guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right\n      to be let alone.&quot; A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his\n      own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing\n      and education among other matters. None can publish anything\n      concerning the above matters without his consent - whether truthful\n      or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he\n      would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and\n      would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however be\n      different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or\n      voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">(2)   The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\n      concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such\n      publication is based upon public records including Court records.\n      This is for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public\n      record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a\n      legitimate subject for comment by press and media among others.\n      We are, however, of the opinion that in the interest of decency\n      (<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 19(2)</a>) an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a\n      female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a\n      like offense should not further be subjected to the indignity of her\n      name and the incident being published in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">(3)   There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above - indeed,\n      this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of\n      public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\n      remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  Page 19 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                            20 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n      to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official\n      duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts\n      and statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\n      that the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\n      disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the\n      dependent (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\n      after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for\n      him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the\n      publications is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n      personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and\n      would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters\n      not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys\n      the same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2)\n      above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by\n      the power to punish for contempt of Court and the Parliament and\n      Legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_59\">Articles 105</a> and\n      <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_60\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions\n      to this rule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">(4)   So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and\n      institutions exercising Governmental power are concerned, they\n      cannot maintain a suit for damages for defaming them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">(5)   Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_61\">Official Secrets Act,\n      1923</a>, or any similar enactment or provision having the force of law\n      does not bind the press or media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">(6)   There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or\n      to impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">28.   Thus, the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be\nlet alone.&quot; A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\nfamily, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education\namong other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above\nmatters without his consent - whether truthful or otherwise and whether\nlaudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to\nprivacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                  Page 20 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                          21 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                      JUDGMENT\n\n\n\ndamages. Position may, however be different, if a person voluntarily\nthrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a\ncontroversy. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has also referred to the exception\nthis rule. It is very evident that when such publication is made by the\nState or the authority or other organ exercising governmental powers the\nsuit for damages cannot be maintained.           In fact,   as the person has\nconsented or invited such publication voluntarily out of free will as a part\nof mutual obligation under an agreement it would stare in the face and no\nsuch claim for violation of right to privacy or reputation an be claimed by\nany such person.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">29.   It is required to be mentioned that the fact that the publication of\nnotice with photograph has a social impact and perhaps that is the\nreason the defaulters/borrowers like the petitioners are more concerned\nwhich in turn is indication of the fact that it is a more effective measure\nfor recovery as the person would like to have his reputation protected and\ntherefore would clear the outstanding dues and would not make the\ndefault. Therefore, though the submissions have been made that it is arm-\ntwisting it could not be readily accepted. In fact, it is rather an effective\nremedy as it has a reference to some kind of social impact. It is required\nto be mentioned at this stage that even for criminal justice system the\ntheory of reformation or deterrence have advocated about social impact or\nsocial sanction being imposed which could be more effective.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"793946\" id=\"span_32\"><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">30.   A useful reference can be made to the observations made by the\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of R. Rajagopal (supra) and relied upon in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/793946/\" id=\"a_63\">Phoolan Devi v. Shekhar Kapoor</a>, reported in (1995) 57 DLT\n154 : (1995) 32 DRJ 142.</p></span><pre id=\"pre_4\">\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                 Page 21 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                         22 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                    JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">31.   It is also required to be considered with reference to the right of the\nbank or financial institution to protect its outstanding dues and also as a\npublic body having a public duty of passing information to the general\npublic with regard to the financial transaction of the defaulters like the\npetitioners. In fact, the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_64\">Right to Information Act</a> has been made for\ngranting more information to the public at large. In the facts of the case,\nsuch information may not be given individually but when the bank in\nexercise of its statutory powers or under an agreement is obliged to give a\nnotice it cannot be interpreted narrowly that it has a right to publish the\nnotice but it does not necessarily mean with photograph. In fact, it is one\nof the modes of publication and the public notice with or without\nphotograph is a matter which is better left to the institution rather than the\ncourt intervening.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">32.   One more aspect which is required to be considered is, as rightly\nsubmitted by learned advocate Ms. Raval, that the RBI is having a master\ncircular by way of guideline which provides for internal mechanism to\nhave some scrutiny before such publication. It has been pointed out that\nit is not that in case of every defaulter it is published with photographs\nand care has been taken so that it does not affect the reputation of a\nperson though he is a borrower who has defaulted. It provides that the\npapers would be placed and only with the approval of Chief Manager it\ncould be published and there is a committee also which would scrutinize\nthe papers. This itself suggests that even the exercise of discretion under\nan agreement is guided by some norms or mechanism. In other words,\neven though the borrower has agreed unconditionally and the bank\nhaving unqualified right to give publication of notice with photograph\nthat there have to be in place some mechanism so that it is not exercised\nin every case. Therefore, it is in this background the court would not be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                  Page 22 of 24</span>\n\n\n\n                                                                          23 of 25\n          C/SCA/8323/2013                                  JUDGMENT\n\n\n\njustified to interfere with such discretion in exercise of discretion under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_65\">Art. 226.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">33.    The scope of judicial review in exercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_66\">Art.226</a>\nis well defined and broad guidelines have been <a href=\"/doc/793946/\" id=\"a_67\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble\nApex Court in this regard. Though the concept of judicial review refers\nto the exercise of such power or judicial review with care and\ncircumspection, meaning thereby, it is not a case of lack of jurisdiction\nbut rather a caution and self-imposed limitation before exercising such\ndiscretion.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">34.
