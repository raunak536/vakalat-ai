The Court,\n                          however directed the aforesaid hotel as also the concerned mobile agencies\n                          to ensure that records in terms of the impugned orders are preserved.\n                          Consequently, the records in terms of the impugned orders have been duly\n                          preserved in accordance with this Court&#x27;s directions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          10.   In support of the petition, Ms. Preeti Singh, learned counsel for the\n                          petitioner begins by contending that the learned Family Court has failed to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                  Page 5 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                     Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          appreciate that no prima facie case of adultery against the petitioner was\n                          made out thereby warranting issuance of directions to Hotel Fairmont to\n                          send the reservation details of the petitioner&#x27;s stay or to the mobile agencies\n                          for sending his CDRs in sealed cover. She contends that the learned Family\n                          Court has proceeded to pass the impugned order solely on the basis of bald\n                          allegations of adultery and cruelty levelled by the respondent against the\n                          petitioner without appreciating the fact that no material was brought on\n                          record by the respondent to establish adultery on the petitioner&#x27;s part. The\n                          petitioner went to Jaipur for some official work and happened to co-\n                          incidentally meet his friend, who was also staying in Hotel Fairmont at the\n                          same time when the petitioner visited Jaipur. Merely because the petitioner\n                          was found sitting with his friend in the common areas of the hotel could not,\n                          in any manner, be construed as adultery being committed by him. She\n                          contends that it was incumbent upon the respondent to first establish a prima\n                          facie case for adultery, which she failed to do. The learned Family Court has\n                          passed the impugned orders without even discussing as to a how a prima\n                          facie case was made out against the petitioner and has gone ahead to accept\n                          the respondent&#x27;s meritless plea that these documents were necessary for\n                          proving the charge of adultery and cruelty against him. In support of her\n                          plea that such directions could not have been passed without the respondent\n                          establishing a prima facie case she seeks to rely on a decision of the Apex\n                          Court in Sharda v.

By drawing my attention to the prayers sought by the respondent in\n                          her application, she contends that vide the said application, the respondent\n                          had sought directions to preserve the reservation details and CDRs of Room\n                          219 or of any such room the petitioner stayed in.

The respondent clearly failed\n                          to conclusively demonstrate that the petitioner was staying with his friend in\n                          Room No. 219. Furthermore, the photographs, on which heavy reliance has\n                          been placed by the respondent, itself showed that the petitioner was in the\n                          company of his friend and her daughter in public areas of the hotel and that\n                          too in broad daylight. She thus contends that once there was no proof that\n                          the petitioner had been staying in the hotel room with his lady friend, the\n                          Court could ought not to have directed a roving and fishing enquiry so as to\n                          collect evidence for the respondent. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"951956\" id=\"span_37\">In support of her plea, she seeks to place\n                          reliance on the decisions of the Apex Court in Sharda (supra)and <a href=\"/doc/951956/\" id=\"a_7\">Martin\n                          Burn Ltd. v.

Ms. Singh next submits that directions issued by the learned Family\n                          Court for preserving the CDRs in respect of mobile nos. 9811484848 and\n                          9310484848 for the period between 01.06.2021 to 30.06.2022 were also\n                          wholly without any basis. She submits that no useful purpose would be\n                          achieved by calling for the CDRs as same cannot in any manner, establish\n                          that the petitioner had indulged in acts of adultery and cruelty. Adultery, she\n                          contends is an offence punishable by law wherein a person indulges in\n                          sexual intercourse outside marriage and in order to prove the said offence,\n                          there has to be conclusive proof of the person indulging in such sexual acts.\n                          The same would therefore require much more than summoning of the CDRs.\n                          Calling for the records of the aforesaid mobile nos. of the petitioner would,\n                          at best, reflect his tower location, individuals whom the petitioner contacted\n                          either in the regular course or for the purposes of his business as also the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                    Page 7 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                     Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          duration of his calls.

She further submits that the directions issued by the learned Family\n                          Court also amount to infringement of the right to privacy, not only of the\n                          petitioner but also of his friend and her daughter, who are not at all\n                          connected with the lis between the parties. If the prayer of the respondent\n                          were to be allowed by this Court, the same would cast grave aspersions not\n                          only on the repute and character of the woman whom the petitioner co-\n                          incidentally met at the hotel but would also put a question mark on the\n                          legitimacy and paternity of the minor child, which she contends should not\n                          be permitted in any manner. Furthermore, as per Section 112 read with\n                          <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the birth of a child during the\n                          continuance of valid marriage is treated as conclusive proof of the child\n                          being legitimate. The object of the said provision is to accord undisputed\n                          legitimacy to a child born out of a valid marriage and to prevent an\n                          unwarranted inquiry into the paternity of the child whose parents, at the\n                          relevant time, had access to each other. Such a presumption can be rebutted\n                          only by strong, conclusive and clear evidence to the contrary.         She,\n                          therefore, contends that once there is neither any dispute regarding the\n                          validity of the marriage of the woman whom the petitioner met at Hotel\n                          Fairmont, Jaipur nor has any evidence been led by the respondent to show\n                          that the marriage of the woman with her husband was invalid, the child born\n                          out of that marriage would, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, in\n                          itself be considered as a legitimate child of that woman.

This she contends, is wholly impermissible and would cause\n                          grave and irreparable loss to the child as there would be a lifelong stigma on\n                          her existence. Such aspersions regarding the legitimacy of the child should\n                          not be permitted by the Court in any manner. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"62123684\" id=\"span_50\">In support of her plea, she\n                          seeks to place reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/62123684/\" id=\"a_10\">Aparna Ajinkya\n                          Firodia vs. Ajinkya Arun Firodia</a>,(2023) SCC Online SC 161.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">                          14.   Her next submission is that the details of the CDRs sought to be\n                          summoned by the respondent would not serve any purpose but would\n                          instead arm the respondent with information regarding the petitioner&#x27;s\n                          business deals and would therefore be used as a tool to defame him and\n                          tarnish his reputation in the society.    The only aim and motive of the\n                          respondent is to defame the petitioner and his family members as is evident\n                          from her past conduct wherein she had filed numerous complaints against\n                          the petitioner and his family members. In fact, even as on date, 8 criminal\n                          complaints are pending adjudication, causing grave hardship not only to the\n                          petitioner but also his family members who are being unnecessarily harassed\n                          by the respondent. The petitioner has been socially boycotted from the\n                          society which has resulted in a situation whereby he has been left with no\n                          household staff to take care of his aged parents and look after the daily\n                          chores.

She submits that as per <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, if a\n                          man refuses to answer a question, which he is not compelled by law to\n                          answer but the answer to it might cause loss to him in matters unconnected\n                          with the matter in relation to which it is asked, the Court may not draw an\n                          adverse inference against him. In the present case, if the directions issued by\n                          the learned Family Court are allowed to stand, the same would have far\n                          reaching consequences for the petitioner as the same would not only amount\n                          to infringement of his privacy but will also gravely affect his relationship\n                          with his friend, his business colleagues and with every individual associated\n                          with him in life.

He contends that the respondent had approached\n                          the learned Family Court not on the basis of mere speculations as alleged by\n                          the petitioner but with conclusive proof of her husband staying in Hotel\n                          Fairmont, Jaipur with another woman outside their marriage for a specific\n                          period, i.e., from 29.04.2022 to 01.05.2022 and had also filed photographs to\n                          show that her husband was in the close company of another woman during\n                          the said period. The establishment of a prima facie case against the\n                          petitioner is also evident from the fact that the petitioner has neither denied\n                          staying in the said hotel with his friend from 29.04.2022 to 01.05.2022 nor\n                          has till date, willingly produced the hotel booking records which are in his\n                          possession. He, therefore, submits that the learned Family Court was\n                          justified in issuing the directions for sending the reservation details and call\n                          detail records to the Court in a sealed cover.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">                          19.    He next submits that while issuing the impugned directions, the\n                          learned Family Court was well aware of the fact that the reservation details\n                          and call detail records being sought by the respondent were necessary for\n                          adjudication of the lis pending between the parties. The respondent has filed\n                          the petition for divorce against the petitioner on the grounds of adultery and\n                          cruelty and the documents being sought would be crucial in establishing the\n                          said charges against him. The petitioner deliberately made hotel reservations\n                          with the intention of indulging in adulterous activities with his friend and as\n                          per the respondent&#x27;s information stayed in the same room with her in Hotel\n                          Fairmont, Jaipur from 29.04.2022 to 01.05.2022. The summoning of the\n                          reservation details would therefore be necessary to establish the charge of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                     Page 13 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                     Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          adultery. Furthermore, the call detail records would also be relevant to prove\n                          the proximity of the relationship between the petitioner and his female\n                          friend; the frequency and duration of the calls made by the petitioner to his\n                          friend would be instrumental in determining the degree of closeness between\n                          them. Moreover, in his written statement filed before the learned Family\n                          Court, the petitioner had taken a totally contrary stand claiming that he had\n                          gone to Jaipur on an official trip along with his female colleague for which\n                          purpose two rooms were reserved in Hotel Fairmont. This in itself, he\n                          contends is sufficient to prima facie show that the petitioner in order to\n                          conceal his adulterous acts is trying to take contradictory stands before the\n                          learned Family Court to somehow prevent disclosure of the details regarding\n                          his stay in the hotel being well aware that this disclosure would in itself\n                          show adultery on his part. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"48128080\" id=\"span_87\">In support of his plea, he seeks to place to\n                          reliance on a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Civil Revision\n                          Petition No.2385 and 2466 of 2018 titled <a href=\"/doc/48128080/\" id=\"a_18\">K Srinivas Rao vs Nalam Naga\n                          Kamala</a>.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                          20.

The only threshold required to be met is that in the opinion of the\n                          Family Court, the evidence sought to be summoned would help in the\n                          effective adjudication of the matter. Whether the evidence would ultimately\n                          be accepted as a proof of fact is irrelevant at this stage.

The summoning of this record\n                          therefore squarely falls within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts\n                          Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_94\">21.    He further submits that the petitioner&#x27;s plea that the summoning of the\n                          reservation details and the call detail records amounts to infringement of his\n                          right to privacy, is wholly misconceived and without any merit.             Even\n                          though the right to privacy of an individual is an intrinsic part of right to life\n                          and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the said\n                          right is not an absolute one and is subject to certain reasonable restrictions in\n                          cases where public interests are involved. By placing reliance on the\n                          decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_23\">Mr.X v. Hospital Z</a>(1998) 8 SCC 296, he\n                          submits that in cases where there is a clash between the right to privacy and\n                          a right that would advance public morality or public interests, the right to\n                          privacy should pave way for the latter as moral considerations cannot be\n                          ignored by the Courts. He further submits that the Courts must ensure that\n                          right to fair trial, which involves public justice and has wider ramifications\n                          should not suffer at the expense of right to privacy and therefore a proper\n                          balance is required to be struck between the two rights. In the present case,\n                          the offence being alleged is that of adultery, which involves public morality\n                          and a legitimate/larger public interest. The petitioner, therefore, cannot take\n                          defence of infringement of his right to privacy so as to curtail the\n                          respondent&#x27;s right to fair trial as the cause of public justice would suffer if\n                          the petitioner&#x27;s prayers are allowed.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"170404652\" id=\"span_95\">In support of his plea, he seeks to place\n                          reliance on the decisions of the Apex Court in Diapnwita Roy v.

He, therefore, submits that the respondent\n                          should be accorded a fair chance to seek the documents which would be\n                          necessary for her to establish the charge of adultery against the petitioner.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">                          22.    Mr. Jauhar next submits that the petitioner cannot be permitted to\n                          take defence of plea that the directions to summon the reservation details\n                          and call detail records amounts to infringement of privacy of his friend or\n                          would bring the legitimacy of the minor child in question. By drawing my\n                          attention to the reply filed by the petitioner to application filed by the\n                          respondent, he submits that the petitioner had stated that the directions\n                          issued by the learned Family Court would be perceived as a doubt upon the\n                          character and chastity of the petitioner&#x27;s friend. This, he contends, is\n                          indicative of the fact that the petitioner is himself pre-supposing that he\n                          stayed with his friend in the same room in the hotel and indulged in\n                          adulterous acts with her. The petitioner is well aware of the consequences\n                          that the documents summoned would disclose the true state of affairs and is\n                          therefore, taking a bald defence that the summoning of the documents would\n                          infringe his friend&#x27;s right to privacy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"999818\" id=\"span_102\">In support of his plea, he seeks to place\n                          reliance on a decision of a Coordinate Bench in <a href=\"/doc/999818/\" id=\"a_25\">Linda Constance Edwards\n                          v.

Furthermore, the respondent\n                          is not seeking any details of the room where the petitioner&#x27;s lady friend\n                          stayed but only of the room where the petitioner stayed between 29.04.2022\n                          to 01.05.2022 and therefore, there is no question of infringement of privacy\n                          of the petitioner&#x27;s lady friend.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">                          24.

Before dealing with the rival submissions of the parties, it would be\n                          apposite to note the statutory provisions relating to this specialised branch,\n                          i.e., Family Law which specifically provide that the Family Courts are not\n                          bound by the restrictions imposed by the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_26\">Indian Evidence Act</a>.

Equally so, in the\n                          face of the settled rule of evidence as augmented by <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_35\">section 14</a> of\n                          the Family Courts Act, it would be unwarranted to bring into the\n                          picture subjective and undefined ethical and moral values or\n                          considerations, to decide if evidence should even be receivable\n                          by a Family Court.

It must be borne in mind that Family Courts\n                          have been established to deal with what are essentially sensitive,\n                          personal disputes relating to dissolution of marriage, restitution\n                          of conjugal rights, legitimacy of children, guardianship, custody,\n                          and access to minors; which matters, by the very nature of the\n                          relationship from which they arise, involve issues that are\n                          private, personal and involve intimacies. It is easily foreseeable\n                          therefore, that in most cases that come before the Family Court,\n                          the evidence sought to be marshalled would relate to the private\n                          affairs of the litigating parties. If <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_38\">section 14</a> is held not to apply\n                          in its full expanse to evidence that impinges on a person&#x27;s right to\n                          privacy, then <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_39\">section 14</a> may as well be effaced from the statute.\n                          And yet, falling back upon the general rule of evidence, the test\n                          of admissibility would only be relevance; and accordingly, even\n                          ignoring <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_40\">section 14</a>, fundamental considerations of fair trial and\n                          public justice would warrant that evidence be received if it is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                          CM(M) 64 of 2023                                      Page 19 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                      Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                                relevant, regardless of how it is collected.

The aforesaid provision undoubtedly declares that the factum of a\n                          child being born during the continuance of a valid marriage between his/her\n                          mother and a man would be conclusive proof of the legitimacy of him/her\n                          being a legitimate child of the man. However, in the facts of the present case\n                          nothing turns upon this provision. As rightly contended by the learned\n                          counsel for the respondent, the paternity of the child is not at all being\n                          assailed by the respondent, who has infact, not even given her particulars\n                          either in the petition seeking divorce or in the application leading to the\n                          impugned orders. All that has been alleged by the respondent is that her\n                          husband is in an adulterous relationship with a lady from which relationship,\n                          they have an illegitimate child. At the cost of repetition, it may be noted that\n                          there is no prayer whatsoever regarding the legitimacy of the child or\n                          regarding the validity of the marriage between her mother and the man with\n                          whom she is stated to be presently married.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                          30.   Having dealt with the statutory provisions, I may now proceed to deal\n                          with the other contentions of the parties. The primary plea of the petitioner,\n                          as noted hereinabove is that the respondent has not been able to establish a\n                          prima facie case of the petitioner indulging in acts of adultery and the\n                          documents sought by her would not at all be relevant to prove her baseless\n                          allegations of cruelty and adultery. The petitioner has also urged that the\n                          disclosure of this information would amount to infringement of not only his\n                          right to privacy but also that of his friend and her minor daughter who are\n                          not connected with the lis in any manner. On the other hand, the plea of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                     Page 21 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                     Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          respondent is that the documents being sought by her are crucial for her to\n                          prove adultery on her husband&#x27;s part and this information as summoned by\n                          the learned Family Court, would fall within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 14</a> of the\n                          Family Courts Act. It is her case that from the photographs placed on record,\n                          she has been able to clearly prove a prima facie case against the petitioner\n                          and if this information was not called for, she may not be able to prove the\n                          serious charges of adultery against the husband. Furthermore, she was\n                          seeking information only about her legally wedded husband and not about a\n                          third party as she had neither sought the details of the room where the lady\n                          was staying, nor asked for the paternity test of the minor child; her prayer\n                          being simply for collecting all the details regarding the room where her\n                          husband was staying between 29.04.2022 to 01.05.2022 at Hotel Fairmont,\n                          Jaipur. It is her plea that even if this information were to incidentally\n                          disclose the details of the room where the lady was staying, the respondent&#x27;s\n                          right to seek this information about her husband&#x27;s whereabouts for this\n                          period could not be curtailed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">                          31.   From these rival submissions of the parties, it emerges that two\n                          primary issues arise for consideration of this Court. The first being as to\n                          whether the respondent has been able to make out a prima facie case and the\n                          information sought by her can be said to be relevant for determining the lis\n                          between the parties. The second question which needs to be answered is as\n                          to whether the information sought by the respondent would amount to\n                          infringement of the right to privacy of the petitioner or of his lady friend or\n                          that of the minor child and in the event the answer to this question is in the\n                          affirmative, whether this right must give way to the respondent&#x27;s right to fair\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                    Page 22 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                     Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          trial by seeking to procure evidence which would fall within the ambit of\n                          <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"36902367\" id=\"span_147\">32.   Having noted the two issues which arise for my consideration, I may\n                          begin by dealing with the first issue. The petitioner has vehemently urged\n                          that the respondent has not been able to make out a prima facie case against\n                          him and the information sought by her is not at all relevant for proving the\n                          charge of adultery. I am, however, unable to agree. It is an admitted position\n                          that the respondent has not only placed a number of photographs showing\n                          the petitioner in close proximity with his lady friend but has also provided\n                          the details of the room and the dates on which according to her, her legally\n                          wedded husband was staying with the lady. Even though, learned counsel\n                          for the petitioner is right in urging by relying on <a href=\"/doc/36902367/\" id=\"a_47\">Jayantibhai Shravanbhai\n                          Rajput</a> (supra) and Veeraman (supra) that the photographs produced by the\n                          respondent where the petitioner is seen sitting in public area with his friend,\n                          do not by themselves establish adultery, it cannot be said that they do not\n                          even point towards a prima facie case. Furthermore, what needs to be noted\n                          that the petitioner has taken contradictory stands regarding the presence of\n                          his lady friend in the hotel. While in his written statement he has stated that\n                          he was on an official trip to Jaipur, along with his female colleague and\n                          therefore, two rooms were booked for them in Hotel Fairmont, in response\n                          to the application he has claimed that he met the lady friend by chance in the\n                          hotel as she was also co-incidentally staying there. The respondent is the\n                          estranged wife of the petitioner who obviously does not has any direct\n                          evidence of her husband indulging in acts of adultery. By resort to <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_48\">Section\n                          14</a> of the Family Courts Act, she is, only trying to seek production of\n                          evidence which she reasonably believes will prove her charge of adultery\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                    Page 23 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                      Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          which by its very nature can be inferred only from circumstances.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"999818\" id=\"span_154\">In this\n                          regard, reference may be made to the observations of the Coordinate Bench\n                          of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/999818/\" id=\"a_49\">Linda Constance Edwards</a> (supra)which reads as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                 &quot;20. It is said that the adultery is committed in darkness and\n                                 secrecy and, therefore, it is difficult to provide a direct proof.\n                                 Rather eyewitness account or photographic account of\n                                 evidence of intercourse is taken as offending.

It is rare that the parties are surprised in direct\n                                 act of adultery. In the opinion of Sir William Scott in Lovedon\n                                 v. Lovedon, 2 Hagg Con, 1810 Australian Family Law 455),\n                                 &quot;the only general rule that can be laid down upon the subject\n                                 is that the circumstances must be such as would lead the\n                                 guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man to the\n                                 conclusion, for it is not to lead a harsh and intemperate\n                                 judgment, moving upon appearances that are equally capable\n                                 of two interpretations, neither is it to be a matter of artificial\n                                 reasoning, judging upon such things differently from what\n                                 would strike the careful and cautious consideration of a\n                                 discreet man.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"201952\" id=\"span_155\">21. Thus the adultery is to be inferred from circumstances\n                                 which must indicate inclination, guilty intention and\n                                 opportunity to commit adultery. Bed room evidence is one of\n                                 such strong circumstances as way back in 1909 in <a href=\"/doc/201952/\" id=\"a_50\">Kerr v.\n                                 Kerr</a>, 114 App. Div. 1421, it was observed that where man\n                                 and a woman who are not husband and wife have bed room\n                                 privacy, there is strong inference of adultery as they do not\n                                 sing prayers there&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                          33.   There can therefore be no gainsaying that direct evidence of adultery\n                          can rarely be available. I am therefore of the considered opinion that the\n                          respondent has not only been able to make out a prima facie case against the\n                          petitioner but also that the information which she is seeking would definitely\n                          be relevant for proving the charge of adultery which she has levelled against\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                CM(M) 64 of 2023                                     Page 24 of 35</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">Signing Date:10.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">15:46:39</span>\n                                                                     Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:3197\n\n\n\n\n                          her husband.

At this stage, I may also refer to the decisions in Vishal Vashisht\n                          (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/1550109/\" id=\"a_58\">Harpreet Singh</a> (supra) relied upon by the petitioner to contend\n                          that it is not permissible for a party to lean on the Court to collect evidence\n                          as it is for the party to prove his/her case by leading cogent evidence. There\n                          can be no quarrel with the well settled principle that generally it is for the\n                          party approaching the Court to lead evidence in support of its case but what\n                          needs to be appreciated is that when the Court is dealing with this special\n                          law relating to family matters, <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act is carved\n                          in a slightly different manner giving very wide powers to the Family Court\n                          in matters of receiving evidence. It is therefore, open for the Family Court to\n                          receive any evidence which may assist the Court to effectively deal with the\n                          dispute irrespective of whether the said evidence is relevant or admissible\n                          under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_60\">Indian Evidence Act</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170404652\" id=\"span_171\">As held in <a href=\"/doc/170404652/\" id=\"a_61\">Deepti Kapur</a> (supra), the\n                          proceedings before a Family Court stand on a different footing from the\n                          proceedings before a regular Civil Court where the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_62\">Indian\n                          Evidence Act</a> are fully applicable.

She has pleaded before\n                          the learned Family Court that she has no other means to prove except by\n                          securing information from the hotel and the mobile agencies, which plea has\n                          been accepted by the learned Family Court. Can it be said that the learned\n                          Family Court, in the light of the documents already placed on record, was\n                          unjustified in coming to her aid, is the question which needs to be answered\n                          by this Court. As held in <a href=\"/doc/999818/\" id=\"a_65\">Linda Constance Edwards</a> (supra) rarely would\n                          there be direct evidence of adultery. I am therefore of the considered view\n                          that when in a case like the present, when a wife seeks the help of the Court\n                          for procuring evidence which would go a long way to prove adultery on the\n                          part of her husband, the Court must step in; this would be in consonance\n                          with <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act which gives a leeway to the Court\n                          to consider evidence which may be not admissible or relevant under the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_67\">Indian Evidence Act</a>.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                          37.

Having given my thoughtful consideration as to whose right should\n                          prevail in the facts of the present case, I am inclined to accept the\n                          respondent&#x27;s plea. The petitioner&#x27;s claim is based solely on the right to\n                          privacy which, as held in <a href=\"/doc/185045812/\" id=\"a_93\">K.S. Puttuswamy</a> (supra) and Joseph Shine\n                          (supra) is not an absolute right; on the other hand, the respondent&#x27;s prayer is\n                          based not only on morality but also on specific rights granted under the\n                          Hindu Marriage Act and the Family Courts Act. I, therefore, have no\n                          hesitation in holding that the respondent&#x27;s right must prevail and therefore,\n                          find no reason to interfere with the impugned orders. The learned Family\n                          Court by way of the impugned orders has sought records which pertain only\n                          to the respondent&#x27;s husband and not to his friend or her daughter. There is,\n                          therefore, no question of their right of privacy being violated in any manner.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185045812\" id=\"span_223\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1550109\" id=\"span_224\">42.
