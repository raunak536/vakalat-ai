But that is a\n                            self-imposed restriction. But once the injustice is patent and it is\n                            likely to affect the society at large, that will be a circumstance to\n                            exercise the extraordinary powers and see that justice is restored.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508554\" id=\"span_20\">35.In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1508554/\" id=\"a_15\">B.C.Chaturvedi Vs.

It does not operate in a\n                            vacuum. As social norms and values change, laws too have to be\n                            re-interpreted, and recast.

Thus, the\n\n                      Constitutional Courts are duty bound to issue certain directions to the\n\n                      Government to regulate the discipline and decorum in the Government Schools\n\n                      and Educational institutions, so as to ensure the Constitutional perspectives and\n\n                      the Philosophies are reached out.
