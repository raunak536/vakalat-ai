I start the narration of facts with the submissions of Mr.Ilaiyaraja, despite\n\n                 the fact that he is the plaintiff only in the second suit. This is for the reason that the\n\n                 entire lis revolves around the ownership of the Intellectual property in the music\n\n                 compositions/musical works of Mr.Ilaiyaraja. The Annexure to the 2nd suit contains\n\n                 reference to 1074 compositions. The Schedule and Exhibit to the Sound Recording\n\n                 Licence Agreement dated 27.11.2007 relied upon by Agi Music Sdn Bhd refers to\n\n                 678 films in which 3811 songs have been composed by Mr.Ilaiyaraja and the\n\n                 Annexure to the written statement filed by Echo, D2 in the 2nd suit, refers to\n\n                 Agreements with Producers in relation to 310 films in which Mr.Ilaiyaraja has\n\n                 composed music, of which 259 have been filed and marked as evidence by Echo. It\n\n                 thus seems appropriate to me that the narration of facts commences with his\n\n                 submissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                            6</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">                          5.

This has led to a serious objection by\n\n                 Agi Music that Mr.Ilaiyaraja is patently guilty of suppression of facts particularly\n\n                 seeing as the 1st suit has been filed by Agi Music making claims based upon the\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                            9</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 aforesaid agreements even as early as in 2013 in which summons had been served\n\n                 upon Mr.Ilaiyaraja by the time the 2nd suit came to be filed.

The argument of Mr.Ilaiyaraja is that the provisions of\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 19(5)</a> of the Act provides for a period of five (5) years, by default, if the\n\n                 agreement for assignment of copyright was silent as to the period of such\n\n                 assignment. Thus, according to Mr.Ilaiyaraja, by statutory mandate, the assignment\n\n                 of the rights to his wife was for a period of five years only. Consequently, both the\n\n                 SRLA and SPA dated 24.11.2007 cease to have any effect from 27th November\n\n                 2012. In any event, Mrs.Jeevaraja had passed away on 31.10.2011 and thus the\n\n                 assignment dated 24.11.2007 could not have survived thereafter post her demise.\n\n                 For these reasons, Mr.Ilaiyaraja contends that the assignment of his copyright and\n\n                 sound recording rights as well as the subsequent licenses/rights came to an end on\n\n                 31.10.2011 itself and at any rate on 26.11.2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">                          (xi) However, according to Mr.Ilaiyaraja, Agi Music has continued to exploit\n\n                 his work unfairly and even after the lapsing of the agreements, infringing his\n\n                 copyright as well as sound recording rights compulsively.

This was a clear violation of the exclusive right granted to Agi Music, in force\n\n                 for a period of ten years. Though several attempts were made to resolve the\n\n                 dispute with Mr.Ilaiyaraja, he was not amenable to the requests of Agi Music\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                          (iv) Agi Music has also been litigating on behalf of Mr.Ilaiyaraja and was\n\n                 incurring substantial expenditure on his behalf to protect his copyright and its rights\n\n                 under the agreement when other persons/entities have attempted to interfere with\n\n                 the same.

In the light of the entitlement of\n\n                 Mr.Ilaiyaraja to such ‘sound recording’, the exclusive right given to Agi Music is\n\n                 lawful and cannot be violated.

It is a recording company in the business of purchasing ‘sound recordings’\n\n                 from producers of cinematograph films and using the same to manufacture\n\n                 cassettes and compact discs for sale.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                          (vii) Echo states that it has obtained licenses/assignments for the ‘sound\n\n                 recordings’ based on the ‘musical works’ of Mr.Ilaiyaraja from various producers of\n\n                 the films, who, according to it are the owners of the such recordings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                          (viii) According to Echo, the suit is entirely misconceived as Mr.Ilaiyaraja is\n\n                 incorrect in the appreciation of the factual and legal position in issue, to the extent\n\n                 to which he believes that it is the composer of the music who holds the copyright in\n\n                 this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">                          (ix)The suit is also contested on the ground of lack of maintainability stating\n\n                 that it is bad for the misjoinder of parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">                          (x) <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_18\">The Act</a> provides that a ‘sound recording’ right vests only in the producer,\n\n                 who is both its ‘Author’ as well as ‘First Owner’. Mr.Ilaiyaraja has been engaged by\n\n                 various producers to compose music for the films they produce. He thus, according\n\n                 to Echo, enjoys only the status of an employee, employed to compose music for\n\n                 their films and holds no other right barring the aforesaid. Once the musical work\n\n                 has been commissioned for the purpose of a specific film, the composer receives\n\n                 adequate remuneration in this regard from the producer.

This confirms the factum of acceptance and acquiescence of Echo that\n\n                 Mr.Ilaiyaraja holds rights in the ‘sound recordings’.

However, such royalty has been paid on the basis of the\n\n                 arrangement with the producers and not on the basis of the alleged ownership of\n\n                 the work of Mr.Ilaiyaraja.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                          (xiii) Echo confirms that it holds valid Assignment Agreements with different\n\n                 producers, 310 in number, out of which 259, ranging between the years 1981 to\n\n                 1991, have been marked and filed as documents.

His legal argument is that he has the unbridled right to exploit his ‘musical\n\n                 works’ in his admitted capacity as the ‘author’ of such work. For this proposition, he\n\n                 relies on the definitions of ‘author’, ‘cinematograph film’, ’infringing copy’,\n\n                 ‘producer’, ‘sound recording’, ‘work’, ‘composer’, ‘musical work’ and ‘adaption’ in\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1655540/\" id=\"a_19\">sections 2(d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/141918630/\" id=\"a_20\">2(f)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/61984705/\" id=\"a_21\">3(m)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/797096/\" id=\"a_22\">2(uu)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/160715538/\" id=\"a_23\">2(xx)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1635970/\" id=\"a_24\">2(y)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/135782188/\" id=\"a_25\">2(ffa)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/23169752/\" id=\"a_26\">2(p)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1812008/\" id=\"a_27\">2(a)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                          (xv) Thereafter, detailed reference is made to <a href=\"/doc/4010217/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_29\">14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_30\">17</a> to\n\n                 establish that he is the ‘first owner’ of the Copyright in the musical work, and thus\n\n                 is vested with the right of reproduction or any other form of exploitation of such\n\n                 work to the exclusion of any other person/entity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                          (xvi) As regards the stand of Echo as well as the 259 Agreements relied upon\n\n                 by it are concerned, the following specific arguments are advanced by Mr.Ilaiyaraja:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                          (a)<a href=\"/doc/53984144/\" id=\"a_31\">The Copyright Amendment Act, 1994</a> substitutes the word ‘record’\n\n                 wherever it occurred in the main Act with the phrase ‘sound recording’. The use of\n\n                 the phrase ‘sound recording’ is only prospective as seen in the notes of clauses\n\n                 when the Act was amended. Thus, the agreements relied upon by Echo would have\n\n                 to be read only as they are without interpolating the words ‘sound recording’\n\n                 therein. It is not the case of Echo that the words ‘sound recording’ have been\n\n                 substituted by way of an addendum to the original agreements and thus the\n\n                 agreements do not protect, in any way, the claims of Echo.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">http://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                             18</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">                          (b) This argument of non-marketability of ‘sound recordings’ on the ground\n\n                 that the agreements do not provide for the same, is countered vehemently by\n\n                 ECHO pointing out that rights over ‘sound recordings’ and ‘musical works’ have\n\n                 been provided for ever since the inception of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_32\">Copyright Act</a> in 1957.       <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_33\">The\n\n                 Act</a>, as it stood promulgated in 1957, provided for the same rights as the present\n\n                 Act does. In other words ‘sound recordings’ have always been intrinsic part of the\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_34\">Copyright Act</a> and the only change over time was the medium upon which the\n\n                 sound is recorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">                          (c) The version of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_35\">Copyright Act, 1957</a> as originally passed and the\n\n                 amended Act notified on 09.05.1995 are compared to show that no new rights have\n\n                 been created by the 1995 amendment in respect of ‘sound recording’ and such\n\n                 rights are an intrinsic part and parcel of the original Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">                          (d) The effect of the argument advanced by Mr.Ilaiyaraja would be to\n\n                 question whether at all such a right, viz., ‘sound recording’ exists and who owns the\n\n                 Copyright in that regard. This is inconceivable and a distortion of the law, according\n\n                 to Echo. Echo states that the media upon which music is recorded over time has\n\n                 changed in terms of advancement in technology and refinements thereof. Music\n\n                 was originally recorded upon a ‘disc’ or ‘record’ and connotes the medium itself\n\n                 upon which the recordings of sounds as well as medium was understood in the\n\n                 1950s when the statute was enacted. However, the word ‘record’ connotes only the\n\n                 factum of recording thereupon and reference to ‘sound recording’ should be read to\n\n                 be synonymous with the word ‘record’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                           19</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">                          (e) With the passage of time, the media upon which sounds were recorded\n\n                 increased manifold and as on date sound is recorded upon an extensive range and\n\n                 variety of media. In fact, today, one does not even require physical recording of\n\n                 sounds that can simply be downloaded from intangible spaces such as the Internet\n\n                 or the Cloud. It is for this reason that legislature has connoted the phrase ‘sound\n\n                 recording’ to merely indicate the act of preservation of the sound, whatever be and\n\n                 without restriction, of the medium.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                          (f) In summary, Echo canvases the position that ‘sound recordings’, though\n\n                 recorded in different media, were always a subject matter of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_36\">Copyright Act</a>,\n\n                 such right vesting only with the producers and Mr.Ilaiyaraja or any other composer\n\n                 for that matter did not retain any right over the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">                          (g) Mr.Ilaiyaraja then argues that the agreements relied upon by Echo are\n\n                 envisaged to survive, if at all, only during the existence of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_37\">Copyright Act, 1957</a>\n\n                 or modifications thereto ‘for the time being in force’, that is, during the tenure of\n\n                 the agreements itself being between 1981 and 1991.

Thus, the copyright held by a\n\n                 creator of a part of a film, would not be affected by the ownership of the Copyright\n\n                 in the entirety of the film, even if the latter was held by the producer.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">                          (xviii) He relies on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 17</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1046219/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2(d)(ii)</a> of\n\n                 the Act that protects the right of the ‘first owner’ of the Copyright, which, according\n\n                 to him, is himself.

Any licenses granted in excess of the period\n\n                 of assignments were invalid. Admittedly, the deed of assignment does not contain a\n\n                 term. In such circumstances, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 19(5)</a> of the Act mandate\n\n                 that the period would be five (5) years. Thus, according to him, the assignment\n\n                 agreement dated 24.11.2007 would survive only for a period of five (5) years and\n\n                 has expired as on 23.11.2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_68\">                          (vii) Moreover his wife, Mrs.Jeevaraja, had expired on 31.10.2011 and with\n\n                 her the assignment of the copyrights as well.

Even according to Agi Music Mr.Ilaiyaraja had approached Modern\n\n                 Cinemas, D2 in the 1st suit, only in 2013 after the assignment to Mrs.Jeevaraja had\n\n                 expired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">                          Single and composite transaction\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">                          (viii)Agi Music argues that the entire transaction as between Mr.Ilaiyaraja,\n\n                 Mrs.Jeeveraja and itself be viewed as a single arrangement and an implied term of\n\n                 10 years be read into the Assignment Agreement.

The agreement in that case did not mention a term and thus the\n\n                 Delhi High Court embarked upon the interpretation of the phrase used therein being\n\n                 ‘full right to publish throughout the world’.

Normally\n\n                 the practice of Agi Music was to make the payments for the previous financial year\n\n                 during the months of July to September. Thus, for the financial year 2012-13\n\n                 payments were due between July to September 2013. However, when Mr.Ilaiyaraja\n\n                 filed his written statement to C.S.No.308 of 2013 contending that the agreement\n\n                 between Agi Music and Mrs.Jeevaraja was only for 5 years, Agi Music did not make\n\n                 a serious attempt thereafter to remit royalties only by virtue of the stand of\n\n                 Mr.Ilaiyaraja. In fact, even after this an attempt was made on 04.08.2014 to\n\n                 deposit royalties for 2013-14 but Agi Music was unable to do so, since Mr.Ilaiyaraja\n\n                 had closed that particular bank account.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">                          (xiii)Agi also contests the 2nd suit on the ground of non-joinder of parties.\n\n                 Though Mrs.Jeevaraja passed away in 2011 and the 2nd suit filed in 2014, none of\n\n                 the legal heirs of Mrs.Jeevaraja have been made a party to the suit. Thus, the suit\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                                                 30</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. Agi Music also argues that the definition\n\n                 of the word ‘owner’ in the suit agreement includes ‘successor’ and seeing as\n\n                 Mrs.Jeevaraja had passed away on 31.10.2011, the agreement would continue to\n\n                 bind her legal heirs including her husband, Mr.Ilaiyaraja. This argument is negated\n\n                 pointing out that the assignment to Mrs.Jeevaraja was itself only for a period of five\n\n                 (5) years and even though upon expiry of the agreement, the rights reverted back\n\n                 to       Mr.Ilaiyaraja,   there   was   admittedly   no   documentation   entered   into   by\n\n                 Mr.Ilaiyaraja with Agi Music and thus, the question of continuation of the licence\n\n                 and publishing agreements does not arise at all. Though raised in the written\n\n                 submission this ground has not been seriously pursued in the course of arguments.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\">                            (xiv) In the course of the oral hearing, an argument is advanced by Agi\n\n                 Music, sailing along with Echo in its stand that the copyright in a ‘sound recording’\n\n                 vests only in the producer, that the words ‘sound recording’ appearing in the SRLA\n\n                 and SPA be struck off adopting the ‘blue pencil principle’ and be replaced instead by\n\n                 the words ‘musical works’. The argument is objected to on the ground that it is an\n\n                 afterthought and does not find place in the pleadings. In any event, and admittedly,\n\n                 royalty has been paid by Agi Music pursuant to agreement dated 24.11.2007 and\n\n                 there is no prayer for refund of the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">                            (xv) Then again, a contradictory stand is taken by Agi Music by adopting in\n\n                 full the arguments of Mr.Ilaiyaraja and supporting his stand that the music\n\n                 composer has full rights vested in him in respect of the ‘musical works’ that he\n\n                 composes.

One such\n\n                 is the absence of reference to the Assignment Agreement, SRLA and the SPA in the\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">\f                                                             47</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 plaint of Mr.Ilaiyaraja leading Agi Music to allege suppression as well as the\n\n                 argument of Mr.Ilaiyaraja that the documents relied upon by Agi Music are forged.\n\n                 Having stated so, he does not pursue the argument by seeking reference of the\n\n                 documents to forensic examination.

This is for the reason that it is the legal issues that have been\n\n                 pursued seriously by the parties in the course of the hearing and not the above\n\n                 fringe issues that are wholly immaterial to determine the crux of the suits. Thus, I\n\n                 restrict the discussions and conclusions to only the legal issues that arise and that\n\n                 have been argued before me.

The\n\n                 questions raised are, who can be said to be ‘owner’ of the ‘sound recording’ and\n\n                 whether Echo has obtained any right in respect of the ‘sound recordings’ from the\n\n                 producers of the scheduled films.

Echo is the company and Poompuhar the producer, and the agreement is\n\n                 for the assignment of the copyright for the exclusive right, unlimited in time, to\n\n                 make records from the ‘sound recordings’ embodied in the film ‘Paasapparavaigal’\n\n                 and the ‘sound recordings’ of any music, musical, literary, dramatic or artistic work\n\n                 that may have been recorded by the producer with the intent of incorporating the\n\n                 same in the film irrespective of whether or not it has been so incorporated.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">                          24. The agreement proceeds on the assumption that the producer holds such\n\n                 right to begin with and thus, there is no restriction or limitation placed upon him to\n\n                 effect such assignment to the company. The assignment of the copyright entitles\n\n                 Echo to make any other record embodying the same recording, to produce any\n\n                 other recording, to cause or permit performance of such recordings, to publish the\n\n                 works embodied in the recordings, broadcast the recordings by radio, to\n\n                 manufacture/ market/ sell /lease /licence /distribute/ advertise/ permit or exploit\n\n                 the recording in any manner whatsoever and permit others to do so such works and\n\n                 to control the physical property of the original recordings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">                          25. The agreement required the producer to supply, simultaneous or prior to\n\n                 the delivery of the cinematograph film/sound recording, the correct title(s), score(s)\n\n                 and details of composer(s) thereof together with information such as the names of\n\n                 recording artist(s), year and place of original recording and all other details relating\n\n                 to the works themselves.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_151\">                          26. Royalty is to be paid to the producer by the company based on the sales\n\n                 of records for which a methodology has been set out for the period when the\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                                                  54</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 recordings are protected under the Act. These are the aspects of the agreement as\n\n                 relevant to this matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">                          27. The producer of the film has assigned the entire rights in the musical\n\n                 work and songs in the cinematograph film to Echo. Obviously, the producer could\n\n                 not have passed on a better right to Echo then what he had had himself to begin\n\n                 with, which brings us to the legal issue of what the right is, that vested in the\n\n                 producer in the first instance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_153\">                          28. According to Mr.Ilaiyaraja, Echo proceeds on the fallacy that the producer\n\n                 is the owner of the ‘sound recording’/’musical work’ comprised in the films.\n\n                 However, since he has, at no point of time, assigned or transferred such rights to\n\n                 the producer, he retains the right in his music compositions as the first owner of the\n\n                 copyright comprised in these works. In such circumstances, he argues that when he\n\n                 continues to retain such works, there is no possibility of such works having been\n\n                 assigned to Echo by the producer, the latter not holding any right over the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">                          29. Both Echo as well as Mr.Ilaiyaraja have referred to and relied upon the\n\n                 several definitions and statutory provisions to support their respective stands. It is\n\n                 thus necessary at this juncture to refer to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_79\">Copyright Act</a> to\n\n                 understand the scheme of ownership under the Act. The statute uses two terms\n\n                 ‘author’ and ‘owner’, both having different and distinct meanings. The statutory\n\n                 provisions relevant to the resolution of the lis are as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">                             2(d) ‘author’ means,-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">                          (i)in relation to a literary or dramatic work, the author of the work;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">                          (ii)in relation to a musical work, the composer;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">http://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                                                         55</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">                                  (iii) in relation to an artistic work other than a photographer, the\n\n                                  artist;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">                                 (iv)in relation to a photograph, the person taking the photograph;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">                                 (v)in relation to a cinematograph film or sound recording, the\n\n                                 producer; and.....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">                                 (the last w.e.f. 10.05.1995)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">                                 2.

A contiguous reading of the above provisions is called for to reconcile the\n\n                 issue before me. <a href=\"/doc/1655540/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 2(d)</a> defines ‘author’, in relation to a ‘musical work’, as the\n\n                 ‘composer’ and in relation to a ‘cinematograph film’ or ‘sound recording’ as the\n\n                 ‘producer’. A ‘cinematograph film’ is defined in 2(f) to mean ‘any work of visual\n\n                 recording, which includes a sound recording’ and a ‘sound recording’ is defined in\n\n                 (xx) to be ‘a recording of sounds from which such sounds may be produced\n\n                 regardless of the medium on which such recordings is made or the method by\n\n                 which the sound are produced’. A producer in relation to a ‘cinematograph film’ or\n\n                 ‘sound recording’ is a person who has taken the initiative and bears the\n\n                 responsibilities for making a ‘work’, such work being defined in <a href=\"/doc/1635970/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 2(y)</a> to\n\n                 include a ‘musical work’, a ‘cinematograph film’ and a ‘sound recording’.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">                          37.   The   provisions   protect   the   authors   of   original   musical   works,\n\n                 cinematograph films and sound recordings. There is an overlap in so far as a\n\n                 ‘cinematograph film’ contains within itself ‘sound recordings’ based on the ‘musical\n\n                 works’ of the composers that are distinct assets on their own, though wholly\n\n                 integrated into the cinematograph film itself. The fact that these assets have been\n\n                 subsumed into the main asset, however, does not take away their individuality or\n\n                 claim to a separate copyright that is statutorily protected by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/43316752/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 13(4)</a>\n\n                 as well as the proviso inserted in 2012 at the foot of <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 17</a> that states that in\n\n                 case of any work incorporated in a cinematograph work, nothing contained in\n\n                 clauses (b) and (c) of <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 17</a> shall affect the right of the author in the work\n\n                 referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/4010217/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 13</a>, being all original literary,\n\n                 dramatic, musical and artistic works.

The Supreme Court in the case of IPRS (supra), was considering an\n\n                 appeal filed by various film producers.

The tariffs fixed had been objected to by the producers of cinematograph\n\n                 films, who claimed ownership of the films including the musical works comprised\n\n                 therein. The producers had averred that the musical works had been commissioned\n\n                 by them for use in their films and had been utilized and incorporated in the sound\n\n                 tracks of the films. According to them, the rights in the entire film, including the\n\n                 sound track, vested in them. Their objections were rejected by the Copyright Board\n\n                 that was of the view that the composer of the music and the musical works retained\n\n                 the copyright in their works and that they could thus assign the same to the IPRS.\n\n                 In appeal, the producers had challenged the decision of the Copyright board before\n\n                 the High Court, Calcutta, which allowed the appeal holding that unless it was proved\n\n                 that the composer had reserved his right to the copyright in his work, he does not\n\n                 acquire any copyright in respect thereof, in terms of proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 17</a> of the\n\n                 Copyright Act and the owner of the film, at whose instance the composition was\n\n                 made, became the owner of the copyright in such composition.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">\f                                                                63</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">                          40.

The main point\n                          for determination in regard to this part of the question is whether the\n                          composer of lyric or musical work (which in terms of <a href=\"/doc/23169752/\" id=\"a_93\">section 2(p)</a> of the Act\n                          means only a notationally written, printed or graphically produced or\n                          reproduced music) retains a copyright in the lyric or musical work if he\n                          grants a licence or permission to an author (owner) of a cinematograph film\n                          for its incorporation in the sound track of a cinematograph film. For a proper\n                          appreciation and determination of the contentions raised before us, it is\n                          necessary to notice certain provisions of the Act.\n                            ………………..\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">                          This takes us to the core of the question namely, whether the producer of a\n                          cinematograph film can defeat the right of the composer of music .... or\n                          lyricist by engaging him. The key to the solution of this question lies in\n                          provisos (b) and (c) to <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_94\">section 17</a> of the Act reproduced above which put the\n                          matter beyond doubt.

The\n                          same result follows according to aforesaid proviso (c) if the composer of\n                          music or lyric is employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship to\n                          compose the work.

Though the judgment was rendered Per Bench, Justice V.R.Krishna Iyer\n\n                 delivered a separate and supplementing footnote where he states thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">                          A cinematograph is a felicitous blend, a beautiful totality, a constellation of\n                          stars, if I may use these lovely imageries to drive home my point, slurring\n                          over the rule against mixed metaphor. Cinema is more. than long strips of\n                          celluloid, more than miracles in photography, more than song, dance and\n                          dialogue and indeed, more than dramatic story, exciting plot, gripping\n                          situations and marvellous acting. But it is that ensemble which is the\n                          finished product of orchestrated performance by each of the several\n                          participants, although the components may, sometimes, in themselves be\n                          elegant entities. Copyright in a cinema film exists in law, but<a href=\"/doc/43316752/\" id=\"a_96\"> s. 13(4)</a> of the\n                          Act preserves the separate survival, in its individuality, of a copyright\n                          enjoyed by any &#x27;work&#x27; notwithstanding its confluence in the film. This\n                          persistence of the aesthetic &#x27;personality&#x27; of the intellectual property cannot\n                          cut down the copyright of the film qua film. The latter right is, as explained\n                          earlier in my learned brother&#x27;s judgment, set out indubitably in<a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_97\"> s. 14(1)(c)</a>.\n                          True, the exclusive right, otherwise called copyright, in the case of a musical\n                          work extends to all the sub-rights spelt out in<a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_98\"> s. 14(1)(a)</a>. A harmonious\n                          construction of<a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_99\"> s. 14</a>, which is the integral yoga of copyrights in creative\n                          works, takes us to the soul of the subject. The artist enjoys his copyright in\n                          the musical work, the film producer is the master of his combination of\n                          artistic pieces and the two can happily co- exist and need not conflict. What\n                          is the modus vivendi ?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">                            ……….\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">                          The solution is simple. The film producer has the sole right to exercise what\n                          is his entitlement under<a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_100\"> s. 14(1)(c)</a> qua film, but he cannot trench on the\n                          composer&#x27;s copyright which he does only if the &#x27;music&#x27; is performed or\n                          produced or reproduced separately, in violation of<a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_101\"> s. 14(1)(a)</a>. For instance,\n                          a film may be caused to be exhibited as a film but the pieces of music\n                          cannot be picked out of the sound track and played in the cinema or other\n                          theatre. To do that is the privilege of the composer and that right of his is\n                          not crowned in the film copyright except where there is special provision\n                          such as in<a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_102\"> s. 17</a>, proviso (c). So, beyond exhibiting the film as a cinema\n                          show, if the producer plays the songs separately to attract an audience or\n                          for other reason, he infringes the composer&#x27;s copyright. Anywhere, in a\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">\f                                                                  65</span>\n\n\n\n\n                          restaurant or aeroplane or radio station or cinema theatre, if a music is\n                          played, there comes into play the copyright of the composer or the\n                          Performing Arts Society. These are the boundaries of composite creations of\n                          art which are at once individual and collective, viewed from different angles.\n                          In &#x27;a cosmic perspective, a thing of beauty has no boundary and is\n                          humanity&#x27;s property but in the materialist plane on which artists thrive,\n                          private and exclusive estate in art subsists. Man, the noblest work of the\n                          Infinite Artist, strangely enough, battles for the finite products of his art and\n                          the secular law, operating on the temporal level, guardians material works\n                          possessing spiritual values. The enigmatic small of Mona, Lisa is the\n                          timeless heritage of man- kind but, till liberated by the prescribed passage\n                          of time, the private copyright of the human maker says, &#x27;hands off&#x27;.\n                             ………\n                          Therefore, copyrighted music is not the soulful tune, the superb singing, the\n                          glorious voice or the wonderful render- ing. It is the melody or harmony\n                          reduced to print, writing or graphic form. The Indian music lovers throng to\n                          listen and be enthralled or enchanted by the nada brahma, the sweet\n                          concord of sounds, the rags, the bhava, the lava and the sublime or exciting\n                          singing. Printed music is not the glamour or glory of it, by and large,\n                          although the content of the poem or the lyric or the song does have appeal.\n                          Strangely enough, &#x27;author&#x27;, as defined in<a href=\"/doc/1655540/\" id=\"a_103\"> s.2(d)</a>, in relation to a musical\n                          work, is only the composer and<a href=\"/doc/1454107/\" id=\"a_104\"> s. 16</a> confines &#x27;copyright&#x27; to those works\n                          which are recognised by the Act. This means that the composer alone has\n                          copyright in a musical work. The singer has none. This disentitlement of the\n                          musician or group of musical artists to copy- right is un-Indian, because the\n                          major attraction which lends monetary value to a musical performance is\n                          not the music maker, so much as the musician. Perhaps, both deserve to be\n                          recognised by the copyright law. I make this observation only because act in\n                          one sense, depends on the ethos and the aesthetic best of a people; and\n                          while universal protection of intellectual and aesthetic property of creators\n                          of &#x27;works&#x27; is an international obligation, each country in its law must protect\n                          such rights wherever originality is contributed. So viewed, apart from the\n                          music composer, the singer must be conferred a right. Of course, law-\n                          making is the province of Parliament but the Court must communicate to\n                          the lawmaker such infirmities as exist in the law extant.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_198\">                          42. A sound recording is a conglomerate of various invaluable contributions.\n\n                 If one were to trace the evolution of what eventually comes to be known as a\n\n                 ‘sound recording’, it all commences with the melody that flows when the muse\n\n                 inspires, the reduction of the same to notation, fleshing out the melody with lyrics,\n\n                 leading to songs, then instrumentation and orchestral arrangements, in all, one\n\n                 complete ‘felicitous blend’. Sometimes, melody is set to lyrics and other times,\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">\f                                                             66</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 lyrics are set to fit within the contours of melody. A ‘sound recording’ incorporates\n\n                 both melodic as well as lyrical contents. The playback artists and accompanists then\n\n                 deliver the song which would be recorded in a studio and embodied as sound in a\n\n                 master medium on a master tape or digital media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">                          43. Irrespective of the medium of delivery, it is the sum-total of all the\n\n                 aforesaid elements that constitute a ‘sound recording’ and it is in respect of this\n\n                 ‘sound recording’ that the producer lays claim, accorded to him in terms of the\n\n                 statute. To this end, the submission that a ‘sound recording’ has always been\n\n                 covered as a subject under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_105\">Copyright Act</a>, though referred to earlier as a\n\n                 ‘record’ is in order. However, the 2012 amendment makes it clear, by way of\n\n                 tightening the statutory protection extended to artists, that the right of exploitation\n\n                 of a ‘work’ shall, prospectively, be restricted only to the specific mode or medium of\n\n                 exploitation stipulated in the Assignment Agreement and none other.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">                          44.

The engagement of\n\n                 Mr.Ilaiyaraja, to my mind, is as a stand-alone professional, and his services,\n\n                 commissioned, as such.

Otherwise eminently forgettable movies are\n\n                 made memorable by the outstanding musical scores that they contain. Though not\n\n                 a rule of thumb, the stature of the music composer before me dictates that that the\n\n                 arrangements as between himself and the producers are not one of service or\n\n                 apprenticeship but one of Principle to Principle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_204\">                          48.

It is this clause which, in my opinion, is applicable to the\n\n                 facts and circumstances of the present cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\">\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">\f                                                            68</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">                          49. As stated earlier, it is unclear as to whether Mr.Ilaiyaraja has reserved\n\n                 his rights by way of agreements with the producers of the films. The producers are\n\n                 not before me to either confirm or deny this position. Mr.Ilaiyaraja also has not\n\n                 produced any documentation in support of this position. Though Agi Music states in\n\n                 its pleadings that it has seen fifty (50) such agreements out of a hundred and\n\n                 eighty five (185) agreements that form the subject matter of C.S.No.187 of 2010,\n\n                 there is no evidence before me to support such a position in the present case.\n\n                 Moreover, the songs in the 259 agreements annexed to the written statement by\n\n                 Echo have been distributed in public domain, thanks to Echo, for the last several\n\n                 years. No objection has been raised by Mr.Ilaiyaraja till date of filing of the suit. If\n\n                 at all he was of the view that the exploitation of the ‘sound recording’ by Echo\n\n                 constituted an infringement, it was incumbent upon him to have taken action in a\n\n                 timely fashion. This has not been done and the plaint does not even mention any\n\n                 communication to Echo or a cease and desist notice having been issued to Echo. By\n\n                 conduct, Mr.Ilaiyaraja appears to have acquiesced to the actions of Echo.        I also\n\n                 draw no adverse inference from the fact that there are 41 agreements that have\n\n                 not been produced by Echo. The explanation offered is reasonable and acceptable\n\n                 and I do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">                          50. No solution has been offered by learned counsel as to how the concurrent\n\n                 rights of the producers and individual constituents of the ‘sound recording’ could be\n\n                 allocated, but to my mind, the answer lies in <a href=\"/doc/1710491/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 57</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1710491/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 57</a>\n\n                 implements the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 6</a> of the Berne Convention conferring upon an\n\n                 author ‘Moral Rights’ or ‘Droit Moral’ as distinguished from ‘economic rights’.

By virtue of\n\n                 such authorship, he is the ‘first owner’ of the copyright vesting in the ‘musical work’\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">\f                                                            71</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 17</a>.

This clause, as it stood earlier extended this protection only during the\n\n                 life of a copyright. However, the 2012 amendment has deleted the phrase ‘which is\n\n                 done before the expiration of the term of copyright’ in Section (1)(b), as a result\n\n                 that the protection and special entitlement now extends in infinitum, and can be\n\n                 exercised by an author of a ‘work’ or his legal heirs at any time without restriction\n\n                 of time or period.

I add this caveat for the\n\n                 reason that the ‘musical works’ in question have already found expression as ‘sound\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">\f                                                            72</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 recordings’    and   have   been    integrated   in   ‘sound   recordings’   in   various\n\n                 cinematograph films. It cannot hence be that further ‘sound recordings’ be made\n\n                 based on the same ‘musical works’. This would defeat the purpose of vesting the\n\n                 ‘sound recording’ right in a producer, in the first place. To sum up, what has been\n\n                 assigned is the ‘musical work’ qua the ‘sound recording’ and the author continues to\n\n                 retain the right in the ‘musical work’ for all other intents and purposes, both moral\n\n                 as well as economic.

Though Special Rights have been part of the Act since inception and bring\n\n                 with its purview the concept of a moral right, the 2012 amendment has introduced\n\n                 the concept of ‘Moral rights’ in so many words, for the first time in the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_126\">Indian\n\n                 Copyright Act</a>, in Chapter VIII, <a href=\"/doc/169389669/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 38 B </a>addressing the moral rights of a\n\n                 performer. The Section states that the performer of a performance shall,\n\n                 independent of his right after assignment, either wholly or partially of his right,\n\n                 continue to have the right to claim to be identified as the performer of his\n\n                 performance except where the omission is dictated by the manner of the use of the\n\n                 performance and to restrain or claim damages in respect of any distortion,\n\n                 mutilation or either modification that would be prejudicial to his reputation. To my\n\n                 mind, these rights are analogous to <a href=\"/doc/1710491/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 57</a> that enumerates an author’s Special\n\n                 Rights and supplemental thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_216\">                          59.

But, unfortunately, over the years -\n                                  especially in the context of artists in India - the producers in this\n                                  country through an assignment took over those rights. Under\n                                  <a href=\"/doc/4010217/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 13 (i) (a)</a> of the Copyright Act, there is protection to the\n                                  artistic work, whether it is a literary work, a musical work, dramatic\n                                  work or a performance. So, protection is provided under the Act.\n                                  So, the artist is the owner of that copyright because he creates\n                                  that artistic work.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">                                  But, unfortunately, there was a provision in <a href=\"/doc/195651592/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 17 (i) (b)</a> of\n                                  the Act under which it was said that the artistic work belongs to the\n                                  owner, subject to a contract to the contrary. So, what used to\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">\f                                                           74</span>\n\n\n\n\n                          happen is that if in a film, a song was to be sung, the producer of\n                          the film would go to the artist and say that you have assigned your\n                          rights to me unconditionally and you have assigned them forever.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">                                  The result was that under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_132\">Copyright Act</a>, instead of the\n                          artist, the producer became the sole author of the copyright. The\n                          result of that was, he produced the film, the artist got the benefit\n                          of whatever he could get in the film but he sold those rights of\n                          which the producer became the owner through other medium. He\n                          sold it to music companies; he sold it to telecom companies; and\n                          he made all the profits. The result was that the poor author and\n                          the poor creator of the copyright did not get any share of the\n                          profit. According to me, this is a historic injustice to the creators.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">                           There are about seven amendments but I am not going to deal\n                          with each section. But broadly one of the things which we wish to\n                          do is to ensure that the authors are the owners of the copyright\n                          and whereas the copyright can be assigned, the right to royalty\n                          cannot be assigned. This is the amendment that we are moving\n                          that you can get the assignment from the artist whether it is a\n                          music composer or a literary composer but when it comes to\n                          payment of royalties through other mediums, then the producers\n                          and the authors must share that royalty in equal measure. So, this\n                          is the first amendment that I have brought and I am commending\n                          it to this House for adoption.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">                            We have also consequentially brought about changes in the\n                          Copyright Societies because in the Copyright Societies all the\n                          producers control the Copyright Societies because the provision\n                          said that the owner of the copyright shall be in the management of\n                          the Society and because of <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 17(1)(b)</a>, the producer became\n                          the owner of the copyright. So, the authors were thrown out of the\n                          Copyright Societies and only the producers became owners of the\n                          copyright societies and they decided to negotiate with music\n                          companies and they decided to sell those works, especially Hindi\n                          songs which are famous throughout the world to music\n                          companies.

Ultimately, in a film, who are the real artists? They are\n                          those who sing songs, those who perform, and those who direct\n                          the film. Now a Director is kept out of any profits of the film. He is\n                          the one who actually creates the architecture of the film.

It is the producer who risks his\n                                 capital.

According to him, the very purpose of the 2012 amendments are to\n\n                 ensure the protection of the intellectual property of a composer, to see that the\n\n                 ownership as well as the right of exploitation thereof, remains within his possession\n\n                 and that of his legal heirs. He draws attention to the amendments to various section\n\n                 of the Act particularly, the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1404402/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 17</a> inserted in 2012, that states that in\n\n                 the case of any work incorporated in a cinematograph film nothing contained in\n\n                 clauses (b) and (c) shall affect the right of the author in the ‘work’ referred to in\n\n                 clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/4010217/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 13</a>.

A combined reading of the aforesaid makes it clear, according to him,\n\n                 that after the amendment of 2012 it is the composer in whom vests the full\n\n                 ownership and right of exploitation of his ‘musical works’ including that of a ‘sound\n\n                 recording’ based on his musical work.

We, as a society, have not\n\n                 been kind to our creators and geniuses. The tendency is to place them on a\n\n                 pedestal and revere them while they are in their prime, while, simultaneously and\n\n                 ironically, finding every method possible to exploit their work to generate profits for\n\n                 corporate interests, to their exclusion. Many of India’s finest Artists thus languish in\n\n                 their old age, without any means of accessing the fruit of their labour. This is a\n\n                 deplorable situation and a clarion call for remedy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_224\">                          62. The amendments to the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_137\">Copyright Act</a> in 2012 are an attempt to redress\n\n                 this, in some measure, in balance with the rights of other entities as well. The\n\n                 producer of a cinematograph films is the brain behind the film, undertaking the risk\n\n                 and responsibility of the venture. It is in recognition of the enormous risk taken by\n\n                 the producer that statute vests in him the copyright in the entire film as well as the\n\n                 ‘sound recordings’ that constitute an intrinsic and integral part of the film. This\n\n                 position, in my view, has not been tampered with or altered by the 2012\n\n                 amendment. The protection afforded to the author of the ‘musical works’ is by\n\n                 insertion of the clauses as we have seen above, as well as the three provisos after\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1910404/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 18(1)</a> dealing with assignment of copy right, and the amendment effected\n\n                 to <a href=\"/doc/185418821/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 19(3)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_225\">                          63. The first proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1910404/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 18(1)</a> states that an assignment made shall\n\n                 apply solely to the exploitation of such work upon such medium or mode of\n\n                 exploitation in existence or in commercial use at the time when such assignment\n\n                 was made or if such assignment specifically referred to such medium or mode of\n\n                 exploitation. The second proviso states that the author of a literary or musical work,\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">\f                                                             77</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 included in a cinematograph film, shall not assign or waive the right to receive\n\n                 royalty, to be shared on a equal basis with the assignee of the copy right for the\n\n                 utilization of such work in any form other than for the communication to the public\n\n                 of the work along with the cinematograph film in a cinema hall, except to the legal\n\n                 heirs of the author or a copyright society for collection and distribution. The third\n\n                 proviso is similar to the second proviso, except that it deals with literary or musical\n\n                 work included in a ‘sound recording’, but not forming part of a cinematograph film.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">                          64. Provisos 2 and 3 thrust royalties upon the authors of ‘musical works’.\n\n                 This serves, in my view, to address concerns that established production houses\n\n                 negotiate unfairly with a music composer, bearing in mind the unequal status of the\n\n                 two parties. By the insertion of the aforesaid provisos, the right to equal royalty in\n\n                 the ‘sound ‘recording is ensured. <a href=\"/doc/185418821/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 19(3)</a> also stands amended along similar\n\n                 lines. Whereas the section earlier provided for the assignment agreement to specify\n\n                 ‘the amount of royalty payable, if any’, it now provides that the assignment\n\n                 agreements ‘shall specify the amount of royalty and other consideration payable to\n\n                 the author or his legal heirs during the currency of the agreement’, thus making the\n\n                 payment of royalty, mandatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">                          65. In summation, the 2012 amendment does take into account the interests\n\n                 of authors of ‘musical works’ by ensuring the payment of equal royalty to them and\n\n                 legal heirs, and not by shifting the basis of ownership of copy right as it exists\n\n                 presently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_228\">                          66.

This category of issues is\n\n                 answered accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">                          67. The second set of issues relate to the question of assignment of copyright\n\n                 of Mr.Ilaiyaraja to his wife Mrs.Jeevaraja and subsequent licences issued by her\n\n                 vide documents executed by her in 2007 being the SRLA and the SPA and the\n\n                 Addendum executed in January 2010. Having held that Echo is the legal owner of\n\n                 the ‘sound recording’ the resultant conclusion would be that the assignment of the\n\n                 copyright to Mrs.Jeevaraja would have no statutory sanction. The entire transaction\n\n                 as regards Agi Music would thus fail at the threshold. However, if at all any party\n\n                 could have questioned the assignment of the ‘sound recoding’ right to Agi Music, it\n\n                 is Echo. Echo has chosen to remain silent notwithstanding the evident exploitation\n\n                 of the ‘sound recording’ right by Agi Music between 2007 and 2012. Echo has thus,\n\n                 in my view, acquiesced to the assignment of the sound recording right to\n\n                 Mrs.Jeevaraja and the subsequent exclusive assignment of the right to Agi Music.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">\f                                                             79</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 Even in the pleadings as well as arguments before me now Echo does not very\n\n                 seriously question the right granted to Agi Music, merely stating that it is the legal\n\n                 owner of the ‘sound recordings’.

In the present case though SRLA and the SPA are effective for a period of\n\n                 ten years, the assignment agreement is silent in regard to its tenure. According to\n\n                 Agi Music, the tenure of the assignment agreement has to be seen in the context of\n\n                 the entire transaction inter se the parties, and includes the interpretation of all the\n\n                 agreements as a whole. Thus, and as a consequence, the Assignment Agreement\n\n                 should also be seen as having the same tenure of ten years as the SRLA and SPA.\n\n                 Per contra Mr.Ilaiyaraja would urge that <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 19(5)</a> is clear in stating that if the\n\n                 agreement of assignment is silent as to tenure it should be deemed to be of five\n\n                 years only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">                          72. No doubt, a transaction as between the parties is to be taken in a holistic\n\n                 fashion. That the Assignment should be seen in a purposive fashion in cohesion with\n\n                 the rest of a transaction and not in isolation finds support in the decision of the\n\n                 Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the case of Dorling Kindersley (supra). The\n\n                 Bench held that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 19(5)</a> are not to be interpreted\n\n                 mechanically but should be seen in context of the transaction, in entirety.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">                          73. However, the parties in the present case have entered into all\n\n                 agreements on the same date, mentioning the tenure thereof in two of the\n\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">\f                                                           83</span>\n\n\n\n\n                 agreements. The absence of a mention of tenure in the assignment agreement\n\n                 cannot thus, in my view, be by omission or oversight. If the assignor, Mr.Ilaiyaraja,\n\n                 had intended that the assignment be for ten years then he would have stated so. I\n\n                 cannot persuade myself to accept the argument that the tenure should be accepted\n\n                 as ten (10) years merely by implication and assumption. This is all the more the\n\n                 reason that the parties to the Assignment Agreement on the one hand, and those\n\n                 who entered into the SRLA and SPA are not identical. One cannot thus, impute the\n\n                 same motives and compulsions to all the parties and thrust a longer period of\n\n                 assignment upon the assignor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">                          74. Agi Music would argue that the royalties were remitted directly to the\n\n                 account of Mr.Ilaiyaraja and thus the identity of the parties being different would\n\n                 not matter or be relevant. I disagree. The mere fact that the royalties were being\n\n                 received by Mr.Ilaiyaraja is no justification to bypass the statutory prescription of\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 19(5)</a>. In any event, the payments of royalty have admittedly been only for\n\n                 the period 2007 to 2012. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 19(5)</a> are mandatory, applicable\n\n                 as a norm. Any variation thereto would have to be the exception, and such\n\n                 exception is liable to be proved not merely by implication but conclusively. This is\n\n                 for the reason that the purpose of the prescription in <a href=\"/doc/262036/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 19</a> is the protection of\n\n                 rights of the assignor and this assumes paramount importance. My conclusion is\n\n                 thus that the term of the assignment agreement is governed by the provisions of\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/160406682/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 19(5)</a> of the Act and is five years only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_244\">\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">\f                                                              84</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_245\">                          75.
