This content may or may not be taken with the\n                          consent of the individual involved, however, its dissemination is largely\n                          meant to be non-consensual and comes under the larger umbrella of cyber-\n                          harassment. Such distribution, more colloquially known by the term\n                          &quot;revenge porn&quot;, causes psychological damage to the victim and subjects\n                          them to social ostracization and humiliation that can seriously impact the\n                          mental health of the victim. This Court will, however, refrain from using the\n                          term &quot;revenge porn&quot; as it is merely a subset of NCII and NCII encompasses\n                          a larger number of scenarios in which such content may be distributed. The\n                          individual whose images are shared without their consent are perceived by\n                          the public to be deserving of the violation of their privacy and bodily\n                          integrity. Further, the same level of gravity that is attached to a crime like\n                          molestation/sexual harassment is not assigned to NCII abuse as the public in\n                          general finds it difficult to conceptualize its negative impact on account of\n                          the fact that the victim&#x27;s physical person remains unharmed. However, what\n                          such conceptualization tends to ignore is that victims of NCII abuse face\n                          significant life disruptions, such as loss of job, being turned away by their\n                          families, etc, which in turn radically affects their mental health. In a 2013, a\n                          self-selected study conducted by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative on Non-\n                          consensual Pornography (NCP), it was found that 93% of NCII abuse\n                          victims suffer significant social distress, 51% experience suicidal thoughts,\n                          and 82% experience social or occupational impairment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                          14.

A working paper on &quot;Tackling the Dissemination and\n                          Redistribution of NCII&quot; by Centre for Communication Governance (CCG)\n                          at National Law University, Delhi, observes that recognition of\n                          heterogeneity in intermediary functionality is necessary to ensure proper\n                          regulation of online content. The paper espouses that due to the\n                          heterogenous nature of intermediaries, mandating a single approach for\n                          removal of NCII content might prove to be ineffective. While espousing this\n                          viewpoint, the paper defines four different types of intermediaries:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">                                        ―ISPs: connect their subscribers to the internet by\n                                        supplying telecommunications facilities and equipment\n                                        such as modems and last-mile connectivity. ISPs do not\n                                        ordinarily filter or examine the data that is transmitted\n                                        on their networks, nor can they interfere with the\n                                        content by altering or removing the content they\n                                        transmit. Thus, it is impractical to require ISPs to\n                                        monitor and detect unlawful content. However, since\n                                        they control their subscribers&#x27; access to the internet,\n                                        they can block certain locations (URLs) on the internet\n                                        if directed by a government or court order. This\n                                        effectively prevents any of the ISPs&#x27; subscribers from\n                                        accessing the URL. This may be particularly useful\n                                        when websites refuse to remove unlawful content.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">                                        Websites hosting third-party content: While some\n                                        websites host their own content (eg, a news website),\n                                        other websites allow third parties (eg, ordinary users)\n                                        to upload content on their website.

Once new web\n                                        pages are discovered, the crawlers follow links\n                                        provided on those discovered web pages to find new\n                                        URLs.

The right of an individual to exercise control\n                                        over his personal data and to be able to control\n                                        his/her own life would also encompass his right to\n                                        control his existence on the internet. Needless to say\n                                        that this would not be an absolute right. The\n                                        existence of such a right does not imply that a\n                                        criminal can obliterate his past, but that there are\n                                        variant degrees of mistakes, small and big, and it\n                                        cannot be said that a person should be profiled to the\n                                        nth extent for all and sundry to know.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">                          43.    This right to privacy is also inextricably linked with the right to live a\n                          life with dignity. As noted in <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 66E</a> of the IT Act as well, individuals\n                          have a reasonable expectation to privacy which is not lost within the\n                          confines of a domestic relationship, or even if any intimate image is shared\n                          with another person with the understanding and the expectation that the\n                          same will not be shared with third persons. The context in such situations\n                          matter with privacy being the expectation that information about an\n                          individual will be treated appropriately and in accordance with the\n                          individual&#x27;s expectations; it is the said individual who retains control over\n                          any information pertaining to themselves. As a corollary, if the individual\n                          has the right to informational privacy, it also subsumes the individual&#x27;s right\n                          to be forgotten which has been held to be the consequence of the dignity of\n                          an individual and, thus, a facet of the right to privacy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">                          44.

The CJEU also recognised the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; and held\n                          that if the user&#x27;s request was found to be in consonance with the law, then it\n                          was incumbent upon the search engine to remove the links in question as the\n                          law would supersede the search engine&#x27;s financial interests as well as the\n                          interest of the general public in accessing that information.

Furthermore, the effect of the\n                                        interference with the person&#x27;s rights is heightened on\n                                        account of the important role played by the internet\n                                        and search engines in modern society, which render\n                                        the information contained in such lists of results\n                                        ubiquitous. In the light of its potential seriousness,\n                                        such interference cannot, according to the Court, be\n                                        justified by merely the economic interest which the\n                                        operator of the engine has in the data processing.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">                                        However, inasmuch as the removal of links from the\n                                        list of results could, depending on the information at\n                                        issue, have effects upon the legitimate interest of\n                                        internet users potentially interested in having access to\n                                        that information, the Court holds that a fair balance\n                                        should be sought in particular between that interest\n                                        and the data subject&#x27;s fundamental rights, in particular\n                                        the right to privacy and the right to protection of\n                                        personal data.

Irrespective of these rules, the State and\n                                        non-State actors are bound to respect the fundamental\n                                        rights of the citizens. There is no difficulty in\n                                        identifying Google as a non-State actor by its nature of\n                                        function and operation which could have an impact on\n                                        the socio, cultural, economic and political life of the\n                                        citizen.

In a paper by L.M. Hinman on &quot;Searching Ethics: The Role of Search\n                          Engines in the Construction and Distribution of Knowledge&quot;, it has been\n                          stated that with the increasing importance and pervasiveness of search\n                          engines, it can be found that search engines can no longer be said to be just\n                          providing access to knowledge, but are playing a central role in the\n                          constitution of knowledge itself. Users of search engines are increasingly\n                          dependent on search engines to filter through the ever-expanding universe of\n                          online data. Its pervasiveness is such that the very term &quot;Google&quot; is now\n                          used as a verb and is synonymous with &quot;search&quot;. As a result, the mere de-\n                          indexing of an URL has an incremental impact on protecting one&#x27;s right to\n                          be forgotten as it makes it almost impossible for someone to access the\n                          offending material if they are already not in possession of the specific URLs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">                          52.    What can be culled out from the aforesaid legal literature is that a\n                          search engine plays an important role in the dissemination of content and its\n                          powers in connecting the said content to the consumers is undeniable. When\n                          viewed in this light, it is unfathomable as to how a search engine can feign\n                          helplessness when it comes to removal of or disabling access to links which\n                          prima facie contain content that is illegal as declared by the Court.

This Court finds the suggestion untenable that the user/victim must\n                          approach either the intermediary in question or the Courts every single time\n                          the NCII content is duplicated.

An approach that entails the victim/user having\n                          to sift through the internet to identify and then share every URL hosting\n                          their NCII is unconscionable in the eyes of this Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">                          Offending Entities Possess the Requisite Technology\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">                          53.    Moreover, search engines cannot hide under the garb of not\n                          possessing the adequate technology to remove NCII content which has been\n                          reported without the victim/user having to approach the intermediary again\n                          and again. As per the Affidavit of Google LLC, hash-matching technology,\n                          which generates a unique identifier/fingerprint/hash, exists for the purpose\n                          of removing CSAM. This technology further allows detection and removal\n                          of the matched content that has previously been removed. For the purposes\n                          of removal of NCII, once such content has been identified and removed, the\n                          hash-matching technology can store only the unique identifier pertaining to\n                          the NCII content and in the event that such content is re-uploaded, it can\n                          filter out the same by going through its database of such fingerprints.

Further, it already mandates a timeline that must be\n                          adhered to when it comes to disabling access/de-linking the offending\n                          content. If read holistically, if the user/victim is required to approach with\n                          each specific URL again and again, this will only frustrate the purpose of the\n                          timelines and the grievance mechanism redressal as expounded under the IT\n                          Rules. It has been submitted that the sustained practice with regard to\n                          content removal under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_104\">IT Act</a> has been to provide specific URLs,\n                          however, this practice fails to account for a grievance redressal mechanism\n                          available to the user/victim and it is not justifiable, morally or otherwise, to\n                          suggest that an NCII abuse victim will have to constantly subject themselves\n                          to trauma by having to scour the internet for NCII content relating to them\n                          and having to approach the authorities again and again.

This Court painfully notes that there is an abysmal absence of a\n                          collaborative effort that should ideally be undertaken by the intermediaries\n                          and the State. The focus of such entities and authorities should be on the\n                          quick redressal of the complaint brought before them rather than the shirking\n                          of blame or making submissions on the onerous nature of their duties. In the\n                          process of shirking responsibility, precious time is lost in removal of the\n                          offending content and it enables the offender to keep reposting the content.\n                          It further encourages other potential offenders to undertake such\n                          dissemination of NCII content as they are aware of the lack of\n                          consequences. This in turn frustrates the legal redressal mechanism in place\n                          and the harm, both emotional and reputational, caused to the victim/user\n                          persists and perpetuates. In a conservative country like India where matters\n                          of this nature are not a part of dinner table conversations, NCII abuse does\n                          indeed lead to harrowing consequences and everlasting stigma for the\n                          victim. In light of this, the endeavour of every entity involved should be to\n                          expeditiously resolve the issue.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">                          DIRECTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">                          61.

Accordingly,\n                                  the    intermediaries   in   question   may    assign    cryptographic\n                                  hashes/identifiers to the said NCII, and automatically identify and\n                                  remove the same through a safe and secure process. This would\n                                  reduce the burden on the victim/user to constantly have to scour the\n                                  internet for NCII pertaining to them and having to request for the\n                                  removal/de-indexing of individual URLs. Utmost importance should\n                                  accorded to the fact that the privacy of the user/victim must remain\n                                  inviolable and the data collected for the purposes of using the hash-\n                                  matching technology is not stored and misused.
