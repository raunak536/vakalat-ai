Through the instant writ petition cast under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, the petitioner, a tricenarian married woman, craves for\n\nissuance of directions upon the official respondents to terminate her\n\npregnancy, without her husband&#x27;s consent. The petitioner claims her\n\npregnancy to be medically terminable on account of her pregnancy length\n\nnot exceeding the period prescribed for termination in <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_2\">The Medical\n\nTermination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</a> (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;Act of\n\n1971&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">GROUNDS        CANVASSED            IN      THE   WRIT     PETITION      FOR\nSECURING THE RELIEF OF PREGNANCY TERMINATION\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.           The marriage of the petitioner was solemnized with one Lovish\n\nBatra on 22.08.2024, however, immediately thereafter, she was subjected to\n\ncruelty by her in-laws family on account of bringing less dowry. Moreover,\n\nthe husband of the petitioner also maltreated her and he even brought a\n\n\n\n                                1 of 19\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">             ::: Downloaded on - 14-01-2025 11:07:48 :::</span>\n                                  Neutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:003140\n\n\n\n\nCWP-75-2025\n\nportable camera twice in their bedroom to secretly record their personal\n\nmoments. Not only this, the business of the petitioner&#x27;s husband also closed\n\ndown and he became dependent on the petitioner and her parents for day to\n\nday needs and expenditure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.           Despite all the atrocities, the petitioner went on performing her\n\nmatrimonial obligations and after approx. 1Â½ months of her marriage, the\n\npetitioner came to know about her pregnancy, whereupon, she informed\n\nabout it to her husband and also informed him that their marital life has just\n\nbegun and their financial condition is also not stable, therefore, she is not\n\nmentally prepared for the baby. However, in order to restrain the petitioner\n\nfrom aborting pregnancy by taking contraceptive measures within the\n\nrequisite period, the husband of the petitioner orchestrated the scenario of\n\nlove and affection towards her. However, the atrocities upon the petitioner\n\ndid not pause and she was manhandled by her in-laws family, which\n\nresulted in hers suffering minor pain and mental trauma. Consequently, the\n\npetitioner had to depart from the company of her husband and had to come\n\nto her parents house. The petitioner also made a police complaint about the\n\natrocities committed upon her. Moreover, owing to the atrocities (supra), the\n\npetitioner started bleeding on 03.12.2024, whereupon, she was taken to\n\nIqbal Nursing Home by her parents. However owing to lack of proper\n\ntreatment, the petitioner&#x27;s parents also took her to DMC Hospital, Ludhiana,\n\nwhere she remained admitted from 03.12.2024 to 06.12.2024. In the medical\n\nsummary report (Annexure P-3) prepared at the time of petitioner&#x27;s\n\ndischarge from hospital, it was specifically observed that the petitioner is\n\n\n\n\n                                2 of 19\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">             ::: Downloaded on - 14-01-2025 11:07:49 :::</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:003140\n\n\n\n\nCWP-75-2025\n\nunder stress and a victim of domestic violence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.           Citing the hereinabove extracted facts and circumstances,\n\nespecially her soured matrimonial relationship and her decision to walk out\n\nof her marriage, the petitioner claims that she does not want to continue with\n\nher unwanted pregnancy as it would cause grave injury to her physical and\n\nmental health, therefore, permission be granted to medically terminate her\n\nunwanted pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THIS COURT AND REPORT OF THE\nBOARD OF DOCTORS\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5.

The first provision, which is of utmost significance and which\n\nis reproduced hereinafter, is enclosed in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1971\n\ninasmuch as there becomes prescribed the manner in which registered\n\nmedical practitioners may terminate pregnancies.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">             &quot;3.

Another important provision is encapsulated in Rule 3(B) of\n\nThe Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules, 2003 (hereinafter referred to\n\nthe as &#x27;Rules of 2003&#x27;). This Rule prescribes the categories of women, who\n\nshall be considered eligible for termination of pregnancy for a period of upto\n\ntwenty-four weeks.

Taking into account the petitioner&#x27;s claimed change of marital\n\nstatus, coupled with the length of her pregnancy, which evidently does not\n\nexceeded twenty weeks, therefore, the provisions concerning the case at\n\nhand are the ones embodied in clause (b) of sub-section (2) <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3</a> of the\n\nAct of 1971 and clause (c) of Rule 3(B) of the Rules of 2003.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">12.

The provisions regarding the termination of pregnancy in\n               the Penal Code, 1860 which were enacted about a century\n               ago were drawn up in keeping with the then British Law on\n               the subject. Abortion was made a crime for which the mother\n               as well as the abortionist could be punished except where it\n               had to be induced in order to save the life of the mother. It\n               has been stated that this very strict law has been observed in\n               the breach in a very large number of cases all over the\n               country. Furthermore, most of these mothers are married\n               women, and are under no particular necessity to conceal\n               their pregnancy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">               2. In recent years, when health services have expanded and\n               hospitals are availed of to the fullest extent by all classes of\n               society, doctors have often been confronted with gravely ill\n               or dying pregnant women whose pregnant uterus have been\n               tampered with a view to causing an abortion and\n               consequently suffered very severely.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">               3. There is thus avoidable wastage of the mother&#x27;s health,\n               strength and, sometimes, life. The proposed measure which\n               seeks to liberalise certain existing provisions relating to\n               termination of pregnancy has been conceived (1) as a health\n               measure--when there is danger to the life or risk to physical\n               or mental health of the woman; (2) on humanitarian\n               grounds-such as when pregnancy arises from a sex crime like\n               rape or intercourse with a lunatic woman, etc.; and (3)\n               eugenic grounds--where there is substantial risk that the\n               child, if born, would suffer from deformities and diseases.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">         The whole tenor of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_14\">MTP Act</a> is to provide access to safe and\n         legal medical abortions to women. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_15\">The MTP Act</a> is primarily a\n         beneficial legislation, meant to enable women to access services of\n         medical termination of pregnancies provided by an RMP.

The notion of privacy\n                enables the individual to assert and control the human\n                element which is inseparable from the personality of the\n                individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality\n                is manifested in the ability to make decisions on matters\n                intimate to human life. The autonomy of the individual is\n                associated over matters which can be kept private. These\n                are concerns over which there is a legitimate expectation\n                of privacy. The body and the mind are inseparable\n                elements of the human personality. The integrity of the\n                body and the sanctity of the mind can exist on the\n                foundation that each individual possesses an inalienable\n                ability and right to preserve a private space in which the\n                human personality can develop. Without the ability to\n                make choices, the inviolability of the personality would be\n                in doubt.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_20\">101. <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_40\">Importantly, Puttaswamy</a> (supra) also deals with facets of\n         reproductive autonomy.

In this case, the\n         victim, an orphaned woman of around 19 years, with mental\n         retardation, became pregnant as a result of a rape that took place\n         while she was an inmate at a government-run welfare institution.\n         After the discovery           of her pregnancy, the Chandigarh\n         Administration approached the High Court of Punjab and\n         Haryana seeking approval for the termination of her pregnancy.\n         The High Court constituted an expert body to conduct an enquiry\n         into the facts. The expert body recorded that the victim had\n         expressed her willingness to bear the child and accordingly\n         recommended the continuation of the pregnancy.

A three-judge Bench of this Court disagreed with the High\n         Court&#x27;s decision. In a judgment authored by K G Balakrishnan,\n         C.J., this Court emphasized that the consent of the pregnant\n         woman is an essential requirement to proceed with the\n         termination of a pregnancy under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_46\">MTP Act</a>. It was held that\n         the state administration cannot claim guardianship of the woman\n         as she was a major. It was further held that the woman only had\n         &quot;mild mental retardation&quot; and was therefore competent to give\n         her consent in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the MTP Act. This\n         Court concluded that the state must respect the reproductive\n         rights of women with &quot;mental retardation&quot; with regard to\n         decisions about terminating their pregnancy. In the process, this\n         Court recognized that a woman&#x27;s right to reproductive autonomy\n         is a dimension of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                &quot;22.

It is important to recognize that\n                reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well\n                as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration\n                is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily\n                integrity should be respected. This means that there should\n                be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\n                reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse\n                participation in sexual activity or alternatively the\n                insistence on use of contraceptive methods. Furthermore,\n                women are also free to choose birth control methods such\n                as undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken to their\n                logical conclusion, reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s\n                entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give\n                birth and to subsequently raise children. However, in the\n                case of pregnant women there is also a &quot;compelling State\n                interest&quot; in protecting the life of the prospective child.\n                Therefore, the termination of a pregnancy is only permitted\n                when the conditions specified in the applicable statute\n                have been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_50\">MTP Act,\n                1971</a> can also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that\n                have been placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_26\">104. <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_51\">Suchita Srivastava</a> (supra) rightly recognised that the right\n         of women to make reproductive choices is a dimension of\n         personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21.</a> It held that reproductive rights\n         include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry the pregnancy to full term,\n         give birth, and raise children.
