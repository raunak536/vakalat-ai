The husband had filed MC.No.56/2016 seeking to\n\ndeclare the marriage as nullity as the wife is not a competent\n\nperson to consummate the marriage. It is the case that the\n\nmarriage had taken place on 11.06.2015 and after the\n\nmarriage, the wife had come to the house of the husband and\n\nstayed for one day and immediately left to her parent&#x27;s house.\n\nIt is the case of the husband that the wife had not shown any\n\ninterest or affection towards the husband and the marriage is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                -3-</span>\n                                            NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                          WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nnot consummated. Within a few days, the husband searched a\n\nrented house and informed the wife to join the company of the\n\nhusband. The wife and her parents put forth unnecessary\n\nconditions that the aged mother of the husband should not be\n\nwith them and the relatives of the husband should not come to\n\nthe rented premises so on so forth as a condition to join the\n\nmatrimonial home. The wife had not joined and whenever he\n\napproaches the wife by going to her parent&#x27;s house, she has\n\nnot expressed any kind of interest in him and even not allowed\n\nhim to come near to her. The husband had made all his best\n\nefforts. It is his case that the wife was calling him during his\n\noffice hours and abusing for the unknown reasons. It is stated\n\nthat on 01.11.2015 there was mediation held at J.P.Nagar at\n\nthe house of relative of the husband where the parents of the\n\nwife agreed to send her to the house of the husband and it has\n\nalso decided to perform the nuptials on 20.11.2015. They\n\nimposed a condition that the relatives of the husband should\n\nnot attend the said function. A small function was held on\n\n20.11.2015. According to him, the marriage could not be\n\nconsummated. He also stated that on 05.12.2015, he had\n\ntaken her to a gynecologist Dr. Latha at Pragathi Clinic which is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                -4-</span>\n                                             NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                           WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nsituated at Chikkallasandra, Bangalore for consultation and\n\neven there she has also not permitted the doctor to test her\n\nand make preliminary enquiries. The doctor expressed that\n\nsome counselling is necessary and detailed examination is\n\nrequired from the reputed doctors to test the maturity or\n\notherwise health condition of the wife. It is also the case of the\n\nhusband that the wife had developed a kind of insecure feeling\n\nand has become very suspicious and tried to test the patience\n\nof the husband in different ways. She was talking a lot about\n\nthe character of the husband, defaming his self respect. On\n\n22.12.2015, the wife along with her parents came to the house\n\nof the husband and started quarrelling with him for unknown\n\nreasons and the father of the wife also threatened him with the\n\ndire consequences. On that day the husband went to his house\n\nand found the same is locked and the wife had taken away all\n\nthe household items, gold ring, silk sarees and other items to\n\nher parent&#x27;s house. It is stated that on these grounds as there\n\nwas no other alternative, he had issued a notice on 26.12.2015\n\ncalling upon the wife to give consent for dissolving the\n\nmarriage. After receiving the notice, she lodged a complaint on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                -5-</span>\n                                             NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                           WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n01.01.2016. The husband has come up with the present\n\npetition seeking to declare the marriage as nullity.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      4. The wife had filed her objections to this petition and\n\nshe had denied the allegations made against her. According to\n\nthe wife, the marriage is consummated. It is stated that the\n\nhusband had forcibly by misreading and manhandling the wife\n\nwithout any intimation to her parents or to anyone had taken to\n\nDr. Latha, who is not a gynecologist, but she is just a physician\n\nwithout any specialization and the doctor tried to make physical\n\nexamination against the wishes of the wife as regards to her\n\nbodily composition and her femininity and the said doctor\n\nforcibly conducted the examinations and had declared that the\n\nwife is hale and healthy and has no health issues and her\n\nfemininity and bodily composition is normal as like any other\n\nwoman and the said doctor had never prescribed any medicine\n\nor counselling or further examination. In view of the same, it\n\ndemonstrates the sadistic nature and character of the husband\n\nand along with that she had taken a stand about the\n\nconsummation of the marriage and that the petition has to be\n\ndismissed. The husband on 24.11.2016 had filed I.A.No.4\n\nseeking a direction to the wife to appear before the competent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 -6-</span>\n                                             NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                           WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\ndoctor/Gynecologist     for   medical   examination   about   her\n\nphysical, psychological capability in consummation of marriage\n\nand furnish the report to the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1992367\" id=\"span_9\">5. The Trial Court, by order impugned, had dismissed the\n\napplication. The Court while dismissing the application, had\n\nrelied on a judgment passed of this Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1992367/\" id=\"a_4\">Revamma\n\nVs. Shanthappa1</a> and observed that in a case where a party\n\nalleges that a person is impotent or suffering from other such\n\nincurable disease, it is for a person making such an allegation\n\nto prove the same. A party cannot be compelled to undergo\n\nmedical examination.</span> It also observed that there is no provision\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_5\">Hindu Marriage Act</a> or the rules framed thereunder,\n\nor in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_6\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> or in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_7\">Indian Evidence Act</a>\n\nor any other law which would show any person in the Court to\n\ncompel any party to undergo medical examination and the Trial\n\nCourt had also considered the judgment of the High Court of\n\nAndhra Pradesh in case of Pulavarthi Sriramamurthy Vs.\n\nLakshmikanthamma2. Relying on these judgments, the Trial\n\nCourt had observed that the marriage was organized on\n\n10.06.2015 and according to the husband, nuptial ceremony\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">1</span>\n    AIR 1972 KANT 157\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">2</span>\n    AIR 2001 AP 502\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                 -7-</span>\n                                              NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                            WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas arranged in the month of November and at para No.8 of\n\nhis pleadings, he had taken a stand that during the stay of the\n\nwife in his residence, on 05.12.2015 he has taken the wife to\n\nthe gynecologist. He had not produced any document to that\n\neffect to show that any advice given to the wife. Dr.Latha is a\n\ngynecologist, but the husband himself had taken the wife to the\n\nhospital. Therefore, question of issuance of direction to the wife\n\nfor medical examination do not arise. When the husband has\n\napproached the Court seeking the declaration that the marriage\n\nis a nullity he has to prove the facts. Therefore, without the\n\nevidence of both the parties, application filed by the husband is\n\nnot maintainable and accordingly, dismissed the application.\n\nAggrieved thereby the present Writ Petition is filed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\nmarriage could not be consummated as the wife is impotent.\n\nHe has no other way to prove the case except sending the wife\n\nfor medical examination. Unless and until she is examined and\n\na report is placed before the Court, it is difficult for the husband\n\nto prove his case. The Trial Court without considering all these\n\naspects had dismissed the petition. He had relied on the\n\njudgement of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in case of Sharda Vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    -8-</span>\n                                                    NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                  WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nDharmpal3. He had relied on para Nos.76, 78 and 79, which\n\nreads thus,\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">      76. The matter may be considered from another\n      angle. In all such matrimonial cases where divorce\n      is   sought,    say   on    the    ground     of    impotency,\n      schizophrenia etc. normally without there being\n      medical examination, it would be difficult to arrive\n      at a conclusion as to whether the allegation made\n      by his spouse against the other spouses seeking\n      divorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In\n      order      to   substantiate       such     allegation,       the\n      petitioner      would      always    insist        on    medical\n      examination. If respondent avoids such medical\n      examination on the ground that it violates his/her\n      right to privacy or for a matter right to personal\n      liberty    as   enshrined    under    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article       21</a>   of   the\n      Constitution of India, then it may in most of such\n      cases become impossible to arrive at a conclusion.\n      It may render the very grounds on which divorce is\n      permissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no\n      right to privacy specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a>\n      of the Constitution of India and with the extensive\n      interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this\n      right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be\n      treated as absolute right. What is emphasized is\n      that some limitations on this right have to be\n      imposed and particularly where two competing\n      interests clash. In mattes of aforesaid nature\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">3</span>\n2003 4 SCC 493\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               -9-</span>\n                                               NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                              WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n     where the legislature has conferred a right upon\n     his spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it\n     would be the right of that spouse which comes in\n     conflict with the so-called right to privacy of the\n     respondent. Thus the Court has to reconcile these\n     competing interests by balancing the interests\n     involved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">     78. It is, however, axiomatic that a Court shall not\n     order a roving inquiry. It must have sufficient\n     materials before it to enable it to exercise its\n     discretion. Exercise of such discretion would be\n     subjected to the supervisory jurisdiction of the\n     High Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/82577596/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 115</a> of the Code of\n     Civil   Procedure   and/or     <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_12\">Article     227</a>   of   the\n     Constitution of India. Abuse of the discretionary\n     power at the hands of a Court is not expected. The\n     Court must arrive at a finding that the applicant\n     has established a strong prima facie case before\n     passing such an order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">     79. If despite an order passed by the Court, a\n     person refuses to submit himself to such medical\n     examination, a strong case for drawing an adverse\n     inference would be made out <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 114</a> of the\n     Indian Evidence Act also enables a Court to draw\n     an adverse inference if the party does not produce\n     the relevant evidences in his power an possession.\n\n\n     He had also relied on the other judgements of the other\n\nHigh Courts which were passed taking into consideration.

Dharmpal</a> stated\n\nsupra in fact, supports the case of the wife and the Trial Court\n\nhad rightly dismissed the petition and no grounds are made out\n\nseeking interference with the well considered order passed by\n\nthe Trial Court.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">      8. Having heard the learned counsels on either side,\n\nperused the material on record. The marriage had taken place\n\non 11.06.2015 and he had filed the M.C. on 04.01.2016.\n\nAccording to the husband, the marriage is not consummated as\n\nthe wife is impotent. He has made all his efforts and it is also\n\nhis case that he has taken the wife to a gynecologist by name\n\nDr. Latha. Even the same was accepted and affirmed by the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                                - 12 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_23\">NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                            WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nwife in her objections stating that she has been taken to the\n\ndoctor and according to her, the doctor, after examination has\n\nfelt that by all means the wife is normal. The husband had not\n\nadduced any other evidence of the family members or the\n\nrelatives as he is referring in his petition about the mediation\n\nthat is done. Now, unless and until he makes out a prima facie\n\ncase with the available evidence that the wife is reluctant and\n\nin that regard the mediations were also done and having no\n\nother go, he had to come before the Court with this petition\n\nseeking nullity of the marriage. Straightaway he cannot come\n\nup with an application stating that the wife has to be subjected\n\nto the medical examination. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_18\">Sharda Vs. Dharmpal</a>&#x27;s case stated supra had considered the\n\nrights of a party and the right to privacy as enshrined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> and how it has to be balanced with the right of a\n\nperson to defend himself. The Court had observed that when\n\nthere is no right to privacy specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India and with the extensive interpretation\n\nof the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read into\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as an absolute right. What is\n\nemphasized is that some limitations on this right have to be</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">                               - 13 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                                            NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                          WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nimposed and particularly where two competing interests clash.\n\nIn matters of the aforesaid nature where the legislation has\n\nconferred a right upon his spouse to seek divorce on such\n\ngrounds, it would be the right of that spouse which comes in\n\nconflict with the so-called right to privacy of one party, there\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held that there should be a balance\n\nbetween the right to privacy and at the same time, the right of\n\nthe other person to be adequately defend himself. While laying\n\nsuch a ratio, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has also categorically\n\nobserved that in those cases, the Court shall not order for\n\nroving inquiry. It must have sufficient materials before it to\n\nenable it to exercise its discretion and such discretion would be\n\nsubject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/82577596/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 115</a> of CPC and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India. Abuse of the discretionary power at the hands of a\n\nCourt is not expected. The Court must arrive at a finding that\n\nthe applicant has established a strong prima facie case before\n\npassing such an order. For applying the <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_24\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_25\">laid down in</a></a> the\n\njudgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in Sharda Vs. Dharmpal&#x27;s\n\ncase stated supra. The first and foremost thing is the party who\n\nseeks such a relief should make out a prima facie case. It is the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">                                 - 14 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                                                NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                               WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\ncase of the petitioner that whatever the case he has pleaded in\n\nthe petition is a prima facie case. In the petition itself, he has\n\nstated about the mediation that had taken place. He had taken\n\nthe wife to a doctor. He should prove his case by adducing\n\nnecessary evidence and he should make out prima facie case.\n\nThereafter, if the medical examination is required and if the\n\nCourt comes to the conclusion that unless and until a medical\n\nexamination is conducted the husband would not be able to\n\nprove his case and having satisfied that there is a prima facie\n\ncase, then at that stage either the application or the request\n\nthat   is   made   by   the   husband    for   examination   can   be\n\nconsidered. But it cannot be at a threshold without even\n\nchoosing any evidence or without even making a strong prima\n\nfacie case where the Court will be compelled to ask the wife to\n\nsubject herself to the examination. In the considered opinion of\n\nthis Court, the stage at which the application is filed by the\n\nhusband is not appropriate and he could not make out a strong\n\nprima facie case which compel the Court to pass an order\n\nsubjecting the wife to medical examination. In that view of the\n\nmatter, this court finds no reason to interfere with the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">                                    - 15 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                                                     NC: 2024:KHC:36842\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                   WP No. 4303 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nconsidered order of the Trial Court.
