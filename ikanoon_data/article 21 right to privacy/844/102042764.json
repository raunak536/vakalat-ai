Similarly, the right to privacy of a\nthird party, which is part of his personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution, may be breached if a particular kind of information, purely of\npersonal nature may be directed to be furnished by the concerned authority. To\nprotect the rights of third parties, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 11</a> of the Act provides that where a\nCentral Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case\nmay be, intends to disclose any information or record or part thereof, may on a\nrequest made under the Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party\nand has been treated as confidential by that third party, a written notice will have\nto be given to such third party inviting such party to make a submission in writing\nor orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such\nsubmission of the third party can be kept in view while taking a decision about\ndisclosure of the information. The decision taken by the Central Public Information\nOfficer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n11</a> of the Act is appealable under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 19</a> of the Act before the Information\nCommission and when the Information Commission decides such an appeal, it\ndecides only whether or not the information should be furnished to the citizen in\nview of the objection of the third party. Here also the Information Commission\ndoes not decide the rights of a third party but only whether the information which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                         6</span>\n is held by or under the control of a public authority in relation to or supplied by\nthat third party could be furnished to a citizen under the provisions of the Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">Hence, the Information Commission discharges administrative functions, not\njudicial functions.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">The Respondent, during the hearing, reiterated the contents of their written\nsubmissions, which states as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_15\">&quot;The Appellant preferred Second Appeal before this Hon&#x27;ble CIC wherein he has\ncontended that that the CPIO denied information on flimsy grounds and that the\nFAA order Is not on record. The Information denied is covered in the directions of\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court In <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_33\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case as well as the contempt petition in\nGirish Mittal case. 7. It is humbly submitted that the CPIO has duly discharged his\nduties in accordance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_34\">RTI Act</a>. It is submitted that though\nSupreme Court in the matter of Jayantilal N Mistry has directed Reserve Bank to\nuphold the public interest and not the interest of any bank and directed to disclose\nthe Information, it has not forbidden the public authority to follow the procedure\nas contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_35\">RTI Act</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_16\">Further, in the matter of Girlsh Mittal, Supreme\nCourt has observed that the respondents (, Reserve Bank of India) are duty bound\nto furnish all information relating to inspection reports and other materials apart\nfrom material that was exempted in para 77 of the judgement&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_36\">Reserve Bank of\nIndia v.

Hence, the contention of the appellant that the\nCPIO has denied the information on flimsy grounds is incorrect and denied, it is\nsubmitted that the CPIO has utmost regard to the judicial and quasi-judicial\nauthorities of the Country and all the actions taken by the CPIO is in accordance\nwith the law. 8. As regards allegation of the Appellant that FAA order was not\nprovided, the same is denied as incorrect. It is submitted that the FAA order dated\n10.08.2021 dismissing the first appeal dated 16.07.2021 filed by the appellant was\nuploaded on the RTI portal on the very same day itself i.e., 10.08.2021. Further,\nthe said order was also forwarded to the Appellant vide letter dated 11.08.2021\nsent through speed post on 11.08.2021. The said letter has not returned\nundelivered and is deemed served upon the appellant. A copy of the forwarding\nletter and speed post receipt is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure-4\n(colly). 9. It is humbly submitted that in the present RTI application filed by the\napplicant, for disclosure of information, the CPIO had followed procedure\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.

The Commission while examining various objections realize that the Writ\nPetitions filed before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India is seeking directions of\nthe Supreme Court for non-disclosure of certain aspects of these audit/inspection\nreport and any such guidance in these Writ Petitions will have direct bearing and\nprovide further clarity to the CPIO/FAA in adjudicating various aspects of\ndisclosure/non-disclosure of reports or the information/data which are part of\nthese reports under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_45\">RTI Act</a>.</span> The Commission takes note that\nall the cases/second appeals filed herein are based on interpretations of RBI Vs.\nJayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judicial pronouncements requesting for\nfull disclosure vis-à-vis with exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act for non-\ndisclosure of full or parts of these reports.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                         8</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_21\">40. In view of the above observations, the Commission is of the view that\nthe reports generated in the hands of regulatory public authority in discharge of\nits statutory obligations are information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the RTI Act, as the\nregulator and the regulated entities are not governed by fiduciary relationship.\nThe orders of the Commission to their effect has been upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_48\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>&#x27;s case and the position is unchanged even\ntoday. Various objections filed by banks/financial institutions, to be examined,\nanalyzed and adjudicated upon, are related to various data and information\nsubmitted to the Reserve Bank of India by these financial institutions explaining\ntheir operations, commercial decisions, clients data etc. under statutory\nobligations can be disclosed as such. There are apparently two set of such\ninformation which have been shared by the institutions with the regulator under\nstatutory obligation. First is the information/data of clients relating to their\nbusiness/commercial operations, financial transactions, business and commercial\nstrategy which is shared by clients with financial institutions in full trust and\nconfidence and is held by them in fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_49\">RTI Act</a> in their hands. Second set is the information relating to business\nstrategy, decisions, transactions, other operational data etc. of financial\ninstitutions have been bearing on their competitive position which also enjoys the\nexemption from disclosure in their hands, if it is a public authority or otherwise,\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_50\">RTI Act</a>. Some of such data, on case to case basis be sensitive enough for\nprotection of national interest. The Commission is of the view that the protection\nof disclosure of information under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of\nfinancial institutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in\ngood faith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligation.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_22\">Various\nobservations of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_52\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>&#x27;s case also does not\nindicate so and decision of the regulator to consider redacting such\ndata/information while disclosing the reports is aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_23\">41. The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of\nthe CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and later\nin the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be required to\nadjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of the Commission\nafresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take view on various\nobjections filed by the Banks and Financial Institutions and submissions made by\napplicant to reach the decision in favour or against redaction of various parts of\nthe report on case to case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                         9</span>\n Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_53\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case and other relevant judgments, some of\nwhich have been referred in this order as well. Hence, with these observations the\norders passed by the CPIO and FAA in these matters are set aside and the cases\nare being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh.

It is amply clear that Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nothers tagged are admitted in Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court wherein guidance and\ndirection has been sought on non-disclosure of certain type of information which\nare essentially the part of the Annual Inspection Report/RAR, etc. These petitions\nalso seek protection of interim communication between regulator and the\nregulated entity in the process of finalization of these reports or otherwise. It is\nobvious that decision in these Writ Petitions will provide clarity and guidance to\nthe Public Authority on redaction/non-disclosure of a set of information inspite of\nbeing part of these reports which are open to disclosure. At this stage, any\ndecision by the Public Authority will amount to pre-judging the issues pending\nadmitted Writ Petitions before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Various banks,\nfinancial institutions, respondent public authority and the RTI applicant have\nalready impleaded party and are presenting their arguments before the Apex\nCourt.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">       43. Hence, any decision of redaction or disclosure of information, without\nwaiting for decision in the Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged may cause irrevocable damage against right of privacy and protection of\ncommercial interest. Hence, the respondent public authority if expedient may\nwait for the outcome in Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged or seek clarification from the Hon&#x27;ble Court and accordingly decide these\nRTI applications by following process as enumerated in the earlier paras by the\nCommission in the interest of principles of natural justice. While disclosing the\ninformation they should be cautious in taking a considerate view balancing right\nto privacy, protection of national and commercial interest on one hand vis-à-vis\nlarger public interest.
