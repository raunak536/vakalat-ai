Whether the building in question described as mosque\n      in the sketch map attached to the plaint (hereinafter\n      referred to as the building) was a mosque as claimed by\n      the plaintiff ? If the answer is in the affirmative?\n1a.   When was it built and by whom-whether by Babar as\n      alleged by the plaintiffs or by Meer Baqi as alleged by\n      defendant no.13 ?\n\nFINDINGS\n      These issues are interconnected and can conveniently be\n\ndisposed of at one place.\n\n\n      Plaintiffs claim that the building in question was a mosque\n\nand has been described in the plaint. It was built by Babur more\n\nthan 433 years ago after his conquest of India. In alternative it is\n\nurged assuming though not admitting that one time there existed a\n\nHindu temple as alleged by the defendants then on the site of\n\nwhich temple Babur built the mosque, the mosque since long in\n\ncontinuous possession of Muslims and they perfected their rights\n\nby adverse possession. It is further the case of the plaintiffs that the\n\nbuilding stood dedicated to Almighty. It is also the case of the\n\nplaintiffs that the building had been used by members of Muslim\n\ncommunity for offering prayers from times immemorial and\n\nMuslims were in possession of the property in suit from 1528 AD\n\ncontinuously, openly and to the knowledge of the defendants and\n\nHindus in general. On the contrary, on behalf of defendant no.13 it\n\nis urged that the property in suit was constructed by Mir Baqi. It\n\nwas not used by members of Muslims for prayers. It remained in\n                                   2\n\npossession of Hindus and building was not dedicated to Almighty.\n\nIt is also the case of Hindus that Muslims were not in exclusive\n\npossession of the property in suit which has already been\n\ndemolished on 06.12.1992.\n\n        It has further been pleaded from the side of Hindus that it\n\nwas Mir Baqi, who was Shia Muslim, who demolished the ancient\n\nHindu temple of Sri Ram Janam Bhumi and raised a mosque like\n\nstructure in its place with its materials. The masjid was known as\n\nMasjid Janmasthan in British times. 14 Kasauti pillars and other\n\nmaterial reveal the structural features of the building. Mir Baqi\n\nwas influenced by the so called Faquir named Fazal Abbas\n\nQalandar, who had instructed the destruction of the ancient temple\n\nat Ram Janma Bhumi and construction of a mosque at that place\n\nfor him to offer prayers, although the doing so is opposed to tenets\n\nof Islam.\n\n        Plaintiffs further claim that since it was a mosque and was\n\nconstructed by Babur, accordingly they are entitled to retain the\n\nsame.\n\n        On behalf of plaintiffs, oral as well as documentary evidence\n\nhas been adduced.\n\n        First of all, I will take up documentary evidence. The\n\nplaintiffs have filed the documentary evidence in different\n\ncategories.\n\n\n        Regarding nature of the building : In order to establish\n                                  3\n\nthat Babur had camped near Ayodhya and he had not given any\n\norder for demolition of any temple and even on his return from the\n\nEast, when he had called Mir Baqi at a place near Ayodhya, there\n\nis no mention that he had given instructions for demolition of any\n\ntemple or construction of any mosque at the site of any temple.\n\nWhile there is specific mention of the desecration of the nude parts\n\nof the idols of Urwa in Babarnama.\n\n       Plaintiffs have relied over (Ext.82)- Extract of Memoirs of\n\nBabur by F.G.Talbot, (Ext.85)- Extract of Mughalkalin Bharat-\n\nBabur by S.Athar Abbas Rizvi, (Ext. 91),(Ext. OOS 5-48)-Extract\n\nof Memoirs of Babar by John Leyden (Vol. 20, P.129 - 137),(Ext.\n\nOOS 5-15)-Extract of Memoirs of Babar by John Leyden &amp; John\n\nErskine (1921) (Vol. 20, P.139, (Ext. OOS 5-16)-Extract of\n\nBaburnama by A.S.Beveridge Vol. 20, P.145 - 159. Plaintiffs have\n\nfurther relied over Epigraphia Indica (Arabic and Persian\n\nSupplement) (1965) by Dr. Z.A.Desai to establish that there were\n\ninscriptions on the Mosque. Sri Z. Jilani, Advocate further relied\n\nover Extract of Aine Akbari (Vol.III) (Vol. 42, P. 83-93) ,Extract of\n\nAine Akbari (Vol.II) (Vol. 42, P. 97-137) and Ext.104 of OOS 4/89\n\nand Extract of the report of William Finch from the Book-Early\n\nTravels in India by William Foster. These extracts go to show that\n\neven in these books written between 1584 and 1608 there is no\n\nmention either of the alleged belief of Hindus about the place of\n\nbirth of Lord Rama being there in the Babri Mosque or about the\n\nalleged belief of demolition of any Ram Janam Bhoomi Temple\n                                  4\n\nby Babar or Mir Baqi. Aine Akbari is a public and historic\n\ndocument. It does not mention of several other places of Hindu\n\nworship but there is no mention of the so called Ram Janam Bhumi\n\nTemple or place of birth of Lord Rama. In this context it further\n\ntranspires that the plaintiffs at para-2 of the plaint have mentioned\n\nthat Babur visited Ayodhya and there was battle between Babar\n\nand then Muslim Ruler of Ayodhya and several persons were killed\n\nduring the battle and they were buried in the ancient graveyard\n\nwhich has already been acquired by the Government of India. Thus\n\nthe plaintiffs through these papers want to establish that Babur\n\nnever visited Ayodhya.\n\n      Plaintiffs have further relied over Vol. 3 of Mr. P.N.Mishra,\n\nSenior Advocate, P.203 - 205 Moghal India by Niccalass Manucli\n\nto show that between the period of 1653-1708 there was no such\n\nalleged belief that the building in dispute was the place of birth of\n\nLord Rama or the same was constructed after the demolition of\n\nany Hindu temple.      The aforesaid plea was reaffirmed in the\n\nExtract of Tieffenthaler published in 1786. It further shows that\n\neven upto that time there was no such alleged belief that the place\n\nof birth of Lord Rama was inside the Babri Mosque but rather Bedi\n\ni.e. &quot;the cradle&quot; referring to the place of Ram Chabutra was said to\n\nbe the place of birth of Lord Rama. Plaintiffs have relied over\n\nExt.D-28, Extract of Epigraphia Indica, Vol.4, Copper plates of the\n\ngrant of Govind Chandra etc. (Vol. 30, P. 119-131),Extract of\n\nEpigraphia Indica, Vol. 14, to show that there was no temple\n                                   5\n\nknown as Ram Janam Bhumi Temple referring to the place of birth\n\nof Lord Rama on the site in dispute.\n\n      The plaintiffs have further referred the Extract of Sanskrit\n\nInscriptions of Delhi Sultanate by Pushpa Prasad (Vol. 30, P. 167-\n\n173), 198C-2/128-130 Extract of the Journal of Bihar and Orissa\n\nResearch Society (1927)-The Sunga Inscription of Ayodhya(Vol.\n\n30, P. 177, 175, 176). These documents show that it was not\n\nmentioned in history that some inscriptions placed in one building\n\nwere later on shifted or installed in some other building also and\n\nthat similar carvings on pillars etc. were found at other places also.\n\nExtract of the Catalogue of Historical Documents in Kapad Dwar\n\nCollection, Jaipur, Ext.105 shows that there is no sketch or\n\nphotograph of any Janam Sthan or Janam Bhumi Temple in\n\nAyodhya. The plaintiffs have further relied over extract of &quot;An\n\nAdvanced History of India&quot; by R.C. Majumdar &amp; Ray Chaudhary\n\netc. (Vol. 38, P. 175-191),Extract of the Book &quot;Society and Culture\n\nin North India in the Twelfth Century&quot; by B.N.S.Yadav,\n\n(Ext.87)Extract of &quot;The History of India as Told by its own\n\nHistorians&quot;,Vol.VI, by Elliot and Dowson (Vol. 16, P. 2-6),\n\n(Ext.89)Extract of &quot;The History of India as Told by its own\n\nHistorians&quot;, Vol.III, by Elliot and Dowson (Vol. 16,P.14-20),(Ext\n\n102)Extract of &quot;The History of India as Told by its own\n\nHistorians&quot;,Vol.II, by Elliot &amp; Dowson(Extract of Tabaqate Nasre\n\n(Vol. 16, P. 184-197)(Exts OOS5-D-5 &amp; D-6)Extract of &quot;The\n\nHistory of India as Told by its own Historians&quot;, Vol.II, by Elliot &amp;\n                                     6\n\nDowson (Extracts of Mirate Masoodi) (Vol. 38, P. 353-371), (Ext\n\n88)Extract of &quot;The History of India as Told by Its Own\n\nHistorians&quot;, Vol. IV,by Elliot &amp; Dowson (Extracts of Tuzuke Babri\n\nand Tarikhe Dawoodi) (Vol. 16, P. 7-12) Extract of Moghul Empire\n\nin India by Prof.S.R.Sharma (1934) (Vol. 16, P. 169-181) 301C-\n\n1/1-3 Extract of &quot;The Sharqi Architecture of Jaunpur&quot; by A.Fuhrer\n\n(Vol.37, P. 135-139) Extract of &quot;Encyclopaedia of Indian\n\nArchaeology&quot; Edited by A.Ghosh (Vol. 37, P. 113) (Ext D-\n\n36)Extract of the Book &quot;Destruction and Conservation of Cultural\n\nProperty&quot; Edited and Published by Roultedge, London in 2001\n\n(Article of Prof.Ram Saran Sharma on Ayodhya) Vol. 38, P.211-\n\n229, (EXT 90) Extract of the Book &quot;The Disputed Mosque-A\n\nHistorical Inquiry&quot; by Sushil Srivastava (1991) (Vol. 16, P. 158-\n\n163),Extract of the Book &quot;The Secular Emperor Babar&quot; by\n\nSurendra Kaur &amp; Tapan Sanyal(1987) (Vol. 25, P. 49-121) Extract\n\nof &quot;The Temples of India&quot; published by the Govt. of India (1964)\n\n(Vol. 37, P.143 - 159),Extract of &quot;India Distorted&quot; by S.C.Mittal\n\n(Vol. 26, P.3 - 51),(Ext E-6)Extract of &quot;The Early History of India&quot;\n\nby V.

It was also\n\nobserved by Martin that Pillars in the Babur&#x27;s Mosque were taken\n\nfrom a Hindu building and probably these Pillars were taken from\n\nthe ruins of the palace. Vol. 20, P. 21-23 (107C-1/10-110) (Ext.\n\nOOS 5-5) by Edward Thorntone (1858). In this Gazetteer also\n                                  10\n\nthere is no mention of any such tradition or belief that any portion\n\ninside the Babri Masjid might have been considered as the place of\n\nbirth of Lord Rama.         Referring to Buchanan, the Author\n\n(Thorntone) says that out of 360 Temples said to have been\n\nconstructed by Vikramaditya, no traces were available of any of\n\nthem and according to native tradition the demolition was made by\n\nAurangzeb who built a Mosque on a part of the site. In this respect\n\nThorntone says that the falsehood of the tradition is, however,\n\nproved by an inscription on the wall of the mosque, attributing the\n\nwork to the conqueror Baber from whom Aurungzeb was fifth in\n\ndescent. The mosque is embellished with fourteen columns of\n\nonly five or six feet in height, but of very elaborate and tasteful\n\nworkmanship, said to have been taken from the ruins of the\n\nHindoo fanes, to which they had been given by the monkey-\n\ngeneral Hanuman, who had brought them from Lanka or Ceylon.\n\nAltogether, however, the remains of antiquity in the vicinity of this\n\nrenowned capital must give a very low idea of the state of arts and\n\ncivilization of the Hindoo at a remote period. A quadrangular\n\ncoffer of stone, whitewashed, five ells long, four broad and\n\nprotruding five of six inches above ground, is pointed out as the\n\ncradle in which Rama was born, as the seventh Avatar of Vishnu;\n\nand is accordingly abundantly honoured by the pilgrimages and\n\ndevotions of Hindus...&quot;Vol. 20, P. 25-34, 107C-1/12-16(Ext.

In this respect also the places associated with Lord Rama\n                                  11\n\nwere specifically mentioned including Guptur Ghat, Swarg Dwari\n\nand Ram Kot etc. and about the birth place Temple it was\n\nspecifically mentioned on page 322 (page 29 of Vol. 20) that &quot;in\n\nthe very heart of the city stands Janam Sthan or &quot;birth place\n\nTemple&quot; of Rama&quot; It is thus evident that in 1862-1865 the tradition\n\nand belief / faith was in respect of the Janam Sthan Temple\n\nsituated in the Northern site of Babri Masjid to be the birth place\n\nof Lord Rama.Vol. 20, P. 35-49 (107C-1/17-24-Ext. OOS 5-49) by\n\nCarnegy (1870). It was with this Gazetteer that the theory of\n\ndemolition of Janam Sthan Temple and construction of Babri\n\nMasjid at the site thereof was introduced for the first time but that\n\ntoo was based on no source of History and rather was based only\n\non local belief. The Author himself says under the heading &quot;The\n\nJanam Sthan and other Temples&quot; on page 20 of the Book (page 45\n\nof the Vol.) that &quot;it is locally affirmed that at the Mohamdan\n\nconquest Emperor Babar built the Mosque by demolishing\n\nJanamsthan Temple&quot;. In the same sequence it is also mentioned\n\non page 21 of the Book:-\n\n      &quot;In two places in the Babri mosque the year in which it was\n\nbuilt 935 H., Corresponding with 1528 A.D, is carved in stone,\n\nwith inscriptions dedicated to the glory of that Empror.&quot; Carnegy\n\nfurther says about the pillars that &quot;To my thinking these strongly\n\nresemble Budhist pillars that I have seen at Benares and\n\nelsewhere.&quot;\n\n      Thus the so called belief / tradition about the Janam Sthan\n                                  12\n\nTemple being demolished and Babri Masjid being constructed on\n\nits site starts from this Gazetteer of 1870.

Plate No. XVI, XVII,\n\nXVIII, XX, XXI, XXIV, CXII, CXV, CXVIII AND CXXI of the\n\nsaid book may be of relevance in this respect.\n\nB - &#x27;Historian&#x27;s Report to the Nation&#x27; is also an important\n\ndocument which has been filed by both the parties Viz. plaintiffs of\n\nthis suit as well as Plaintiffs of OOS No. 5 / 89 which is marked as\n\nExt. 62 (Volume 12, P. 367-405) in this suit and Ext. OOS 5-45\n\n(Vol. 32, P.231-245) in OOS 5/89. This report not only supports\n\nMuslims claim but also belies the case of Hindu side.\n\nC - Similarly some documents have been filed to show the manner\n\nin which Pillars are generally found in Hindu Temples. These\n\ndocuments prove the contention of the Muslims that the place in\n\ndispute had no such structure which might have rested on Pillars.\n                                      26\n\nSome pillar bases are also visible in the documents marked as\n\npaper No. 333 C-1/1 - to 335 C-1/20 (Vol. 40 P. 159 - 319) (Ext.\n\nD-17, D-18 and D-19) and Ext. D-9, 10 and 11 (Vol. 39, P.17-45).\n\nDifferent other features and places of putting idols in Temples are\n\nalso evident from these photograps which support the contention\n\nof the Muslims that the walls 16 and 17 found during the\n\nExcavation could not be said to be the wall of any Temple but\n\nrather the same could be the wall of the Idgah.\n\nD.      Reliance has been placed by the plaintiffs on some books of\n\nHistory which were referred during the arguments in rebuttal\n\nadvanced from the side of plaintiffs. These Books included:-\n\n(i)     &#x27;Travels in the Mogul Empire,&#x27; AD 1656-1668, Translated\n\n        by Archibald Constable, revised by V.A. Smith, Oxford,\n\n        1916 , (p.5)\n\n(ii)    W.

Wilson, 6 vols., London, 1840, I, (pp. 137-140)\n\n        From these accounts it is clear that, as Bernier puts it, the\n\nKing was the owner of all soil, except for the houses and lands that\n                                      27\n\n     were allowed to be sold and purchased. Thus it follows that all\n\n     vacant land automatically belonged to the sovereign - a doctrine\n\n     that continued under the British government.\n\n             FOLLOWING WITNESSES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED\n\n     BY THE PLAINTIFF/MUSLIM SIDE:-\n\n             The witnesses produced by the Muslim side may be divided\n\n     in the following categories:-\n\n     A-      Witnesses of fact deposing about the Mosque being used\n\n     for the prayers by Muslims upto 22-12-1949:-\n\nAnnexure-V\nPage 240-281\n\n\n     (i) PW-1 (Mohd.

The Chinese Traveler Yuan Chwang who       travelled India\n\n  in the reign of Emperor Harshavardhan during the period of\n\n  629 A.D.to     645 A.D. has recorded existence of Ten\n\n  prominent Deva Temple of the Hindus in Ayodhya which\n\n  shows that the prominent Temples described in Sri\n\n  Skandapuranam including the Sri Ramjanamsthan Temple\n\n  were still in existence during the Ayodhya visit of Yuan\n\n  Chwang.

In his memoirs Babur-Nama Babar did not record any entry\n\n  to show that there was fighting between him and the then\n\n  ruller of Ayodhya or to show under his order any mosque\n\n  was erected in Ayodhya as such the plaint case that there\n\n  was fighting between Babur and the then ruler of Ayodhya\n\n  wherein several soldiers of Babur were killed and for corpse\n\n  of those soldiers said Emperor made grave-yards and for\n\n  other Muslims made a mosque has no foundation at all. In\n\n  his memoirs Babur has mentioned name of the places and\n\n  nature of constructions carried on at such places but he has\n\n  not mentioned Ayodhya and Babri mosque. In 935 A.H.\n\n  itself Babur remembered that construction works were going\n\n  on in Dhulpur and Agra but did not mention construction of\n\n  Baburi Mosque at Ayodhya. He has recorded his orders\n\n  given for constructing wells, building, mosque, ponds etc.\n                             42\n\nvery minutely and he has referred construction of one place\n\nseveral times in his Memoirs as such there is no possibility\n\nof his missing any construction at Agra. Relevant extracts\n\nfrom pages 520, 606-607, 615-616 and 642 from the Babar-\n\nNama translated by Annette Susannah Beveridge reprint of\n\n2006 published by the Low Price Publications, Delhi read as\n\nfollows:\n\n           &quot;680 men worked daily on my buildings in Agra\n           and of Agra stone-cutters only; while 1491 stone-\n           cutters worked daily on my buildings in Agra, Sikri.\n           Biana, Dulpur, Gualiar and Kuil. In the same way\n           there are numberless artisans and workmen of every\n           sort in Hindustan.&quot; (ibid p. 520)\n\nBabur-Nama&#x27;s entry dated 21st September 1528 (935 A.H.)\nrecords his order to erect a mosque in Dhulpur, said entry\nreads as follows:\n\n           &quot;(c. Work in Dulpur (Dhulpur).)\n           That place is at the end of a beaked hill, its beak\n           being of solid red building-stone (imarat-task). I\n           had ordered the (beak of the) hill cut down (dressed\n           down?) to the ground-level and that if there\n           remained a suffering height, a house was to be cut\n           out in it, if not, it was to be levelled and a tank\n           (hauz)cut out in its top. As it was not found high\n           enough for a house, Ustad Shah Muhammad the\n           stone-cutter was ordered to level it and cut out an\n           octagonal, roofed tank. North of this tank the\n           ground is thick with trees, mangoes, jaman\n           (Eugenia jambolana), all sorts of trees; amongst\n           them I had ordered a well made to by to; it wa\n           almost ready; its water goes to the afore-named\n           tank. To the north of this tank Sl. Sikandar&#x27;s dam is\n           flung across (the valley); on it houses have been\n           built, and above it the waters of the Rains gather\n           into a great lake. On the east of this lake is a\n           garden; I ordered a seat and four-pillared platform\n           (talar)to be cut out in the solid rock on that same\n           side, and a mosque built on the western one.&quot; (ibid\n           p.606-607)\n                Babur-Nama&#x27;s entry dated 14th October, 1928\n                             43\n\n              records inspection of the work at Sikari as\n              follows:\n          &quot;At the top of the dawn, we bestirred ourselves\n          from that place, and in the first that place, and in\n          the first watch dismounted at the garden now in\n          making at Sikri.

Their leave was then given them.&quot;\n                                                 (ibid p. 642)\n\n4. Princes Gul-Badan Begam, the daughter of the Emperor\n\n  Babur in her book Humayun-Nama has mentioned several\n\n  constructions at different places wherein Ayodhya and\n\n  Baburi Mosque did not find place. From which facts it\n\n  becomes clear that no construction of Baburi Mosque was\n\n  done by the Emperor Babur in Ayodhya was made by\n\n  Relevant extract from her said book read as follows:\n\n          &quot;He commanded buildings to be put up in Agra on\n          the other side of the river, and a stone palace to be\n          built for himself between the haram and the garden.\n          He also had one built in the audience court, with a\n          reservoir in the middle and four chambers in the\n          four towers. On the river&#x27;s bank he had a\n          chaukandi built.\n\n          He ordered a tank made in Dholpur, ten by ten, out\n          of a single mass of rock, and used to say, &#x27;when it is\n          finished, I will fit it with wine.&#x27; But as he had\n          given up wine before the fight with Rana Sanga, he\n          filled it with lemonade.&quot;(ibid p.98)\n                              44\n\n           &quot;When we had been in Agra three months, the\n           Emperor went to Dholpur. Her Highness Maham\n           Begam and this lowly person also went. A tank had\n           been made there, ten (gaz) by ten, out of one piece\n           (of rock). From Dholpur his Majesty went on to\n           Sikri. He ordered a great platform made in the\n           middle of the tank, and when it was ready, he used\n           to go and sit on it, or to row about. This platform\n           still exists.&quot;\n                                                       (ibid p.\n           102)\n           From Gulbadan-Begam&#x27;s account related to the\n           event which took place just after death of Emperor\n           Babur it appears that Mir Baqi was not Governor of\n           Oudh but some one else. Relevant extract from her\n           book read as follows:\n\n           &quot;As Gul-chihra Begam was in Oude, and her\n           husband, Tukhta-bugha Sultan, went to the mercy\n           of God, her attendants wrote to his Majesty from\n           Oude and said: &#x27;Tukhta-bugha Sultan is dead.\n           What is the order about the begam?&#x27; His Majesty\n           said to Mir Zaycha: &#x27;Go and bring the begam to\n           Agra. We also are going there&#x27;.&quot; (ibid p.115)\n\n\n5. In his book &quot;History of Indian and Eastern Architecture&quot; 1st\n\n   published 1910 reprinted by Low Price Publication, Delhi in\n\n   2006 in its Chapter X &#x27;Mughal Architecture&#x27;           James\n\n   Fergusson writes that no buildings erected by Babur or his\n\n   son Humayan are existent. The writer also writes that the\n\n   Babur in his memoirs had written that he had employed 680\n\n   persons on his palaces and 1491 stone cutters at Agra, Sikri,\n\n   Biana, Dholpur, Gwaliar and Koil for construction work.\n\n   From this recording it becomes clear that if Babur would\n\n   have employed workers to erect lofty firmament building in\n\n   Ayodhya somewhere in four corners of his memoirs sooner\n\n   or later certainly he would have mentioned.         Relevant\n                             45\n\n  extract from the page 285 of &quot;History of Indian and Eastern\n\n  Architecture&quot; read as follows:\n\n          &quot;There is, again, a little difficulty and confusion in\n          our having no examples of the style as practised by\n          Babar and Humayun. The well-known tomb of the\n          latter king was certainly built by his son Akbar;\n          Babar was buried near Kabul, and no building\n          known to be his has yet been identified in India.\n          Yet that he did build is certain. In his own\n          &#x27;Memoirs&#x27; he tells us. &quot;In agra alone, and of the\n          stone-cutters belonging to that place only, I\n          everyday employed on my palaces 680 persons; and\n          Agra, Sikri, Biana, Dholpur, Gwaliar and Koil,\n          there were every day employed on my works 1,491\n          stone-cutters.&quot; In the following pages he describes\n          some of these works, and especially a Baol of great\n          magnificence he excavated in the fort of Agra. This\n          was in the year 1526, and he lived to carry on these\n          works for five years longer. During the ten years\n          that his son retained the empire, we learn from\n          Ferishta and other sources that he adorned his\n          capital with many splendid edifices: one, a palace\n          containing seven pavilions or audience halls - one\n          dedicated to each of the planets, in which he gave\n          audience on the day of the week dedicated to the\n          planet of the day. There are traditions of mosque he\n          is said to have built on the banks of the Jamna,\n          opposite where the Taj now stands; and his name is\n          so frequently mentioned in connection with\n          buildings both at Agra and Delhi that there can be\n          little doubt that he was a builder to as great an\n          extent as the troubled character of his region would\n          admit of. But his buildings have perished, so that\n          practically the history of Mughal architecture\n          commences with the buildings of an Afghan\n          dynasty who occupied the throne of India for\n          sixteen years during the last part of Humayun&#x27;s\n          lifetime.&quot;\n\n          (ibid p. 285)\n\n6. Within 26th years of the death of Emperor Zahiruddin\n\n  Muhammad Babar in the year 1556 his grandson Emperor\n\n  Jalaluddin Muhammad succeeded his empire. During the\n                           46\n\nreign of Akbar, the Great, A-in-I Akbari, the Gazetteer of his\n\nKingdom was compiled by Emperor&#x27;s close confident and\n\nan erudite scholar Abul Fazl Allami. In the said Gazetteer\n\nAbul Fazl gives very minute and microscopic account of\n\nAjodhya he records that Ajodhya is esteemed ones of the\n\nholiest places of antiquity and was the residence of\n\nRamchandra in the Treta age. He further records that near\n\nthe city there were two tombs of six and seven yards in\n\nlength alleged to be of Seth and the Prophet Job. He also\n\nrecords the presence of the tomb of Kabir at Ratanpur as\n\nwell as grabes of the Salar Masud and Rajab Salar located in\n\nBahraich; but he did not mention existence of Babri Mosque\n\nor any other Mosque in Ayodhya from which it is crystal\n\nclear that during the reign of Akbar, the Great there was\n\nexistence of Sri Ramjanmsthan but there was no existence of\n\nBaburi Mosque otherwise a person from whose notice even\n\nthe graves have not been escaped would have certainly\n\ndescribed    said Babari Mosque more so a Mosque built by\n\nthe grandfather of his patron. Relevant extract from page\n\n182 of the Volume-II of the said book reads as follows:\n\n        Awadh (Ajodhya) is one of the largest cities in India.\n        It is situated in longitude 1180 6&#x27; and latitude\n        27o22&#x27;. In ancient times, its populations side\n        covered an extent of 148 kos in length and 36 in\n        breadth and it is esteemed ones of the holiest places\n        of antiquity. Around environs of the city, they sift\n        the earth and gold is obtained. It was the residence\n        of Ramchandra who in the Treta age combined in\n        his own person both the spiritual supremacy and the\n                              47\n\n           kingly office.\n\n           At the distance of one kos from the city, the Gogra,\n           after its junction with the Sai, [Saraju] flows below\n           the fort. Near the city stand two considerable\n           tombs of six and seven yards in length respectively.\n           The vulgar believe them to be the resting-places of\n           Seth and the prophet Job, and extraordinary tales\n           are related of them. Some say that at Ratanpur is\n           the tomb of Kabir, the assertor of the unity of God.\n           The portals of spiritual discernment were party\n           opened to him and he discarded the effete\n           doctorines of his own time. Numerous verses in the\n           Hindi language are still extant of him containing\n           important theological truths. Bahraich is a large\n           town on the banks of the river Sarju.

From the book Tarikh-I Badauni written by Abdul Kadir\n\n      Badauni another court Historian of the Emperor Akbar it\n\n      appears that said Emperor had very high regard for Sri Ram\n\n      Chandra and at the instance of the Emperor, Abdul Kadir\n\n      Badauni had translated Ramayana.

He had adopted sun worship and other mode of\n\n  worship of the Hindus.         He had handed over several\n\n  Mosques to Hindus and had allowed Hindu converts to\n\n  return back to their own religion. From the facts as stated\n\n  by said critic historian of the Emperor&#x27;s Court, it can be\n\n  inferred that if any Mosque would have been erected over\n\n  Sri Ramajanamsthan it would have been handed over to the\n\n  Hindus and such transfer of Mosque would not have escaped\n                           50\n\nnotice of Badauni. The relevant extracts from the Badauni&#x27;s\n\nsaid book reproduced in A-In-I Akbari Vol.I translated by\n\nH.Blochmann and reprinted in 1989 by the Low Price\n\nPublication, Delhi read as follows:\n\n        &quot;Moreover, Sumanis and Brahmins managed to get\n        frequent private interviews with His Majesty. As\n        they surpass other learned men in their treatises on\n        morals, and on physical and religious sciences, and\n        reach a high degree in their knowledge of the\n        future, in spiritual power and human perfection,\n        they brought proofs based on reason and testimony,\n        for the truth of their own and the fallacies of other\n        religions, and inculcated their doctrines so firmly\n        and so skilfully represented things as quite self-\n        evident which require consideration, that no man,\n        by expressing his doubts, could now raise a doubt\n        in His Majesty, even if mountains were to crumble\n        to dust, or the heavens were to tear as under.&quot;\n\n                                            (Ibid. p.188-189)\n\n        &quot;The emperor also learned from some Hindus,\n        formulae to reduce the influence of the sun to his\n        subjection, and commenced to read them mornings\n        and evenings as a religious exercise. He also\n        believed that it was wrong to kill cows, which the\n        Hindus worship; he looked upon cow-dung as pure,\n        interdicted the use of beef, and killed beautiful men\n        instead of cows. The doctors confirmed the\n        emperor in his opinion, and told him it was written\n        in their books that beef was productive of all sorts\n        of diseases and was very indigestible.&quot;\n                                                 (Ibid. p.193)\n\n        &quot;In this year the Tamgha (inland tolls) and the\n        Jazya (tax on infidels), which brought in several\n        krors of dams, were abolished, and edicts to this\n        effect were sent over the whole empire.&quot;\n                                               (Ibid. p.198)\n\n        &quot;Beef was interdicted, and to touch beef was\n        considered defiling. The reason of this was that,\n        from his youth, His Majesty had been in company\n        with Hindu libertines, and had thus learnt to look\n        upon a cow - which in their opinions is one of the\n                   51\n\nreasons why the world still exists - as some thing\nholy.    Besides, the Emperor was subject to\ninfluence of the numerous Hindu princesses of the\nharem, who had gained so great an ascendancy over\nhim as to make him forswear beef, garlic, onions,\nand the wearing of a beard, which thing His\nMajesty still avoids. He had also introduced,\nthough modified by his peculiar views, Hindu\ncustoms and heresies into the court assemblies, and\nintroduces them still, in order to please and win the\nHindus and their castes, he abstained from\neverything which they think repugnant to their\nnature, and looked upon shaving the beard as the\nhighest sign of friendship and affection for him.\nHence this custom has become very general.&quot;\n                                         (Ibid. p.202)\n\n&quot;The ringing of bells as in use with the Christians,\nand the showing of the figure of the cross, and\n.....and other childish playthings of theirs, were\ndaily in practice.&quot;\n                                       (Ibid. p.203)\n\n&quot;In these days (991) new orders were given.

Mosques and prayer-rooms were\nchanged into store rooms, or given to Hindu\nchaukidars. For the word jama at (public prayer)\nHis Majesty used the term jima (copulation), and\nfor hayya ala, he said yalala talala.\n             &quot;The cemetery within the town was\nordered to be sequestered.&quot;\n                                      (Ibid. p.210)\n\n&quot;These formulas were to take the place of our\nsalam and the answer to the salam.

The said book is written in\n\nLatin language, an English translation of his narrative of\n\nAjodhya finds place in the book Modern Traveler, a Popular\n\nDescription, Geographical, Historical and Topographical of\n\nthe Various Country of the Globe - India Vol-III published\n\nby James Duncan in the year 1828. Relevant extracts\n\ncontaining translation of Tieffenthaler&#x27;s account from pages\n\n312, 313, 314, 316 and 317 read as follows:\n\n            &quot;Its appearance, in 1770, is thus described by\n            Tieffen theler: &quot;Avad, called Adjudea by the\n            Learned Hindoos is a city of the highest antiquity.\n            Its houses are, for the most part, only on mud,\n            covered with straw or with tiles; many, however,\n            are of brick. The principal street, running from S.\n            to N., is about a league (mille) in length; and the\n                    55\n\nbreadth of the city is somewhat less. Its western\npart, as well as the northern, is situated on a hill; the\nnorth-eastern quarter rests upon eminences; but\ntowards Bangla, it is level. This town has now but\na scanty population, since the foundation of Bangla\nor Fesabad; a new town where the Governor has\nestablished his residence, and to which a great\nnumber of inhabitants of Oude have removed. On\nthe southern bank of Deva (or Goggrah), are found\nvarious buildings erected by the Gentoos in\nmemory of Ram, extending from east to west. The\nmore remarkable place is that which is called\nSorgodoari, that is to say, the heavenly temple;\nbecause they say, that Ram carried away from\nthence to heaven all the inhabitants of the city. The\ndeserted town was repeopled and restored to its\nformer condition by Bikaramajit, the famous King\nof Oojain. There was a temple here on the high\nbank of the river; but Aurangzebe, ever attentive to\nthe propagation of the faith of Mohammed, and\nholding the heathen in abhorrence, caused it to be\ndemolished, and replaced it with a mosque with\nminarets, in order to abolish the very memory of\nthe Hindoo superstition. Another mosque has been\nbuilt by the Moors, to the east of this. Near the\nSargodoari in an edifice erected by Nabalroy a\nformer Hindoo governor.           But a place more\nparticularly famous is that which is called Sitha\nRassoee, the table of Sitha (Seeta), wife of Ram;\nsituated on an eminence to the south of the city.\nThe emperor Aurangzebe demolished the fortress\ncalled Ramcote, and erected on the site, a\nMohammedan temple with a triple dome.\nAccording to others, it was erected by Baber. There\nare to be seen fourteen columns of black stone, five\nspans in height, which occupied the site of the\nfortress. Twelve of these columns now support the\ninterior arcades of the mosque: the two other form\npart of the tomb of a certain Moor. They tell us,\nthat these columns, or rather these remains of\nskilfully wrought columns, were brought from Isle\nof Lanca or Selendip (Ceylon) by Hanuman, king\nthe of monkeys. On the left is seen a square chest,\nraised, five inches from the ground covered with\nlime, about 5 ells in length by not more than four in\nbreadth. The Hindoos call it Bedi, the cradle; and\nthe reason is, that there formerly stood here the\nhouse in which Beshan (Vishnoo) was born in the\nform of Ram and were also, they say, his three\n                              56\n\n           brothers were born. Afterwards, Aurangzebe, or,\n           according to others, Baber, caused the place to be\n           destroyed, in order to deprive the heathen of the\n           opportunity of practicing there their superstitions.\n           Nevertheless, they still pay a superstitious\n           reverence to both these places; namely, to that on\n           which the natal dwelling of Ram stood, by going\n           three times round it, prostrate on the earth. The two\n           places are surrounded with a low wall adorned with\n           battlements. Not far from this is a place where they\n           dig up grains of black rice changed into little\n           stones, which are affirmed to have been hidden\n           underground ever since the time of Ram. On the\n           24th of the month         Tshet (Choitru), a large\n           concourse of people celebrate here the birth-day of\n           Ram, so famous throughout India.

Relying on said Gazetteer it is submitted that\n\neven in or before1828 A.D. the Hindus were performing\n\ncustomary ceremonies at the birth place of the Lord of\n\nUniverse Sri Rama ; and during said point of time there was\n\nno existence of alleged Babari Mosque as no such Mosque\n\nhas been described in the four corners of the said Gazetteer.\n\nRelevant extract from page 353 of the said Gazetteer reads\n\nas follows:\n\n        &quot;Oude: the ancient capital of the province of Oude,\n        situated on the South side of the Goggra, seventy\n        nine miles east from Lucknow: lat. 2648&#x27; N., lon.\n        824&#x27;E By Abul Fazel in 1582 it is described as\n        follows. &quot; Oude is one of the largest cities of\n        Hindostao.

The modern town extends\n        a considerable way along the banks of the Goggra,\n        adjoining Fyzabad, and is tolerable well peopled\n        but inland is a mass of rubbish and jungle among\n        which are the reputed sites of temples dedicated to\n        Rama, Seeta, his wife, Lakshman, his general, and\n        Hunimaun (a large monkey), his prime minister.\n        The religious mendicants, who perform the\n        pilgrimage to Oude are chiefly of the Ramata sect,\n        who walk round the temples and idols, bathe in the\n        holy pools, and performed the customary\n        ceremonies&quot;\n                                 58\n\n                                     (East India Gazetteer p.353)\n\n15.   Above referred East India Gazetteer of Hindustan of Walter\n\n      Hamilton, 2nd Edition first published in 1828 A.D. in its\n\n      preface declares that it contains accurate information the\n\n      details whereof    were collected by the persons          best\n\n      qualified from length of service residence on this spot, and\n\n      established reputation to form a correct judgment of their\n\n      authenticity. Relying on said declaration it is respectfully\n\n      submitted that in or before 1828 A.D. there was existence of\n\n      Sri Ramjanmsthan and temples in Ram-Kot, Ayodhya and\n\n      the Hindus were worshiping therein and there was no\n\n      existence of alleged Babari Mosque.

In\n              various cases the narrative is given as closely as the\n              necessity of condensing many thousand pages into\n              a small compass would permit; in others it has been\n              necessary to compare contradictory and conflicting\n              testimonies, and to select that which appeared to\n              rest on the most solid foundation. Conciseness has\n              been particularly aimed at, and the endeavour to\n              effect it has added greatly to the labour; for it is\n              easy to write a description of a country when the\n              materials are scanty, not so when the mass has been\n                                       59\n\n                    accumulating for half a century.

The Gazetteer of the Territories under the Government of\n           East India Company and of the Native States on the\n           continents of India by Edward Thornton, first published in\n           1858 records that on the right bank of the Ghogra, are\n           extensive ruins, about 2000 years old said to be those of the\n           forts of Rama, king of Oude, hero of the Ramayana, and\n           otherwise highly celebrated in the mythological and\n           romantic legends of India; the ruins still bear the name of\n           Ramgurh, &quot;or of fort of Rama&quot;; according to native tradition\n           temples thereon were demolished by Aurangzebe, who built\n           a mosque on part of the site, but an inscription on the wall of\n           the mosque, falsify the tradition as it attributes work to the\n           conqueror Baber, from whom Aurangzebe was 5th in\n           descent. The mosque is embellished with 14 columns of\n           only 5 or 6 feet in height, but of very elaborate and tasteful\n           workmanship, A quadrangular coffer of stone, whitewashed\n           five ells long, 4 broad, and protruding 5 or 6 inches above\n           ground, is pointed out as the cradle in which Rama was born\n                            60\n\nas the 7th Avatar of Vishnoo; and is accordingly abundantly\nhonoured by the pilgrimages and devotions of the Hindoos.\nFrom the aforesaid recording of the said Gazetteer it\nbecomes crystal clear that Temple of Sri Ramjanmasthan\nwas remodeled like mosque either by Babar or by\nAurangzebe by utilizing the building materials of the said\nTemple and in spite of that the Hindus were worshipping on\nthe Vedi established therein.       It is submitted that the\ncompilers has recorded two sources to ascertain the person\nwho was responsible for damaging the Temple and\nconverting the same into a mosque. Gazetteer says that\naccording to tradition it was Aurangzebe but according to an\ninscription it was Babar.       The compiler recording both\nsources gave weightage to the information of the alleged\ninscription. As in earlier part of this argument it has already\nbeen established that the alleged inscriptions were neither\never fixed on said alleged Babari Mosque nor were in\nexistence in any point of time the opinion of the compiler\nformed thereon crumbles down and only source of\ntraditional information remains as reliable. Relevant extract\nfrom pages 739-740 of the said Gazetteer reads as follows:\n         &quot;Oude- A town in the kingdom of the same name.\n         It is situate on the right bank of the river Ghogra,\n         which Buchanan considers here to be &quot;fully larger\n         than the Ganges at Chunar,&quot; and which is navigable\n         downwards to its mouth, upwards to Mundiya\n         Ghant, in the district of Bareilly. It extends about a\n         mile in a South-East direction, from the adjoining\n         recent city of Fyzabad; the breadth of the town is\n         something loss from North-East to South-West, or\n         from the river Landwards. The greater part of the\n         site is on gently swelling eminences; but to the\n         north-west, or towards Fyzabad, islo. Most of the\n         houses are of mud, and thatched, though a few are\n         tilted. Here, in a large building a mile from the\n         river, is an extensive establishment, called\n         Hanumangurb, or Fort of Hanuman, in honour of\n         the fabled monkey-god the auxillary of Rama. It\n         has an annual revenue of 50,000 rupees, settled on\n                   61\n\nit by Shuja-ud-daulah, formerly Nawaub Vizier. It\nis manage by a malik or abbot, the spiritual\nsuperior; and the revenues are dispensed to about\n500 bairagis or religious ascetics, and other Hindoo\nmendicants of various descriptions; no Mussulman\nbeing allowed within the worlds other\nestablishments of similar character are Sugrimkills,\nRam-Prashad-ka-Kana,            and       Bidiya-kuod;\nmaintaining respectively 100, 250, 200 bairagis.\nClose to the town on the East, and on the right bank\nof the Ghogra, are extensive ruins, said to be those\nof the forts of Rama, king of Oude, hero of the\nRamayana, and otherwise highly celebrated in the\nmythological and romantic legends of India.\nBuchanan observes, &quot;that the heaps of bricks,\nalthough much seems to have been carried away by\nthe river, extend a great way; that is, more than a\nmile in length, and more than half a mile in width;\nand that, although vast quantities of materials have\nbeen removed to build the Mahomedan Ayodha or\nFyzabad, yet, the ruins in many parts retain a very\nconsiderable elevation; nor is there any reason to\ndoubt that the structure to which they belonged has\nbeen very great, when we consider that it has been\nruined for about 2000 years.&quot; The ruins still bear\nthe name of Ramgurh, &quot;or of fort of Rama&quot;; the\nmost remarkable spot in which is that from which,\naccording to legend, Rama took his flight to\nheaven, carrying with him the people of his city; in\nconsequence of which it remained desolat until re-\npeopled by Vikramaditya, the king of Oujein, half a\ncentury before the Christian era, and by him\nembellished with 360 temples. Not the smallest\ntraces of these temples, however, now remain; and\naccording to native tradition they were demolished\nby Aurangzebe, who built a mosque on part of the\nsite, the falsehood of the tradition is however,\nproved by an inscription on the wall of the mosque,\nan attributing work to the conqueror Baber, from\nwhom Aurangzebe was 5th in descent. The mosque\nis embellished with 14 columns of only 5 or 6 feet\nin height, but of very elaborate and tasteful\nworkmanship, said to have been taken from the\nruins of the Hindoo fanes, to which they had been\ngiven by the monkey general Hanuman, who had\nbrought they from Lanka or Ceylon. Altogether,\nhowever, the remains of antiquity is the vicinity of\nthe renowned capital must give a very low idea of\nthe state of arts and civilization of the Hindoos at a\n                                  62\n\n              remote period.

Relevant extract from page XXXI reads as follows:\n\n               &quot;Long before the dawn of the authentic history,\n               Oudh stands out in the full blaze of legend and\n               poetry. Ajodhya its eponymous city was the capital\n               of that happy kingdom in which all that the Hindu\n               race reveres or desires was realized as it can never\n               be realized again, and the seat of the glorious\n               dynasty which began with the sun and culminated\n               after 60 generations of blameless rulers in the\n               incarnate deity and perfect man, Rama. Whether\n               criticism will finally enroll the hero among the\n               highest creations of pure imagination or accord him\n               a semi-historical personality and a doubtful date, it\n               is barren to speculate; history is more nearly\n               concerned with the influence which the story of his\n               life still has on the moral and religious beliefs of a\n               great people, and the enthusiasm which makes his\n               birth-place the most highly venerated of the sacred\n               places to which its pilgrims crowd.&quot;\n                          (Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh p.xxxi)\n\n18.   The said Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh of 1877-78\n\n      records that Ajodhya is to the Hindus what Mecca is to the\n\n      Mohammadans and Jerusalem to the Jews.

From the said recording of the Gazetteer it\n\n   is crystal clear that since the Tretayug Sri Ramjanmsthan is\n\n   most sacred place of the Hindus and performing their\n\n   customary rights thereon is integral part of Hinduism.\n\n   Relevant extract from page 2 of the said Gazetteer reads as\n\n   follows:\n\n              &quot;Ajodiya - (Ajodhya) - Pargana Haweli Oudh -\n              Tahsil Fyzabad - District- Fyzabad : A town in the\n              district of Fyzabad, and adjoining the city of that\n              name is to the Hindu what Mecca is to the\n              Mohammadans, Jerusalem to the Jews; it has in the\n              traditions of the orthodox, a highly mythical origin,\n              being founded for additional security, not on the\n              transitory earth, but on the chariot wheel of the\n              Great Creator himself.

From the said recording of the\n\n  Gazetteer it is crystal clear that over the sacred shrine Sri\n\n  Ramjanmsthan any one of the Mughal Emperor had erected\n\n  a Mosque in flagrant violation of the Law of Shar which\n\n  mandatorily forbids from usurping others&#x27; land as such any\n\n  building erected over the land of the Hindu Deity i.e. The\n\n  Lord of Universe Sri Ram from the building materials of the\n\n  Temple of the said Deity does not come within the definition\n\n  of Mosque.

The swargaddwar is the gate\n           through which he passed into Paradise, possibly, the\n           spot where his body was burnt. The Treta-ke-\n           Thakur was famous as the place where Rama\n           performed a great sacrifice, and which he\n           commemorated by setting up their images of\n           himself and Sita.&quot;\n              (Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh 1877-78 p. 6)\n\n21.The said Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh 1877-78 records\n\n   that in 1855 A.D. in course of great rapture between the\n\n   Hindus and the Muslims, loosing possession of Sri\n\n   Ramjanmsthan for few days        ultimately the Hindus re-\n\n   occupied their said sacred shrine suffering 11 casualties\n\n   and inflicting 75 casualties on Muslim-side. The Gazetteer\n\n   further records that up to that time the Hindus and Muslims\n\n   alike use to worship in the mosque-temple. Since British\n\n   rule a railing had been put up to prevent the disputes within\n\n   which, in the mosque, the Muslims used to pray; while\n\n   outside the fence the Hindus had raised a platform on which\n\n   they used to make their offerings. From the said recordings\n\n   of the Gazetteer it becomes crystal clear that at least till\n\n   1855 A.D. the Hindus were worshipping in the same\n\n   structure which has been described as Babari Mosque in the\n                           66\n\nplaint of the instant suit and, a platform now known as\n\nRamchabutara       was erected by some Hindus after\n\ncommencement of British Rule i.e. in 1856 A.D. as such the\n\nSthandil i.e. Vedi (cradle) which was being worshipped by\n\nthe Hindus in 1770 A.D. and seen by Joseph Tieffenthaler\n\nwas other than the platform which was subsequently built in\n\n1556 A.D. Be it mentioned herein that from the several\n\napplications of the self-proclaimed Mutawallis, Muezzins,\n\nKhattibs under or through whom the plaintiffs are claiming\n\nhad seen    it is crystal clear that since time immemorial\n\nHindus are worshiping in the central Sanctum Sanctorum of\n\nthe Temple Structure which has been described as Babari\n\nMosque in the plaint of the instant suit, which makes it clear\n\nthat the Hindus did not care for illegal and arbitrary\n\nprohibition imposed upon them by the British Rulers in\n\n1856 A.D. or thereafter as alleged at all. Relevant extract\n\nfrom page 7 of the said Gazetteer reads as follows:\n\n        &quot;Hindu and Musalman - The Janmasthan is within\n        a few hundred paces of the Hanomangarhi in 1855,\n        when a great rapture took place between the Hindus\n        and the Muhammadans, the former occupied the\n        Hanomangarhi in force, while the Musalmans took\n        possession of the Janmasthan. The Mohammadans\n        on that occasion actually charged up the steps of the\n        Hanomangarhi, but were driven back with\n        considerable loss. The Hindus then followed up\n        this success, and at the third attempt took the\n        Janmasthan at the gate of which seventy-five\n        Muhammadan were buried in the &#x27;martyr&#x27;s grave&#x27;\n        (ganj-i-shahidan). Eleven Hindus were killed.\n        Several of the King&#x27;s regiment were looking on all\n        the time but their order were not to interfere. It is\n                             67\n\n          said that up to that time the Hindus and\n          Mohammadans alike use to worship in the mosque-\n          temple.

A second attempt was\n          made shortly afterwards by Molvi Amir Ali of\n          Amethi; the object was to seize the alleged site of an\n          old mosque on the Hanoman Garhi&quot;.\n              (Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh 1877-78 p.7)\n\n\n22.The said Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh of 1877-78\n\n  records that in the great fair of the Ram Navami i.e. Janm-\n\n  mahotsva of Sri five lakh people used to participate. Said\n\n  Gazetteer further records that about 150 years ago National\n\n  feeling of the Hindus aroused by the tyranny of Aurangzeb\n\n  or by success of Marathas or by the compilation of\n\n  Ramayana in Hindi i.e. Sri Ramacharitmanas of Sri\n\n  Goswami Tulsidas Ajodhya became again esteemed as a\n\n  holy place; it grew favour each year, and then in all India,\n\n  perhaps except the Jagannath festival and that at Hardwar,\n\n  there was none to equal the Ram Naumi celebration at\n\n  Ajodhya. It is needless to say that according to holy\n\n  scripture of the Hindus Sri Skand-puran since the days of\n\n  Sage Narad who was contemporary of Lord of Universe Sri\n\n  Ram, it became integral part of Hinduism to celebrate Janm-\n\n  mahotsav of the Lord of Universe Sri Ram and perform\n\n  customary rituals at Sri Ramjanmsthan in Ayodhya. Be it\n\n  mentioned herein that neither there was nor there is such a\n                              68\n\nplace other than Sri Ramjanmsthan, Ramkot, Ayodhya wich\n\nhad/has capacity to attract and accommodate such a huge\n\nassemblage of the Devotees at least 150 years back from the\n\n1877-8 A.D. the year of the publication of the instant\n\nGazetteer i.e. 1727-28 A.D. it is further submitted that from\n\nthe said facts as recorded in this Gazetteer it becomes crystal\n\nclear that after the death of Aurangzeb Sri Ramjanmsthan\n\nhas become centre of Hinduism.          Relevant extracts from\n\npages 14, 451 and 452 of the said Gazetteer reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n           &quot;There are 96 Hindu temples, of which 63 are in\n           honour of Vishnu and 33 of Mahadeo; there are 36\n           mosques. There is also a vernacular school. There\n           is little trade at Ajodhya. The great fair of the\n           Ramnauami, on which 5,00,000 people assemble, is\n           held here; it is described in the district of\n           Fyzabad&quot;.\n\n       (Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh of 1877-78. p. 14)\n\n            &quot;Religious sect of Fyzabad- Religion in this district\n           is of more than ordinary interest. Ajodhya, as is\n           related in the account of that town, is the great\n           centre of the hero worship which has selected the\n           ancient king Ram Chandar as the object of its\n           adoration. At the Ram Naumi festival 5,00,000\n           people assemble in honour of that potent monarch\n           and innumerable shrines have been erected to Ram\n           Chandar, his brother Bharat, his wife Sita and his\n           ally in the great dekkan war Hanoman, the Monkey.\n           This saint worship at the same time does not seem\n           to interfere with the more spiritual theologh which\n           concorns itself with the wholly unearthly beings, -\n           Vishnu, Mahadeo and Bhawani or Debi&quot;.\n                    (Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh of 1877-\n                                                      78p.451)\n           &quot;...it may, however, be remarked here that the\n           Hindu revival at Ajodhya is one of the most\n           remarkable things in modern times. In Buddhist\n                              69\n\n            times, the place had no peculiar sanctity, although\n            there were doubtless temples and shrines. Long\n            afterwards, during many centuries, Gya, Benares,\n            Puri and Muttra kept their reputation, while\n            Ajodhya became a wilderness and famous hunting-\n            ground. About a hundred and fifty years ago there\n            was a revival; where a national feeling was aroused\n            by the tyranny of Aurangzeb or by the success of\n            the Marahtas, or by the translation into popular\n            language of the Ramayana, somehow or other\n            Ajodhya became again esteemed as a holy place; it\n            grew favour each year, and now in all India,\n            perhaps except the Jagannath festival and that at\n            Hardwar, there is none to equal the Ram Naumi\n            celebration at Ajodhya.&quot;\n          (Gazetteer of the Province of Oudh of 1877-78 p.452)\n\n23.There are 20 terms and conditions of the Jizya out of which\n\n   condition no.3 is that the Jimmis shall not prevent Muslim\n\n   Travellers from staying in Idol Temples and, condition no.4\n\n   is that the Muslims shall have right to stay in the house of\n\n   Jimmis as a guest for 3 days. As under the Islamic Rulers\n\n   the Hindus was Jimmis in Oudh Province till its annexation\n\n   to British Rule i.e. 1856 A.D. during this period they were\n\n   bound to follow the terms and conditions of Jizya as\n\n   modified by Great Imam Abu Haneef. From the readings of\n\n   the said Gazetteer of 1877 - 1878 it appears that invoking\n\n   the condition no.3 of the Jizya the Muslim travellers used to\n\n   stay in Sri Ramjanmsthan compound and during their such\n\n   temporary stay it might be that those travellers used to offer\n\n   prayer in the rooms of the Dharamshala of the said Temple\n\n   compound which was misconstrued by the compiler of the\n\n   said Gazetteer. Even now-a-days the Muslims during their\n                                70\n\n     travels used to offer prayer in trains as also at the place of\n\n     their temporary abode. As offering prayer in a building\n\n     which has images is prohibited in Islam it can be said with\n\n     certainty that no Muslim was offering prayer in Sri\n\n     Ramjanmsthan Temple which has been described as Babari\n\n     Mosque in the plaint of the instant suit. In nut-shell it can\n\n     be inferred that only Hindus were performing religious rites\n\n     and worship in the Idol Temple of the Lord of Universe Sri\n\n     Ram. In the book &quot;The Delhi Sultanate&quot; 4th Edn. edited by\n\n     renowned Historian Sri R.C.Majumdar and published in\n\n     1990 by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay on page 619 an\n\n     extract from the book &quot;Zakhirat-ul-Muluk&quot;         written by\n\n     Shaikh Hamadani containing 20 terms and conditions of\n\n     Jizya has been reproduced. Relevant extract from the said\n\n     book reads as follows:\n\n              &quot;There is another mandate relating to those subjects\n              who are unbelievers and protected people (zimmis).\n              For their governance, the observance of those\n              conditions which the Caliph &#x27;Umar laid in his\n              agreement for establishing the status of the fire-\n              worshippers and the people of the Book (Jews and\n              Christians) and which gave them safety is\n              obligatory on rulers and governors.

The twenty\n              conditions are as follows:\n1.   In a country under the authority of a Muslim ruler, they are\n     to build no new homes for images or idol temples.\n2.   They are not to rebuild any old buildings which have been\n     destroyed.\n3.   Muslim travelers are not to be prevented from staying in\n     idol temples.\n4.

If any of their people show any inclination towards Islam,\n        they are not to be prevented from doing so.\n7.      Muslims are to be respected.\n8.

They are not to buy Muslim slaves.&quot;\n\n\n      24.Staying of Muslims in the Temple or House of Jimmis was\n\n        not only in theory but in practice also. During his retreat\n\n        from Tibet campaign Bakhtiar Khilji took refuge in an Idol\n\n        Temple in Kamrup which has been described in the book\n\n        &quot;Riyazu-s-Salatin&quot; A History of Bengal on its pages 66 -67.\n\n        During his travel Ibn Battuta stayed in a House of a Jimmi\n\n        lady in Kaynuk, which fact has been recorded on page 138\n\n        of the book &quot;Ibn Battuta&quot; translated and selected by H.A.R.\n\n        Gibb First Published in 1929 and, reprinted in 2007 by Low\n\n        Price Publication, Delhi.      Relevant extracts from the\n\n        aforesaid two books read as follows:\n                                      72\n\n                    &quot;Muhammad Bakhtiar engulphed in the sea of\n                    confusion and perplexity, despaired of every\n                    resource. After much striving, he got news that in\n                    the neighbourhood there was a very lerge Temple,\n                    and that Idols of Gold and Silver were placed there\n                    in great pomp. It is said that there was an Idol in\n                    the temple which weighed a thousand maunds. In\n                    short, Muhammad Bakhtiar with his force took\n                    refuge in this temple, and was busy improvising\n                    means for crossing the river. The Rajah of Kamrup\n                    had ordered all his troops and subjects of that\n                    Country to commit depredations.&quot;\n                                                (Riyazu-S-Salatin. P.67)\n                    &quot;Kaynuk is a small town in the territories of Sultan\n                    Orkhan Bek, inhabited by infidel [Christan] Greeks\n                    under Muslim protection. There is only one\n                    household of Muslims in the place, and that belongs\n                    to the governors of the Greeks, so we put up at the\n                    house of an old infidel woman. This was in the\n                    season of snow and rain. She treated us well, and\n                    we spent that night in her house. Now this town\n                    has no trees or vineyards; the only thing cultivated\n                    there is saffron, and the old woman brought us a\n                    great quantity of it, thinking that we were\n                    merchants and would buy it from her.&quot;\n                (Ibn Battuta translated by H.A.R. Gibb reprint 2007 p.13\nAnnexure-IV\nA-In-I Akbari\nPage 12\n\n\n      25.   It is noteworthy that in A-In-I Akbari Vol.II at page 182 it\n\n            has been recorded that at that time in Ayodhya there were\n\n            only two tombs of Seth and the Prophet Job of six and seven\n\n            yards in length respectively. But from the Gazetteer of the\n\n            Province of Oudh it is known that in the mean time another\n\n            tomb Noah was also added and a story was concocted that\n\n            the tomb of Nuh was built by Alexander the Great i.e. in 4th\n\n            B.C., as this tomb of Nuh did not find place in A-In-I\n\n            Akbari&#x27;s account. In fact the tomb of Noah or Nuh is in the\n                           73\n\ntown Najaf in Iraq. In the light of aforesaid facts it becomes\n\ncrystal clear that this tomb was brought into existence in\n\ndeceitful manner in later days and to glorify it a fiction was\n\ncreated that it was existing in 4th B.C. It is respectfully\n\nsubmitted that the Babari Mosque has also been brought into\n\nfiction in later days i.e. after infliction of damages to Sri\n\nRamjanmsthan Temple by the Emperor Aurangzeb and to\n\nglorify this subsequently name of the Emperor Babar was\n\ntagged with said disputed structure, which structure in fact\n\nwas a Hindu temple and remained as such even after its\n\ndefilement by the Emperor Aurangzeb.        Relevant extract\n\nfrom page 11 and 12 of the Gazetteer of the Province of\n\nOudh 1877-78 reads as follows:\n\n        &quot;The Tombs of the Patriarchs. - Adjoining the\n        Maniparbat are two tombs, of which General\n        Cunningham writes that &quot;they are attributed to Sis\n        paighambar and Ayub paighambar, or the Prophets\n        Seth and Job. The first is seventeen feet long and\n        the other twelve feet. These tombs are mentioned\n        by Abul Fazl, who says: &#x27; Near this are two\n        sopulcjarai monuments, one seven and the other six\n        cubits in length. The vulgar pretend that they are\n        the tombs of Seth and Job, and they relate\n        wonderful stories of them.&#x27; This account shows\n        that since the time of Akbar the tomb of\n        Seth must have increased in length, from seven\n        cubits, or ten and a half feet, to seventeen feet,\n        through the frequent repairs of pious Musalmans.&quot;\n        These tombs are also mentioned at a later date, in\n        the Araish-i-Mahfil. To these tombs Colonel\n        Wilford adds that of Noad, which is still pointed out\n        near the police station. The Colonel&#x27;s account is as\n        follows: &quot;Close to Ajodhya or Oudh, on the banks\n        of the Gogra, they slow the tomb of Noah, and\n        these of Ayub, and Shis or Shish, (Job and Seth).\n        According to the account of the venerable Darvesh\n                              74\n\n           who watches over the tomb of Nuh, it was built by\n           Alexander the Great, or Sikandar Rumi. I sent\n           lately (A.D. 1799) a learned Hindu to make\n           enquiries about this holy place: from the\n           Musalmans be could get no further light; but the\n           Brahmans informed him that where Nuh&#x27;s tomb\n           stands now, there was formerly a place of worship\n           dedicated to Gapesha; and close to it are the\n           remains of a baoli, or walled well, which is called\n           in the Puranas Ganapat Kund. The tombs of Job\n           and Seth are near to each other, and about one bow-\n           shot and a half from Nuh&#x27;s tomb; between them are\n           two small hillocks, called Soma-giri, or the\n           mountains of the moon: according to them these\n           tombs are not above four hundred years old; and\n           owe their origin to three men, called Nuh, Ayub,\n           and Shis, who fell there fighting against the Hindus.\n           These were, of course, considered as shahids, or\n           martyrs; but the priests who officiate there, in order\n           to increase the veneration of the superstitious and\n           unthinking croud, gave out that these tombs were\n           really those of Noah, Job, and Seth, of old.

It is a fine town, situated in a\n      wide rocky plain- one of the finest, most populous,\n      and most substantially built cities in &#x27;Iraq&#x27;. It has\n      beautiful clean bazaars. We entered by the [outer]\n      Bab al-Hadra, and found ourselves first in the market\n      of the greengrocers, cooks and butchers, then in the\n      fruit market, then the tailors&#x27; bazaar and the\n      Qaysaruya, then the perfumers&#x27; bazaar, after which\n      we came to the [inner] Bab al-Hadra, where there is\n      the tomb, which they say is the tomb of Alf. One\n      goes through the Bab al-Hadra into a vast hospice, by\n      which one gains access to the gateway of the shrine,\n      where there are chamberlains, keepers of registers and\n      eunuchs. As a visitor to the tomb approaches, one or\n      all of them rise to meet him according to his rank, and\n      they halt with him at the threshold. They then ask\n      permission for him to enter saying &quot;By your leave, O\n      Commander of the Faithful, this feeble creature asks\n      permission to enter the sublime resting-place,&quot; and\n      command him to kiss the threshold, which is of silver,\n      as also are the lintels. After this he enters the shrine,\n      the floor of which is covered with carpets of silk and\n      other materials. Inside it are candelabra of gold and\n      silver, large and small. In the centre is a square\n      platform about a man&#x27;s height, covered with wood\n      completely hidden under artistically carved plaques of\n      gold fastened with silver nails. On this are three\n      tombs, which they declare are the graves of Adam,\n      Noah, and Alf. Between the tombs are dishes of\n      silver and gold, containing rose-water, musk, and\n      other perfumes; the visitor dips his hand in these and\n      anoints his face with the perfume for a bleassing.&quot;\n                                         76\n\n              (Ibn Battuta translated by H.A.R.

It is needless to repeat and reiterate that in spite of\n\n             such preventive measures of the British Rule the Hindus\n\n             continue with their worship in the Sri Ramjanmsthan\n\n             Temple which has been described as Babari Masjid in the\n\n             plaint of the instant suit.

To my thinking, these\n                     strongly resemble Buddhist pillars that I have seen\n                     at Benares and elsewhere. They are from seven to\n                     eight feet long, square at the base, centre, and\n                     capital, and round or octagonal intermediary.\n                     669. Hindu and Musalman difference - The\n                     Janmsthan is within a few hundred paces of the\n                     Hanuman Garhi. In 1855, when a great rupture\n                     took place between the Hindu and Mahomedans the\n                     former occupied the Hanuman Garhi in force,\n                     while the Musalmans took possession of the\n                     Janmasthan. The Mohamedans on that occasions\n                     actually charged up the steps of the Hanuman\n                     Garhi, but were driven back with considerable loss.\n                     The Hindus then followed up this success, and at\n                     the third attempt took the Janmsthan, at the gate of\n                     which 75 Mahomedans are buried in the &#x27;Martyrs\n                     grave&#x27; (Ganj-Shahid).

It is said that up to that\n                     time, the Hindus and Mahomedans alike used to\n                     worship in the mosque-temple.

King\n          Wajid Ali Shah is said to have appointed a\n          Committee to investigate this matter whichheld a\n          public meeting in Gulab Bari. It appears that\n          among those assembled no one testified the\n          existence of the mosque. Therefore, the Committee\n          unanimously decided the issue in favour of the\n          Vairagis. When the report of the Committee\n          reached Lucknow, it caused a sensation among the\n          Muslims. A Council of action was formed of which\n          Maulvi Amir Ali Amethi (District Lucknow) was\n          elected leader. He was staying at Suhali and\n          succeeded in attracting a large number of followers.\n          On learning this the Vairagis started arrangements\n          for the defence of the place. Wajid Ali Shah then\n          ordered a regiment to guard it. At last on\n          November 7, 1855 Maulavi Amir Ali started for\n          Rudauli with his followers.

From the said fact\n\n  as recorded in the Gazetteer it is very much apparent that at\n\n  the time of annexation of Oudh Province to the British Rule\n\n  in the middle of 19th Century Hindus were strong enough to\n\n  retain control at least over one of the most holiest place of\n\n  worship of the Hindus i.e. Sri Ramjanmsthan at Ayodhya\n                              79\n\n   and they did so as it is very much apparent from the several\n\n   applications made on an from 1858 to the date of inception\n\n   of instant litigations by the alleged Mutawallis, Muezzins,\n\n   Khattibs etc. Relevant extract of the aforesaid Gazetteer as\n\n   quoted in paragraph 40 of the written statement of the this\n\n   defendant no.20 reads as follows:\n\n           &quot;with the departure of the Court, the Hindus were\n           left to themselves and numerous temples and\n           monestries sprang into existence.

Even\n                Aurangzeb found it impossible to rule\n                absolutely according to Islamic law and had to\n                            80\n\n              concede to certain extra-Islamic practices of his\n              predecessors.

He further records that when Emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s\n\narmy on his command tried to demolish a temple in Karnataka\n\nthe Hindus fought and repulsed the Imperial Army and one of\n\nhis Hindu noble revolted against him and left his service. From\n\nthe facts recorded by Francois Martin who was Governor of\n\nFrench East India Company it becomes crystal clear that the\n\nEmperor Aurangzeb was leaving no stone unturned in inflicting\n\nhumiliation, oppression and excesses on Hindus in course\n\nwhereof he was causing demolition of the Idol Temples but the\n\nsame was by hook or by crook being opposed by the Hindus and\n\nthey were not giving up to their religious places and rites. This\n\nfact corroborate the fact as recorded by the Niccolao Manaucci\n\nto the effect that the said Emperor caused demolition of Hindu\n\ntemples but immediately thereafter Hindus thronged at their\n\nsacred sites of the temples and started their usual worship on\n\nthose sites.

All the temples in the cities and villages\n            had been destroyed. Now these inner sanctums\n            were also to be laid low and the least sign of the\n            practice of the Hindu religion was to be wiped out.\n            The numbers of this community, particularly at\n            Hyderabad and Cambay where they were to be\n            found in large numbers, were greatly alarmed at\n            these instructions. It was said that the banias\n            managed to circumvent the Mughal orders by\n            giving presents to the Governors who thereupon\n                              84\n\n           took their inspection tours very lightly.&quot;\n           (ibid p.914)\n           &quot; Following the Emperor&#x27;s orders with regard to\n           the destruction of temples, the Moors brought one\n           down in the Carnatic. This incited the Hindus to\n           revolt in an attempt to prevent this action. The two\n           communities clashed openly and both sides\n           sustained loss of life. As a result, the Moors were\n           forced to postpone their demolition activities to a\n           later date.&quot;                (ibid p. 1249)\n           &quot;Yachappa Nayak, the Hindu noble to whom I have\n           referred earlier in my narrative, on seeing that the\n           Mughal army after repeated orders from the\n           Emperor, was bent on the destruction of the Hindu\n           temples, left Mughal service and entered the\n           territory of Gingee with his men. From there, he\n           wrote to all the Hindu Princes, urging them to unite\n           against the enemy of their community and\n           religion.&quot;\n           (ibid p.1256)\n\n\n\n33.In the aforesaid book Francois Martin also records that in\n\n   spite of injunctions of the Mugal Emperor the Hindus did\n\n   not stop from performing their traditional religious\n\n   ceremonies and continue to perform it in violation of\n\n   prohibitory orders. This recording also corroborate the facts\n\n   as recorded by Niccolao Manucci to the effect that in spite\n\n   of the demolition of the temples the Hindus did not abandon\n\n   their sacred places and soon thereafter started performing\n\n   their customary religious rituals on those sites. From the\n\n   recording of the Gazetteers of 1877-78 and the Settlement\n\n   Report of Faizabad it becomes crystal clear that according to\n\n   those official records also Hindus were worshiping in Sri\n\n   Ramjanmsthan Temple described as Babri Mosque in the\n                                  85\n\n      plaint of the instant suit at least prior to annexation of Oudh\n\n      to British Rule in 1856. Relevant extracts from page 877-\n\n      878 &amp; 916 of vol.-II Part.-I read as follows:\n\n               &quot;The Hindus in Surat practice a certain rite during\n               the month of August. I am not sure whether it is at\n               the time of the full moon or new moon that they\n               perform it. They go for boat rides on the river and\n               throw large number of coconuts into the water,\n               while all the ships and boats moored on the river\n               are gaily bedecked with flags and buntings. This is\n               an age-old practice based on the superstition that if\n               this is done the ships which they have at sea will\n               have successful voyages. Although many Hindu\n               superstitions have been tolerated by the Moors, the\n               Emperor had given explicit instructions that these\n               festivals should be banned. The Governor forbade\n               this practice but his orders were not always carried\n               out. Some of the banias and members of the other\n               castes did not show any signs of having departed\n               from their normal customs and practices.&quot;\n               (ibid p. 877-878)\n               &quot;The annual ceremony of throwing coconuts into\n               the river was celebrated on 25 August. I have\n               spoken about this earlier. Despite the Mughal\n               injunction against the practice of this ancient rite by\n               Hindus, it continues unabated.          Even among\n               Muslims, those possessing ships on the high seas\n               sometimes join in. It marks the opening of the\n               sailing season.&quot;\n                                                         (ibid p.916)\n\n34.      Ibn Battuta in his account of travels tells us that in Bud-\n\nPattan city though there was not a single Muslim inhabitant it\n\nhad a mosque which was being looked after and maintained by\n\nthe Brahmins with due respect; though he did not describe it as\n\nnoble gesture of Hindus but says that it was due to panic of\n\nsome evil consequences fell down on Hindus but his said\n\nconjecture and surmise is based on his believed that as the\n\nChristians and Jews had not honoured sacred placed of the\n                              86\n\nMuslims how Idolaters do it. If we go through the instances as\n\nrecorded in the book &#x27;Spirit of Islam&#x27; by Syed Ameer Ali it\n\nappears that excesses were committed by the Jews and\n\nChristians against the Muslims. But in fact as India was a\n\nreligiously tolerant Country and Hindus always used to honour\n\nReligions and religious places of the others it can be inferred\n\nthat the Hindus were maintaining said Mosque on account of\n\ntheir respect to religious place of Muslims. This spirit of the\n\nHindus makes it clear that the Hindus neither can defile nor\n\nclaim over the religious places of others and as Sri\n\nRamjanmsthan described as Babari Mosque in the plaint is\n\nbeing possessed, claimed and asserted as their most holiest\n\nsacred place then indeed it is birth place of Loard of Universe\n\nSri Ram. The relevant extract of the Ibn Battuta Ki Bharat\n\nYatra (published by National Book Trust of India Reprint 1997\n\nof the 1st Edn. 1933) from page 203 reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (Ibid p.203)\n                                   87\n\n   34. Be it mentioned herein that the Sacred Compilation Jami&#x27;\n\n      At-Tirmidhi (Vol.-2) Hadith 1063 enumerates five types of\n\n      martyrs as such from the name of a place Ganj Shahidan it\n\n      cannot be inferred that it was a place of the graves of the\n\n      soldiers who lost their lives in a battle in between Emperor\n\n      Babur and the then ruler of Ajodhya. Contrary to this it can\n\n      be inferred that the inhabitant of that place in totality died\n\n      with plague that is why people used to call it Ganj Shahidan.\n\n      According to dictionary &#x27;Urdu Hindi Sabdakosh&#x27; (published\n\n      by Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan) Ganj means Nagar as such\n\n      Ganj Shahidan means city of martyrs. Said Hadith reads as\n\n      follows:\n\n                 &quot;1063. Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger\n                 of Allah said: &quot;The martyrs are five: Those who die\n                 of the plague, stomach illness, drowning, being\n                 crushed and the martyr in the cause of Allah.&quot;\n                 (Sahih)\n                       (Jami&#x27; At-Tirmidhi Vol.-2 Hadith 1063)\n\n      Shri P.N. Mishra, Advocate thereafter has further referred\n\nthat there was no war in Ayodhya nor the emperor Babur built\n\ngraveyard or mosque at Ram Janmsthan described as Babri\n\nMosque and the allegations in the plaint are false. His submissions\n\non the basis of certain books are as under:-\n\n      THERE WAS NO WAR IN 935 AH (1528 AD) IN\n\nAYODHYA          NOR    THE     EMPEREOR         BABUR      BUILT\n\nGRAVEYARDS OR MOSQUE AT RAMJANAMSTHAN\n\nDESCRIBED AS BABARI MOSQUE IN THE PLAINT OF\n                               88\n\nTHE INSTANT SUIT:\n\n  1. The plaintiffs&#x27; case as made out in the paragraph 1 and 2 of\n\n     the plaint is that in 935 A.H. there was a battle in between\n\n     the Emperor Babur and the then Ruler of the Ayodhya in\n\n     Ayodhya. After attaining victory Babur made graveyards for\n\n     his soldiers who had lost their lives in the said battle and\n\n     erected a Mosque for the Muslims of Ayodhya.          Be it\n\n     mentioned herein that according to English Calendar said\n\n     935 AH commenced on 15th September,1528 and ended on\n\n     5th September, 1529 and for this whole year&#x27;s account is\n\n     available in Babur-Nama save and except 3 days&#x27; account of\n\n     15th September 1528 to 17th      September 1528. On 18th\n\n     September, 1528 Babur was in his court at Agra. On 20th\n\n     September, he left for Gwalior, said facts prove it beyond\n\n     doubt that   during said three days Emperor Babur was\n\n     nowhere in the vicinity of Ayodhya but far away at Agra.\n\n     Prior to defeat of Sultan Ibrahim Lodi in 1526 Mustafa\n\n     Farmuli was his Governor of Oudh and just after the\n\n     Sultan&#x27;s defeat Shaikh Bayazid Farmuli was appointed\n\n     Governor of Oudh by the victorious King Babur. He\n\n     remained in the Good-book of the Emperor at least till\n\n     December, 1527. In fact Babur himself was ruler of Oudh\n\n     and his appointee Shaikh Bayazid was Governor thereof.\n\n     Even when Shaikh Bayazid became hostile from January\n\n     1528 onwards neither Babur nor Shaikh Bayazid entered in\n                                       89\n\n            the city of Ayodhya nor there was any fighting in Ayodhya\n\n            between them either in 935 AH or in any other year during\n\n            the life time of emperor Babur as such losing lives by\n\n            Emperor Babur&#x27;s soldiers in action in Ayodhya city and\n\n            creation of Graveyards for those fall in action as well as\n\n            erection of Mosque is false, frivolous, and concocted- one.\n\n            The Plaintiffs have failed to plead and prove name of any\n\n            independant ruler of Ayodhya as well as fighting between\n\n            any such independant King and the Emperor Babur as such\n\n            the instant Suit is liable to be dismissed with exemplary\n\n            cost.\n\nAnnexure-IV\nBabur Nama by A.S.\nBeveridge\nPages 1-7\n\n\n       2.    Babur -Nama (Translated by Anette Susannah Beveridge\n\n             and Reprinted in 2007 by Low Price Publications, Delhi\n\n             first published in 1921) tells us that after defeating the\n\n             Sultan Ibrahim Lodi in the battle of Panipat on 8th of Rajab\n\n             932 AH corresponding to 20th day of April 1526 Babur\n\n             became King of Delhi, Agra and Oudh (Babur-Nama\n\n             p.472-74). Mustafa Farmuli was Sultan Ibrahim Lodi&#x27;s\n\n             Governor of Oudh and died before Sultan&#x27;s defeat. His\n\n             younger brother was      Shaikh Bayazid (Farmuli). After\n\n             Sultan   Ibrahim Lodi&#x27;s defeat, Shaikh Bayazid together\n\n             with Firuz Khan and Mahmud Khan went to serve Babur.\n                             90\n\n    Babur writes that &quot;I shewed them greater kindness and\n\n    favour than was their claim.&quot; He gave Shaikh Bayazid 1\n\n    krur, 48 laks and 50,000 tankas from Aud, Firuz Khan 1\n\n    krur, 46 laks and 5,000 tankas from Jaunpur and Mahmud\n\n    Khan 90 laks and 35,000 tankas from Ghazipur (ibid p.\n\n    527). Shaikh Bayazid, Firuz Khan, Mahmud Khan and\n\n    Qazi Jia who were highly favoured commanders to them\n\n    Eastern Paraganas were given (ibid p. 530). In January\n\n    1527 Humayun placed Shaikh Bayazid in Oudh (Ibid\n\n    p.544).\n\n3. In December 1527 Babur got wild news about Shaikh\n\n    Bayazid (Babur-Nama P. 585). On the eve of Chanderi\n\n    expedition Babur received a bad news on 28th January,\n\n    1528 that &quot;the troops appointed for the East (i.e. against\n\n    Bayazid) had fought without consideration, been beaten,\n\n    abandoned Laknau, and gone to Qanuj&quot; (Ibid p. 594). After\n\n    conquering   Chanderi Babur again got news on 22nd\n\n    February, 1528 that his troops had abandoned Qanuj\n\n    (Kannauj) and gone to Rapri; whereas the enemy&#x27;s army\n\n    under Biban, Bayazid and Maruf had taken over\n\n    Shamsabad. Babur himself moved towards Kannauj. On\n\n    hearing his march, Bayazid, Biban and Maruf crossed\n\n    Ganga and seated themselves in its eastern bank opposite\n\n    Kannauj for preventing Babur&#x27;s passage (Ibid 598). But\n\n    Babur and his Army , after having built bridge over the\n                               91\n\n     river Ganga, crossed the river on 15th March, 1528. But\n\n     due to one day&#x27;s delay in crossing the river Ganga, the\n\n     enemy escaped. Babur ordered Chin-timur Sultan to chase\n\n     Trio. Babur also placed Baqui Tashkinti under Chin-timur\n\n     Sultan&#x27;s command. But the pursuers did not do well. On\n\n     16th March Babur dismounted at Bangarmawn (Ibid 599-\n\n     601).\n\n4.   On March 21, 1528 Babur       visited Laknau and crossed\n\n     Gomati, while he was one or two march away from Oudh\n\n     on request of Chin -timur Babur sent a reinforcement of\n\n     1000 braves (Babur-Nama p.601). On 28th March, 1528 in\n\n     course of his pursuit of rebel Shaikh Bayazid Babur\n\n     dismounted 2 or 3 kurhos (i.e. 6 or 8 miles) from Oudh\n\n     above the junction of Gagar (Goghgra) and Sirda. [John\n\n     Leyden, and William Erskine created confusion by\n\n     identifying Sirda with Sarju; whereas Annette Susannah\n\n     Beveridge rightly identified it with Kali-Sarda on the\n\n     Chouka affluent of the Gogra and not Sarju river.] At that\n\n     time Bayazid was far away on otherside of the Sirda\n\n     opposite to Oudh. Babur&#x27;s army and generals who had\n\n     crossed over first pursued Shaikh Bayazid till the evening\n\n     prayer but he flung into jungle and escaped. Chin-timur\n\n     Sultan chased Afghans dismounted late on the bank of\n\n     standing-water, rode on at midnight after the rebel, went as\n\n     much as 40 kurhos (80 miles) where Bayazid&#x27;s family and\n                              92\n\n    relations had been, they however had fled. He sent\n\n    gallopers off in all directions from that place.. Baqi\n\n    Shaghawal and few brave drove the enemy, overtook\n\n    family and brought in some Afghan prisoners. He stayed on\n\n    that ground few days in order to settle the affairs of Audh.\n\n    During his said stay Babur heard from the people that the\n\n    land lying along Sirda 7 or 8 kurohs (14-16 miles), above\n\n    Audh, was a hunting-ground. Mir Muhammad the raftsman\n\n    was sent out and returned after looking at the crossing over\n\n    the Gagar-water (Gogra) and the Sirda-water (Chauka).\n\n    Babur, fond of hunting, rode out to hunt on 2nd April, 1528\n\n    (ibid p.602)\n\n5. There is no recording of Diary in Babur-Nama from 3rd\n\n    April to 17 September, 1528. Ayodhya was under the\n\n    Muslim rule for about last 300 years and under Babur&#x27;s\n\n    domain since 20th April 1526. As Bayzid was neither\n\n    stationed in Ayodhya City nor his       garrison, citadel or\n\n    Army was there; question of a battle in Ayodhya for freeing\n\n    Ayodhya from his control also didn&#x27;t arise at all.\n\n6. In 934 AH last entry in Babur-Nama is of Jumada II, 12th 934\n\n    corresponding to 2nd April 1528 A.D. while in 935 first\n\n    entry therein is of Muharram 3rd 935 corresponding to 18th\n\n    September 1528. As 935 AH commenced on 15th\n\n    September 1528 for this year only 3 day&#x27;s entries are\n\n    missing. What Babur did during this interregnum can be\n                                  93\n\n       fairly built up. A. S. Beveridge points out that &quot;much can\n\n       be gleaned of Babur&#x27;s occupations during the 5 months of\n\n       the lacuna from his chronicle of 934 and 935 A.H. which\n\n       makes several references to occurrences of last year,&quot; If\n\n       such references are put together it appears that Babur\n\n       carried on his military operations against Afghans in the\n\n       east and south Bihar as well. During this period five and\n\n       half months he stayed at Jaunpur, Chausa and Buxar in\n\n       defeating and driving away the Afghans and compelling\n\n       them to take shelter in eastern Bihar and Bengal and after\n\n       settling the affairs of the eastern region Babur returned to\n\n       Agra (source: Ibid. 603-04) .\n\n      Shri P.N. Mishra, Advocate has further argued that there was\n\nno person like Mir Baqi or Abdul Baqi associated with emperor\n\nBabur, accordingly the alleged Babri Mosque was not constructed\n\nat Sri Ramjanamsthan by the Minister/Governor of the emperor.\n\nHis submissions are as under:-\n\n      THERE WAS NO PERSON NAMED MIR KHAN OR\n\nMIR    BAQI     OR    ABDUL       BAQI     OR     ABDUL     BAQI\n\nISPHAHANI ASSOCIATED WITH EMPEROR BABUR AS\n\nSUCH BUILDING OF ALLEGED BABARI MOSQUE AT\n\nSRI    RAMJANAMSTHAN                  BY   SUCH     FICTITIOUS\n\nCOMMANDER / MINISTER / GOVERNOR OF THE\n\nEMPEROR IN 923 A.H. (1516-17 A.D.), IN 930 A.H. (1523-\n\n24A.D.) AND IN 935 A.H. (1528-29 A.D.)            CANNOT AND\n                                94\n\nDOES NOT ARISE AT ALL:\n\n      1.    It is alleged that in 935 AH (corresponding to 15th\n\n      September 1528 to 5th September 1529) one Mir Baqi\n\n      named Counsellor &amp; Minister of Emperor Babur built a\n\n      Masjid in Ayodhya at the site of Sri Ramajanamasthan by\n\n      demolishing the Temple of Sri Ramchandraji and utilizing\n\n      its materials. In fact, nowhere in Babur-Nama a person by\n\n      name of Mir Baqi has been mentioned. In the Indian\n\n      context the name Baqi suffixed by Saghawal, Ming-Bashi\n\n      has figured at 9 places in Beveridge&#x27;s Translated Babur-\n\n      Nama.\n\n      2.    In 932 A.H. Baqi Shaghawal figures at pages 463,\n\n      546 of the Babur-Nama relevant extracts wherefrom read\n\n      as follows:\n\n                    &quot;At the end of our first stage, I bestowed\n              Dibalpur on Baqi Shaghdwal2 and sent him to help\n              Balkh; sent also gifts, taken in the success of\n              Milwat, for (my) younger children and various train\n              in Kabul.&quot;\n\n              2.

Shaikh\n           Bayazid and Biban, on hearing of their expedition,\n                                 97\n\n               had fled to the pargana of Mahuba. As the Rains\n               had set in and as after 5 or 6 months of active\n               service, horses and cattle in the army were worn\n               out, the sultans and begs of the expedition were\n               ordered to remain where they were till they\n               received fresh supplies from Agra and those parts.\n               At the Other Prayer of the same day, leave was\n               given to Baqi and the army of Aud (Ajodhya).\n                                             (Babur-Nama p. 685)\n      From the above mentioned extracts of the Babur-Nama it\n\nbecomes crystal clear that Baqi has been mentioned by Babur as\n\nBaqi Tashkindi ( i.e. Baqi, the inhabitant of Tashkent presently in\n\nUzbekistan), Baqi Shaghawal (i.e. Baqi, the head Kazis and\n\nMullas), Baqi Ming-Bashi (i.e Baqi, the commander of 1000\n\ntroops), Baqi Beg (i.e. Baqi, the Junior commander) and Baqi but\n\nnowhere in his Memoir Emperor Babur has mentioned him as Mir\n\nBaqi. From the Book Babar written by Stanley Lane-poole it is\n\nknown that the Amir or Mir, Khan &amp; Mirza titles were meant for\n\nthe royal descents. Since nowhere in four corners of Babur-Nama\n\nepithet Mir has been used for Baqi it can be inferred with certainty\n\nthat he was not a royal descent. From the aforesaid extracts it is\n\nalso very much apparent that the &#x27;Begs&#x27;. were junior Army\n\nCommanders and &#x27;Sultans&#x27; were Senior Army Commanders, that\n\nis why in a campaign against Sheikh Bayazid being a Beg, Baqi\n\nSaghawal was put under the command of Chin-timur Sultan.\n\nHolding a meeting of Sultans and begs by Emperor Babur leaves\n\nno doubt that these two were designations of the Senior and Junior\n\ncommanders respectively. Till 1929 Baqi was only Beg i.e. a junior\n\ncommander of 1000 troops. Thus it is clear that commander of\n                                   98\n\nAudh&#x27;s Army was Baqi Tashkindi who was Mingbashi the head of\n\nQazis &amp; Mullas in February 1526 AD, a Beg (Junior Commander)\n\nand Shaghawal ( Commander of 1000 troops) in 1528-29 AD and\n\nnor Mir Baqi which figures in the latter forged Inscriptions\n\nsupplied to A.S. Beveridge for her publication in 1921 as also to\n\nZ.A. Desai for his publication in A.S.I&#x27;s Report 1964-65 because\n\nin the former Inscriptions supplied to A. Fuhrer for his publication\n\nin A.S.I.&#x27;s Report in 1889 the builder of the alleged Masjid was\n\nnamed as Mir Khan.\n\n\n      Shri P.N. Misra has further argued that Islam guarantees\n\nreligious freedom and tolerance and does not permit to usurp\n\nsacred places of other religion. The principal submissions made\n\non his behalf before this Court are as under:-\n\n      ISLAM GUARANTEES RELIGIOUS FREEDOM &amp;\n\nTOLERATION AND DOES NOT PERMIT TO USURP\n\nSACRED RELIGIOUS PLACE OF OTHERS:\n\n   1. The Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet has commanded that\n\n      no one should be compelled to change religion, idolaters\n\n      should be allowed to worship in their own way, the Holy\n\n      Prophets have appeared in every community and they\n\n      should not be compared but respected and a Muslim can\n\n      maintain good relation with his Pagan (i.e. worshipper of\n\n      multi -deities) relative.\n\n   2. The Holy Quran (Noble Quran, Surah-2 Al-Baqarah, Ayat\n                              99\n\n  256 at p.58) commands that there is no compulsion in\n\n  religion.   English translation of the said Ayat reads as\n\n  follows:\n\n        &quot;256. There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the\n        Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path.\n        Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah,\n        then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold\n        that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-\n        Knower.\n\n                 (Noble Quran, Surah-2 Al-Baqarah, Ayat 256)\n\n3. The Holy Quran (Noble Quran, Surah-107 Al-Ma&#x27;un, Ayat\n\n  1-6 at p.852-853) permits people of other religion to carry\n\n  out their religious practices according to their own religion.\n\n  English translation of the said Ayat reads as follows:\n\n        &quot;1. Say: (O Muhammad .. .. .. (Arabic text) .. .. to\n        these Mushrikun and Kafirun): &quot;O Al-Kafirun\n        (disbelievers in Allah, in His Oneness, in His Angles,\n        in His Books, in His Messengers, in the Day of\n        Resurrection, and in Al-Qadar.)!\n        2. I worship not that which you worship.\n        3. Nor will you worship that which I worship.\n        4. And I shall not worship that you are worshipping.\n        5. Nor will you worship that which I worship.\n        6. To you be your religion, and to me my religion\n        (Islamic Monotheism).&quot;\n\n               (Noble Quran, Surah-107 Al-Ma&#x27;un, Ayat 1-6 at\n                                                 p.852-853)\n\n4. The Holy Quran (Noble Quran, Surah-10 Yunus, Ayat 47 at\n\n  p.277) recognizes birth of Messengers of the Almighty in\n\n  every community or nation. English translation of the said\n\n  Ayat reads as follows:\n\n        &quot;47. And for every Ummah (a community or a nation)\n        there is a Messenger, when their Messenger comes,\n        the matter will be judged between them with justice,\n                                  100\n\n            and they will not be wronged.&quot;\n\n                 (Noble Quran, Surah-10 Yunus, Ayat 47 at p.277)\n\n\n   5. Sacred Compilation Hadith Sahih Bukhari 3.595 p.610-611\n\n      reveals that the Holy Prophet commanded not to give a\n\n      Prophet superiority over another. Relevant portion of the\n\n      said Hadith reads as follows:\n\n            &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;Do not give a prophet superiority\n            over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all the\n            people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to\n            emerge from the earth, and will see Moses standing\n            and holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not\n            know whether Moses has fallen unconscious or the\n            first unconsciousness was sufficient for him.&quot;\n\n                            (Hadith Sahih Bukhari 3.595 at p.611 )\n\n   6. The Sacred Compilation Hadith Sahih Bukhari 4.407 reveals\n\n      that Holy Prophet allowed a Muslim to keep good relation\n\n      with his mother who was pagan i.e. idolater.       The said\n\n      Hadith reads as follows:\n\n              4.407:\n              Narrated Asma &#x27;bint Abi Bakr: During the period of\n              the peace treaty of Quraish with Allah&#x27;s Apostle, my\n              mother, accompanied by her father, came to visit\n              me, and she was a pagan. I consulted Allah&#x27;s\n              Apostle, &quot;O Allah&#x27;s Apostle! My mother has come\n              to me and she desires to receive a reward from me,\n              shall I keep good relation with her?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes,\n              keep good relation with her.&quot;\n\n      Sri P.N. Mishra has further submitted that in 1526 A.D. after\n\ndefeating Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi, Babur became ruler of Delhi,\n\nAgra and Oudh and in view of the Principle of Darul Islam, he\n\nonly acquired sovereignty rights. Thus it was not possible for him\n                                 101\n\nto change the nature of the land belonging to Hindus and the\n\nalleged creation of waqf is null and void. His submissions are as\n\nunder:-\n\n      IN 1526 A.D. WHEN BABUR BECAME RULER OF\n\nDELHI, AGRA &amp; OUDH DEFEATING SULTAN IBRAHIM\n\nLODI      IN    THE      BATTLE       OF     PANIPAT      THESE\n\nTERRITORIES WERE COMPRISED IN DAR-UL-ISLAM:\n\n\n   1. When in the year 1526 King Babur acquired sovereignty\n\n       over Delhi, Agra and Oudh defeating Sultan Ibrahim Lodi In\n\n       the battle of Panipat those territories were constituent of\n\n       &#x27;Dar-ul-Islam for the reason that outgoing Sultan was a\n\n       Muslim and during his reign Law of Shar was Law of the\n\n       Land. Therefore by defeating Sultan Ibrahim Lodi Emperor\n\n       Babur acquired only those right of Sovereignty that a\n\n       Islamic ruler had under Shar and; as Shar does not\n\n       extinguish title of land owner on the basis of change of\n\n       sovereignty or religion of the subjects he didn&#x27;t become\n\n       owner of the land owned by his Hindu subjects and their\n\n       endowments. As a Hindu Endowment Ramajanamsthan\n\n       Temple was already existing, Emperor Babur did not acquire\n\n       ownership of that place as such alleged creation of Wakf for\n\n       erection of Masjid thereon rendered the said alleged Wakf\n\n       null and void.\n\n   2. Illustrated author and great jurist Syed Ameer Ali in his\n                          102\n\nbook the &#x27;Spirit of Islam&#x27; (at p.215) describes the\n\nrelationship between the citizens of three types of Nations\n\nDar-ul-Islam i.e. an Islamic State, Dar-ul-Harb i.e. a State\n\nRuled by belligerent non-Islamic Ruler, Dar-ul-Aman. i.e. a\n\nState Ruled by non-Islamic Ruler with which an Islamic\n\nState is at peace. Relevant extract of the said book reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n      &quot;An examination, however, of the principles upon\n      which the relations of Moslem states with non-\n      Moslem countries were based, shows a far greater\n      degree of liberality than has been evinced by\n      Christian writers on international law. It is only in\n      recent times, and under stress of circumstances that\n      non-Christian states have been admitted into the\n      &quot;comity of nations&quot;. The Moslem jurists, on the other\n      hand, differentiate between the condition of\n      belligerency and that of peace. The expression, Dar-\n      ul-Harb thus includes countries with which the\n      Moslems are at war; whilst the States with which they\n      are at peace are the Dar-ul-Aman. The harbi, the\n      inhabitants of the Dar-ul-harb, is an alien, pure and\n      simple. He has no right to enter Islamic States\n      without express permission. But once he receives the\n      aman or guarantee of safety from even the poorest\n      Moslem, he is perfectly secure from molestation for\n      the space of one year. On the expiration of that\n      period, he is bound to depart. The inhabitant of the\n      Dar-ul-aman is a mustamin. The aman may be for\n      ever or for a limited duration, but so long as it lasts,\n      the mustamin&#x27;s treatment is regulated in strict\n      accordance with the terms of the treaty with his\n      country. The mustamins were governed by their own\n      laws, were exempt from taxation and enjoyed other\n      privileges.\n             The spirit of aggression never breathed itself\n      into that code which formally incorporated the Law of\n      Nations with the religion; and the followers of\n      Mohammed, in the plentitude of their power, were\n      always ready to say to their enemies, &#x27;Cease all\n      hostility to us, and be our allies, and we shall be\n      faithful to you; or pay tribute and we will secure and\n      protect you in all your rights; or adopt our religion,\n                                103\n\n          and you shall enjoy every privilege we ourselves\n          posses.&quot;\n                   ( Spirit of Islam by Syed Ameer Ali at p.215)\n\n3. Syed    Ameer    Ali   in    his   book   &#x27;Commentaries     on\n\n   Mahommedan Law&#x27; also describes Dar-ul-Harb. Relevant\n\n   extract from the foot note 1 of the said book reads as\n\n   follows:\n\n          &quot;The Moslem jurists, like the jurists of Christendom,\n          until very recent times, divided the world into two\n          portions, one the Dar ul-Harb, and the other the Dar\n          ul-Islam, the country of peace.        Juridically, all\n          Mussulman nations were at peace with each other. As\n          a matter of fact, no Mussulman Sovereign could\n          declare war against another without first pronouncing\n          him to be a heretic and beyond the pale of Islam. The\n          non-Moslem subjects of Moslem States are called\n          Zimmis. The non-Moslem subjects of non-Moslem\n          Sovereigns at peace with Islamic States are called\n          Mustamins.\n\n      (Mohammedan Law by Syed Ameer Ali, 5th Edn. Reprint\n  2009, published by Hind Publishing House,Allahabad, p.301)\n4. Fighting between two Muslim Rulers is not fighting\n\n   between Dar-ul-Islam and Dar-ul-Herb but it is fighting\n\n   between to armies of Islam for Superiority for the benefit of\n\n   Islam and subject people. This is very much apparent from\n\n   the extract quoted in the preceding paragraph from Syed\n\n   Amir Ali&#x27;s book as also, from the answer given by Sultan\n\n   Sikandar Lodi to the Kalandar (i.e. a person who had no\n\n   worldly desires). When said Darvesh conveyed the Sultan\n\n   that he would attain victory in ongoing battle, the Sultan told\n\n   him that when two Islamic armies are fighting decision\n\n   should not be given in one&#x27;s favour but only good wishes\n                                  104\n\n      should be given stating that who will be beneficial for Islam\n\n      and subject people will attain victory. Relevant extract from\n\n      the book Tabkati- Akbari published in the Book Uttar\n\n      Taimoorkalin Bharat at page 227 reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n      Shri P.N. Misra, Advocate has argued that Muslims are\n\nbound to observe the law of Shar and transgression of divine law\n\nof Shar by an Islamic Ruler or Muslims is impermissible in Darul\n\nIslam. His submissions are as under:-\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF DIVINE LAW OF SHAR BY AN\n\nISLAMIC       RULER         AS    WELL      AS    MUSLIMS        IS\n\nIMPERMISSIBLITY IN DAR-UL-ISLAM:\n\n1.    Muslims are not free to lead the life of their choice and they\n\n     are bound by the law of Shar. Muslims should not transgress\n\n     law as enunciated in Shar otherwise they will lose their status\n\n     of being Muslim. According to Shar Plunderer &amp; looters are\n\n     not Muslims. Islamic Ruler and Muslims are subject to Divine\n\n     Law of Shar according to which duty of an Islamic Ruler is to\n\n     guard the lives, honour and property of his subjects, maintain\n\n     peace, check the evil-doer, and prevent injuries and; duty of\n\n     Muslims is to disobey oppressive and sinful order of a Tyrant\n                              105\n\n Ruler and refrain himself from such sinful acts. Muslims\n\n should not approve bad deed of the Amirs i.e. the rulers.\n\n Making a just statement before tyrannical ruler is a greatest\n\n type of Jihad. A person who acts as God against the unlawful,\n\n is kind to his neighbour and loves the people as he loves\n\n himself is Muslim, otherwise not.\n\n2.

I believe that every social political, economic,\n            or legal concept or doctrine must answer the needs of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                     149</span>\n\nthe people of a country at a particular time.

The second type of explanation may\nbe called historical or meant merely to indicate and\nillustrate notions or concepts put forward by thinkers\nat various times in various countries so as to\nappropriately relate them to what we may find today\nunder our Constitution. We have to appreciate the\nchronology or stages of their development if we are to\navoid frying to fit into our Constitution something\nwhich has no real relevance to it or bearing upon its\ncontents or which conflicts with these. It must not, if I\nmay so put it, be constitutionally &quot;indigestible&quot; by a\nconstitution such as ours. Of course, it is not a secret\nthat we have taken some of the basic concepts of our\nConstitution from British and American Constitutions\nin their most developed stages. That too must put us\non our guard against attempts to foist upon our\nConstitution something simply because it happens to\nbe either a British or American concept of some\nparticular period which could not possibly be found in\nit today. Therefore, both types of explanation appear\nto be necessary to an exposition of what may or may\nnot be found in our Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">532. After the break-up of the Roman Empire, there\nwere attempts in medieval Europe, both by the\nChurch and the Kings, to develop spiritual and\ntemporal means for checking wrong and oppression.\nQuests for the superior or a sovereign power and its\ntheoretical justifications by both ecclesiastical and lay\nthinkers were parts of an attempt to meet this need.\nThe claims of those who, as vicars of God on earth,\nsought to meddle with mundane and temporal affairs\nand acquire even political power and influence were,\nafter a struggle for power, which took different forms\nin different countries, finally defeated by European\nKings with the aid of their subjects.

The ideal King in ancient India, was\nconceived of primarily as a Judge deciding cases or\ngiving orders to meet specific situations in accordance\nwith the Dharma Shastras.

We know that Semitic prophets, as messengers of\nGod, also became rulers wielding both spiritual and\npolitical temporal power and authority although to\nJesus Christ, who never sought temporal power, is\nascribed the saying: &quot;render unto Caesar the things\nthat are Caesar&#x27;s and to God things that are God&#x27;s&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">According to the theory embodied in this saying,\nspiritual and temporal powers and authorities had to\noperate in different orbits of power altogether.\nAnother theory, however, was that the messages of\nGod had been given the sovereign will of God\nAlmighty Which governed all matters and this could\nnot be departed from by any human authority or ruler.\nIn the practical administration of justice, we are\ninformed, Muslim caliphs acknowledged and upheld\nthe jurisdiction of their Qazis to give judgment\nagainst them personally. There is an account of how\nthe Caliph Omar, being a defendant in a claim brought\nby a jew for some money borrowed by him for\npurposes of State, appeared in person in the Court of\nhis own Kazi to answer the claim. The Kazi rose from\nhis seat out of respect for the Caliph who was so\ndispleased with this unbecoming conduct that he\ndismissed him from office. (See: Sir A.

It is\nvery wide in its import as it statutorily obliges the\nGovernment to return the goods seized or to pay the\nvalue of the goods if for any reason it cannot\ndischarge its obligation to return it.

The section is clear that if only part of\nthe goods are confiscated then the remaining has to be\nreturned. The very first part of the sub-section\nindicates that where the order of confiscation, is\nmodified in appeal meaning thereby if confiscation is\nconfined to part only the Government is bound to\nrelease or return the remaining or pay the value\nthereof. But what is more significant of this sub-\nsection which widens its reach is the expression, &#x27;and\nin either case it is not possible for any reason to return\nthe essential commodity seized&#x27; then, the State shall\nbe liable to pay the market price of the value with\ninterest. The expression, &#x27;for any reason&#x27; should be\nunderstood in broader and larger sense as it appears\nfrom the context in which it has been used. The\ninability to return, giving rise to the statutory\nobligation of deeming it as sale to the Government\nmay arise for variety of reasons and extends to any\nfailure on the part of the Government.

Or it might have\nbeen lost or stolen from the place of storage. The\ngoods might have deteriorated or rusted in quality or\nquantity. The liability to return the goods seized does\nnot stand discharged by offering them in whatever\ncondition it was. Confiscation of part of the goods\nthus could not affect the right of owner to claim return\nof the remaining goods. Nor the owner is bound to\naccept the goods in whatever condition they are. The\nclaim of the respondent, therefore, that the appellant\nwas bound to accept the goods in whatever condition\nthey were is liable to be rejected.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                   153</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">3.

The central question in issue is the interpretation\n           of clause (b) Explanation I to Section 2(11) of Act 26\n           of 1963. Learned counsel for the aforesaid respective\n           appellants, Mr Tripurari Ray and Mr A.T.M. Sampath,\n           Senior Counsel submit on the facts of this case that\n           the disputed land cannot be construed to be &quot;part-\n           village inam estate&quot; to fall within Act 26 of 1963 but\n           is a minor inam to fall under Act 30 of 1963. Before\n           taking up this issue of &quot;part-village inam estate&quot;, it is\n           necessary to look back to the history of inam lands,\n           how it emerged, was recognised, canalised and dealt\n           with through various enactments till it reached the\n           legislative umbrella of both Acts 26 and 30 of 1963.\n           The law relating to the landholdings, agrarian reform,\n           in the Presidency town of Madras, with reference to\n           the landlords and ryots started from the previous\n           century and it is interesting to note a few of the\n           essential features of this agrarian development. The\n           origin of inam tenure is traced back to its grant made\n           by Hindu rulers for the support of temples and\n           charitable institutions, for the maintenance of holy\n           and learned men rendering public service, etc. This\n           practice was followed by the Mohammedan rulers and\n           by British administrators until about a century ago.\n           According to the ancient Hindu law, there were two\n           beneficial interests in land, namely, (1) that of the\n           sovereign or his representative, and (2) that of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                155</span>\n\n            cultivator holding the land. The sovereign&#x27;s right to\n            collect a share of the produce of the cultivated land\n            was known by the name &quot;melvaram&quot;, the share of the\n            ryot or cultivator was known by the name\n            &quot;kudivaram&quot;. The ryot&#x27;s right arose from occupation\n            of the land. Thus, the grant of an inam did not touch,\n            and could not have touched, the cultivator&#x27;s right in\n            the land, namely, the kudivaram, except in rare cases\n            where the grantor was also holding the cultivator&#x27;s\n            interest at the time of the grant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1647330\" id=\"span_53\">5.

It is true that in dealing with the effect of this\n       Firman, the learned Attorney-General sought to raise\n       before us a novel point that under Hindu law even an\n       absolute monarch was not competent to make a law\n       affecting     religious    endowments      and    their\n       administration. He suggested that he was in position\n       to rely upon the opinions of scholars which tended to\n       show that a Hindu monarch was competent only to\n       administer the law as prescribed by Smgritis and the\n       oath which he was expected to take at the time of his\n       coronation enjoined him to obey the Smritis and to\n       see that their injunctions were obeyed by his subject.\n       We did not allow the learned Attorney-General to\n       develop this point because we hold that this novel\n       point cannot be accepted in view of the well-\n       recognised principles of jurisprudence. An absolute\n       monarch was the fountain-head of all legislative,\n       executive and judicial powers and it is of the very\n       essence of sovereignty which vested in him that he\n       could supervise and control the administration of\n       public charity. In our opinion there is no doubt\n       whatever that this universal principle in regard to the\n       scope of the powers inherently vesting in sovereignty\n       applies as much to Hindu monarchs as to any other\n       absolute monarch. Therefore, it must be held that the\n       Firman issued by the Maharana of Udaipur in 1934 is\n       a law by which the affairs of the office Nathdwara.\n       Temple and succession to the office of the Tilkayat\n       were governed after its issue.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">2.

But a place more\nparticularly famous is that which is called Sitha\nRassoce, a table of Sitha (Seeta), wife of Ram;\nsituated on an eminence to the south of the city.\nThe emperor Aurangzebe demolished the fortress\ncalled Ramcote, and erected on the site of\nMohammedan temple with a triple dome.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">According to others, it was erected by Baber. There\nare to be seen fourteen columns of black stone, five\nspans in height, which occupied the site of the\nfortress. Twelve of these columns now support the\ninterior arcades of the mosque: the two other form\npart of the tomb of a certain Moor. They tell us that\nthese columnsms, are rather these remains of\nskillfully wrought columns, were brought from the\nIsle of Lanca or Selendip (Ceylon) by Hanuman,\nKing of the Monkeys.

The\ncradle; and the reason is, that there formerly stood\nhere the house in which Beshan (Vishnoo) was born\nin the form of Ram, and were also, they say, is three\nbrothers were born. Afterwards, Aurangzebe or,\naccording to others, Baber caused the place to be\ndestroyed, in order to deprive the heathen of the\nopportunity of practising there their superstitions.\nNevertheless, they still pay superstitious reverence\nto both these places; namely, to that on which the\nNatal dwelling Ram stood, by going three times\naround it, prostrate on the earth. The two places are\nsurrounded with a low wall adorned with\nbattlements. Not far from this is a place where they\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                      169</span>\n\n                     dig up grains of black rice changed into little\n                     stones, which are affirmed to have been hidden\n                     under ground ever since the time of Rama.

Josef Tieffenthaler was born at Bozen in the Tyrol, on 27th\n\n            August, 1710 and died at Lucknow on 5 July, 1785. He\n\n            entered the Society of Jesus 9 October, 1729, and went in\n\n            1740 to the East Indian mission where he occupied various\n\n            positions, chiefly in the empire of the Great Moghul. After\n\n            the suppression of the Society he remained in India, and on\n\n            his death was buried in the mission cemetery at Agra, where\n\n            his tombstone still stands. He was a fine scholar with an\n\n            unusual talent for languages; besides his native tongue he\n\n            understood Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hindustani,\n\n            Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit. He was the first European\n\n            who wrote an exact description of Hindustan. A brief list of\n\n            his works is the best proof of his extraordinary power of\n\n            work and his varied scholarship. In geography, he wrote a\n\n            &quot;Descriptio Indiae&quot;, that is a circumstantial description of\n\n            the twenty two provinces of India, of its cities, fortresses,\n\n            and the most important smaller towns, together with an\n\n            exact statement of geographical positions, calculated by\n\n            means of a simple quadrant. He wrote a large book on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                           170</span>\n\ncourses of the Ganga. In history, he wrote many books. He\n\nwrote on the origin of the Hindus and their religion in Latin,\n\nexpeditions of Nadir Shah to India in German, the Deeds of\n\nthe Mughal Emperor Shah Alam in Persian, Incursions of\n\nthe Afghans and the Conquest of Delhi in French. He wrote\n\na book on contemporary history 1757-64. In linguistics he\n\nprepared a Sanskrit-Parsee Lexicon, treatises in Latin on the\n\nlanguage of the Parsees, on the proper pronunciation of\n\nLatin, etc.. In the area of religion, he wrote &#x27;Brahmanism&#x27;\n\nand works on Indian polytheism, Indian asceticism, the\n\nreligion of Parsee Islam and relations of these religions to\n\none another. In the field of the natural sciences he wrote on\n\nastronomical observations on the sunspots and zodiacal\n\nlight, studies on the Hindu astronomy, astrology and\n\ncosmology. In addition, he wrote on the descriptions and\n\nobservations of the flora and fauna of India. Thus he was an\n\nintellectual giant and a linguistic wizard and not mere a\n\ntraveller or a merchant who made casual remarks. His\n\npublished works along with biographical notes can be\n\nlucidly gleaned from Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) and\n\n&#x27;Christianty in India&#x27; through Wikisource and Wikipedia&#x27;s\n\nwebsite respectively.

These\n          inscriptions were the sheet-anchor of the plff&#x27;s case\n          but I am of the opinion that they are inconclusive.\n          The 1st inscription contains three couplets in Persian\n          and when translated runs as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">          &quot;By the order of Shah Babar, whose justice went up\n          to the skies (i.e. was well known), Amir (Noble)\n          Mir Baqi, of lofty grandeour, built this resting place\n          of angels in 923 Hijri.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">          The 2nd inscription is more elaborate and contains\n          usual high flown language on eulogy of Babar &amp;\n          describe Mir Baqi of Isphahan as his adviser and\n          the builder of the mosque.

In one it is given 923 Hijri\n\n  corresponding to 1516-17 A.D. while in other Inscription it\n\n  has been given 935 A.D. corresponding to 1528-29 A.D. In\n\n  this Inscription Mir Baqi of Isphahan has been described as\n\n  Babur&#x27;s adviser and the builder of the mosque. As Esfahan\n\n  and Taskend are part of two different Nations i.e. Iran and\n\n  Uzbekistan respectively these two Baqi are to be construed\n\n  two different persons. While in     A. Fuhere&#x27;s Inscription\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                              182</span>\n\n  structure in question has been mentioned as lofty firmament\n\n  building ; in the contractor Tehwoor khan&#x27;s restored\n\n  Inscription it has been purposely mentioned as resting place\n\n  of angels.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">16.In 1964-65 Dr. Z.A. Desai, Superintendent, Persian and\n\n  Arabic Inscription Nagpur published Texts and Translations\n\n  of three Inscriptions alleged to be fixed on Babari Mosque.\n\n  Dr. Desai gives reason for his said publication of the Texts\n\n  and Transalations of the said Inscriptions as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">           &quot; The mosque contains a number of inscriptions.\n           On the eastern façade is a chhajja, below which\n           appears a Quaranic text and above, an inscription in\n           Persian verse. On the central mihrab are carved\n           religions texts such as Kalima (first Creed), etc. On\n           the southern face of the pulpit was previously fixed\n           a stone slab bearing a Persian inscription in verse.\n           There was also another inscription in Persian verse\n           built up into the right hand sidewall of the pulpit.\n           Of these, the last mentioned two epigraphs have\n           disappeared. They were reportedly destroyed in the\n           communal vandalism in 1934 A.D., but luckily, I\n           managed to secure an inked rubbing of one of them\n           from Sayyid Badru&#x27;l-Hasan of Fyzabad. The\n           present inscription, restored by the Muslim\n           community, is not only in inlaid Nasta&#x27;liq\n           characters, but is also slightly different from the\n           original, owing perhaps to the incompetence of the\n           restorers in deciphering it properly.1\n           The readings and translations of the historical\n           epigraphs mentioned above, except in the case of\n           one, were published by Fuhrer and Mrs. Beveridge,\n           but their readings are so incomplete and different\n           from the text that their inclusion in this article is not\n           only desirable but imperative.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">           The epigraph studied below was built up into the\n           southern side of the pulpit of the mosque, but is\n           now lost, as stated above It is edited here from the\n           estampage obtained from Sayyid Badru&#x27;l-Hasan of\n           Fyzabad4.

Desai In his detailed discussion on all inscriptions\n\n   of Babur&#x27;s regime writes an introduction that a rough draft\n\n   of an article of his predecessor Maulivi M. Asuraf Hussain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                               187</span>\n\n   who retired in 1953 was found amongst sundry papers in his\n\n   office with a note that it might be published after revision by\n\n   his successor. Consequently, he claims, that he has published\n\n   these inscriptions with translation after extensive revision\n\n   and editing, but nowhere has he mentioned that which\n\n   portions of the reading of these inscriptions are his own\n\n   revision and editing and on what ground these revisions\n\n   have been made. About inscriptions at Ayodhya he writes\n\n   that there are three inscriptions in the Babari Mosque out of\n\n   which the two were completely destroyed by the Hindu\n\n   rioters in 1934 A.D. However, he managed to secure an ink-\n\n   stampage of one of them from Sayyid Badru&#x27;l - Hasan of\n\n   Fyzabad. He writes that the present inscription restored by\n\n   the Muslims Community &quot;is also slightly different from the\n\n   original owing perhaps to the incompetence of restorers in\n\n   deciphering it properly.&quot; When Dr. Desai himself admits that\n\n   the restored inscription is slightly different from the original,\n\n   then his claim that the restored inscription fixed on Baburi\n\n   mosque in or after 1934 is the dextrously rebuilt of the\n\n   original one alleged to be fixed on since the days of Babur\n\n   becomes meaningless and un-trustworthy. . In fact, none of\n\n   the Inscriptions was fixed on the Disputed Structure which\n\n   has all along been sacred place of the Hindus known as Sri\n\n   Ramajanmasthan Temple.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">19.Dr. Desai informs that he has based his translation on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                           188</span>\n\ninscription of Fuhrer, although he says that Fuhrer must\n\nhave been misinformed to affirm that; &quot;few corrections of\n\nthe second and the whole third line completely defaced&quot;.\n\nEven if it is supposed that some words in the 2nd line and\n\nthe whole third line are defaced, there is not much impact in\n\nthe meaning of the text of the inscription. But here we do\n\nfind that Dr. Desai has extensively changed the meaning of\n\nthe translated passage. It is quite different from what Fuhrer\n\nhad translated. Fuhrer had written that it is in ten lines,\n\nabove the entrance door of the Masjid. He has made its\n\ntranslation in ten separate lines. Dr. Desai has considerably\n\nchanged the meaning of the text without pinpointing how\n\nFuhrer&#x27;s translation was wrong. Since beginning and the end\n\nof the text are the same and the inscription is said to be the\n\nsame and there is no major variance in Fuhrer&#x27;s English\n\ntranslation from the Persian text, Dr. Desai&#x27;s translation\n\nappears to be arbitrary. He has changed the date of the\n\ninscription 930 H. (1523 A.D.) to 935A.H. without assigning\n\nany reason. In Dr. Desai&#x27;s translation the name of Mir Baqi\n\nthe second Asfaq appears where as in the original Persian\n\ntext Mir Baqi&#x27;s name does not appear at all. Then Babar is\n\ncalled a Qalandar in this inscription which is not found in\n\nFuhrer&#x27;s translation. After 4th line Dr. Desai does not follow\n\nthe line system and at the end he mentions Fathu&#x27;llah\n\nMuhammad Ghori as the humble writer of this inscription.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                             189</span>\n\n  His name figures in the Fuhrer&#x27;s translation too. He goes on\n\n  expanding how Babar was called Qalandar but he does not\n\n  explain how the changes have taken place in the inscription\n\n  which was not in the text read by Fuhrer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">20.In the above mentioned Inscriptions the Emperor&#x27;s name\n\n  Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Babur Badshah Ghazi which has\n\n  been recorded almost in all other available Inscription of his\n\n  period, is missing from which it appears that the forgers of\n\n  later days were not familiar with the correct name of the said\n\n  Emperor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">  In the Inscription, dated A.H. 933 i.e. 1526-27 A.D. found\n  on the wall of a well from Fatehpur Sikri being Plate No.\n  XV(a) in its 1st line his name has been recorded as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">          &quot;Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Babur Badshah Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">                              (Epigraphia Indica Arabic\n                              &amp; Persian Supplement\n                              1964 and 1965 at page-51)\n\n  In the Inscription of A.H. 934 i.e. 1527-28 A.D. found on a\n  mosque from Panipat being Plate No. XVI(b) in its 1st line\n  his name has been recorded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">           &quot;Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Babur Badshah Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">                                                  (Ibid.p. 55)\n  In the Inscription dated A.H. 934 i.e. 1527-28 A.D. found\n  on a mosque from Rohatak being Plate No. XVI(a) in its\n  2nd line his name has been recorded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">           &quot;Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Babur Badshah Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">                                                  (Ibid.p. 56-7)\n\n  In the Inscription dated A.H. 934 i.e. 1528 A.D. found on a\n  mosque from Rohtak being Plate No. XVII(a) in its 1st line\n  his name has been recorded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">           &quot;His Majesty Babur Badshah Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">                                                   (Ibid.p. 57)\n  In the Inscription of A.H. 935 i.e. 1528-29 A.D. found on a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                             190</span>\n\n   mosque from Palam(Delhi) being Plate No. XVIII(a) in its\n   1st and 2nd lines his name has been recorded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">             &quot;Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Babur Badshah Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">                                                    (Ibid.p. 62)\n   In the Inscription of A.H. 935 i.e. 1528-29 A.D. found on a\n   mosque from Pilakhna being Plate No. XVIII(c) in its 3rd\n   line his name has been recorded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">             &quot;Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Babur Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">                                                      (Ibid.p. 64)\n\n   In the Inscription dated A.H. 936 i.e. 1529 A.D. found on a\n   mosque from Maham being Plate No. XIX(a) in its 1st and\n   2nd lines his name has been recorded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">             &quot;Zahiru&#x27;d-Din Muhammad Badshah Ghazi&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">                                                      (Ibid.p. 65)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">21.It is not uncommon for ruffians to fix old Inscriptions on\n\n   newly built and / or converted mosques. &#x27;Epigraphia Indica\n\n   Arabic &amp; Persian Supplement 1964 and 1965&#x27; at its pages\n\n   55 and 56 records that two Inscriptions dated 1934 fixed on\n\n   two mosques at Rohtak did not belong to those mosques but\n\n   have been fixed thereon. relevant extracts from said book\n\n   read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">           &quot;Among the historical buildings, two mosques, viz.,\n           Masjid-i-Khurd in the Fort2 and Rajputon-ki-\n           Masjid, a new mosque in the city area, bear\n           inscriptions of the time of Babar. The one on the\n           Masjid-i-Khurd consists of three lines inscribed on\n           a tablet measuring 53 by 23cm. Which is fixed over\n           the central archway outside3.

Relevant\n\n   extracts from his said reprt read as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">            &quot; It would not be, however, wholly correct to say\n            that the Kushk-Mahal does not bear any inscription.\n            There are about a score of places on the walls\n            enclosing the stair-cases<a href=\"/doc/269366/\" id=\"a_44\">, <a href=\"/doc/269366/\" id=\"a_45\">referred to above</a></a>, which\n            bear short inscriptions. The rubbings of some of\n            these were found in the bundles of old estampages\n            which were transferred to our office, from the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                  192</span>\n\nOffice of the Government Epigraphist for India,\nOotacamund, South India, who in his turn seems to\nhave received them quite some time back from the\nArchaeological Department of the erstwhile\nGwalior state. I prepared fresh rubbings of these\nrecords when I toured some places in Madhya\nPradesh, including Chanderi, in November 1962.\nOf these, some are mere repetitions of the same text\nand as such have been excluded from this purview.\nThe remaining four inscriptions are edited here for\nthe first time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">These inscriptions raise an important question, as to\nwhether they are contemporary with the building or\nnot. They do not appear to be so, because they are\nnot inscribed on tablets set up on the walls, nor are\nthey found incised on prominent places on the\nmonument. A building of such magnificence would\nhave had, if at all it was so planned, an inscription\nof proportionate prominence. This does not rule\nout the possibility, however, of the existence of an\nepigraph on the monument, for it is possible that it\nhad one and may have disappeared since.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">Moreover, the texts of the inscriptions under study\nare also vague on this point, for they do not make\nany explicit reference to the palace-building or its\nconstruction. In view of these facts, it appears\nmore likely that these records are either visitors&#x27;\netchings or some sort of mementos which the\ngovernors, the palace-guards or some other officials\nmight have desired to leave on the stone.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">Fortunately, one of these four records is dated, and\nsince the same penmanship is employed in the other\nthree records, they can also be safely taken as\nhaving been inscribed at about the same time or at\nshort intervals. Their language is Persian and style\nof writing cursive Naskh. The wear and tear of time\nhas affected the stone, resulting into partial\nobliteration of some of the letters, particularly in\nthe first inscription.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">The contents of these four epigraphs classify them\ninto two groups: one, of the first inscription, and the\nother of the remaining three. The first refers itself\nto the governorship(amal) of Khan-i-A&#x27;zam Sharaf\nKhan Sultani and the superintendence (shahnagi) of\none person whose name is not very legible; it seems\nto be Raja, (son of) Shams, (son of) Fath.

Accordingly, the disputed site cannot be deemed to be a\n\nmosque. He has further submitted that there is no reliable\n\nevidence that it was constructed by Babur or Mir Baqi.\n\nAccordingly Ramjanamsthan Temple even under the Islamic\n\nlaw shall retain its existence, which is not vanished by any\n\nillegal action of Aurangzeb, Babur or any ruler. No valid waqf\n\ncan also be created.

There is a clear mention that there\n\n      existed Rama temple at the place in question. From the Gazateers\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                         199</span>\n\n      report as well as from the Judgment of Civil Judge in Suit no. 61/\n\n      280 of 1885 it is clear that Hindus were performing Pujas in the\n\n      inner courtyard and after riot in 1855 a railing was put, and\n\n      Muslims were allowed to perform Namaz as well. But there is no\n\n      evidence that the Hindus did not continue to worship the idols\n\n      inside the inner courtyard. The Muslims tried to enter upon the\n\n      inner courtyard in the year 1934 and riot took place in which the\n\n      Domes were damaged and were rebuilt by the Britishers giving\n\n      outlook of a Mosque. There is no evidence that after riots, the\n\n      structure was handed over to Muslims by the Government. The\n\n      Hindus continued in possession and pooja was being performed in\n\n      the inner courtyard and also on chabutara. The pilgrims and\n\n      devotees continued to worship and perform ritual of all the sacred\n\n      places at the Asthan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\">\n20-         It is remarkable to mention that the building in question\n\n      cannot be termed as mosque in any way. On the pillars, images of\n\n      Hindu God and Goddess are visible, at the entrance small &#x27;aala&#x27; for\n\n      worship of the deity was there, in the northern side Singh Dwar\n\n      was there and the outer was the image of Varah is very much\n\n      visible. Apart from all these evidences, one more remarkable thing\n\n      is that there is parikrama marg round the structure which is found\n\n      in a Temple. After Darshan of the &#x27;Idol&#x27;, the &#x27;Charans&#x27; and Sita\n\n      Rasoi&#x27;,   devotees      were   taking   parikrama   of   the Temple\n\n      continuously much before the rule of Babur. The Panchkosi and\n\n      Chaudah Kosi parikrama of the Asthan are being performed from\n\n      ages. On Ram Naumi day, the birth place of Lord Ram devotees in\n\n      lacs were collecting to perform Pooja and other rituals much\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                       200</span>\n\n      before from Babur invaded and continued till date.\n\n\n21-           It is noteworthy that in all the Government and Revenue\n\n      Record Janamsathan or Temple have been mentioned. Even the\n\n      Muslims in their applications have referred the place as Janam\n\n      asthan. In 1858, Mohd. Asgar, the alleged Mutwalli had confirmed\n\n      that Hindus collect and perform puja there from ages.\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"269366\" id=\"span_109\">22-           It is remarkable that all the Muslim historian, writers,\n\n      intellectuals etc have continuously maintained that Babur\n\n      constructed a Mosque after demolishing the birthplace temple at\n\n      the site in question. For the first time, Mohd. Ayub Advocate, in\n\n      his statement under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_52\">Order 10 CPC</a> asserted that Mosque was\n\n      constructed under the orders of Babur at a barren land.\n\n\n23-           It is noteworthy that Mohd. Ayub Advocate could not give\n\n      said statement on the basis of his knowledge as he had not seen the\n\n      events of 1528 and he has not disclosed his source of knowledge.\n\n\n24-           In <a href=\"/doc/269366/\" id=\"a_53\">Suit No. 29 of 1945, UP Shia Wakf Board Vs.

Sunni\n\n      Wakf Board</a> which is being relied upon by the plaintiffs, there is a\n\n      finding that the Mosque in question was constructed after\n\n      demolishing a Temple at the Birthplace of Lord Ram. The Muslims\n\n      have also not filed any appeal against the said finding. Therefore,\n\n      there is estoppels against the Muslims on the issue and they cannot\n\n      assert that the alleged Mosque in question after demolishing the\n\n      Temple at the Ram Janam Asthan was constructed on a barren\n\n      land.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                       201</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">\n\n25-         From a reading of Babur Nama, it is crystal clear that he\n\n      hated Hindus and Idol worshippers and he took a vow to break\n\n      their Idols in pieces.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">\n26-         Therefore, a clear mens rea is established and Babur&#x27;s hatred\n\n      came true when under his order temple at the place in question was\n\n      destroyed partly to humiliate the Idol Worshippers and show the\n\n      victory of Army of Islam over Pagans( Kafirs).\n\n\n27-         It is relevant to point out that Muslim Plaintiffs have\n\n      asserted that from the time of Babur till British Rule they were\n\n      being paid Nankar grant. In this regard it is to point out that there\n\n      was no proof that any grant was ever given by any ruler before\n\n      1860 in the name of alleged Baburi Mosque. It is for the first time\n\n      that Britishers allured the Muslim by financial grant of Rupees 302\n\n      and 6 annas on the condition that they will be loyal to the\n\n      Britishers and give military service whenever required. The grant\n\n      was given for a Mosque existed at Mauja Sehenava and not for any\n\n      Mosque at Mauja Kot Ramchandar. Mauja Sehenava is 5\n\n      kilometers away from Mauja Kot Ramchandar.\n\n      There is no proof that any Wakf was ever created or the Mosque\n\n      was on a Wakf property. No Wakf can be created over the site of a\n\n      Hindu temple or Hindu place or at the Asthan of Hindu worship. It\n\n      is immaterial as to whether Muslim law permits such a\n\n      construction of a Mosque and the defendant Hindu Maha Sabha\n\n      does not rely on Muslim law at all. In regard to Hindu places of\n\n      worship, Muslim law cannot be applied and Hindu Law will apply\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                202</span>\n\nand prevail, which lays down that once deity&#x27;s property, if always\n\na deity&#x27;s property and even King cannot take it. Even if under\n\nMuslim law the construction in question could be recognized as\n\nmosque, the defendant does not place reliance on that analogy to\n\ntake benefit of foreign law which would be shameful and\n\nderogatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_178\">      He has further submitted that on the basis of archaeological\n\nevidence and remains which were found after the demolition of the\n\nold structure suggests that after demolition of the temple the\n\nmosque was constructed by the debris of the old temple.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">1.    The most clinching evidence is epigraphical, i.e.,\n\ndocuments inscribed on stone. It is the inscription of that\n\nvery king in whose reign the Hindu temple at Rama\n\nJanmabhumi was built, King Govinda Chandra. It is,\n\ntherefore, contemporary documentary evidence which is\n\nincontrovertible hence it should be fully relied upon in\n\nestablishing the historical fact of the existence of a pre-\n\nBabari Masjid Hindu temple at Rama Janmabhumi.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">2.    It is a 20-line lekha (inscription or document)\n\nengraved on a rectangular phalaka (slab or tablet) of buff\n\nsandstone (Shila) . It measures about 5 fts. In length and\n\n2.25 fts. In width. The language of the inscription is\n\nSanskrit. The text is largely composed in beautiful verses;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                 203</span>\n\nonly some portions are in prose.

This is fully\n\nestablished by palaeography or &quot;the science of old\n\nwritings&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">3.   That      inscription,   in      the   absence     of    proper\n\nprofessional     estampages,       which      the     court    must\n\nimmediately arrange from the Archaeological Survey of\n\nIndia, has understandably as yet not been fully deciphered\n\nby   palaeographists      and      epigraphists.      Nevertheless,\n\nsubstantial portions have been deciphered from the\n\navailable estampages, photographs, colour slides and a\n\nvideo-film prepared by Dr. S.P. Gupta jointly with Dr.\n\nSudha Malaiyya on 13 t h Dece. 1992, which prove beyond\n\nan iota of doubt that here at Rama Janmabhumi there did\n\nexist from at least the early 12 th century A.D. a Hindu\n\ntemple. The inscription and its deciphered portions are\n\ngiven in Appendix -I. Here we are quoting only the\n\nrelevant portions to bring home the single point that as\n\nearly as the first half of the 12 t h century A.D. a\n\nmagnificent and imposing Hindu temple,dedicated to Lord\n\nVishnu-Hari, was constructed here during the reign of the\n\nmost powerfull ruler of this region, King Chandra Deva\n\nof the Gahadval Dynasty ruling from Kannauj, an ancient\n\ncity of the R. Ganga, from where even the king Harsha\n\nhad ruled in the 7 t h century A.D.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                              204</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">4.    The inscription has not been read fully due to the\n\nnon-availability of good impressions, but what has so far\n\nbeen deciphered in more than enough to conclude the\n\nerection of a Vaishnava shrine there during this period.\n\nThe record was evidently put up on a wall of the shrine to\n\nmark its completion and installation of the divine image.\n\nLine 15 of this inscription tells us that a beautiful temple\n\nof Vishnu-Hari built with heaps of stone (sila-samphati-\n\ngrahais) and beautified with a golden spire (hiranya-\n\nkalasa- sri-sundaram) unparalleled by any other temple\n\nerected by earlier kings (purvvair-apy-akritam kritam\n\nnripatibhir ) was constructed. This wonderful temple (aty-\n\nadbhutam )was built in the temple-city (vibudh-alayani ) of\n\nAyodhya and Saketa were closely connected, Saketa being\n\nthe district wherein Ayodhya was located. The two names\n\nare used as synonymous in classical Sanskrit literature,\n\nand it is likely that they represent the twin cities of\n\nAyodhya and Faizabad. Towards the end it also refers to\n\nGod    Vishnu    as   destroying   kind   Bali   (in   Vamana\n\nincarnation) and the ten headed (Dasanana, i.e. Ravapa)\n\nand alludes to the serious fear from the west (paschatya-\n\nbhiti ).   It also contains the expression Janmabhumi. It\n\nwas composed by the poet Ayushyachandra, son of\n\nAlhana. Perhaps he was also a ruling chief and as royal\n\npoet he was said to have excelled even Sahasanka and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                               205</span>\n\nSudraka and is credited with the excavation of tanks,\n\nwells as well as stepped wells. We come across a\n\nreference to king Govindachandra, who appears to be\n\nidentical with the homonymous Gahadavala king, as well\n\nas to strong ruling chief named Sallakshana twice. This\n\nSallakshana cannot be dfinitely identified as the whole\n\ninscription has not yet been deciphered. He could have\n\nbeen    a   Gahadavala     feudatory     or   the     well-known\n\nChandella king of that name who ruled towards the close\n\nof the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth century\n\nA.D.    while   certain   points    in   connection    with   the\n\ninterpretation of the inscription are yet to be settled, and\n\ncan only be settled when good impressions are made\n\navailable, the fact is finally established that at the\n\ndisputed site there existed an eleventh-twelfth century\n\nVaishnava temple before the erection of the &#x27;Babari\n\nmasque.&#x27;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">5.     In this prashasti (citation) the king says that he\n\ncame to Ayodhya, which is located in the Saket Mandala\n\n(District), and built a sundara mandiram (most beautiful\n\ntemple) of shila (stone). It was possibly done in place of\n\nan old temple which had by then become weathered. He\n\ntopped the Shikhara (spire) of the temple with kalasha\n\n(pinnacle) made of hiranya (Gold). He dedicated the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                             206</span>\n\ntemple to Lord Vishnu-Hari who was none else but the\n\none who had humbled the pride of Bali-raja (the\n\ntrivikram form of Vishnu) and also dushta Dashanana\n\n(wicked Ravana). This he did when the foreigners (the\n\nMuslims) were avalanching from the West (Paschchatya )\n\nand creating fear (bhiti ) but he had successfully thwarted\n\nit with the valour of his own arm (Bahudalanama ).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">6.   The date of the reigning king Govinda Chandra of\n\nthe Gahadval dynasty of Kannauj is bracketed between\n\n1114 A.D. and 1154 A.D.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">7.   It is most significant to note that the king not only\n\nbuilt the temple but also completed it because the kalasha\n\nor pinnacle is established on the top of the Shikhara or\n\nspire only when the temple is finally ready in all respects\n\nand the kumbhabhisheka performed. Then only the deity\n\nin the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) gets consecrated\n\nand is ready to receive daily offering and worship. In this\n\ncase the main deity was Lord Vishnu -Hari. Evidently, the\n\ninscribed tablet was fixed in the walls of the temple of\n\nVishnu- Hari at the time of the consecration of the deity\n\nand the inaugural worship held to commemorate the\n\nevent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_186\">8.   No, greater proof is required to establish the fact\n\nthat here at Rama Janmabhumi a magnificient Vaishnava\n\ntemple was in fact built sometime between 1114 AD. And\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                  207</span>\n\n1154 A.D., i.e. during the first half of the 12 t h century\n\nA.D. and dedicated to Lord Vishnu-Hari who had humbled\n\nthe pride of many, including Ravana. (Incidently, Rama\n\nand Rama alone had humbled the pride of Ravana; hence\n\nin a sense it was not only a Vishnu temple but also Rama\n\ntemple, as Rama was one of the various incarnations of\n\nVishnu.)The event of erecting the temple had taken place\n\naround 400 years prior to the building of the &#x27;Babari\n\nMasjid&#x27;: the temple was built in early 12 t h century while\n\nthe &#x27;mosque&#x27; was built in early 16 t h century. For the\n\nhistorians the evidence of the inscription is full, final and\n\nincontrovertible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_187\">9.    It may also be noted that even earlier to it there\n\nexisted a temple at this very site which had become\n\ndilapidated due to the ravages of time which had\n\nweathered the stones of the temple. This is borne out from\n\nthe details of the inscription as well as the actual art and\n\narchitectural remains discovered on 6 t h Dec. 199: Hence,\n\nthe building of the 12 t h Century Hindu temple was not a\n\none-time   act   but    an     act     in   an   on-going    process.\n\n(Reference:      Rama        Janmabhumi,          Ayodhya:      New\n\nArchaeological       Discoveries,       Historians   Forum,     New\n\nDelhi, 1992).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\">10.   Fortunately,      this     contemporary         documentary\n\nevidence, in the form of Hari-Vishnu temple inscription,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                  208</span>\n\nengraved on a stone tablet, is further supported by two\n\nmore inscriptions engraved on a stone pillar found within\n\nthe debris of the Babari Masjid on the 6 t h Dec. 12992 .\n\nOne of these stone inscriptions (Shila-lekha ), the upper\n\none, is in eight lines, while the other, the lower one, is in\n\ntwo   lines.    Though     the     inscriptions    are   so   very\n\nfragmentary that no coherent account could so far be\n\nmade out from their reading. Still two things are\n\nabsolutely clear: one , that the inscriptions relate to\n\nHindu Gods and Hindu Kings ( there is a genealogical\n\nreference) and second, that palaeographically the script is\n\nto be placed in 12 th century A.D., may be in the mid to\n\nlat 12 th Century A.D.           Thus, these inscriptions are\n\naround 50 years later in date than the Vishnu-Hari temple\n\ninscription.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">11.   It, therefore, follows, that the activities connected\n\nwith the structures did not cease by the middle of the 12 t h\n\ncentury A.D, these were continuing beyond it.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_190\">12.

There are several pieces of architectural members of\n\nthe pre-1528-29 A.D. Hindu temples which once stood at\n\nRama Janmabhumi. We may start with the internal\n\nevidence of the structure of the so-called Babari Masjid\n\nwhich stood at the site from 1528-29 A.D. till the\n\nafternoon of the 6 t h Dec. 1992. The evidence is in the\n\nform of a number of beautifully carved monolithic pillars\n\nof black colour with bluish hue. These were at the ends of\n\nthe piers of the domes and also on the entrance of the\n\n&#x27;masjid&#x27;. On all counts, these are non-Islamic because\n\nthey show images of Hindu gods and goddesses. Thus,\n\nthese pillars must have formed part of a temple of the\n\npre-Babari Masjid period. The relevant details are as\n\nfollows:   (i)    Within the then disputed structure of the\n\nso-called Babari Masjid there were as many as 14 pillars\n\nof black stone popularly called&#x27;kasauti&#x27; but geologically\n\nspeaking, schistose of the slate varity, a sedimentary\n\nrock, the nearest deposits of which are located in hilly\n\ntracts of Garhwal- Kumaonregion of Uttar Pradesh. All of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                             210</span>\n\nthem were used a architectural members in the body\n\nfabric of the &#x27;Babari Mosque&quot;.                               (ii)\n\n      One of the black stone pillars, fixed on the northern\n\nside of the main entrance, carved under the central dome,\n\nwas   found   inscribed   with    the   letter   &quot;Si &quot;,   written\n\nprominently in typical Nagari script which is stylistically\n\ndatable to 11-12 t h century A.D., sdme as the script of the\n\nVishnu-Hari temple inscription mentioned in Section-I.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_192\">      (iii) There are two similar pillars found fixed\n\nupside down in a grave-yard located nearly a furlong\n\naway from Janmabhumi. The grave near which these are\n\nstill found existing is alleged to be of the Muslim saint,\n\nMusa Ashikan who is supposed to be patron of Mir Baqi.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\">      There are a couple of similar other black stone\n\npillars, still standing in the cantonment area at Faizabad,\n\nsome 8 to 10 Km. away from Ayodhya.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">      (iv) Each pillar, which nearly 11 to 12 inches\n\nsquare at the base, but eight faceted in the centre and four\n\nfaceted below it, is shown emerging out of a sacred\n\nwater-pitcher, called purna-kumbha or purna-ghata , or\n\nsimply kalasha. It is exclusively a Hindu sacred motif\n\nsince it relates to the Vedic concept of Water Cosmology.\n\n(Reference: &quot;&#x27;Ashokan&#x27; Pillar: A Reassessment of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                211</span>\n\nEvidence&quot; pt.IV Symbolism, Burlington Magazine 1976,\n\nby John Irwin).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">     (v)   Each purna-ghata is shown carried on the\n\nshoulders of four yakshas, sitting on knees and pressing\n\nthe hands on the ground in the front.

According    to\n\nSadhanamala ,      an    old    Sanskrit      text      on   Hindu\n\nInconography, each human settlement had at least one\n\nyaksha, as the guardian deity; he had a consort also,\n\ncalled   yakshi,   Reference:        yaksha       by    Ananda   K.\n\nCoomaraswami)           (vi) The        pillars        are   further\n\nembellished with male (Ganas ), female (deva-kanyas ),\n\nfloral ( kamala ), faunal (hamsa ) and geometric motifs\n\n( diamond), typical of the Hindu iconography, repeatedly\n\nfound in all Hindu temples.

From 1975 through 1980 professor B.B. Lal, a\n\nformer Director General, Archaeological Survey of India,\n\nexcavated at fourteen different places in ayodhya on\n\nbehalf of the Archaeological Survey of India. In one of\n\nhis trenches, laid immediately on the south of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                               212</span>\n\nboundary wall of the then disputed structure, he found six\n\nof the several pillar-bases arranged in two parallel rows.\n\nThese were built of burnt-bricks mixed with blocks of\n\nstone.     It was logically surmised by the excavators that\n\nthese may have been those very &#x27;bases&#x27; on which some of\n\nthe block stone pillars of the original temple stood while\n\nin situ.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\">3.    After a close examination of the plans and sections\n\nof this site, it may further be noted, even three other\n\neminent archaeologists--Prof. K.V. Raman, Head of the\n\nAncient History and Archaeology Department, Madras\n\nUniversity, Dr. Y.D. Sharma and Dr. K.M. Srivastava--\n\nformerly Directors, Archaeological Survey of India, have\n\ncome to the same conclusion. The have observed that the\n\nfoundation-trenches of the pillars, the layers found\n\nagainst the pillar-bases, the various lime-floors, the\n\ndebris, and the floor sealing the pillar-bases as well as the\n\nmaterial found in the debris overlying the sealin-floor\n\nestablish beyond any doubt that the pillar-bases were\n\nraised in the 11 t h -12 t h century A.D. Incidentally, as noted\n\nearlier, one of the pillars on the main entrance of the\n\ndisputed structure also bears an inscription in Nagari\n\ncharacters of the 11 t h -12 century A.D. Thus, the pillar-\n\nbases belonged to the period 11 t h -12 t h century A.D.\n\nfurther, the dating of the destruction of the temple, early\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                             213</span>\n\n16 t h century, is based upon two unquestionable pieces of\n\nevidence: (i)   the material found in the deposit lying\n\nburied in a pit immediately below the sealing floor and in\n\nthe debris lying immediately above the sealing floor.\n\nThere are a number of glazed ware pieces in both the\n\ndeposits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">\n\n\nDOOR-JAMB OF BLACK STONE\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">4.    There is a door-jamb or dvara - shakha of black\n\nstone kept in the court-yard of a comparatively new\n\nbuilding called now &#x27;janmasthana. The door- jamb may\n\nhave been fixed at the entrance of the garbha-griha of the\n\noriginal Hindu temple. It shows two parallel mouldings,\n\none of which is purely decorative as it consists of\n\nmeandering creepers. The second mouldings is very\n\nsignificant because it is divided into several rectangular\n\npanels, set one above the other, each depicting a Hindu\n\ndeity. The lower -most depicts the image of Dvarapala , or\n\ndoor-keeper, standing in tribhanga poses under a arched\n\ncanopy. The devarapala is wearing a karanda mukuta on\n\nthe   head   and a vanamala in the neck.        In   Hindu\n\ninconography, when both of them occur together on the\n\nbody of a deity, the deity is necessarily to be Vaishnavite\n\nin origin. The entrance of the canopy is like a trefoiled\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                              214</span>\n\narch with three semi-circular mouldings based on the\n\nprinciple of oversailing courses, named &quot;corbelied arch&quot;.\n\nThis ornamental arch rests on two pillars, emerging out of\n\npurna-ghatas and beautifully decorated with a number of\n\nmouldings on the top. The panel above the devarapala\n\nshows a female deity standing in an arched gateway. Her\n\nposture is also in tribhanga . The panel above this also\n\nshows a female deity standing in tribhanga pose. The next\n\npanel shows the mother goddess standing in the forntal\n\npose under a canopy. The 4 t h panel depicts a gana or a\n\nyoung dwarfish male dancing under a canopy. The top-\n\nmost shows the beautiful image of salabhanjika, holding\n\na branch of the blossoming tree. It may be mentioned in\n\nthis context that the dvarapala is holding a shula, or a\n\nspear, in his left hand. It establishes the fact that he is a\n\nguardian deity, holding a weapon to protect the main\n\ndeity of the garbha-griha from all evil-doera. The right\n\nhand, on the other hand, is held in vyakhyana mudra, i.e.\n\nin a pose which is adopted by a deity when he delivers a\n\nsermon to the visitors. It should be borne in mind that the\n\ndeity is standing on a full blown lotus, as was customary\n\nwith all the deities during this period. It is, therefore,\n\nabsolutely clear that the temple to which the dvara-shakha\n\noriginally belonged was dedicated to Vishnu or an\n\nincarnation of Vishnu, most probably Rama, both are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                               215</span>\n\nessentially one and the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">\nMORE ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES OF ART\nAND ARCHITECTURAL OBJECTS FROM A 12 TH\nCENTUR A.D. HINDU TEMPLE--JUNE 1992\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_204\">5.   We are now on almost sure grounds that the 12 t h\n\ncentury Hari-Vishnu temple constructed here during the\n\nreign of King Govinda Chandra was destroyed, according\n\nto the tradition recorded in various Indian and foreign\n\naccounts, in the early 16 t h century, in all probability by\n\nBabur&#x27;s men. The parts of this temple which could be\n\ngainfully re-used in the structure of the &#x27;Baburi Masque&#x27;\n\nwere in fact re-used, such as the black stone pillars in the\n\npiers, some carved blocks of stone in the walls and at\n\nleast one long piece of stone with lotus carvings in the\n\nvitana , i.e., as a lintel. However, the parts which could not\n\nbe used, because of their unmanageable shapes, such as\n\nthe crescent shaped amalakas with corrugated periphery,\n\nor otherwise, were cast-away and dumped in a pit nearby.\n\nThese   details   of   the   discovery   and   some   of   the\n\nanitiquarian remains may be recounted as under.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">6.   ON THE 18 T H OF JUNE 1992, when the ground near\n\nthe Rama Janmabhumi was being leveled, a most startling\n\narchaeological discovery was made at Ayodhya. At a depth\n\nof about 12 feet from the ground level near the\n\nRamajanma Bhumi temple, towards the south and beyond\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                   216</span>\n\nthe fencing, a big hoard of beautifully carved buff\n\nsandstone pieces was located in a large pit dug down\n\nbelow the old top level.

The temple: The experts, who visited the site on\n\nbehalf of the academic organization, &quot;The Historians&#x27;\n\nForum&quot;, on the 2 n d and 3 rd of July 1992, are unanimously\n\nof the view that the temple, to which these fragments\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                               217</span>\n\nbelong, is of the developed Nagara style of ancient temple\n\narchitecture which was current in northern India during\n\nthe later part of the early medieval period, i.e. the period\n\nafter 900 A.D. and before 1200 A.D. The temples of this\n\nstyle are characterized by a distinctly imposing shikhara ,\n\nwhich is a tall and tapering spire over the garbha-griha, or\n\nsanctum sanctorum , which houses the main deity.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">10.   The Shikhara Amalaka: The developed Shikhara is like\n\na mountain with several tiers of subsidiary Shikharas , rising\n\none above the other and projecting partially from the main\n\nShikhara. The Shikharas are crowned with a very distinctive\n\ncircular piece of stone, called amalaka, which is shaped like a\n\ncogged wheel, with bead-like mouldings along the periphery.\n\nIt is so very typical of the temples of northern India that no\n\none in the world who knows even a little about the Hindu\n\ntemples can cast any doubt about its position in the temple\n\nstructure. There are two examples of half- amalakas, in the\n\npresent hoard of objects, evidently used on the top of the\n\nsubsidiary Shikharas, called Shikhara of karmas , i.e. fring\n\nspires.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_212\">11.   The Shikhara Jala : The second most significant find is\n\nthe curvilinear part of the jala mouldings present on the\n\nShikharas.   It is beautifully decorated with scrolls. It also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                 218</span>\n\nbelongs exclusively to the north Indian temples of the period\n\nafter 900 A.D. since the technique of its carving involves the\n\nmethod of scooping out the areas around the floral elements\n\nso that the art-motifs are formed with surface absolutely\n\nplain. It is called &#x27;Stencil&#x27; technique.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">12.   The Capital:      The third most noteworthy sculptured\n\npiece of stone in this collection is a rectangular capital of a\n\npillar with beautiful mouldings in the form of highly stylized\n\nlotus petals arranged as narrow parallel strips carved in low\n\nrelief around the capital.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">13.   The Cornice : The fourth example of stone sculptures\n\nbelongs to the most characteristic members of the Nagara\n\nstyle of temples - it is called Chhadya, and in Hindi Chhajja,\n\nsun-shade, where the straight wall over the high plinth meets\n\nthe base of the Shikhara.        It is carved and shaped like\n\nrectangular Mangalore tiles to serve not only as a sun-shade\n\nbut also allow the rain water to run off quickly and protect the\n\nstructure. It is a corner-stone of the cornice.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">14.   Floral freize : There is one frieze of continuous leaf-\n\nmolding which decorates one of the top lines of the high\n\nplinth of the temple.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">15.

It is\n\ndecorated with a meandering floral design, carved in &#x27;Stencil&#x27;\n\nstyle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">16.      Images of Vihnu&#x27;s Incarnations : There is also a\n\nfragment of a steel embellished with the most significant\n\nsculptures     of   a   number   of Vaishnavite     gods,   viz.   a\n\nChakrapurusha , i.e. a youthful male figure standing gracefully\n\nat an angle (tribhanga ) and holding vertically in the palm of\n\nthe right hand the characteristic wheel or chakra of Vishnu.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_222\">17.

It was found from a shallow mound called Nala,\n\nlocated some 200 metres away from the site of the above\n\nhoard of art and architectural pieces. Though Shiva&#x27;s head is\n\nnow lost, his hand holding a trishula , trident, is fully intact.\n\nSimilarly, although Parvati&#x27;s face is not extant, her hand from\n\nbehind Shiva&#x27;s neck is found resting on his right shoulder in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                               220</span>\n\nan embracing position.

Some of these rooms were just the store-\n\nrooms, practically closed quarters with very poor light and\n\nventilation. These objects of stone and metal were locked by\n\nthe U.P.

Apart from it, the khasra abadi\n\n     shows that the inhabitants of Janmasthan (sakna Janmasthan)\n\n     also owned other plots/sub-plots (vide khasra Nos. 203,\n\n     206,214) or owned musli (taproot) and imli (tamarind) trees\n\n     in the other plots (vide khasra Nos. 451-52)of the village.\n\n     This shows that the Janmasthan          complex was fairly\n\n     inhabited and that the mahants/bairagis of Janmasthan, with\n\n     a network of land-ownership in the village, had a sound\n\n     financial and social status. None of the khasra abadi Nos., as\n\n     mentioned above, parallel to the abadi Janmasthan of Khasra\n\n     kishtwar No.163, does mention the existence of any\n\n     &#x27;mosque&#x27;, though in the kaifiyat, they do mention the\n\n     prevalence of pacca graveyard (qabarqah pukhta), a few imli\n\n     (tamarind), musli (taproot) trees and makana (houses), etc.,\n\n     on the campus.

Even though the physical existence of\n\n      an extraneous structure believed to be &#x27;mosque&#x27; built by the\n\n      Mughal Emperor Babur at the Janmasthan site was\n\n      undeniable, most significantly, the revenue settlement maps\n\n      of 1861, 1893 and 1936-37 A.D. do not bear any indicate\n\n      only the Janmasthan at the site.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_265\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_266\">12.

As per Khasra\n\nbandobast and Khatauni documents, the portion of the\n\nJanmasthan area i.e., (the proper &#x27;Ram Janmabhoomi&#x27;/\n\n&#x27;Babari Masjid&#x27; land ) being under mahal nazul Sarkar,\n\ncomprises two khasra Nos., i.e, 163/1 and 163/2, with an\n\narea of 2 bighas -14 biswas and 2 biswas respectively. These\n\nare shown under habitation (abadi) and are vested in the\n\nsubordinate ownership and occupation of the Hindu Mahants\n\nRaghuar Das, Gopal Das and Thaurdwara Sita Ram.

The above map is significant in many a respect. In its list of\n\n      depicted symbols, it does not cover the symbol of a Shiwala\n\n      (temple ) or a mosque. But it does denote the symbols of\n\n      abadi, road, graveyards (qabaristan), pacca well, nature of\n\n      land (i.e., parti qadim ) and non-payment of lagan, etc. As\n\n      such, it shows khasra no.163/1 (i.e., the site of &#x27;Ram\n\n      Janamabhoomi&#x27;/ &#x27;Baburi Masjid&#x27;) with habitation (abadi)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                  239</span>\n\n      and a pacca well in then north-eastern direction.

Above all, most significantly, there is no symbol of a\n\n      graveyard (Qabaristan) in any of the sub-plots of Khasra No.\n\n      163 of the Janmasthan complex, though, there are symbols\n\n      of graveyards in the neighbouring plots, i.e., Khasra Nos.\n\n      161,158, 56-57, etc. Even        though earlier in the Khasra\n\n      kishtwar No.163       of the 1861      settlement relating to\n\n      Janmasthan, the column(No.16)         of the general remarks\n\n      (kaifiyat) as well as the khasra abadi Nos. 444, 452 of the\n\n      same settlement do mention about the existence of graveyard\n\n      (gabargah) in the complex of Janmasthan, it is well\n\n      confirmed by the above map that by 1894-95 A.d., there is\n\n      no graveyard inany of the sub-plots of Janmasthan complex,\n\n      Later on, this position is reiterated by the 1344 F/1936-37\n\n      AD.

A note of caution is necessary with regard to the alleged\n\n      Khasra and map maintained by the Nazul department in the\n\n      Faizabad Collect-orate which is relied upon by the plaintiffs\n\n      of Suit No.12 of 1961 (now O.O.<a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_56\">S. 4</a> of 1989 before the\n\n      Lucknow Bench       of the Allahabad High Court), Sunni\n\n      Central Board of Waqf and others Vs Gopal Singh Visharad\n\n      and others.

It is noticeable that the plot\n\n      numbers given in the plaint of that Suit are based on the said\n\n      khasra abadi of the Nazul department. There is no Fard\n\n      Mutabigat comparative table between the plot numbers\n\n      given in the khasra abadi of the Nazul department and the\n\n      Khasra abadi maintained by the revenue Department of the\n\n      Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_275\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_276\">20.   In fact, the purpose of the Nazul (Municipal) survey and the\n\n      map prepared in 1931 A.D. was to identify the\n\n      encroachments made on the Nazul property. Such a survey\n\n      may cannot take precedence over the regularly conducted\n\n      revenue settlement operations and the maps prepared\n\n      thereupon, especially when the title to land is involved. In its\n\n      order dated 10.1.1990, the High Court directed the Board of\n\n      Revenue, U.P. Sate, to survey the site and submit report\n\n      accordingly with the assistance of the Municipal records and\n\n      such other records which it considered to be useful and in its\n\n      further order dated 23.5.1990 directed it to execute the\n\n      commission and locate the plots with reference to documents\n\n      on record only. The commissioner, Shri J.P. Srivastava,\n\n      appointed by the Board of Revenue for the purpose,\n\n      submitted his report on 25.07.1990 wherein he had located\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                 242</span>\n\n      the disputed property with reference to the Nazul map of\n\n      1931, even though he conceded that the Nazul map and the\n\n      settlement maps were on different scales and that it was not\n\n      possible to juxtapose the two maps and prepare Fard\n\n      Mutabiqat and correspond the Nazul. Khasra numbers with\n\n      the settlement khasra numbers. Thereupon, the Hon&#x27;ble court\n\n      passed another order directing the commissioner to submit\n\n      supplementary report surveying and locating the property\n\n      with reference to settlement maps of 1861 and 1937 A.D.\n\n      The commissioner submitted his supplementary report dated\n\n      8.2.1991.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_277\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_278\">21.

Such an act on the part of the commissioner for having\n\n      accepted the Plaintiff&#x27;s map and adopting it as his own\n\n      official map for submission to the court was characterized by\n\n      the latter as &quot;wholly unwarranted&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_279\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_280\">22.

After the first war of\nIndependence in 1857 (mentioned as &#x27;Mutiny&#x27; in the Report\nof the District Waqf Commissioner, Faizabad, dated\n16.09.38), the British Government, apparently on political\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                          254</span>\n\ngrounds because of the loyalty and services rendered by the\nland lord / pattidari family of the village Shahanwa,\ncontinued the above mentioned amount in cash but from\n1863 -64 A.D. onwards, the British Government considered\nit expedient to commute this cash payment into a conditional\n(mashrut) muafi land grant-a process which was completed\nby 1870 A.D. when, as explained further, the revenue-free\nland grant along with superior proprietor rights was\nbestowed on Mohammad Asghar and Mohammad Afzal Ali\nin the villages of Sholapur and Bhaharanpur but not in kot\nRam Chander were the Janmasthan &#x27;Mosque&#x27; stood.

Later on the sanad issued by the Chief\nCommissioner clarifies that the cash nankar of Rs. 302/3as/6\npies received by Rajab Ali and Muhammad Asghar as rent-\nfree tenure in Village Shahanwa under the former\nGovernment (Nawabi Rule) was being maintained ( as\nmuafi land in the village of Bhuraipur and Sholapur) under\nthe authority of the Governor General-in- Council so long as\nthe object for which the grant had been made was kept up on\nthe conditions that the assignees would surrender all the\n(previous) sanads, title deeds, and other documents relative\nto the grant in question and above all, they and their\nsuccessors would &quot; strictly perform all the duties of land\nholders in matters of Police and any Military or Political\nService that may be required of them by the Authorities ...\nIf any one of these conditions was broken by Rajub Ally or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                           256</span>\n\nMohammad Usgar or their successors the grant will be\nimmediately resumed&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_309\">      A serious controversy about the nature of the land\ngrant in the village of Bhuraipur and Sholapur earlier given\nby the British Government to the assignees (khattib /\nmuazzan) which was also in a way connected with the &#x27;\nBaburi Mosque&#x27; at kot Ram Chander, Ajodhya arose in 938\nA.D. The District Waqf Commissioner, Faizabad (Eligible-\nS.M.Omais) vide his decision dated 16.09.38 while\ninterpreting the sanad earlier given by the British\nGovernment to the assigness (khattib / muazzan) maintained\nthat even though the grant was conditional on the\nperformance of duties of land holders in the matter of\nPolice, Military or Political Service, etc., the object for\nwhich the grant was made was the maintenance of the\n&#x27;Mosque&#x27;. He also stressed that the original object of the\nstate grant of Emperor Babur and Nawab Saadat Ali Khan\nwas also continued in the sanad by the British Government\nafter the &#x27;Mutiny&#x27;, i.e., for the maintenance of the &#x27;Mosque&#x27;\nand further that the nankar was to be enjoyed by the grantee\nfor so long as the object of the grant, i.e., the &#x27;Mosque&#x27;, was\nin existence. In view of this, the Commissioner gave a ruling\nto the effect &#x27;clearly then the grant to Mohd. Zaki must be\nregarded as waqf, the purpose of which is the maintenance\nof the religious building known as the &#x27;Baburi Mosque&#x27;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_310\">      Muhammad Zaki, the (khattib /muazzan) ( also\nmutawalli in case of waqf) raised serious objections to the\ndecision of the Commissioner, waqf Board. He maintained\nthat the particular grant of land in Sholapur and Bhuraipur\nhad been made by the British Government which was a non-\nMuslim body and hence the grant could not be taken as a\nmuslim waqf. Moreover, as per sanad, it was conditional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                           257</span>\n\ngrant subject to the performance of military, police and other\nduties, etc., and in case of non-fulfillment of the latter\nservices, the grant could not be regarded as a Kuslim waqf.\nHe contended that after the annexation of Awadh, the British\nGovernment in lieu of cash nankar and madad-i-maash (as\ninherited from the Nawabi period ) granted land to\nMuhammad Asghar and Muhammad Afzal and in the first\nRegular Settlement (1861), it was entered in the latter&#x27;s\nmalkiyat (ownership). Thereafter, on February 03, 1870\nAD., Muhammad Asghar and Muhammad Afzal got a\ndecree in their favour whereby they were entered in the\nrevenue records as superior proprietors and possessors in\npossession of the property ( malik-i-ala qabiz wa mutsarif\njadaid) and since then, their descendants have continued\nwith the same status. As such, the property falling in the\ncategory of superior proprietorship ( malkiyat-i-ala) did not\nfall in the definition of the Muslim waqf. He further\ncontended even though, the descendants of Muhammad\nasghar, etc., had been bearing the expenses for the essential\nitems of expenditure for the maintenance of the &#x27;masjid\nBaburi&#x27;, the family property was outside the jurisdiction of\nthe Muslim waqf Act, No.12,1936 as the major amount of\nthe income had been spent by them on their own\nsubsistence as madad-i-maash, etc This had always been\nrecorded in the khewat records as such.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_311\">      Apart from the above arguments, Muhammad Zaki\nalways maintained that Sayed Abdul Baqui, the First\nmuazzan/khattib of the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; appointed by Babur was a\nShia and his descendants all through the ages, till date\nbelong to the Shia sect and could not be coerced to accept\nthe spurious contention that the &#x27;Baburi Mosque&#x27; might be\nput under the control of the Sunni Waqf Board. This position\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                           258</span>\n\nwas taken by the (khattib/muazzan) family before the\nDistrict Waqf Commissioner, Faizabad (1941). However, the\nlatter&#x27;s Report (dated February 08,1941) simply reproduced\nand reiterated the position earlier taken by the District Waqf\nCommissioner in 1938 A.D. on the contrary, Muhammad\nZaki and Malik Hussain, etc., the (khattib/muazzan) vide\ntheir Application dated 26th September, 1943 AD serial\nno.26, submitted to the Sunni Central Board of Waqf, U.P.,\nLucknow, took a clear stand that there was no waqf for their\nproperties in the villages of Buharanpur and Sholepur with\ntotal annual income of Rs. 528/14 as (Rupees Five hundred\nTwenty Eight and Annas Forteen only, i.e., Rupees Three-\nhundred-fifty-one and Annas six (Rs. 351/6 as ) from the\nvillage of Bahoranpur and Rs. 177/8as (Rupees One-\nhundred, Seventy -Seven and annas eight) from Sholepur.\nThey contended that earlier they had been bestowed grant\n(atiya) by Shahenshah Babur and Nawab Saadat Ali Khan\nand in the present case ( i.e. land/income from\nBaharanpur/Sholepur) they were strictly governed by the\nsanad nankar granted by the British Government. They\nfurther maintained that the khewatdara (i.e., the revenue\nauthorities/ records) did not recognize this as waqf and that\nit had been recorded in the revenue records only as nankar\nmuafi. Of course, in the past they had been looking after the\nwhite washing, lighting arrangements of the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; and\nas   well   making    payment    of   the   salaries   of   the\nMuazzans/Imams, etc., Malik Hussain, s/o Syed Muhammad\nZaki in his detailed letter No.5607 dated 20.11.43/22.11.43\nin response to the Secretary, sunni Waqf Board &#x27;s\ncommunication vide no. 5272 dated 27 October, 1943,\nclarified his relation with the &#x27;Baburi Masjid&#x27;. He\ncategorically maintained (vide para 5) that there was neither\nany waqf for the &#x27;masjid&#x27;, nor there had ever been a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                           259</span>\n\nMutawalli for it. Further, that his family has had muafi land\n(in the villages of Buharanpur and Sholepur) and being the\nlambardar ( head ) of the property and being ( good)\nMuslims, it had been looking after the repair etc. of the same\nand that he, too, as lambardar had been discharging this\nobligation since 17 February, 1943 . He stated that the\nexpenditure incurred in this regad was from his family\nproperty which was in muafi nankar and not in waqf (Vide\nparas 8-9 ) . In this letter, he also gave some details about\nthe items of white washing , repair and floor carpet etc\nrelating to the &#x27;Masjid&#x27; and some expenditure incurred in\nthis regard since October, 1941. ( Vide paras 2-3, 10-11).\nNot with standing all this, the legal tussle continued and in\n1945   A.D. it was considered that the muazzan/khattib\nfamily ( At this time kalab Hussain, the brother of the\ndeceased Muhammad Zaki)had been all through Shias, even\nthough the prayers in the past had been offered both by the\nShias and the Sunnis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_312\">        It is equally important to note that during the 1930&#x27;s\n of the 20th century, as per statement of Muhammad Zaki,\n the Muazzan / Khattib even though he was looking after\n some of the essential items of the maintenance of the\n &#x27;Mosque&#x27;(i.e., whitewashing, lighting and flooring, etc.),\n from the income of the nankar /muafi grant held as\n malkiyat in perpetuity, he did not spend any money on the\n repairs of the &#x27;Mosque&#x27;in the aftermath of the riot in\n Ayodhya in 1934 A.D. The Collectorate and the P.W.D.\n records of the District Faizabad bear out the fact that the\n entire expenditure for the repairs of the &#x27;Mosque&#x27;was met\n by the District administration/PWD. Significantly, in the\n waqf records of the Sunni/ Shia Boards of waqf or the\n Collectorate/UP. Government Records, there is no mention\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                           260</span>\n\n of any Mutawalli or waqf from the income of which the\n structure of the &#x27; Baburi Mosque&#x27;might have been rebuil\n valuable revenue free grant of land held by Muhammad\n Zaki etc. in the villages Burhanpur and Sholepur allegedly\n a attached for the maintenance and upkeep of the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_313\">      An elementary knowledge of the Mugal agrarian\nsystem/ Nawahi phase and the British administration in\nIndia as we as well as as understanding of the nature of\nvarious categories of land grants for administrative purpose\nor to the religious institutions would clearly show that there\nhas always been a basic difference between nankar (for\npersonal maintenance) and waqf. In this regards, the\ncontentions of the grantees, i.e. Muhammad Asghar, etc. 19th\nCentury) and Mohd. Azkil Kalab Hussain/Malik Hussain,\netc. have been absolutely correct and tenable that their\nproperties in Shahanwa/Burhanpur/Sholepur could not be\ncategorized as waqf. As such, they do not show any waqf\nrelating to the alleged &#x27;Baburi Masjid. Even in the Judicial\nrecords of the various suits pending before the Lucknow\nBench of Allahabad High Court, there is no registration of\nany waqf having any connection with the alleged &#x27;Baburi\nMasjid&#x27; as per records of the Sunni Central Waqf Board.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_314\">      After the above mentioned enquiry by the District\nWaqf Commissioner, his report as prescribed under the U.P.\nMuslims Waqfs Act, 1936 along with the lists of the Shia\nWaqfs and Sunni Waqfs was forwarded by the U.P.\nGovernment to both the Shia Central Board of Waqfs and\nSunni Central Board of Waqfs as each of the two Waqf\nBoards were to publish the report along with their respective\nlists in Official Gazette, under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 5</a>\nof the Act. In the Shia -Sunni legal Tussle that followed, the\nSunni Central Board of Waqf claimed that it was published\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                           261</span>\n\nas a Sunni &#x27;Mosque&#x27; in the U.P.

Muslims waqf Act ( XIII of 1925 ) as\nwell as by the Sunni Central Board of Waqf, U.P. and also\nassuming the fact that the same had been published in the\nGovernment Gazette dated 26.02.1944, the Shia Central\nBoard of Waqf U.P., as Plaintiffs in the Regular Civil Suit\nNo.29 of 1945, sought a declaration that the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; was a\nShia Waqf together with the idgah attached to it at Jaipa\nNala, Ayodhya, and village Behrampur, Pargana Haveli and\n20bighas odd land, known as sholepuri grove, in mahal\nBharanapur, in Tehsil and District Faizabad. As a matter of\nfact, when face to face with the issue that under the law, the\n&#x27;Mosque&#x27; had to be essentially attached with either of the\nWaqf Boards, i.e. Sunny/Shia, the Waqf Board in the plaint\ncame upwith the contention that Sayid Abdul Baqt ( Mir\nBagi), the builder of the mosque&#x27;, in 1528 AD, during the\nreign of the Mughal Empror Babur, was a Shia and that\nbeing the founder-waqf as well the first Mutawalli of the\n&#x27;Mosque&#x27;, followed since then by a lineage of successive\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                           262</span>\n\nMutawallias    till date (1945)with kalab Husain as the\nMutawali in 1945 after the death (1944) of his brother\nMohammad Zaki and as such, the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; was a Shia waqf\n. Even though, as already stated, earlier Mohammad\nZki/Kalab Husain in the official documents submitted to the\noffice of the District / Commissioner of Waqf, had always\nmaintained that there had been no Mutawalli shince the\nbuilding of the mosque as they were mearly khatibs and\nmuezzins looking after the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; by meeting some of the\nincidental charges from the income of their personal\nproprietary lands in the village of Sholapuri and Behrampur\nwhich were not in waqf now under the compelling\ncircumstances, with a view to tide over the technical, legal\ndifficulty and to get the &#x27;Mosque&#x27;legally declared as a Shia\nWaqf, it was contended for the first time that the cash nankar\n(Rs. 302/3 as /6 paisa) bestowed during the Nawabi period\nand the properties in Sholepur and Behranpur granted by the\nBritish Government , as revenue- free grants , confirmed by\na decree in proprietary rights, revenue free now passed in\nfavour of hereditary mutawallies who since then had been\nobserving the terms of the grant and filing accounts before\nthe S.D.O.\n\n      It was also claimed by the plaintiffs i.e. the Shia\nCentral Board of Waqf, that its mutawalli was entitled to the\nsupervision of the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; as it was Shia Waqf and that the\nChief Commissioner of Waqf had not sent the list of Sunni\nWaqf to them even though the latter had included the\n&#x27;Mosque&#x27; in its list supposed to have been based on the\npublication in the Gazette.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_317\">      The Sunni Central Board of Waqf, in its defence\nstatement asserted that the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; was founded by\nEmperor Babur who was a Sunni and that its pheshhawar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">                           263</span>\n\nkhatibs and muezzins had been of the same sect until much\nlater on, one of the phes hawars / mutawallis in the pedigree\nlist i.e. Mohamad Afzal became a convert to Shia during the\nclosing peiod of the reign of the kings of Awadh, who were\nShias. It was also asserted that the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; had always\nbeen used by the sunnis of Ayodhya for saying their Friday\nprayer and the Idgah as noted above, was quite independent\nof the &#x27;Mosque&#x27; and was similarly used by the Sunnis for\ntheir Id and Baqrid prayers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_318\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1203298\" id=\"span_173\">In the continued litigation between the above two\nparties, the Court of the Civil Judge, Faizabad, which tried\nthecase as a preliminary issue, vide-judgment dated\n21.04.1966 held that &quot; no valid notification under Section\n5(1) of U.P. Muslim Waqf Act No.XIII of 1936 was ever\nmade&quot; relating to the specific disputed property. As such, the\njudge made it clear that the allege notification of in\n26.02.1994 did not specify the property in suit as waqf\nproperty and that it was of no legal effect. This finding\nbecame final between the two parties. Later on, in the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/1203298/\" id=\"a_59\">Gulam Abbas V.

As a matter of fact, as per the\noriginal documents, the entire complex of Janmasthan is\ncovered under khasra No.163 with 9 Plots, with total area of\n5 bighas and 4 biswas. However, under column No.16 of\nKaifiyat, it is stated that in the area of Janamasthan, there is\none pacca well, three whose number is recorded in Kahasra\nabadi and Khana grave yard ( qabristhan). As district from\nthe khasra kishtwar, in khasra abadi Nos. 431-456, (as\nrecorded corresponding to No.163 of the former) shows\nabadi (Population) in this area. They do not mention the\nexistence of any &#x27;Mosque&#x27;, though, in the kaifiyat they\nmention the prevalence of pacca graveyards imli threes and\nmakans (houses ) etc. in the campus. For 4 bighas and 13\nbiswas, the superior ownership of the land has been declared\nin the name of Sarkar Bahadur Nazul ( Government), and\nvide Khatauni No. I, 1878 11 biswas have been shown a\nmuafi under mahal Azahar Hussain. In the settlement of\n1301 Fasli/1893 A.D, in the khasra kishtwar, the same\nkhasra number (163) remains, though the entire area is\nshown under 5 plots instead of 9 as previously in the 1861\nsettlement report Both in the khata Khatauni/khewat the\nHindu Mahants of Janmasthan have been shown with\nsubordinate proprietay rights as malikan-i- matehit along\nwith their respective shares. But later on these nos. undergo\na change during the Fasli 1344/45 /1936-37 AD Settlement\nReport but the position of1861 persists even in later\nSettlements effected from time to time during the 19th and\n20th centuries. It is also clear that the area on which the\nstructure of the &#x27; Baburi Masjid&#x27; stood is a part of the\nJanmasthan and under the subordinate ownership (malik\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                          265</span>\n\nmataiht ) of a Hindu Mahant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_320\">      This position was inherited by the early British\nadministration from the earlier records of the Nawabi and\nthe Mugal periods. However, in the Settlement Record of\n1861 of the Mahafazkhana, certain later alternations have\nbeen made wherein the name of Jama Masjid and the word\nmuafi has been inserted. In Plot No.163/1 the words\nJamaiMasjid , uafi and Azhar Hussain under coloumns\nNo.2,3 and 4 respectively have been added. But the copies\nof the same document prepared during the same year\navailable at the Tehsil office wherein only the word Jamai\nmasjid has been added in column No.2 but not muafi and\nAzhar Hussain in column nos. 3 and 4 as against Muhafaz\nKhanna Report clearly prove that the later additions are\ninterpolations, done perhaps during the past few decades of\nthe controversy. This is also confirmed by the fact that the\nKhasra Kishtwar records of the second Revenue Settlement\neffected in the year 1301 Fasli (1893 A.D.) do not carry out\nsuch alternations or additions. These records still show the\narea on which &#x27;Baburi Masjid&#x27; had been earlier constructed\nas forming a part of the Janmasthan complex and there is no\nmention of any &#x27;Mosque&#x27; nor any land assigned to it in\nmuafi. It is evident that interpolations in the settlement\nReport of 1861 of the District Record Office ( Muhafz\nKhanna), Faizabad have been done for a few other khasra\nkishtwar nos. as well. All this needs a through probe on\nscientific basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_321\">      As already stated, according to the revenue Settlement\neffected in 1861 AD, the total area covered by khasra no.163\nrelating to Janmasthan has 9 distinct plots. There have been\ntwo more settlement operations since then. However, in the\nrevenue settlements effected from time to time, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                          266</span>\n\nkhasra/khewat/khata Khatauni Number as well as the nos. of\nplots undergo a change and there are also adjustments with\nthe neighboring plots. But the table of equivalent past\nnumbers and parts thereof along with the current (ha 1)\nnumbers Fard Mutabaqat )is always appended and forms a\npart of the Settlement Report. In the latest revenue records\nof 1397-99 Fasli/1989-92, the erstwhile Janmasthan\ncomplex has been shown in four khasra Nos. , i.e.,\n159,160-,146, and 147. The major portion of the Janmasthan\ncomplex comprising Ram Janmabhoomi, the so-called\nBaburi Masjid as well as the new Janmasthan falls under\nKhasra Nos. 159,146 (vide khata Khewat No.35) and 147 R\nwherein the names of the Mahants alongwith the areas in\ntheir ownership have been recorded. Only some portion of\nthe complex falls under No.160 which too is shown under\nmahal Nazul Sarkar. In brief , Janmabhoomi/ &#x27; Baburi\nMasjid&#x27; have been recorded under No.159 and 160. The\nentire khasra No.159 has been entred in the ownership of &#x27;\nShri Danesh Dhari Bhagwan Bara Asthan, Ajodhya&#x27; whereas\nsome portion falling in khasra no.160 has been recorded in\nthe ownership of Sarkar Nazul.

Such a survey\nmap cannot take precedence over the regularly conducted\nrevenue settlement operations and the maps prepared\nthereupon, especially when the title to land is involved. In\nits order dated 10.01.1990, the High Court directed the\nBoard of Revenue, U.P. State, to survey the site and make\nreport with the assistance of the municipal records and such\nother records which it considered to be useful and in its\nfurther order dated 23.5.1990 directed it to execute the\ncommission and locate the plots with reference to\ndocuments on records only. The commissioner , Shri J.P.\nSrivastava, appointed by the board of revenue for the\npurpose, submitted his report on 25.07.1990 wherein he had\nlocated the disputed property with reference to the Nazul\nmap of 1931, even though he conceded that the Nazul map\nand the settlement maps were on different scales and that it\nwas not possible to juxtapose the two maps and prepared\nfard Mutabiqat and corresponde the Nazul khasra numbers\nwith the settlement khasra numbers. Thereupon, the Hon&#x27;ble\ncourt passed another order directing the commissioner to\nsubmit supplementary report surveying and locating the\nproperty with reference to settlement maps of 1861 and\n1937 A.D. The commissioner submitted his supplementary\nreport dated 8.2.1991 appended by 14 Annexures, to which\nserious objections were made by the Defendants.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                                  269</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_327\">             In fact, the commissioner instead of surveying the\n      land of his own had &#x27; Baburi Mosque&#x27; , grave yards, the\n      shilanyas site and various other plots, Such an act on the\n      part of the Commissioner for having accepted the Plaintiff&#x27;s\n      map and adopting it as his own official map for submission\n      to the court was characterized by the latter as &#x27;wholly\n      unwarranted&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_328\">             Having gone through the pros and cons of the entire\n      case, Hon&#x27;ble court in its judgment on 8.8.91, even though it\n      refrained from calling the commissioner&#x27;s report as\n      &#x27;motivate&#x27;, described it as &quot;absurd&quot;.

Had it been during Aurangzib&#x27;s reign, the\nbook would have been titled after the name of Aurangzib rather\nthan of Bahadurshah. According to the Foreign Department\nPolitical Consultations, December 28, 1855, No. 450, the Prime\nMinister of Wajid &#x27;Ali Shah &#x27;referred to a book which existed in\nthe King&#x27;s library written in the reign of Bahadurshah about the\nyear 1707 A.D. which contained an account of the masajid at\nHanumangarhi¹. The Persian text under examination des contain,\ninter alia, an account of the mosque built at Hanuman&#x27;s abode\n(later named Hanumangadhi). In fact, while quoting the above\npassage from the work, Mirza Jan prefaces it with a special\nmention of that mosque thus; In short, these four mosques [Babari\nmosque, Ram Darbar mosque, fort mosque, and Hanumangadhi\nmosque] built by the rulers of the past were situated at Ayodhya\nlike four pillars of the faith. And there is clear description thereof\nin the books of history, particularly (existence of) the\nHanumangadhi mosque is established by a passage of the Shifah-I\nShahi ( i.e. Sahifah-iChihal Nasa&quot;ih-I Bahadurshahi), which\nBahadurshah&#x27; Alamgir&#x27;s daughter has written ( comprising ) forty\nsermons... ² This creates a strong presumption in four of the view\nthat it this book which the prime Minister had in mind.

But the entire account is conspicuous by its\nabsence in at least the 1981 edition. I possess a Xerox\ncopy of the last, 1981 edition as well as page 40onlyof an\nearlier edition.

The author says: &#x27;when a boy, Sultan Babar, who belong\nthe family of Timur, came from Kabul to the town of Awadh in\ndisguise, donning the garb of an ascetic. Those days, the town of\nAwadh was under the Sutanate of Sikandar Lodi and the place was\na (Second) Capital of the Sultanate. Sultan Babar paid a reverential\nvisit to His Holiness Shah Jalal and Sire Musa&#x27; Ashiqan and\nsolicited occult favour from them, so that the ancestral Sultanate of\nHindustan might come into his hands thanks to the blessings of\nthose saints. Prince Babnar took leave of those personages, went to\nKabul, mustered an army, brought it to Hindustan, and fought with\nSultan Sikandar Lodhi (sic) at the (battle) field of Panipat¹. A little\nlater the author adds: &#x27;Accordingly, in fulfillment of the pledge\nkind Babar had taken before those saints, Babar appointed Mir\nBaqi to it and got a magnificent mosque constructed... ² Here the\npledge taken by Babar has not been specified. Avadh-Vasi Lala\nSita Ram uses the original edition of the work, from which it\nappears that the latest, edition leaves out the saints&#x27; reaction to\nBabar&#x27;s request, which is to this effect:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">   1. &quot;Sultan Babar ki jo Amir Timur ki nasi se apne bachpan ke\n      zamqnah meih khu fiyyah ( awr par libas tabdil kar ke\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                 281</span>\n\n      faqiron ki (arah Kabul se - shahr-i Awadh mein qya.

One of the courtiers brought it\nto the royal ears that a qalandar from among sages is standing in\nthe court feasting on the elegance of the sultan. Sultan Sikandar\nbade some of his courtiers bring him in.

And the few Hindus who\nremained safe from the hands of the Muslims became the slaves of\nIslam, began to pay kharaj, became sudbdued and dross of\ninfidelity, they cleared up Faizabad and Awadh also from the filth\nof false belief, inasmuch as it is a great place of worship and was\nthe capital of Rama&#x27;s father. Here they broke the temples and left\nno stone-hearted idol intact. Where there was a big temple, there\nthey got a big mosque constructed, and, where there was a small\npavilion, there they erected a plain camp mosque/enclosure\nAccordingly, what a majestic mosque Babar Shah has got\nconstructed in 923 AH.

He demolished a old Hindu Temple of Mahakal,\n\ndestroyed statute of Vikrmajeet and took away Brass Idols of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">                               289</span>\n\nHindu Gods and placed at the foot step of stairs of a Mosque at\n\nOld Delhi and asked the people to pass through these Idols of\n\nHindu Gods. After Iltutmish, Balban ruled parts of India. He also\n\nattacked Hindus and Hindu Temples in 1254 A.D. In 1321 A.D.\n\nJalaluddin Khilji attacked Fort of Ran Thambore and enroute he\n\ndamaged and demolished several Hindu Temples. In 1292 A.D.,\n\nhis nephew Allauddin Khilji attacked Bhelsa and he too\n\ndemolished a large number of Hindu Temples and thrown idols of\n\nHindu Gods. He also proposed to make a Minar taller than the\n\nQutubminar by using materials of demolished Hindu Temples. He\n\nalso ordered his cousin Ulugh Khan to demolish reconstructed\n\nSomnath Temple of Gujrat, who also damaged and demolished a\n\nnumber of Hindu Temples. He also attacked Ujjain and\n\ndemolished several Hindu Temples at Ujjain. Like wise, he\n\nattacked Malva and Chittaur (Rajasthan) where he demolished a\n\nlarge number of Hindu Temples.

Taimur attacked India in 1399 A.D. and started war against\n\nHindus on religious basis. He demolished a large number of\n\nHindu Temples. In 1392 A.D., Muzaffarshah, Governor of Gujrat\n\ndemolished reconstructed Somnath Temple again and constructed\n\na Mosque within the Temple, but after some time Hindus\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">                               290</span>\n\nreconstructed same Temple. In 1401 A.D., Ahmad, grand son of\n\nMuzaffarshah, who took over as Governor of Gujrat appointed a\n\nDaroga (Inspector) for demolishing all Hindu Temples of Gujrat.\n\nIn 1415 A.D., Ahmad attacked and demolished Sidhpur Temple\n\n(Rudra Mahalaya) and in its place he constructed a Mosque. From\n\n1389 A.D. to 1431 A.D., Sikandar (Boot Shikan) attacked and\n\ndemolished a large number of Hindu Temples and idols, who was\n\nknown for his pleasure by breaking Idols of Hindus. Between\n\n1389 A.D. to 1431 A.D., he demolished Temples of Martand,\n\nVishnu, Ishan, Chakrvarti and Tripureshwar. There were no places\n\nin his Empire where his Mantri Suha had not demolished Hindu\n\nTemples. Babar, who established Moghul Empire, attacked India\n\nand demolished Ram Janma Bhumi Temple at Ayodhya and\n\nconstructed a Mosque on the same place. After Babar, Humiaun\n\nruled India. It is described in history that Chchatri Temple at\n\nZehanabad was demolished by Humaun and in place of Temple a\n\nMosque was constructed. During the period of Jehangir Sikh Guru\n\nSri Arjun Singhjee was killed, Hindu Durg Temple of Kangra and\n\ncows were slaughtered in the Temple. Shahjehan got demolished\n\nabout 76 Temples of Benaras in 1633 A.D. by ordering to\n\ndemolish all the newly constructed Hindu Temples. Demolition of\n\nHindu Temples by Aurangjeb is also well known to everyone.\n\nWhen he was only Prince, he demolished Chintamani Temple at\n\nGujrat and in place of Temple he constructed Qubbatul Islam\n\nMosque in 1645 A.D. In 1648 A.D., he sent Mir Jumla to Kooch\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                                   291</span>\n\nBihar, who demolished several Hindu Temples there and\n\nconstructed Mosaues in place of Hindu Temples.

The list of\n\nfacts mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_77\">section 57</a> of which the Court can take judicial\n\nnotice is not exhaustive and indeed the purpose of the section is to\n\nprovide that the court shall take judicial notice of certain facts\n\nrather than judicial notice. Recognition of facts without formal\n\nproof is a matter of expediency and no one has ever questioned the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                                 300</span>\n\nneed and wisdom of accepting the existence of matters which are\n\nunquestionably within public knowledge.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_400\">      Shutting the judicial eye to the existence of such facts and\n\nmatters is in a sense an insult to commonsense and would tend to\n\nreduce the judicial process to a meaningless and wasteful ritual.\n\nNo Court therefore insists on formal proof, by evidence, of\n\nnotorious facts of history, past or present. The date of poll, the\n\npassing away of a man of eminence and events that have\n\nrocked the nation need no proof and are judicially noticed.\n\nJudicial notice, in such matters, takes the place of proof and is\n\nof equal force. In fact, as a means of establishing notorious and\n\nwidely known facts it is superior to formal means of proof.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_401\">      The list of facts mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_78\">section 57</a> of the Evidence Act\n\nof which the Court can take judicial notice is not exhaustive and\n\nthe purpose of the section is to provide that the Court shall take\n\njudicial notice of certain facts rather than exhaust the category of\n\nfacts of which the Court may in appropriate cases take judicial\n\nnotice.

These authorities are\n\nsufficient proof of the general Hindu Law prevailing over large\n\ntracts of country and populous communities. Any body living\n\namong them must be taken to fall under those general rules of\n\nlaw, unless he can show some valid local, tribal or family custom\n\nto the contrary. In order to bring a case under any rule of law <a href=\"/doc/1311406/\" id=\"a_79\">laid\n\ndown by</a> recognized authority for Hindus generally, it is        not\n\nnecessary to give evidence of actual events to show that in point of\n\nfact the people subject to that general law regulate their lives by\n\nit. Special custom may be pleaded by way of exception, which it is\n\nproper to prove by evidence of what actually is done. There is one\n\nessential feature in the operation of customs which necessarily\n\ndifferentiates them from the operation of Acts of Legislature. In\n\nthe case of laws enacted by the Legislature, Courts have to take\n\njudicial notice not only of the rules but also of those facts which\n\nare necessary for showing that they have the force of law, such\n\nfacts consisting of the proceedings of the legislative body. In the\n\ncase of customs, the facts showing that they have the force of law\n\nand that they govern the parties or the properties concerned\n\ninclude the fact that the alleged rules of conduct have been\n\nuniformly followed by the parties concerned of the community to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                 302</span>\n\nwhich the parties belong. This fact is one of which the Courts\n\ncannot take judicial notice, unless it has been so often proved in\n\nthe Courts as to make further proof unnecessary. Thus, the Courts\n\nmay take judicial notice of a custom if it is generally prevalent\n\namong a certain class of people or is well established by long\n\nusage, e.g. a customary right of privacy prevailing in Oudh. When\n\nthe existence of a custom is generally known and judicially\n\nrecognized it is necessary to prove it by specific evidence. Where\n\na custom is repeatedly brought to the notice of the Courts of a\n\ncountry, the Courts may hold that custom to be introduced into the\n\nlaw without the necessity of proof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_405\">      The privy Council in Raja Rajendra Narainv. Kumar\n\nGangananda, AIR 1925 PC 213: 1925 MWN 549: 89 IC 737, held\n\nthat after the existence of a custom for some years has been proved\n\nby direct evidence, it can only, as a rule, be shown to be\n\nimmemorial by hearsay evidence and it is for this reason that such\n\nan evidence is allowable as an explanation to the general rule. In\n\nD.C. Bara Banki v. Receiver of the Estate of Choudhry, AIR 1928\n\nPC 202: 32 CWN 1120: 53 IA 303, it has been held that breach of\n\na custom in a particular instance need not destroy it for all times.\n\nIn Effuah Amissahv. Effuah Krabah, AIR 1936 PC 147: 162 IC\n\n461: 44 MLW 73, it was held that material customs must be proved\n\nin the first instance by calling witness acquainted with them until a\n\nparticular custom has, by frequent proof in the court, become so\n\nnotorious that the courts take judicial notice of it. A custom cannot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                 303</span>\n\nbe extended by logical process. In Saraswativ. Jagadambalal, AIR\n\n1953 SC 201, it has been held that oral evidence as to instances,\n\nwhich can be proved by documentary evidence, cannot be fairly\n\nrelied upon to establish custom when no satisfactory explanation\n\nfor withholding the best evidence is given. Custom cannot be\n\nestablished by analogy and it cannot be established by a\n\npriorimethod. Uzagar Singhv. Mst. Jeo, AIR 1959 SC 1041, laid\n\ndown that the ordinary rule is that a custom, general or otherwise,\n\nhas to be proved under <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_80\">section 57</a> of the Evidence Act. However,\n\nnothing need be proved of which the courts can take judicial\n\nnotice. When a custom has been judicially recognised by the court\n\nthen it passes into the law of the land as proof of it becomes\n\nunnecessary under <a href=\"/doc/1665836/\" id=\"a_81\">section 57(1)</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_406\">      List of facts enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_82\">section 57</a> not exhaustive of\n\nthe facts of which Courts may take judicial notice :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_282\">      The Maxim expressio unius exclusio alteriusis often a\n\nvaluable servant, but a dangerous master to follow in the\n\nconstruction of Statutes.

This maxim\n\nis not applicable to <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_83\">section 57</a> of the Evidence Act, as it has been\n\nheld that the list mentioned in the section is not exhaustive of the\n\nfacts of which the Courts may take judicial notice. It is doubtful\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                  304</span>\n\nwhether an absolutely complete list of the facts of which Courts\n\ncan take judicial notice could be framed, as it is practically\n\nimpossible to enumerate everything which is so notorious in itself\n\nor so distinctly recorded by public authority that it would be\n\nsuperfluous to prove it. The tendency of modem practice is to\n\nenlarge the field of judicial notice, and the penultimate paragraph\n\nof this section indicates both an approval of this practice as also\n\nthe kinds of subjects of which judicial notice may be taken. The\n\nIndian case law and practice also appear to have proceeded on a\n\nliberal application of the power to take judicial notice. There is,\n\nhowever, this difference between the facts mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_84\">section 57</a>\n\nand others which are not so mentioned but of which judicial notice\n\nmay properly be taken; that, whereas the Court is bound to take\n\njudicial notice of the former, the Court has a discretion in the case\n\nof the latter, which it may or may not judicially notice, Matters\n\ndirected by statute to be judicially noticed must be so noticed by\n\nthe Courts; but beyond this, the Courts have a wide discretion and\n\nmay notice much which they cannot be required to notice. <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_85\">Section\n\n57</a> of the Evidence Act makes it obligatory on the part of the Court\n\nto take judicial notice of the facts mentioned in clause (1) to clause\n\n(13) of <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_86\">section 57</a>. There is nothing in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_87\">section 57</a> to indicate that a\n\nCourt cannot take judicial notice of facts, which are not covered by\n\nclause (1) to clause (13) of <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_88\">section 57</a>. Therefore, so far as the\n\npower of the Court to take judicial notice of the facts of the case is\n\nconcerned, <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_89\">section 57</a> and <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_90\">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act confer\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                   305</span>\n\ntwo different kinds of powers. The distinction between <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_91\">section 57</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_92\">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act is this that if under <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_93\">section 57</a>\n\nof the Evidence Act, relevant fact is covered by one or more of the\n\nthirteen clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_94\">section 57</a>, then the Court is under a legal\n\nobligation to take judicial notice of the fact subject to the\n\nconditions laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_95\">section 57</a> itself. On the other hand,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_96\">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act does not make it obligatory on the\n\npart of the Court to take judicial notice of any fact, but empowers\n\nthe Court to take judicial notice of all those facts, which the Court\n\nmay presume to have happened regard being had to the common\n\ncourse of natural events, human conduct and public and private\n\nbusiness in relation to the fact of the particular case.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_407\">      Thus, the Court may take judicial notice of any fact which,\n\nthough not mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_97\">section 57</a>, is judicially notified by the\n\nEnglish Courts, and of other facts which are notorious-e.g., the\n\nordinary course of nature, the standards of weight and measure, the\n\npublic coin and currency, and its difference of value in early and\n\nmodern times. That Ramayana is sacrosanct to Hindus, that Rama,\n\nKrishna, Brahma, Mahatma Gandhi, to wit only a few, are held in\n\nthe highest esteem by them are matters of common knowledge and\n\ncourts can take judicial notice thereof under clause 13 of <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_98\">section\n\n57</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_408\">      Judicial notice may properly be taken of current events and\n\nnotorious facts, e.g., like a world-wide economic depression or a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                  306</span>\n\npolitical movement e.g., the &quot;Quit India&quot; campaign and the\n\naccompanying disturbances of August, 1942. Courts can take\n\njudicial notice of the anti-corruption propaganda carried on by a\n\nState Government. A Court can take judicial notice of facts\n\ntranspiring in Court. A record of custom purporting to be prepared\n\nby a public officer is admissible under <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_99\">section 57</a> without proof\n\nthat it was prepared by the officer by whom it purports to have\n\nbeen prepared. The extent to which, and the pictorial delineation of\n\na scene are not matters of common knowledge but are matters for\n\nexperts. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that original\n\ntelegrams are destroyed by the Telegraph Department after three\n\nmonths. The Court may take judicial notice of the rules of\n\nexecutive business of the Government. It may also take judicial\n\nnotice of the fact that the Courts of Wards is much concerned with\n\nthe welfare of its wards. A Court Martial may take judicial notice\n\nof any matter within the general Military knowledge of its\n\nmembers. The Court is justified in taking judicial notice of the\n\npractice with the banks of charging interest on the overdrawn\n\namount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_409\">      Court can take judicial notice of the fact there is a\n\nflourishing colony of satsangisat Agra and there are centres in\n\nmost of the big cities in U.P.\n\n      Facts of which judicial notice may be taken are not limited\n\nto those of the nature specifically mentioned in clauses (1) to (13)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_223\">                                 307</span>\n\nof this section. These are mentioned because, as regards them, the\n\nCourt is given no discretion. They must be recognised by the\n\nCourts. As to others the Courts have a wide discretion and may\n\nnotice many facts which they cannot be required to notice. Thus a\n\nCourt can take judicial notice of &quot;notorious fact,&quot; but the question\n\nwhether a particular fact is a &quot;notorious fact&quot; may be a matter of\n\nopinion and somewhat controversial. The Court cannot smuggle\n\ninto the evidence its own opinion of controversial situation\n\ndistinguished as notorious facts. The Court must determine in each\n\ncase, whether the fact is of such well-known and established\n\ncharacter as to the proper subject of judicial notice. A proclamation\n\nof emergency is a matter of general information of which a Court\n\ncan take Judicial notice. A matter of public history may be such a\n\nfact. Consequently, the rule of exclusion should not be applied in\n\nconstruing statutes, when the application of the rule is likely to\n\nlead to injustice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_410\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120094409\" id=\"span_224\">The list of facts mentioned in the <a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 57</a>, of which the\n\nCourt can take judicial notice, is not exhaustive.

The Court can take\n\njudicial notice only of what may be regarded as notorious facts of\n\npublic history; it cannot treat letters though 75 years old, without\n\nany sort of legal proof, as proof of where certain missionaries were\n\nresiding and when they died.

The question of title\n\nbetween the trustee of a mosque, though an old and historical\n\ninstitution, and a private person, cannot, in our opinion, be deemed\n\nto be a &#x27;matter of public history&#x27; within the meaning of the said\n\nsection.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_295\">      In Mahant Shri Srinivas Ramanuj Das v.

A judge is entitled to take judicial notice of matters which\n\nhave reached the Courts, e.g., prosecutions for political crimes or\n\nthe general trend of evidence adduced for the prosecution and\n\ndefence in such case. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that\n\ncertain district in England had been attacked by aircraft; or that a\n\ndistrict had been the scene of recent and frequent dacoities; or that\n\nthe original records of a district destroyed during the Mutiny of\n\n1857. In Dorab Ali v. Abdul Aziz the Privy Council was inclined to\n\ntreat the fact that the Province of Oudh was not, when first\n\nannexed to British India, annexed to the Presidency of Fort\n\nWilliam as a fact of which judicial notice could be taken under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_106\">Evidence Act</a>. Judicial notice cannot be taken of land revenue\n\nreports which must be proved like any other document requiring\n\nproof. Judicial notice may be taken of proceedings in the\n\nLegislative Assembly, not of the truth of the facts asserted in the\n\nspeeches but of the fact that such speeches were made. Vernacular\n\nhistories which have never received any recognition, as historical\n\nworks of value and reliability relating to matters of public or\n\ngeneral interest nor have been referred to in any well-known\n\nhistorical work are inadmissible.

A witness has to state the\n\nfacts which he has seen, heard or perceived, and not the\n\nconclusions which he has formed on observing or perceiving them.\n\nThe function of drawing inferences from facts is judicial function\n\nand must be performed by the court. If a witness is permitted to\n\nstate not only the facts which he has perceived but also the opinion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                                  314</span>\n\nwhich he has formed on perceiving them, it would amount to\n\ndelegation of judicial functions to him and investing him with the\n\nattributes of a judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_414\">      To this general rule, however, there are some important\n\nexceptions, which are enacted in this set of sections. When &quot;the\n\nsubject-matter of inquiry is such that inexperienced persons are\n\nunlikely to prove capable of forming a correct judgment upon it&quot;,\n\nor when &quot;it so far partakes of the character of a science or art as to\n\nrequire a course of previous habit or study&quot;, the opinions of\n\npersons having special knowledge of the subject-matter of inquiry\n\nbecome relevant; for it is very difficult for the Court to form a\n\ncorrect opinion on a matter of this kind, without the assistance of\n\nsuch persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_415\">      Matters for expert testimony; competency to depose as\n\nan expert\n\n      Opinions of experts become relevant only when the Court\n\nhas to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law, or of science or\n\nart, or as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions. This\n\nsection is, therefore, exhaustive of the matters on which expert\n\ntestimony can be given, though the expression &quot;science or art&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_301\">would include almost all branches of human knowledge requiring\n\nspecial study, experience or training. So that a witness may be\n\ncompetent to depose as an expert, he must be shown to have made\n\na special study of the subject or acquired a special experience\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                  315</span>\n\ntherein.

Is he skilled?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_302\">Has he adequate knowledge?&quot; An expert is a person who has\n\nspecial knowledge and skill in the particular calling to which the\n\ninquiry relates. In law, and as applied to a witness, the term\n\n&quot;expert&quot; has a special significance, and no witness is permitted to\n\nexpress his opinion, unless he is an expert within the terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_110\">section 45</a>.

Clearly, therefore, what is admissible is the opinion of such\n\nan expert in the field in which he or she has acquired special\n\nknowledge. Outside specialised field, the opinion of the expert\n\nwould cease to be expert opinion and fall outside the purview of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_113\">section 45</a> of the Evidence Act.</span> In Deeks v.

There can, however, be no dispute that an expert&#x27;s\n\nevidence is a good evidence and cannot be rejected simply because\n\nit may not be decisive. In spite of it, the Court is not bound by the\n\nexpert opinion though it is bound to consider the same along with\n\nother evidence and circumstances appearing in a particular case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"760665\" id=\"span_236\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/760665/\" id=\"a_114\">Haji Mohd. v.

The scientific opinion\n\nevidence, if intelligible, convincing and tested, becomes a factor\n\nand often an important factor for consideration along with the\n\nother evidence of the case.

It cannot be disputed that thumb impressions would\n\nstand on a different footing, when compared to signatures and the\n\nvariations, in thumb impression cannot be easily judged by naked\n\neyes.

Plaintiffs\n\nhave filed Ext.82, extract of Memoirs of Babur by F.G.Talbot.\n\nFurther reliance has been placed on on Ext.85 extract of\n\nMughalkalin Bharat-Babur by S.Athar Abbas Rizvi.

The plaintiffs\n\nhave placed these documents to establish that Babur had camped\n\nnear Ayodhya, but had not given any order for demolition of any\n\ntemple and even on his return from the East, when he had called\n\nMir Baqi at a place near Ayodhya, no such mention was made by\n\nMir Baqi that any temple was demolished at Ayodhya or any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">                                 322</span>\n\nmosque was constructed at the site of any such Temple while there\n\nis specific mention of the desecration of the nude parts of the idols\n\nof Urwa in Babarnama.

Carnegi in his gazetteer for the first time evolve a theory of\n\nJanam Asthan temple and construction of Babri Masjid that too\n\nwas based on no source of History and rather was based only on\n\nlocal belief. He himself admitted that it was locally affirmed that\n\nEmperor Babur built the mosque by demolishing Janan Asthan\n\ntemple. In two places in Babri mosque the year it was built 935 H.,\n\ncorresponding with 1528 A.D. is carved in stone with inscription.\n\nThis assertion goes to show that the Babri Masjid was constructed\n\nin the year 1528. It is further urged that Babri Masjid being\n\nconstructed on the site of a temple after its demolition started from\n\nthe gazetteer of 1870. The assertions in gazetteers of Carnegy were\n\nrepeated in the reports of Millet, A.Fuhrer and H.R.Nevill.

Girijshankar, establishes that the temple\n         and its properties were always treated as private\n         properties. It would get fortified and gets corroborated\n         by decrees in Civil Suit No. 439/1985, one of the\n         legatees sought to annul the Will in Exhibits 10, 59\n         and the decree in that behalf. The Civil Suits Nos.\n         353/93, Ex. 24 and the Civil Suit No. 439 of 1885,\n         Ex. 26 and the Civil Suits Nos. 904 of 1903 and 910\n         of 1903, Ex. 52 and Ex. 54, Civil Suit No. 912 of\n         1903, Ex. 55 would establish that the appellant&#x27;s\n         family had always treated the temple and the lands\n         attached to temple as private properties. It has also\n         been further contended that the entry into the temple\n         was subject to permission and the devotees were not\n         allowed to have Pooja, but have Darshan only. These\n         circumstances have duly been taken into\n         consideration by the District Judge while the High\n         Court had not considered them in proper perspective.\n         We find no force in the contention. It is seen that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                     327</span>\n\nGazette of the Bombay Presidency, Vol. III published\nin 1879 is admissible under<a href=\"/doc/1034981/\" id=\"a_125\"> S. 35</a> read with<a href=\"/doc/492182/\" id=\"a_126\"> S. 81</a> of\nthe Evidence Act, 1872. The Gazette is admissible\nbeing official record evidencing public affairs and the\nCourt may presume their contents as genuine. The\nstatement contained therein can be taken into account\nto discover the historical material contained therein\nand the facts stated therein is evidence under<a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_127\"> S.45</a> and\nthe Court may in conjunction with other evidence and\ncircumstances take into consideration in adjudging the\ndispute in question, though may not be treated as\nconclusive evidence. The recitals in the Gazette do\nestablish that Kalika Mataji is on the top of the hill.\nMahakali temple and Bachra Mataji on the right and\nleft to the Kalika Mataji. During Moughal rule\nanother Syed Sadar Peer was also installed there, but\nKalika Mataji was the chief temple. Hollies and Bills\nare the main worshipers. On full Moon of Chaitra\n(April) and dussehra ( in the month of October), large\nnumber of Hindus of all classes gather there and\nworship Kalika Mataji, Mahakali, etc. After the\ndownfall of Moughal empire, Marathas took over and\nHis Highness Scindia attached great importance to the\ntemple. One of the devotees in 1700 offered silver\ndoors. The British annexed the territory pursuant to\nthe treaty between Her Majesty&#x27;s Government of India\nand His Highness Scindia on the 12th December,\n1860. A condition was imposed in the treaty for\ncontinued payment of fixed cash grants to all the\ntemples from the Treasury and that British emperors\naccepted the condition. Regular cash grants of fixed\nsums were given to all the temples by Scindias and\nBritish rulers, as evidenced by Exhibits 27, 28, 29 and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_321\">30. The historical statement of noted historian, stated\nby the High Court, by name M.S. Commissionaria in\nhis Vol. 1 of 1938 Edition corroborates the Gazette in\nthe material particulars, which would establish that\nthe temple was constructed on the top of the hill\naround 14th century and the people congregate in\nthousands and worship, as of right, to Kalika Mataji\nand other deities. R.N. Jogelkar&#x27;s Alienation manual\nbrought up in 1921 in the Chapter 5 Devasthana also\ncorroborates the historical evidence. It is true that Bai\nDiwali in her Will, Ex. 22 treated the temple and the\nproperties to be private property and bequeathed to\nher brother and the litigation ensured in that behalf. At\nthat time, as rightly pointed out by the High Court, the\nconcept of public trust and public temple was not very\nmuch in vogue. Therefore, the treatment meted out to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">                     328</span>\n\nthese properties at that time is not conclusive. On the\nother hand the fixed cash grants given by the Rulers\nScindias and the successor British emperors, the large\nendowment of lands given to Kalika Mataji temple by\nthe devotees do indicate that the temple was treated as\npublic temple. The appropriation of the income and\nthe inter se disputes in that behalf are self serving\nevidence without any probative value. Admittedly, at\nno point of time, the character of the temple was an\nissue in any civil proceedings. All the lands gifted to\nthe deity stand in the name of the deities, in particular\nlarge extent of agricultural lands belong to Kalika\nMataji. The entries in Revenue records corroborated it\n. The Gazette and the historical evidence of the\ntemple would show that the village is the pilgrimage\ncentre. Situation of the temples on the top of the hill\naway from the village and worshipped by the people\nof Hindus at large congregated in the thousands\nwithout any let or hindrance and as of right, devotees\nare giving their offerings in large sums in discharge of\ntheir vows, do establish that it is a public temple. It is\ntrue that there is no proof of dedication to the public.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_435\">It is seen that it was lost in antiquity and no\ndocumentary evidence in that behalf is available.\nTherefore, from the treatment meted out to the temple\nand aforesaid evidence in our considered view an\nirresistible inference would be drawn that the temple\nwas dedicated to the Hindu public or a section thereof\nand the public treat the temple as public temple and\nworship thereat as of right. It is true that there is\nevidence on record to show that there was a board\nwith inscription thereon that &quot;no entry without\npermission&quot; and that only Darshan was being had and\ninside pooja was not permitted. But that is only\ninternal regulation arranged for the orderly Darshan\nand that is not a circumstance to go against the\nconclusion that it is a public temple. Enjoyment of the\nproperties and non-interference by the public in the\nmanagement are not sufficient to conclude that the\ntemple is a private temple. It is found by the District\nCourt and the High Court that the appellants are\nheredity priests and when the public found that they\nare in the management of the properties they\nobviously felt it not expedient to interfere with the\nmanagement of the temples. It is seen that the High\nCourt considered the evidence placed on record and\nhas drawn the necessary conclusions and inferences\nfrom the proved facts that Kalika Mataji temple is a\npublic temple. It is a finding of fact .

Relevant paragraph 4 of the said judgment reads as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_329\">           &quot;4. It is necessary at this stage to set out the origin and\n           history of the Dargah. The Dargah has been in\n           existence for over about 700 years. Its origin is lost in\n           antiquity but the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency\n           tells us that the tomb is that of a Muslim saint who\n           came to India as an Arab missionary in the thirteenth\n           century. According to tradition, there are two tombs in\n           the Dargah in one of which is the dead body of a\n           Hindu princess and in the other tomb the dead body of\n           the Muslim saint. The fame of the saint was at its\n           height when the English made their appearance at\n           Kalyan in 1780. As they only stayed for two years,\n           their departure in the year 1782 was ascribed to the\n           power of the dead saint. The Peshwas were then in\n           power in that region and after the departure of the\n           English they sent a thanks offering under the charge\n           of one Kashinath Pant Ketkar, a Kalyan Brahmin. It is\n           said that the offering sent by the Peshwas was a pall\n           of cloth of gold trimmed with pearl, and supported on\n           silver pasta. The tomb was in disrepair and Kashinath\n           started to repair it and according to tradition was\n           miraculously assisted by the dead saint who, without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">                              333</span>\n\n         human aid, quarried and dressed the large blocks of\n         stone which now cover the tomb. It appears that\n         Kashinath was not content to repair the tomb. He also\n         wanted to manage it and this led to a dispute with\n         Kalyan Muslims who resented Brahmin management\n         of a Muslim shrine. Matters came to a head in 1817\n         and the dispute came before the Collector who\n         declared that the dead saint should settle the affair and\n         that the only way of ascertaining the saint&#x27;s wishes\n         was by casting lots. This was done and three times the\n         lot fell on the representative of Kashinath and so the\n         matter ended and Kashinath&#x27;s representative was\n         proclaimed guardian of the tomb.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_440\">7.

They are generally celibates but in certain\nMaths married men may hold the office.. Mahants are\nthe gurus or spiritual guides of many people who\npresent the Maths with presents of money and\nendowments in land. Thus the Sriramdas or\nDakshinaparwa Math received rich endowments from\nthe Mahrattas its abbot having been the guru of the\nNiahratta Governor While the Mahant of Emar Math\nin the eighteenth century who&#x27; had the reputation of\nbeing a very holy ascetic, similarly got large offerings\nfrolic his followers.

Relevant paragraph 12 of the\n\nsaid judgment reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_334\">         &quot;12. Apart from a copy of the fireman of Emperor\n         Akbar produced by the respondents to show that Shri\n         Rikhabdevji temple is a Swetamber Jain temple, the\n         authenticity of which has been disputed by the State,\n         there are other documents from which it appears\n         indisputable even as was represented by the State and\n         its predecessors that Shri Rikhabdevji temple is a Jain\n         temple. Annexure-26 -The Imperial Gazetteer of\n         India, Vol. XXI (New Edition 1908 pp. 168-169)\n         describes it as &quot;The famous Jain temple sacred to\n         Adinath or Rakhabnath&quot;. It further states that it is\n         annually visited by thousands of pilgrims from all\n         parts of Rajputana and Gujarat, and that it is difficult\n         to determine the age of this building, but three\n         inscriptions mention that it was repaired in the\n         fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There can be no\n         doubt that it is an ancient temple, though it is not\n         possible to say when and by whom the idols were\n         consecrated. We find as late as in 1958 that Annexure\n         30 - a Calendar printed and published by the\n         Government of Rajasthan - has a photo of Shri\n         Rikhabdevji temple under which there is a caption\n         &quot;UDAIPUR KE PAS RIKHABDEVJI KA PRASIDH\n         JAIN MANDIR&quot; i. e. famous Jain temple of\n         Rikhabdevji near Udaipur. Annexure 17 is a\n         notification issued by the Mewar Government on\n         Chait Sukla 7 Monday 1982 corresponding to April\n         19, 1926 A.D. with the heading &quot;Unique Angi Utsav\n         in Shri Dhulevnagar&quot;. In it Shri Keshariyanathji\n         Maharaj is described as a holy Jain Tirath which was\n         managed previously by Udaipur Nagar Seth and Seth\n         Jorawarmalji. We are not for the present concerned\n         with the statement contained there in about the\n         misappropriation of the money of the deity in Samvat\n         Year 1934 But this document also shows that the State\n         of Mewar describes it as a holy Jain Tirath. Annexures\n         2, 3, 4, 6, 7A, 7B and 7C show that some\n         embezzlement of the temple funds was suspected in\n         Samvat Year 1933 (about year 1875-76 AD.) as a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">                    336</span>\n\nresult of which one Molvi Abdul Rehman Khan was\ndeputed by the State of Udaipur to make enquiry and\ncheck the accounts. It appears that while this enquiry\nwas - proceeding, one Bhandari Jawanji Khem Raj\ncomplained against that Molvi for forcibly breaking\nopen the lock of the Bhandar and taking away the\naccount books and other papers. In that connection he\ndescribed the temple of Shri Rikhabdevji Maharaj as\nbelonging to the Jain Sangh. Annexure 9 dated\nJanuary 27. 1878, is a notification of the Government\nof Udaipur State for the information of the pilgrims\nand the devotees of Shri Rikhabdevji stating that\nBhandaries     were      removed     due    to    their\nmismanagement of the temple affairs and that a\nCommittee consisting of five respectable Oswal\nMahajans devotees of Shri Rikhabdevji, was\nappointed. Annexure 10 dated November 22, 1878, is\na notice issued by the members of the Committee to\ndispel doubts about the action taken by the Ruler of\nthe State in appointing a Committee for the\nmanagement of the temple. It also mentions that- the\nmanagement has been assigned to a Committee of\nfive or seven big Sahukars who follow Jain religion\nand lead a religious life. Annexure 24 dated May 29,\n1886, is a copy of the report made by Mehta Govind\nSingh Hakim Magra (an officer having both judicial\nand magisterial powers) to Mahkama Khas, Udaipur,\non an application submitted by some Digamber Jains\nobjecting to the raising of Dhawaja i.e. flag over the\n&#x27;Jainalaya&#x27; by the Swetambar Jains. In that report it\nwas stated that the temple was a Swetamber Jain\ntemple. Annexure 21 dated July 19, 1907, shows that\non a complaint that some people had allowed low\ncaste people to perform Puja of Shri Rikhabdevji by\ntaking some illegal gratification, the matter was\nreferred by the officer of the Devasthan Bhandar to\nJain Muni Paniyas Nem Kushalji as to what steps be\ntaken for purification of the temple and the reply\ngiven by the said Muni. Annexure 28 dated Kartik\nSudi 10 Samvat 1979 (1922 A D.) is a copy of the\nreport of the Devasthan Department to Mahkama\nKhas, Udaipur State, stating that &#x27;Naivedya&#x27; should\nnot be offered to the deity Shri Rikhabdevji as neither\nthe Committee no; the Jain Sangh nor the Acharyas of\nthe Jain Sangh are in favour of it, and that the new\npractice of offering &#x27;Naivedya&#x27; for the first time is\nuncalled for. On this report, the Mahkama Khas\nordered that the Devasthan be informed that there is\nno necessity of offering &#x27;Naivedya&#x27;.

For the purposes of this appeal it will be necessary\nto refer to some earlier litigation about this temple.\nThe history of this temple, it is not disputed, goes\nback to remote antiquity. According to Hindu tradition\nreferred to in the Siva Purana and Padma Purana,\nextracts from which, with translations, are given by\nDr. Rajendra Lal Mitra in his paper on the Temples of\nDeoghar (see Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\nPart 1, 1883, quoted in the Bihar District Gazetteer\nrelating to Santal Parganas, 1938 edition pp. 373-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_338\">376), the origin of the temple is traced to the Treta\nYuga, which was the second age of the world by\nHindu mythology. Side by side with Hindu tradition,\nthere is a Santal tradition of the origin of the temple\ngiven by Sir William Hunter (see the Annals of Rural\nBengal, p. 191; Statistical Account of Bengal Vol.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_449\">XIV, p. 323). But these materials afford no evidence\nas to when and by whom the idol was established or\nthe temple was built.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_450\">3. The temple sheltering the &quot;lingam&quot; and dedicated\nto Mahadeva stands in a stone-paved quadrangular\ncourtyard. The courtyard contains eleven other\ntemples, smaller in size and of less importance than\nthat of Baidyanath. Pilgrims visit the temples in large\nnumbers and make offerings of flowers and money in\nsilver or gold; rich people offer horses, cattle,\npalaquins, gold ornaments and other valuables and\nsometimes, rent-free land in support of the daily\nworship. There is a high or chief priest (Sardar Panda)\nwho it appears used to day a fixed rent to the Rajas of\nBirbhum during the Muhammadan regime, and the\nadministration of the temple was then left entirely in\nthe hands of the high priest. It may be here stated that\nabout 300 families of &quot;pandas&quot;, who belong to a\nbranch of Maithil Brahmins, were attached to the\ntemple and earned their livelihood by assisting\npilgrims in performing the various ceremonies\nconnected with the worship of the God. When the\nBritish rule began, it was decided to take over the\nmanagement of the temple, and with this object an\nestablishment of priests, collectors and watchmen was\norganised in 1787 at Government expense. The\nrevenue soon fell off, as the chief priest beset the\navenues to the temples with emissaries, who induced\nthe pilgrims to make their offerings before\napproaching the shrine. (See the District Gazetteer,\nibid, p. 383). In 1791 Government relinquished its\nclaim to a share of the offerings and entrusted the\nmanagement of the temple to the head priest on his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_260\">                                339</span>\n\n           executing an agreement to keep the temples in repair\n           and to perform all the usual ceremonies. This\n           agreement was entered into by Ram Dutt the (ancestor\n           of the present respondent), then high priest of the\n           temple, and Mr. Keating who was then Collector of\n           the district. According to Mr. Keating the income of\n           the temple in 1791 consisted of the offerings of the\n           proceeds of 32 villages and 108 bighas of land which\n           he estimated at Rs. 2,000 a year; some years later the\n           total income was estimated at Rs. 25,000 a year.\n           Under the system introduced by the agreement of\n           1791, the mismanagement of the temple was a source\n           of constant complaint; the temple and &quot;ghats&quot; were\n           frequently out of repair and the high priest was\n           charged with alienating villages from the temple and\n           treating his situation as a means of enriching himself\n           and his family. On the death of the high priest in 1820\n           a dispute over the succession arose between an uncle\n           and a nephew. The nephew Nityanand was eventually\n           appointed, but neglected to carry out the terms of his\n           appointment. Finally, Nityanand was charged with\n           malversation of the funds and the uncle Sarbanand\n           was appointed in his stead in 1823. There was a\n           faction which was opposed to Sarbanand&#x27;s retention in\n           office and asked for Government interference in the\n           internal management of the temple. In 1835\n           Government declined all interference in the matter\n           and the parties were left to have recourse to the\n           established Courts of law. Sarbanand died in 1837 and\n           Iswaranund Ojha, son of Sarbanand Ojha, was\n           subsequently elected Sardar Panda. Iswaranund was\n           succeeded by his grand-son, Sailajanund Ojha.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_451\">9. In AIR 1954 SC 575 (Choote Khan. v.

It is common ground that the property was\n           originally granted in 1822 A.D. to Dalmir by Nawab\n           Ahmad Bakhsh Khan Rais of Ferozepore Jhirka. The\n           grant is not in writing and there is no\n           contemporaneous record which could throw any light\n           on its terms. Dalmir claimed to be the sole grantee\n           with full proprietary rights. A number of documents\n           are attached to the Settlement record of 1963.

Relevant paragraph 5 of the said\n\n  judgment reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_344\">           &quot;5. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to\n           mention briefly the history of the Sheorinarayana\n           Math. The Math is situated in the village\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">                    342</span>\n\nSheorinarayan, 62.04 kilometers from Bilaspur on the\nleft bank of Mahanadi. It is an ancient Math and us a\nwell-known place of pilgrimage. The entire\nChhatisgarh area which includes the District of\nBilaspur was ruled by the Kalchuri clan of Rajputs\nfrom the 9th century A.D. to the 18th century A.D.\nThe capital of these rulers was at Ratanpur which is at\nshort distance from Bilaspur. The Kalchuries of\nRatanpur were all descendants of the Kalchuries of\nChedi or Dehala with their capital at Tripuri near\nJabalpur. Kalchuries belong to Haihaya race claiming\ndescent from Kartavityarjuna of the Epic and the\nPuranic fame and are also referred to as Haihayas :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_345\">(Madhya Pradesh District Gazetteer of Bilaspur\nDistrict, pp. 56 to 66). The popular belief which is\nalso adverted to in the plaint is that the temple of\nNarayana which is the principal temple of the Math\nwas constructed during the reign of Jajalladeva II who\nruled from 1165 A.D. to 1168 A.D. There are two\nstone inscriptions which are important for finding out\nas to when the temple of Narayana in the Math was\nbuilt. The first inscription which is of the Kalchuri\nyear 898 is incised on the pedestal of the statue of a\nmale person in a small shrine in the courtyard of the\ntemple of Narayana. The corresponding English date\nof this inscription is 9th Sept. 1146 A.D. The object of\nthe inscription is to record that the statue is of a\nwarrier named Sangramasimha the son of Balesimha\nand Ananadevi. The praise which is here lavished in\nthe inscription is wholly conventional and has no\nhistorical importance: (See Corpus Inscriptionum\nIndicarum (Inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi Era)\nVol. IV, Pt. II, pp. 582 to 584). The only thing of\nimportance in this inscription is the date and the fact\nthat it starts with an invocation to &#x27;Shiv&#x27;. The second\ninscription is of the Kalchuri or Chedi year 919. The\nstone which bears this inscription is built in the\ntemple of Chandrachudeavars which stands in close\nvicinity to that of Narayana temple. The date of the\ninscription is not available but the year corresponds to\n1167-68 A. D. The inscription belongs to the reign of\nJajalladeva II of the Kalchuri Dynasty of Ratanpur.\nThe immediate object of the inscription is to record\nthe donation of the village Chincheli by Amanadeva, a\ndescendant of a collateral branch of the Kalchuri\nDynasty for the purpose of defraying the expenses of\nworship of God Chandrachude and the erection of a\ntemple of Durga in front of the shrine. The inscription\nis, however, historically important as it furnishes an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">                                343</span>\n\n           account of the collateral Dynasty of Ratanpur. This\n           inscription also begins with an invocation to Shiv:\n           (Inscriptions of the Kalachuri Chedi Era Pt. II, pp.\n           519 to 527). It is generally believed that the temple of\n           Narayana was constructed during the same period to\n           which the above inscriptions belong. There is some\n           controversy as to whether the idol in this temple is of\n           Vishnu or Shiva. It is stated in the Archaeological\n           Survey of India Report, Vol. VII, p. 196 that the deity\n           in the temple is Shaivic and not Vaishanavic. The\n           same thing is repeated in the Madhya Pradesh District\n           Gazetteer of Bilaspur District at p. 524. The Survey\n           Report which states that the idol is of Shiv was made\n           by J.D. Beglar, who was Assistant to Major-General\n           A. Cunningham, Director General, Archaeological\n           Survey of India. The inference drawn by Beglar on\n           this point does not appear to be correct. The idol is a\n           figure in a sitting posture and not Shivalingum. The\n           very fact that the idol has been worshipped as\n           Narayana or Vishnu for ages proves that it is of\n           Vishnu and not of Shiv. Probably, the Beglar&#x27;s report\n           was influenced by the fact that the stone inscriptions\n           which we have referred to above begin with an\n           invocation to Shiva and the Kalchuri Rulers in whose\n           reign the Shrine was founded were also of Saivic\n           faith. In our opinion, however, the correct position is\n           stated by Dr. Mirashi in his introduction to Vol. IV of\n           Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum (Inscriptions of the\n           Kalachuri-Chedi Era Pt. I, pp. xxiii, cxv, cli and clxiii)\n           that though Saivism was the predominant cult in\n           Dakshina Kosala i.e. Chattisgarh, but Vaishnavism\n           also was prevalent and that the old temple at\n           Sheorinarayan is of Vishnu and was erected by a\n           collateral branch of the royal family of Ratanpur. This\n           is also the view of a modern author as Kalchuri Rulers\n           and their descendants: (See Kalchuri Naresh Aur\n           Unke Vanshaj (1982) p. 33 by Dr. Ram Kumar\n           Singh).

Ali Khan Sahib)\n\n   on its page 215, the Privy Council extracted the facts from\n\n   Madura Gazetteer in respect of Tirupparankundram temple and\n\n   also held that though there is a general presumption that waste\n\n   land are the property of the crown, but it is not applicable\n\n   where alleged waste is, at all found, physically within a temple.\n\n   Relevant extracts from pages 214 to 216 of the said judgment\n\n   read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_358\">            Their main criticism of the Subordinate Judge is that\n            &quot;he refused to draw the proper presumption from the\n            admitted facts of the case,&quot; and that this vitiates his\n            consideration of all the evidence. The presumption\n            which they draw is that the unoccupied portions of the\n            hill belong to Government, and they appear to base\n            this upon historical grounds.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_359\">            It is necessary therefore to trace shortly the fortunes\n            of the temple in the 17th and 18th centuries, for which\n            the authorities relied on are principally the &quot;Madura\n            Gazetteer,&quot; and Nelson&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;Manual of the Madura\n            Country,&quot; a compilation of great interest which has\n            frequently been cited before this Board.\n            There appears to be no doubt that under the Nayakkan\n            Kings of Madura the seven temples in and in the\n            immediate neighbourhood of the capital were\n            endowed with large revenues derived from a number\n            of villages. The temples were known as the Hafta\n            Devasthanam, and included the Tirupparankundram\n            Temple. It seems probable that this endowment was\n            due mainly to the generosity of Tirumala, a famous\n            member of that dynasty who reigned from 1623 to\n            1659. During the century and a half that followed the\n            history of Madura is a confused record of internecine\n            warfare, in which the incursions of Mahomedan,\n            Mysorean and Mahratta invaders played the largest\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_270\">                    349</span>\n\npart, and these were succeeded by the gradual, but by\nno means peaceful, penetration of the East India\nCompany. During those troublous times the Hafta\nDevasthanam lands seem to have disappeared\npiecemeal. What remained of them when Chanda\nSahib, nominally representing the Nawab of Arcot,\nestablished himself in Madura in 1738 were then\nconfiscated. His domination was interrupted by\nanother invasion of the Mahrattas, who probably\nrestored a portion of the old endowments. They again\nwere ousted by the Nizam in 1744, and the temples\nfared no better than before. Then followed the\nintervention of the East India Company. Madura was\neventually subdued by their troops under Mahomed\nYusuf Khan, who in due course established himself as\nruler. In 1763 he was beseiged in Madura by the\nCompany&#x27;s army, and after a memorable defence was\nbetrayed and executed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_360\">Thenceforward Madura seems to have come gradually\nunder the Company&#x27;s control, and after the fall of\nSeringapatam the civil and military administration of\nthe district was formally made over, as part of the\nGarnatic, to the British under Lord Clive&#x27;s treaty with\nAzim-ul-Dowlah of 31st July 1801 (Aitchison&#x27;s\nTreaties, Edn. 4, X. 57).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_361\">Mahomed Yusuf Khan (above referred to), who was\napparently a Hindu by birth, re-established the\nendowment of the temples by a money grant, possibly\nderived from the revenues of the confiscated villages\nbut the villages themselves were not restored.\nThis was the position when Mr. Hurdis, who was\nalready in charge of the adjoining district of Dindigul,\nbecame the first British Collector of Madura, and\ncarried out an elaborate survey and settlement of the\ncountry. He was in considerable doubt as to the course\nthat should be adopted with regard to the Hafta\nDevasthanam lands. The Board of Directors ordered\ntheir restoration to the temples, but for some\nunexplained reason this order was never carried out, a\ntasdik or annual allowance in money being paid in\nlieu thereof to each of the temples. The\nTirupparankundram tasdik, according to Nelson&#x27;s\naccount, was a sum of Rs. 2,651-8-3.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_362\">Their Lordships will now return to the matter with\nwhich the present appeal is immediately concerned.\nThe question is whether any presumption should be\ndrawn from the confiscation of the endowed villages\nas to the proprietary rights in the waste land situate\nwithin the &#x27;ghiri veedhi&#x27; and forming part of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_271\">                    350</span>\n\n&#x27;malaiprakaram.&#x27; It is admitted that the village of\nTirupparankundram, in which the temple is situated,\nwas part of this endowment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_363\">The Subordinate Judge thought that there was nothing\nin the long story, which their Lordships have\nattempted to summarize in the preceding pages, to\nsuggest that the temple had over been ousted from its\npossession of the hill. The High Court, on the other\nhand, took the view that the hill being part of the\nvillage, it must be presumed to have been confiscated\nwith the village, and to have become in 1801\nGovernment property.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_364\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1042546\" id=\"span_272\">The conclusion to which their Lordships have come is\nthat the Subordinate Judge was right. There is no trace\nin the historical works to which they have been\nreferred of any interference by the Mahomedan\ninvaders with the sacred hill or the immediate\nsurroundings of the temple. They and the other\npredatory forces which established themselves from\ntime to time in Madura, no doubt seized the revenue-\nproducing lands which formed the joint endowment of\nall the temples, and these must have included the\ncultivated and assessed lands within the &#x27;ghiri veedhi,&#x27;\nbut there seems to be no suggestion that the\nTirupparankundram\nTemple or any of its adjuncts passed at any time into\nsecular hands. It was probably during some interval of\nMahomedan domination that the mosque and some\nMahomedan houses were built (though the\nMahomedans themselves ascribe the mosque to a\nmuch earlier period), but this was an infliction which\nthe Hindu occupants of the hill might well have been\nforced to put up with ; it is, their Lordships think, no\nevidence of their expropriation from the remainder.\nBut the more relevant period to consider is that\nfollowing the cession of sovereignty in 1801. The\nonly rights which the temple can assert against the\nrespondent are rights which the East India Company\ngranted to them or allowed them to retain : see <a href=\"/doc/1042546/\" id=\"a_139\">Secy.\nof State v. Bai Rajbai</a> (1), and their Lordships think\nthe evidence shows that the temple was left after 1801\nin undisturbed possession of all that it now claims.\nIndeed, the policy of the Directors seems to have been\nrather to restore to the temples what they had been\ndeprived of in the long years of anarchy which had\npreceded British rule, than to mulct them of any\nremnant that was left. It is, in their Lordships&#x27; view,\nhardly, conceivable that the East India Company\nwould have wished, for no gain to themselves, to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                                     351</span>\n\n                 appropriate what was plainly the &#x27;prakaram&#x27; of an\n                 ancient temple studded with shrines, &#x27;inandapams&#x27; and\n                 other accessories to the worship of its devotees. Nor is\n                 there in the reports of Mr. Hurdis, or of any of his\n                 successors, which are summarized in the Nelson\n                 Manual, any hint of such a policy or of any claim by\n                 Government to rights over the hill.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">                 (1)</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_365\">                 AIR 1915 PC 59=30 IC 303=42 IA 229=39 Bom.\n                 625(PC).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_366\">                 Their Lordships do not doubt that there is a general\n                 presumption that waste lands are the property of the\n                 Crown, but they think that it is not applicable to the\n                 facts of the present case where the alleged waste is, at\n                 all events physically, within a temple enclosure. They\n                 see no reason to disagree with the Subordinate Judge&#x27;s\n                 discussion of the authorities on this question. Nor do\n                 they think that any assistance can be derived, under\n                 the circumstances of this case, from the provisions of\n                 the Madras Land Encroachment Act 3 of 1905, on\n                 which the respondent has relied.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_367\">Annexure-V\nTwenty lines Inscription\nengraved on a slab\nPage 45-59\n\n\n           On 6.12.1992 the disputed structure was demolished and\n\n     the inscription and several pieces of architectural remains were\n\n     found.

The clinching evidence of\n\nepigraphical record prepared by Rakesh Tewari OPW-14 contains\n\na list of 265 artifacts. After seeing the list it transpires that remains\n\nof old Hindu temple were used in construction of mosque. Sri\n\nRakesh Tewari was cross examined. There is not even an iota of\n\nevidence to suggest that he had not collected the remains of the\n\ndisputed structure and prepared inventory containing 265 artifacts.\n\nConsequently on the basis of epigraphical evidence it transpires\n\nthat ornamental pictures, images, parts of the old temple and other\n\nreligious articles used in the temple were found from the debris of\n\nthe demolished structure. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1042546\" id=\"span_280\">In view of the inscription <a href=\"/doc/1042546/\" id=\"a_140\">referred to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                        357</span>\n\n      above</a> it is established that there was temple prior to the\n\n      construction of Babri Mosque.

Alexandar\n\n      Connigham in O.O.<a href=\"/doc/973062/\" id=\"a_144\">S.5-6</a> has also mentioned that very heart of the\n\n      city stand Janam Asthan or birth place temple of Ram. The\n\n      Encyclopedia of India of Eastern and Southern Asia by Surgeon\n\n      General Edward Balfour (1885) at page 56 also refers about the\n\nAnnexure-IV\nAyodhya by Hans Bakker\nPages 14 to 33\n\n\n      moque. Lastly Hans Bakker in the celebrity book of Ayodhya at\n\n      page 46 took view that the original location of Janam Asthan is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">                                 358</span>\n\ncomparatively certain since it seems to be attested by the location\n\nof the mosque built by Babur, in the building of which materials of\n\na previous Hindu temple were used and are still visible. The\n\nmosque is built by general consciousness to occupy the site of the\n\nJanam Asthan. In this context it may be clarified that gazetteers are\n\nofficial documents and the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has relied upon\n\nthem. They are admissible u/ss.35, 45 and 81 of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_145\">Indian\n\nEvidence Act</a>.

In this context I would like to\n\nrefer Baburnama by A.S.Beweridge who has dealt this inscription\n\nat appendix U at page 27. He has obtained the inscription from\n\nDeputy Commissioner, Faizabad. The inscription inside the\n\nmosque reveals that &quot;By the command of the Emperor Babur, Mir\n\nBaqi built this alighting-place of angels&quot;. After considering the\n\nentire inscription Beweridge took the view and concluded that\n\n&quot;inscription is incomplete&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_386\">      It is not disputed between the parties that original suit\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">                                  359</span>\n\nno.29/1945 was filed by Shia Central Waqf Board against Sunni\n\nCentral Board of Waqf and the learned Civil Judge had the\n\nopportunity to see the inscription on the mosque. He has relied\n\nupon gazetteers of settlement report and took a view that when no\n\ndirect evidence is available then the material in the gazetteer which\n\nwas compiled after spot inspection assumes great importance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_387\">According to the Civil Judge the inscription on the pulpit shows\n\nthat it was built in 923H while gazetteer show that the mosque was\n\nbuilt in 935H. Thus the Civil Judge disbelieved the inscription.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_388\">      Besides Beveridge even the Civil Judge who visited the site\n\non 26.05.1946 instead of one found two inscriptions, one refers\n\n923 H i.e. 1516-17 AD, another refers 935 H i.e. 1528-29 AD.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_389\">Deputy Commissioner provided the copy of one inscription to\n\nBeveridge. Consequently the plaintiffs are unable to prove before\n\nthis Court as to what happened with the earlier inscription of\n\nshowing the date of construction as 923H referred in the judgment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_390\">As regards the 2nd inscription Beveridge found it incomplete. Thus\n\nwith all certainty it can be said that inscription is not reliable and\n\non the basis of inscription plaintiffs are unable to establish that\n\nBabri Mosque was constructed in the year 1528 A.D. but on\n\nhistorical account it is established that the mosque was constructed\n\nafter demolishing the temple. Consequently during the regime of\n\nBabur the mosque was constructed under his command after\n\ndemolishing the temple against the tenets of Islam by Mir Baqi.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_391\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1042546\" id=\"span_284\">I have already referred the arguments advanced by Sri Hari\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                                    360</span>\n\nShanker Jain Advocate. He has pointed out the circumstances\n\nwhich leads to an inescapable conclusion that the temple was\n\ndestroyed and remains of the temple were re-used in the\n\nconstruction of the mosque. This view gets strength from the\n\nGazetteers as well as from circumstantial evidence<a href=\"/doc/1042546/\" id=\"a_147\">, <a href=\"/doc/1042546/\" id=\"a_148\">referred to\n\nabove</a></a>. In this regard I find recovery of 265 artifacts fully establish\n\nthat damaged parts of the old Hindu temple in the form of\n\nbuilding material were reused in the construction of the mosque\n\nagainst the tenets of Islam.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_392\">      I have already recorded the findings of issue no. 1-b. A.S.I.\n\nreport has also confirmed that the disputed building was\n\nconstructed on the site of     old Hindu temple. Statement of O.P.W.\n\n14 Dr Rakesh Tiwari, who prepared the inventory, if read along\n\nwith A.S.I. report , then the total outcome is that old temple was\n\ndemolished and at the site disputed structure was constructed .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_393\">      265 inscriptions found on 6.12.1992 after demolition of the\n\ndisputed structure along with other architectural remains leave no\n\nroom for doubt that the inscription is written in the script of Dev\n\nNagri of 11th and 12 century. I have also           referred English\n\ntranslation of 20 line inscription of Dr. K.B. Ramesh. The\n\naforesaid circumstantial evidence supported by other epigraphical\n\ndocuments are the most valuable evidence which fully corroborate\n\nthe version of Hindus and belies the version of Muslim that the\n\nmosque was not constructed, after demolishing any temple. On\n\nthe basis of circumstantial evidence, historical accounts, gazetteers\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                           361</span>\n\nand other epigraphical documents, it is established that after\n\ndemolishing the temple the disputed structure was constructed as a\n\nmosque and even pillars of the old temple were re-used which\n\ncontained the images of Hindu Gods and Goddesses against the\n\ntenets of Islam. Thus, the circumstantial evidence totally\n\ncontradicts the assertion of Muslims. I have already referred the\n\noral evidence,          adduced by the parties in Annexure No.5. I\n\nconclude that the oral evidence led by Muslims is not trustworthy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_394\">Thus the circumstantial evidence conclusively establish the claim\n\nof Hindus about the destruction of old temple and construction of\n\nBabri Mosque at the site of the temple which is corroborated by\n\nthe expert evidence of A.S.I.\n\n        As regards revenue entries, the plaintiffs cannot get any\n\nadvantage for the reasons that there are lot of interpolations. I\n\nagree with the analysis of Sri Hari Shanker Jain Advocate.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_395\">        I have referred in detail that on the basis of revenue records\n\nalso and other documents, it can conclusively be said that\n\nJanmsthan was taken into consideration. Thus, on the basis of the\n\nopinion of the experts, evidence on record, circumstantial evidence\n\nand historical account from all or any angle, it transpires that the\n\ntemple was demolished and the mosque was constructed at the site\n\nof the old Hindu temple by Mir Baqi at the command of Babur.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_396\">Issue Nos. 1 and 1(a) are decided in favour of the defendants and\n\nagainst the plaintiffs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_397\">Tripathi/Tanveer/Akhilesh/Padam P.
