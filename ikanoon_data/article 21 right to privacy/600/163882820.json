Kenajit, learned counsel for the petitioner, assisted by Mr.\n\nAlbert Keisham, Advocate; and Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP for the State.\n\n\n[2]          The petitioner herein approached this Court by an application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing F.I.R. No. 208 (04) 2012 IPS<a href=\"/doc/1781202/\" id=\"a_2\"> u/S 17</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1561699/\" id=\"a_3\">20</a> Unlawful\n\nActivities (Prevention) Act. It is stated that the petitioner is presently running a\n\nbusiness of mobile food truck and is a family man taking care of his old aged parents,\n\nwife and two minor sons, and he is the only bread earner of the family and his wife is\n\nhelping him in the food truck business. The petitioner was arrested on 21.04.2012 in\n\nconnection with F.I.R No. 208 (04) 2012 IPS<a href=\"/doc/1781202/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/S 17</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1561699/\" id=\"a_5\">20</a> UA(P) Act and the learned\n\nChief Judicial Magistrate, Imphal West, released him on bail on 30.04.2012. It is also\n\nstated that respondent No. 3 arbitrarily arrested the petitioner without any material\n\nonly on the ground that he was carrying Rs. 90,000/- (Rupees Ninety Thousand) with\n\nhim. It is further stated that there is no prima facie case against the petitioner and\n\nthere is no progress in the investigation since his arrest 10 years ago. It is stated that\n\nthe petitioner has been picked up from his residence on every Independence Day and\n\nRepublic Day i.e. 15th August and 26th January every year by the police and took\n\nphotographs in full public view and hence, his prestige and reputation has been\n\ntarnished in the society. In the F.I.R., it is alleged that the petitioner was a member\n\nof a banned militant outfit PLA/RPF. Since there is no progress in the investigation for\n\nmore than 10 years, it is prayed that name of the petitioner may be quashed or deleted\n\nfrom the FIR or direct the respondents to file charge sheet within a time frame. The\n\nrelevant portion of the prayer is reproduced below :-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                               3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                 &quot;iii) to quash/delete the name of the petitioner from the impugned FIR No.\n                 208(04) 2012 IPS<a href=\"/doc/1781202/\" id=\"a_6\"> u/s 17</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1561699/\" id=\"a_7\">20</a> UA(P) Act (Annexure Q/2);\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">                     or\n                 to direct the respondents to file charge sheet against the petitioner within a\n                 time frame;&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">[3]          The petitioner also filed an application being MC(Cril.Petn.) No. 27 of\n\n2022 inter alia praying that during the pendency of Cril.Petn. No. 26 of 2022, the State\n\nrespondents may be directed not to pick up the petitioner and wrongfully detain him\n\nin custody in the guise of F.I.R No. 208 (04) 2012 IPS<a href=\"/doc/1781202/\" id=\"a_8\"> u/S 17</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1561699/\" id=\"a_9\">20</a> UA(P) Act on the\n\nground that such routine detention of the petitioner on the eve of 26th January and\n\n15th August every year and also during the visit of high dignitaries, violates his right\n\nof live with dignity and his right of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\n[4]          The State respondents submits that the petitioner was arrested for being\n\na member of the illegal unlawful band outfit PLA/RPF and from his possession, Rs.\n\n90,000/- (Rupees Ninety Thousand) was recovered in cash from his possession. He\n\nused to collect money from various departments and businessman and transferred the\n\nsame to the organization as party fund after retaining his percentage. As the State of\n\nManipur is an insurgency prone State, there has to be strict vigilance and surveillance\n\nover the movement of cadres or members of outlawed organizations, especially on\n\nthe occasions of Independence Day and Republic Day. Accordingly, the petitioner\n\nbeing a bail-out member of PLA/RPF, the police makes some queries about his life\n\nafter releasing him on bail and states that he was never arrested or detained. It is also\n\nstated that there are sufficient materials against the petitioner in the FIR. It is stated\n\nthat the petitioner ought to approach the concerned Special Court under the provisions\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_10\">Cr.P.C</a>. for calling status of investigation and expediting the same, instead of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                             4</span>\n\n\napproaching this Court for quashing FIR. It is also clarified that the investigation took\n\na long time as associates of the petitioner are yet to be arrested and necessary steps\n\nwill be taken up to complete the investigation as soon as possible.\n\n\n[5]          The petitioner filed rejoinder affidavit to the counter affidavit of the State\n\nrespondents and stated that he was implicated in the FIR with mere suspicion without\n\nany evidentiary materials and on the basis of concocted story. On the other hand, the\n\ninvestigation could not be completed for more than 10 years. The petitioner has been\n\npicked up repeatedly on several occasions such as the Independence Day, Republic\n\nDay and during the visit of high dignitaries and detained the whole night in the custody\n\nof the police. Inability to complete the investigation for more than 10 years shows that\n\nthere is no evidence against the petitioner and it is a fit case for quashing the FIR.\n\n\n[6]          Mr. H. Kenajit, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that there is no\n\nprogress in the investigation at all for a period of more than 10 years and during the\n\npendency, the petitioner who leads a normal life by doing a food stall and maintaining\n\na family has been harassing on occasion of Republic &amp; Independence Day and visit of\n\nhigh dignitaries and he has been picked up from his residence by the police and this\n\nlowers his dignity in the society. After the filing of MC(Cril.Petn.) No. 27 of 2022 and\n\nduring the pendency of the present petition, the police has stopped picking up from\n\nhis residence. The plea of calling the petitioner to enquire his well being, cannot be\n\nsustained, as he was usually picked up by police from his residence and took\n\nphotographs in full public view. It is stated that he was treated as an accused involved\n\nin a heinous crime on the basis of an FIR registered a decade ago with no progress in\n\nthe investigation. It is emphasizing that such treatment violates the petitioner&#x27;s right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                             5</span>\n\n\nto privacy and dignity as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Since the FIR\n\ndoes not disclose any material for the involvement of the petitioner and also inability\n\nto complete the investigation for more than 10 years, Mr. H. Kenajit, learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner has submitted that this is a perfect case for quashing the FIR. If this\n\nCourt is not willing to quash the FIR at this stage, Mr. H. Kenajit, learned counsel,\n\nsubmits that a definite time frame may be given to the investigating agency to\n\ncomplete the investigation. He draws the attention of this Court to an order dated\n\n17.10.2022 passed by this Court in CRIL.PETN. No. 31 of 2021 where FIR registered\n\nway back in the year 2009 FIR relating to offence of kidnapping, murder and <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_12\">Unlawful\n\nActivities (Prevention) Act</a>, was handed over to the CBI directing to complete the\n\ninvestigation and file a final report/charge-sheet before the competent Court within a\n\nperiod of 6(six) months from the date of receipt of the order. It is submitted that in\n\nthe present case also, direction for completing the investigation within a period of\n\n6(six) months may be given to the investigating agency. Mr. H. Kenajit, learned\n\ncounsel, also submits that as prayed in MC(Cril.Petn.) No. 27 of 2022, the State\n\nrespondents may be directed not to pick up the petitioner and wrongfully detain in\n\ntheir custody in connection with F.I.R No. 208 (04) 2012 IPS<a href=\"/doc/1781202/\" id=\"a_13\"> u/S 17</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1561699/\" id=\"a_14\">20</a> UA(P) Act on\n\nthe occasions of Independence Day, Republic Day or visit of high dignitaries to the\n\nState.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\n[7]          Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP for the State submits that an investigation\n\ninvolving offences under UA(P) Act cannot be quashed on mere technicalities and the\n\ninvolvement of the petitioner has to be established after due investigation. He further\n\nsubmits that as clarified in the counter affidavit, the investigation could not be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                             6</span>\n\n\ncompleted as other associates of the petitioner could not be arrested and the State\n\nendeavor to complete the investigation as soon as possible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n[8]          Learned PP has objected to the prayer made in the misc. application being\n\nMC(Cril.Petn.) No. 27 of 2022 to restrain the police from picking up the petitioner on\n\naccount of every Republic Day, Independence Day and visit of high dignitaries. It is\n\nclarified that the petitioner was not arrested or picked up as alleged in the application.\n\nSince Manipur is an insurgent prone State and the bail-out surrendered militants are\n\ncalled on to the police station to enquire about their well-being and for counselling\n\npurpose. Learned PP also draws attention of this Court to the order dated 17.10.2022\n\nin Cril.Petn. No. 31 of 2021 where this Court was not inclined to quash the FIR on\n\nmere technicalities and directed to complete the investigation within 6(six) months.\n\nHe also prays that the present petition and the application may be rejected being\n\ndevoid of any merit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">[9]           It will be fruitful to discuss case laws on the right to live with dignity. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_6\">In\n\nthe   celebrated   case   of   <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_15\">Kharak Singh v.

It was held that such a provision violated the personal liberty to live with\n\ndignity guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Para 38 is reproduced for a\n\nclear understanding.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        &quot;38. ......

If so understood, all the acts of\n        surveillance under Regulation 236 infringe the fundamental right of the\n        petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_8\">[10]          In the recent case of <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_19\">KS Puttuswamy v.

The only explanation given by the State authorities\n\nis that associates of the present petitioner could not be arrested and hence, the matter\n\ncould not be completed. On the other hand, this Court is conscious of the fact that the\n\noffences under UA(P) Act are serious one relating to the security of the nation and\n\nFIR cannot be quashed on mere technicalities without going to the complete merit of\n\nthe case. The main prayer in the cril. petition is for quashing of the F.I.R No. 208 (04)\n\n2012 IPS<a href=\"/doc/1781202/\" id=\"a_22\"> u/S 17</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1561699/\" id=\"a_23\">20</a> UA(P) Act or to direct the respondents to file charge-sheet within\n\na time frame. This Court is of the view that it will be appropriate and suffice if this\n\nCourt directs the respondents to complete the investigation within a period of 6(six)\n\nmonths from the date of receipt of this order and submit a report under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 173</a>\n\nCr.P.C. to the concerned Court.

In case, the\n\npetitioner fails to appear before the Investigating Officer, necessary steps may be\n\ntaken up by the police for effecting his appearance. This direction is issued keeping in\n\nmind the settled principles of law of maintaining the intricate balance between the\n\nfundamental right to live with dignity of a citizen vis-à-vis the affairs of security of the\n\nState.
