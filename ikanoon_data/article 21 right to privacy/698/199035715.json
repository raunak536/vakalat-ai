The learned\n\nSingle Judge of the Calcutta High Court by a judgment dated\n\n03.11.2017 upheld the Notification dated 31.07.2013. However,\n\nthe Notification dated 10.09.2014 was held to be arbitrary and\n\nunreasonable. Aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Single\n\nJudge, the State of West Bengal filed an appeal before the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court. Some of the Writ Petitioners\n\nwho were aggrieved by the judgment insofar as it related to the\n\nNotification dated 31.07.2013 being upheld also filed appeals.\n\nBy the impugned judgment, a Division Bench of the Calcutta\n\nHigh Court held that both the Notifications dated 31.07.2013\n\nand 10.09.2014 are neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.                The\n\nDivision Bench set aside the judgment of the learned Single\n\nJudge insofar as it related to the Notification dated 10.09.2014\n\nbeing quashed.

In case\n\nof failure to serve for five years, the Appellants were required to\n\nrecompense the college with Rs.25 Lakhs. The above condition\n\nwas included in the brochure for admission to Post-Graduate\n\nMedical Courses for the year 2014-2015.

It was\n\ncontended on behalf of the Appellants that they became\n\nentitled for admission to post-graduate and super Speciality\n\ncourses in the government medical colleges in the State of West\n\nBengal on the basis of their merit in the All India Post Graduate\n\nMedical Entrance Examination (AIPGMEE). According to them,\n\nadditional eligibility conditions cannot be introduced by the\n\nState Government in respect of All India Quota candidates.\n\nImposition of a condition of compulsory service infringes their\n\nfundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_2\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.

As the field\n\nwas already occupied by a Union Legislation, the State\n\nGovernment does not have the competence to legislate on the\n\nsame subject matter.

Consequently, a\n\npolicy decision taken by the State Governments to utilize the\n\nservices of doctors who were beneficiaries of Government\n\nassistance to complete their education cannot be termed\n\narbitrary.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\nB.

Reasonableness is a ground that pervades through the\n\nsubmissions made by the counsel on both sides. In the State of\n\nWest Bengal, the requirement of a compulsory bond was initially\n\na service of one year in the State in default of Rs.10 Lakhs was\n\nto be paid. This was enhanced to three years and Rs.30 Lakhs\n\nby a Notification dated 09.10.2014.   In the State of Tamil Nadu,\n\nthe bond condition was that a doctor has to serve for ten years\n\nin the State and in default of which, the doctor was to pay Rs.2\n\nCrores. This was reduced to two years and Rs.50 Lakhs. The\n\nArmed Forces Medical College imposes a condition of five years\n\ncompulsory service in the Army for post-graduate and super\n\nSpeciality doctors who prosecuted their study in the college.\n\nThey have an option of not serving for five years by\n\nrecompensing the Government by paying Rs.25 Lakhs.           The\n\nmain contention of the counsel appearing for the Appellants is\n\nthat the condition of a long period of service that is imposed is\n\nunreasonable. The basis for the submission is that they have\n\nalready served the society by working in Government hospitals\n\nwhile undergoing their course. Further conditions imposed on\n\nthem would impede the progress of their careers. Restrictions\n\nplaced on their choice of place of work are also unreasonable\n\naccording to them.     An alternate submission made by the\n\ncounsel appearing for the Appellants is that the imposition of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                               27</span>\n\fthe condition of compulsory bond should be reasonable and the\n\nexit clause should be relaxed. Notifications issued by the State\n\nGovernments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a\n\ndefault clause are per se not unreasonable. However, we are in\n\nagreement with the learned counsel for the doctors that the\n\nperiod of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable.\n\nThe State Governments and the Armed Forces Medical College\n\nare directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory\n\nservice period of two years in default of which the Doctors shall\n\nrecompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs.\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 19:</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">20. According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their\n\nprofession which is guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> is violated by\n\nthe compulsory bonds.       They contend that the compulsory\n\nbonds place a restriction on their right to carry on their\n\nprofession on completion of their course.     It is also submitted\n\nthat any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by\n\nthe State Government can be made only by a “law” as per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution. Consequently, the Notifications\n\nthat were issued by the State Governments fall foul of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_74\">Article\n\n19(1)(g).</a> The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at\n\nthe time of their admissions into post-graduate and super\n\nSpeciality courses.

The right to carry on the profession\n\nwould start on the completion of the course.          At the outset,\n\nthere is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive\n\nhigher education. Violation of a right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_75\">Article\n\n19(1)(g)</a> does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a\n\ncollege. There is no doubt, that the condition that is imposed\n\nhas a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on\n\ncompletion of the course.           However, the Appellants have,\n\nwithout any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the\n\ncompulsory bonds. Execution of bonds is part of a composite\n\npackage.     We are in agreement with the judgment of the\n\nCalcutta High Court that the Appellants have not been able to\n\nsucceed in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.

Connol30 wherein he held that:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">      “The     courts    have   never   dreamt   of   enforcing\n\n      agreements strictly personal in their nature, whether\n\n      they are agreements of hiring and service, being the\n\n      common relation of master and servant ….”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">38. Specific performance of contract for personal service is not\n\npermissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_106\">Specific Relief Act</a>, therefore, there cannot\n\nbe a decree for specific performance of a contract of personal\n\nnature.    None of the State Governments have made an attempt\n\nto enforce the contracts entered into by them with the\n\nAppellants through the service bonds. We are not in agreement\n\nwith the submission of Mr. Ahmadi that the compulsory bonds\n\nfall foul of the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_107\">Specific Relief Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">      IV. Restraint on Profession\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">39. The argument advanced on behalf of the Appellants that\n\ncompulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and\n\nthus, would be contrary to <a href=\"/doc/1431516/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act,\n\n1872. The High Court of Calcutta repelled this submission by\n\nholding that the compulsory bond does not amount to any\n\nrestraint on the professional activity of the Appellants. The High\n\nCourt observed that the Appellants are offered the job of\n30 (1880) 14 Ch D 482, 487\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                   39</span>\n\fMedical Officer in the State of West Bengal and that the\n\ncovenant in the compulsory bond operates only during the\n\nperiod of such employment. Relying upon the dictum of Lord\n\nMorris in Esso Petroleum v. Harper’s Garage (Stourport)\n\nLtd.,31 that “if A made a contract under which he willingly\n\nagreed to serve B on reasonable terms for a few years and to\n\ngive his whole working time to B, it would be surprising indeed,\n\nif it were sought to describe the contract as being in restraint of\n\ntrade; in fact, such a contract would very likely be for the\n\nadvancement of trade’, the High Court concluded that a contract\n\nentered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few\n\nyears under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in\n\nrestraint of trade. We are in agreement with the findings\n\nrecorded by the High Court of Calcutta. Therefore, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that the conditions of compulsory bonds for\n\nadmission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in\n\ngovernment medical colleges are not in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1431516/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 27</a>\n\nof the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">40. The upshot of the above discussion is that the Writ\n\nPetitions     and       the   Appeals    deserve   to   be   dismissed.\n\nConsequently, all the Doctors who have executed compulsory\n\nbonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein.\n\n\n31 1967 1 All ER 699.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                    40</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\f41. Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments\n\nhave rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by\n\nthe Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter\n\npertaining to the compulsory bonds, we suggest that suitable\n\nsteps be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of\n\nIndia to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service\n\nto be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government\n\ninstitutions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">42. The Writ Petitions and the Appeals are dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">                                   …................................J.\n                                    [L.
