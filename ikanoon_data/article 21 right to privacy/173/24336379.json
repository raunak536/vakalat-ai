He dropped his bow and arrows on the ground. When he\n\n                     woke up the next morning, he found that one of his arrows had fatally\n\n                     pierced a frog. The frog was about to breathe its last. The anguished\n\n                     Rama asked the frog as to why it did not raise an alarm. The innocent\n\n                     frog replied, “when others hurt me, I call your name “Rama Rama”-but\n\n                     when you are the source of trouble-who else can I call?” .\n\n\n\n                                  2.Any constitutional democracy (the prefix &#x27;constitutional&#x27; is\n\n                     significant.        An authoritarian political arrangement can claim to be\n\n                     people&#x27;s democracy) rests on three pillars. When the individual liberty\n\n                     is threatened by legislative or executive action, one turns to judiciary for\n\n                     relief and remedy. In State of Madras v. V.G.Row (AIR 1952 SC\n\n                     196), Justice M.Patanjali Sastri, C.J. remarked that the Supreme Court\n\n                     had been assigned the role of a sentinel on the qui vive as regards the\n\n                     fundamental rights. I venture to think that this applies with equal force\n\n                     to every court and not just the constitutional courts.\n\n\n\n                                  3.Why such reflections and prefatory remarks?     The petitioner\n\n                     herein is running a Spa in the name and style of “Queen Ayurvedic\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     2/18\n\f                     Cross Spa Centre” at Trichy. Originally, there was no law regulating the\n\n                     said business and no license was required from any governmental\n\n                     authority. Since vide Gazette Notification No.252 dated 16.07.2018,\n\n                     obtaining of license has been made mandatory, the petitioner applied\n\n                     for such license. Since no action was taken on his request, he filed this\n\n                     writ petition for directing the police authority to issue “no objection\n\n                     certificate”.       He also wanted this Court to restrain the police from\n\n                     interfering with the running of the Spa. The petitioner&#x27;s counsel relied\n\n                     on an earlier order dated 12.08.2021 made in WP No.16811 of 2021. A\n\n                     learned Judge of this Court had directed the authorities concerned to\n\n                     issue “no objection certificate”, if the applicant satisfied all the\n\n                     requirements.         In the event of granting such NOC, the respondents\n\n                     were restrained from interfering with the activities of the Spa so long as\n\n                     it is run in accordance with law. I was informed that a number of such\n\n                     orders have been passed. In line with the same, I disposed of the writ\n\n                     petition on 21.12.2021.\n\n\n\n                                  4.While so, the learned Government counsel made a mention that\n\n                     another learned Judge of this Court (His Lordship The Hon&#x27;ble Mr.Justice\n\n                     S.M.Subramaniam), while dealing with a similar writ petition, had issued\n\n                     the following directions vide order dated 20.12.2021 in WP No.37089 of\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     3/18\n\f                     2015 (C.P.Girija vs. The Superintendent of Police, Villupuram District and\n\n                     two others) :\n\n                                              “1)The respondents are directed to issue\n                                       appropriate orders to all the Spa and Massage\n                                       centers, Therapy centers etc., across the State of\n                                       Tamil Nadu to install CCTV cameras which must be\n                                       functional in all circumstances.\n                                              2)Appropriate directions are to be issued to\n                                       ensure that these Spa, Massage centers, Therapy\n                                       centers etc., are conducting their business activities\n                                       in a transparent manner and avoid secluded or\n                                       closed rooms paving way for illegal activities.\n                                              3)In the event of any reasonable suspicion,\n                                       information or complaint, the Police authorities are\n                                       directed to initiate all appropriate actions in the\n                                       manner known to law.”\n\n                     The learned Government counsel felt that it was his bounden duty to\n\n                     bring it to my notice about the passing of such an order a day prior to\n\n                     the disposal of the present writ petition.\n\n\n\n                                  5.I wondered if I should recall the order earlier passed and refer\n\n                     the matter to My Lord the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n                     Court in S.Kasi vs. State (AIR 2020 SC 2921) had held that a\n\n                     coordinate Bench cannot take a contrary view and that it can only refer\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     4/18\n\f                     the matter for consideration by a Larger Bench. But where the law has\n\n                     already been laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, in view of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_2\">Article\n\n                     141</a> of the Constitution of India, one is obliged to follow the same.\n\n\n\n                                  6.In my humblest opinion, and I say this with the greatest of\n\n                     respect to my revered brother Judge, the judgment in C.P Girija v.\n\n                     The Superintendent of Police and Others appears to run counter to\n\n                     the law laid down by the 9-judge bench judgment of the Hon’ble\n\n                     Supreme Court in K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India, (2017) 10\n\n                     SCC 1. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution guarantees to all persons the\n\n                     fundamental right to privacy. Through a unanimous verdict, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n                     Supreme Court declared in ringing terms that the right to life and\n\n                     personal liberty guaranteed in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> also includes implicitly within it\n\n                     a right to privacy. This right to privacy is seen as both possessing\n\n                     inherent value in that it is important for every person’s basic dignity,\n\n                     and also instrumental value in that it furthers a person’s ability to live\n\n                     life free of interference. The Court held that privacy as guaranteed in\n\n                     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> takes several different forms-it includes a right to bodily\n\n                     autonomy, a right to informational privacy and a right to a privacy of\n\n                     choice. The installation of CCTV equipment inside premises such as a\n\n                     spa would unquestionably infract upon a person’s bodily autonomy.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     5/18\n\f                     These are inviolable spaces where the prying eye of the state simply\n\n                     cannot be allowed to enter.\n\n\n\n                                  7.The following observations from the judgment in Puttaswamy\n\n                     are apposite:\n\n                                               “While the legitimate expectation of privacy\n\n                                         may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and\n\n                                         from the private to the public arena, it is important to\n\n                                         underscore that privacy is not lost or surrendered\n\n                                         merely because the individual is in a public\n\n                                         place.” (Chandrachud, J, at para 3(f) of his\n\n                                         conclusion)\n\n\n\n                                               “The entitlement to such a condition is not\n\n                                         confined only to intimate spaces such as the\n\n                                         bedroom or the washroom but goes with a person\n\n                                         wherever he is, even in a public place.” (J. Bobde at\n\n                                         para 22)\n\n\n\n                     The judgment in CP Girija directs the installation of CCTV cameras not in\n\n                     public spaces but in what are intimate, private spaces. It is clear from\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     6/18\n\f                     the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgment that any invasion of life or\n\n                     personal liberty must meet the three-fold requirement of (i) legality,\n\n                     which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\n\n                     legitimate state aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a rational\n\n                     nexus between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them. In\n\n                     the first place, unless a legislature mandates by law that CCTV cameras\n\n                     ought to be installed in a certain space, to do so would violate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article\n\n                     21.</a>           In this case, the notification issued by the Government\n\n                     contemplates installation of CCTV cameras only at the entry and exit\n\n                     points. It consciously caveats that this would be without prejudice to\n\n                     the individual&#x27;s privacy. Thus, the executive while enacting subordinate\n\n                     legislation has been conscious of the privacy concerns of the citizens.\n\n                                  8.No right including a fundamental right can be absolute. But the\n\n                     restrictions can be put in place only by the legislature or the executive.\n\n                     The sweep and the reach of the fundamental rights cannot be curtailed\n\n                     by any judicial measure. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court alone can do so in\n\n                     exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution. A decision\n\n                     to install a CCTV camera which has a bearing on a person’s privacy\n\n                     requires the most careful of considerations—it requires the government\n\n                     to apply its mind prudently and determine what manner of regulations\n\n                     ought to be put in place for its proper use.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     7/18\n\f                                  9.The right to life and personal liberty enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of\n\n                     the Constitution of India includes the right to relax.        This right can be\n\n                     exercised in a variety of forms. The Puttaswamy verdict posits that\n\n                     there are three essential features of privacy – repose, sanctuary and\n\n                     intimate decisions.            “Repose” refers to freedom from unwarranted\n\n                     attention, “sanctuary” refers to the freedom of keeping things to oneself\n\n                     and “intimate decisions” refers to the freedom of autonomy to make\n\n                     personal life choices. The right of an individual to avail means of\n\n                     relaxation (in this case, via spa) falls within the ambit of the right of\n\n                     repose and sanctuary. Therefore, any intrusion into the right to relax\n\n                     shall necessarily have to satisfy the test of legality, legitimate aim and\n\n                     proportionality.\n\n\n\n                                  10.The Commissioner, Greater Chennai Corporation had issued\n\n                     Notification under <a href=\"/doc/127922880/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 373</a> of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation\n\n                     Act, 1919 and the same was also published in Tamil Nadu Government\n\n                     Gazette No.9, dated 27.02.2019.

When the executive notification\n\n                     itself contemplates that Spa/Massage parlours should have partitions or\n\n                     rooms, there is no need to issue a further direction that the licensees\n\n                     should conduct their business activities in a transparent manner and\n\n                     avoid secluded or closed rooms.           One can take judicial notice of the\n\n                     fact that after a massage session, the customer might prefer to take a\n\n                     soothing hot water bath. That is why, the aforesaid notification refers to\n\n                     Sauna/bathing facilities. They have to be necessarily in closed rooms.\n\n                     There cannot be transparency in such matters.\n\n                                  11.Suspicion that immoral activities are taking place in massage\n\n                     centres cannot be reason enough to intrude into an individual&#x27;s right to\n\n                     relax for it intrinsically is part and parcel of his fundamental right to\n\n                     privacy. The question of whether concerns of breach of morality can be\n\n                     made a ground for intruding into one&#x27;s private space was pondered over\n\n                     in Govind v. State of MP (AIR 1975 SC 1378). While the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n                     Supreme Court did not answer this question, it did however set forth a\n\n                     principle. Para 22 of the judgment is as follows:\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     11/18\n\f                                            “If the court does find that a claimed right is\n                                           entitled to protection as a fundamental privacy\n                                           right, a law infringing it must satisfy the compelling\n                                           state interest test. Then the question would be\n                                           whether a state interest is of such paramount\n                                           importance as would justify an infringement of the\n                                           right. Obviously, if the enforcement of morality were\n                                           held to be a compelling as well as a permissible\n                                           state interest, the characterisation of a claimed right\n                                           as a fundamental privacy right would be of far less\n                                           significance.”\n\n\n                     When Govind decision was rendered, privacy was not recognised as a\n\n                     fundamental right.         Post Puttaswamy judgment, privacy right can be\n\n                     curtailed only on grounds set out therein. Morality cannot be invoked\n\n                     as a mere incantation to justify such curtailment. This was also the\n\n                     essence of the landmark “<a href=\"/doc/122787211/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 377</a>” verdict of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n                     Court in which it was held that in matters of one&#x27;s private affairs,\n\n                     constitutional morality shall trump public morality.           (Navtej Singh\n\n                     Johar and Ors. vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

The Writ Appeal\n\n                     was filed by the appellant after suffering an order of writ of mandamus\n\n                     under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India for removal of the Closed\n\n                     Circuit Television Units (CCTVs) installed in the rest room and lockers\n\n                     room.        The Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench observed that such installation is\n\n                     not only objectionable but also impermissible in law in light of\n\n                     Puttaswamy judgment.           The essence of Puttaswamy was summarised\n\n                     in the following terms :\n\n                                        “....the right to privacy is a fundamental right that\n                                  does not need to be separately articulated, but can be\n                                  derived from <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_13\">, 19</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">&amp; 21</a> of the Constitution of\n                                  India; that it is a natural right that subsists as an integral\n                                  part to the right to life and liberty; that it is a fundamental\n                                  and inalienable right and attaches to the person covering all\n                                  information about that person and the choices that he/she\n                                  makes; that it protects an individual from the scrutiny of the\n                                  State in their home, of their movements and over their\n                                  reproductive choices, choice of partners, food habits, etc.,\n                                  therefore, any action by the State that results in an\n                                  infringement of the right of privacy is subject to judicial\n                                  review, in the case on hand, since there is no infringement\n                                  of privacy by the State, the first respondent/writ petitioner\n                                  cannot lay their claim before this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226</a> of\n                                  the Constitution of India.

Time has come\n\n                     to look beyond.           Priscilla M Regan in her seminal work “Legislating\n\n                     Privacy”, highlights the importance of developing and understanding of\n\n                     the social importance of privacy.        She conceptualizes privacy as a value\n\n                     and as a goal of public policy.\n\n\n\n                                  14.In the decision reported in 2015 (1) MLJ 308 (Masti\n\n                     Health and Beauty Private Limited vs. The Commissioner of\n\n                     Police Chennai City), a learned Judge of this Court disposed of a\n\n                     similar writ petition in the following terms :\n\n                                            “67.In the light of the above, all the writ petitions\n                                      are disposed of to the following effect:\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n                     14/18\n\f                                        (i) The respondents shall not, as a matter of\n                                  routine and without any basis, conduct any raids and\n                                  interfere with the business carried on by the petitioners;\n                                        (ii) In specific cases where the police have\n                                  reasonable   grounds    to   believe   that   an   offence\n                                  punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/69064674/\" id=\"a_16\">Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act</a>\n                                  has been or is being committed, it is open to the police\n                                  to take action, after scrupulously following all the steps\n                                  indicated in <a href=\"/doc/129231558/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 15</a> of the said Act.
