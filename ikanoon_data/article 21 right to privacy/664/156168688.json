With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the Income Tax Returns, this Commission refers to the\njudgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in SLP(C)\nNo. 27734 of 2012 titled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_8\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central\nInformation Commission</a> &amp; ors., wherein, it has been held as under:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">         &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n         whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n         &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n         the RTI Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">         13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n         the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n         issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                          Page 2 of 7</span>\n          censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information\n         as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The\n         performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily\n         a matter between the employee and the employer and normally\n         those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under\n         the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has\n         no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the\n         other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted\n         invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n         the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n         Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the\n         larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information,\n         appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim\n         those details as a matter of right.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">         14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n         &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure\n         under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a\n         larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or\n         the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n         satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n         such information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_4\">7.     The present matter wherein the appellant has sought the details of the\nIncome Tax Returns filed by his estranged wife Smt. Parul Shukla can be\ndistinguished from the decision dated 15-05-2018 of the Division Bench of the\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh on the premise that in that matter the\ninformation was sought regarding an employee&#x27;s salary from the employer being a\ngovernment department i.e. the BSNL which otherwise was obliged to disclose the\nremuneration of its employee in view of <a href=\"/doc/1493389/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 4(1)(b)(x)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nand no direction was given by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh to\ndisclose the Income Tax Returns of the employee. Moreover, the decision of the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_13\">Girish Ramachandra Deshpande</a> (supra)\nwas only distinguished with regard to the limited point that wife was entitled to\nknow the remuneration details of her husband. No other opinion/decision was\nconveyed regarding other personal information. Therefore, this Commission does\nnot agree with the contentions put forth by the appellant for disclosure of income\ntax returns of his wife.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">8.     Henceforth, the issue to be decided is whether the appellant claiming to be\nthe legally wedded husband of his estranged wife Smt. Parul Shukla is entitled to\nseek details of her income tax returns. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_5\">In this regard, it is apt to mention the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                         Page 3 of 7</span>\n decision dated 01-07-2009 of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in W.P.(C)\n803/2009 titled as <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_14\">Vijay Prakash v. UOI &amp; others</a> wherein it has been clarified\nthat in a private dispute between husband and wife, the basic protection afforded\nby virtue of the exemption from disclosure enacted under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> cannot be\nlifted or disturbed unless the petitioner is able to justify how such disclosure would\nbe in &#x27;public interest&#x27;. In the matter at hand, the appellant has not succeeded in\nestablishing that the information sought is for larger public purpose.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_7\">9.      Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, this\ninformation cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger public\ninterest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated 11-06-2015\nrendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 8753 of 2013\ntitled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_16\">Shailesh Gandhi v.

I am afraid the said contention is thoroughly\n          misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can be no stretch of\n          imagination be said to be a public activity, but is an obligation\n          which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes and since the\n          said information is held by the Income Tax Department in a\n          fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed to be revealed\n          unless the pre-requisites for the same are satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_8\">10.

Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to\n      the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n      W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n      returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n      Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n      Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and information\n      provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public activity.&quot; In my\n      view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of filing\n      returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity.\n      The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public\n      nature and not necessarily act done in compliance of a statute.

There is no public activity involved in filing a\n     return or an individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n     authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n     assessee could not be disclosed.
