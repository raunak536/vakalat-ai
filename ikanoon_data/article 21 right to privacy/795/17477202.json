On 25.07.2023, she had gone to the college\n\n    where the appellant met her and told her that he wanted to talk\n                  rt\n    her, but she declined to listen his words and went to attend the\n\n    class. While, she was in the class, the appellant entered and\n\n    threatened her and asked her not to talk with the boys of her\n\n\n    class and also questioned as to why she had been sitting on the\n\n    conductor seat. However, she told him that he had nothing to do\n\n\n\n\n    with where she sits. On this, the appellant slapped her and went\n\n\n\n\n\n    away from the class. It was further alleged that on the same day\n\n    at about 2.00 p.m., she went to her home in a bus and alighted\n\n\n\n\n\n    at Dangel from where her house was at a walking distance and\n\n    while she was on her way and crossing &#x27;nala&#x27; at Dangel, the\n\n    appellant, who had already been hiding himself forcibly dragged\n\n    her and gagged her mouth with the hands and laid down her on\n\n    the ground and committed rape. Thereafter, the appellant fled\n\n    away from the spot and she went to her house where only her\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 23/09/2023 20:33:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       3</span>\n\n\n\n    younger sister and brother were present.

On finding a prima facie case, the appellant was\n\n\n\n\n    charge-sheeted for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 376</a> of\n\n\n\n\n\n    IPC to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">    5.             The prosecution examined as many as 21 witnesses\n\n\n\n\n\n    and closed its evidence. Thereafter, the appellant was examined\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. in which he denied the prosecution\n\n    story and pleaded his innocence. Then, the appellant was called\n\n    upon to enter his defence, but he did not lead any evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">    6.             The learned Court below after evaluating the\n\n    evidence convicted and sentenced          the appellant to undergo\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 23/09/2023 20:33:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                      4</span>\n\n\n\n    rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of\n\n    Rs.20,000/- and in default of payment of fine, he was further\n\n    directed to undergo simple imprisonment for two years for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">    offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 376</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">    7.

It is vehemently argued by Shri Vinod Gupta,\n\n    Advocate, for the appellant that it was neither the case of the\n                   rt\n    prosecution that the appellant intended to forcibly marry the\n\n    prosecutrix-PW-17 without her consent or that the prosecutirx did\n\n    not intend to marry the appellant and it was in this background\n\n\n    that the entire evidence was required to be appreciated by the\n\n    learned Court below, but it failed to do so. The learned Court\n\n\n\n\n    below failed to appreciate that the appellant had been framed by\n\n\n\n\n\n    the parents of the prosecutrix just to get rid of the appellant as\n\n    they were not in favour of relationship of the appellant and the\n\n\n\n\n\n    prosecutrix, as is evident      from the testimonies of PW-3 and\n\n    PW-5, father and mother of the prosecutrix, respectively. It is\n\n    further argued that the learned Court below has placed undue\n\n    reliance and believed the version of the prosecutrix as a gospel\n\n    truth, whereas, the story projected by the prosecutrix is highly\n\n    improbable. The prosecutrix has made major improvements in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 23/09/2023 20:33:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    5</span>\n\n\n\n    her statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. Ext. PW-17/A and her\n\n    statement    on oath as PW-17 from her            original statement\n\n    Ext.PW-4/A Rapat No. 49A and also from the statement under\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">    <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 154</a> Cr.P.C.

Lastly, it is argued that there are major\n\n    contradictions in the testimonies of the witnesses and since the\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n    prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,\n\n    the appellant ought to be acquitted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">                   rt\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">    9.          On the other hand, Shri I.N. Mehta, learned Senior\n\n    Additional Advocate General, while supporting            the judgment\n\n    rendered by the learned Court below, would argue that since the\n\n\n    same is based upon correct appreciation of the statements of\n\n    the witnesses as well as documents that have come on record,\n\n\n\n\n    no interference is called for and the judgment needs to be upheld.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">    10.

Since, all the contentions raised by the appellant are\n\n    intrinsically inter-connected and inter-related, therefore, the same\n\n    are taken up together for consideration. However, before doing\n\n    so, we need to minutely scrutinize the testimony of the\n\n    prosecutrix as also other statements, be it that of PW-3 Jivan\n\n    Ram father of prosecutrix or for that matter mother of prosecutrix\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 23/09/2023 20:33:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n    PW-5 Parvati Devi, which are based merely on hearsay of the\n\n    prosecutrix and could at best be used only for corroborative\n\n    purpose.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">                                                               .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">    12.          The prosecutrix   appeared in the witness box                as\n\n    PW-17 and stated that she was a student of B.Sc 2nd year in\n\n\n\n\n\n    Govt. Degree College, Bassa Gohar, District Mandi. On\n\n    25.07.2013, she had gone to attend the classes and on the way,\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n    the appellant met her firstly at Chail Chowk and later in the\n\n    college where he asked her to stop in the college on the pretext\n                   rt\n    that he wanted to talk her. He disclosed that because of her, he\n\n    had remained in jail for 14 days. He further disclosed that his\n\n    uncle had also narrated this fact to the appellant at Chail Chowk.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">    Appellant caught hold of her from the neck in the college, as a\n\n    result of which, her locket broke. Then, appellant left the college\n\n\n\n\n    and she went to attend the class. In five minutes, the appellant\n\n\n\n\n\n    came in the class and asked her why she used to sit on the\n\n    conductor seat in the bus and talk with the male class fellows.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">    She replied that she was free to talk with anyone or sit anywhere.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">    On this, the appellant slapped her and left the class room. She\n\n    further stated that she had boarded the bus to reach her home\n\n    and after getting down at Dangel, she started to walk towards her\n\n    house.     When she reached        near a &#x27;nala&#x27; at a place called\n\n    Dangel, then the appellant, who had been hiding in the maize\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 23/09/2023 20:33:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                   7</span>\n\n\n\n    crop field came all of a sudden and caught hold of her arm and\n\n    pushed her on the ground.

The impact of the omission, as is discernible\n\n\n\n\n\n                from the authorities, has to be adjudged in the totality of the\n                circumstances and the veracity of the evidence. The\n\n\n\n\n\n                involvement of the accused persons cannot be determined\n                solely on the basis of what has been mentioned in the FIR.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_136\">    56.         Learned counsel for the appellant would further argue\n\n    that the appellant had all intentions of marrying the prosecutrix and\n\n    the prosecutrix herself was ready to marry the appellant and that is\n\n    why they had joint photograph mark D-1.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 23/09/2023 20:33:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                      39</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">    57.          Assuming for a moment that the prosecutrix and the\n\n    appellant   wanted to marry each other, but the same essentially\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">    does not in any way mean that the prosecutrix             was ready for\n\n    pre-marital sex and had consented to the same. In case, that\n\n\n\n\n\n    would have been so, then there was no occasion for the prosecutrix,\n\n    being a consenting party, to have lodged the FIR, more particularly,\n\n\n\n\n                                      of\n    when there is no eye-witness to the incident.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">    58.\n                    rt\n                 In view of the aforesaid discussion and for the reasons\n\n    stated, we find no infirmity in the judgment passed by the learned\n\n    Court below.
