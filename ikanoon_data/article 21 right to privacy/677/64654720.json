With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the Income Tax Returns, this Commission refers to the\njudgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in SLP(C)\nNo. 27734 of 2012 titled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_9\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.

The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n         whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n         &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n         the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                          Page 2 of 10</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           13.

However, the present matter wherein the appellant has sought the details of\nthe Income Tax Returns filed by his estranged wife Smt. Sravanthi Pippalapally\ncan be distinguished from the aforesaid decision dated 15-05-2018 of the Division\nBench of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh on the premise that in that\nmatter the information was sought regarding an employee&#x27;s salary from the\nemployer being a government department i.e. the BSNL which otherwise was\nobliged to disclose the remuneration of its employee in view of <a href=\"/doc/1493389/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 4(1)(b)(x)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 and no direction was given by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of\nMadhya Pradesh to disclose the Income Tax Returns of the employee.

It was further held that when any personal\n     information sought has no nexus with any public activity or interest,\n     the same is not to be provided. Finding the information sought <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_38\">in that\n     case</a> to be even remotely having no relationship with any public\n     activity or interest and rather being a direct invasion in private life of\n     another, information was denied.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_23\">The full bench of this Court also in\n     Secretary General, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_39\">India Vs. Subhash Chandra\n     Agarwal</a> AIR 2010 Del. 159 has held that the conflict between the\n     right to personal privacy and public interest in the disclosure of\n     personal information is recognized by the legislature by\n     incorporating <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. It was further observed that\n     personal information including tax returns, medical records etc.\n     cannot be disclosed unless the bar against disclosure is lifted by\n     establishing sufficient public interest in disclosure and disclosure\n     even then can be made only after duly notifying the third party and\n     after considering his views.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">13. At this juncture, this Commission deems it appropriate to quote <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 2(n)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 which reads as under:-\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                      Page 7 of 10</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">     &quot;2(n):- &quot;third party&quot; means a person other than the citizen making a\n    request for information and includes a public authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">14. From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, his estranged wife Smt.\nSravanthi Pippalapally being a person other than the RTI applicant surely comes\nwithin the definition of &#x27;third party&#x27;. Moreover, in response to the notice u/<a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n11(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, his estranged wife Smt. Sravanthi Pippalapally has\ndenied her consent on the grounds of harassment by her husband and the in-laws.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_25\">15.

In light of the aforesaid decisions and the legal principles enunciated therein,\nthis Commission after considering the factual matrix of the case is of the opinion\nthat in the absence of any larger public interest in the matter, the appellant is not\nentitled to seek details of the Income Tax Returns filed by his estranged wife Smt.\nSravanthi Pippalapally which is exempted u/<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">17.
