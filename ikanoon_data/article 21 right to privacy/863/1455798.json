The incident was widely\nreported, inter alia, in &#x27;The Hindustan Times&#x27;, Delhi Edition, on 19.9.2002\nunder the caption &quot;Empty coffers drive staff to self-immolation bids&quot;. The\nsaid Chandan Bhattacharya later on succumbed to the burn injuries suffered\nby him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">In this writ petition, the writ petitioner, a public spirited citizen and a\nSupreme Court lawyer, alleged that apart from plight of the employees of\nthe public sector undertakings or the statutory authorities, even the\nteaching and non-teaching staff of Aided and Unaided Schools, Madrassas and\nColleges have been facing a similar fate. We, however, as at present\nadvised do not intend to deal with the same. According to the petitioner,\nfrom a newspaper report it would appear that about 250 employees died due\nto starvation or committed suicide owing to acute financial crisis\nresulting from non-payment of remunerations to them for a long time. The\nreport further goes on to say that the leader of the opposition in the\nBihar Assembly had alleged that over 1000 employees died &quot;due to lack of\nsalary for a period ranging from four months to 94 months&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">In its counter affidavit, the State of Bihar does not deny about the\nfactual statement made in the said writ petition.

It is averred:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;...The Managing Director of the Bihar Panchayati Raj Finance Corporation\nhad initially reported that 3 employees of the Corporation had died, but\nhad not given any details about the date and cause of their deaths. In his\nsubsequent report the Managing Director reported that there was no report\nregarding the suicide or death due to starvation of any employee of the\ncorporation. The Managing Director of the Bihar State Sugar Corporation had\ninitially reported that 4 employees of the Corporation had died for want of\nproper treatment. In this subsequent report the Managing Director has\nreported that the employees&#x27; Union has submitted a list of 241 employees\nwho have died or become disabled. Similarly, the Company Secretary of the\nBihar State Seeds Corporation had initially reported that 4 employees of\nthe Corporation have died during the period when salary was not paid.\nSubsequently, the Company Secretary has reported that 5 employees of the\nCorporation have died for want of proper treatment. However, in view of the\ndiscrepancy in the two reports of these corporations, the concerned\nManaging Directors have been asked to make a thorough investigation into\nthe causes of these deaths and to submit detailed reports in the matter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">I say that the employees Union of the Bihar Handloom, Powerloom and\nHandicrafts Development Corporation has submitted to the Managing Director\nof the Corporation a list of 7 employees and 2 wives of employees who have\ndied. The cause of death of 4 employees has not been specified, while 3\nemployees and 2 wives of employees are stated to have died due to financial\nhardship. The Managing Director of the corporation has reported that no\ncase of suicide or starvation death by employees of their dependents have\nbeen reported to the Corporation but the submissions of the employees union\nis being verified. The Managing Director has been asked to make a thorough\ninvestigation into the causes of these deaths and to submit a detailed\nreport in the matter.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">The records of this case bear out that deaths had occurred owing to\nstarvation or malnutrition. The fact that the employees have not been paid\ntheir salaries for a long time; in some cases for a decade or more; stands\nadmitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">The Affidavit of the State of Bihar, purported to have been based on\nreports of the Managing Director of same Undertaking does not inspire\nconfidence. The statements made therein are self-contradictory and\ninconsistent. It smacks of lack of bona fide and is full of afterthoughts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">The stand of the State of Bihar on law is that having regard to the. fact\nthat most of the undertakings or companies are registered or incorporated\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_1\">Indian Companies Act, 1956</a>, the rights and liabilities of the\nshareholders would be governed by the provisions of the said Act and the\nliability of the said companies cannot be passed on to the State by taking\nrecourse to the doctrine of &#x27;lifting the veil&#x27; or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">Keeping in view the complexity of the matter, this Court appointed Shri\nP.S. Mishra, a senior counsel of this Court, as amicus curiae.  Shri\nAmarendra Sharan also assisted the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">The learned amicus curiae has, inter alia, submitted that the independent\ninvestigation revealed that the head offices of the Government companies\nare situated in rented premises. It was contended that all shares are owned\nby the State and in some of the cases only one share had been allotted in\nthe name of the nominee of the Government of the State of Bihar. The\nallegations of the writ petitioner to the effect that there had been\nstarvation deaths and/or suicide by the employees of the public sector\nundertakings are correct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_4\">Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State\nof Bihar, would submit that having regard to the magnitude of the problem,\nit would be just and proper if liability is directed to be met to the\nextent of 80 per cent by the Union of India and that the State Government\nwill bear the burden to the extent of 10 per cent thereof and the remaining\nmay be realised from the sale of properties belonging to the respective\ncompanies. The learned counsel would submit that pursuant to or in\nfurtherance of a decision of the Full Bench of the Patna High Court in\nC.W..I ( No.5015 of 1996, liquidation proceedings of the Government\ncompanies have been initiated and they are pending before the Company Judge\nof the Patna High Court&#x27;. Mr. Shanti Bhushan would urge that having regard\nto the Well-settled principle of law that a company registered under the\n<a href=\"/doc/153279772/\" id=\"a_2\">Indian Companies Act</a> is a juristic person, its rights and liabilities must\nbe determined in terms thereof and not de&#x27;hors the same.

Having examined the\nmemorandum of association and the Rules of the Society, the Court decided\nthat the control of the State and the Central Government was deep ,and\npervasive and the Society was a mere projection of the State and the\nCentral Government and it was, therefore, an instrumentality or agency of\nthe State and the Central Government and as such an authonty-State within\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 12.</a></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">The principle laid down in the aforementioned cases that if the Government\nacting through its officers was subject to certain constitutional\nlimitations, a fortiori the Government acting through the instrumentality\nor agency of a corporation should equally be subject to the same\nlimitations, was approved by the Constitution Bench and it was pointed out\nthat otherwise it would lead to considerable erosion of the efficiency of\nthe fundamental rights, for in that event the Government would be enabled\nto override the fundamental rights by adopting the stratagem of carrying\nout its function through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation\nwhile retaining control over it.

The State acts\nin a fiduciary capacity. The failure on the part of the State in a case of\nthis nature must also be viewed from the angle that the statutory\nauthorities have failed and/or neglected to enforce the social welfare\nlegislations enacted in this behalf e.g. <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_54\">Payment of Wages Act, Minimum\nWages Act</a> etc. Such welfare activities as adumbrated in Part IV of the\nConstitution of India indisputably would cast a duty upon the State being a\nwelfare State and its statutory authorities to do all things which they are\nstatutorily obligated to perform.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">In &#x27;The constitution, social rights and liberal political justification&#x27;,\nFrank I.

No\ndoubt it may figure as something beyond positive law: &#x27;a &quot;mirror reflecting\nthe national soul&#x27;,&quot; perhaps; an expression of national ideals,\naspirations, and values expected, as such, to &quot;preside and permeate the\nprocesses of judicial interpretation and judicial discretion&quot; throughout\nthe length and breadth of the national legal order. But had bills of rights\nnot also and always registered as direct, regulatory legislation - as laws\nto be enforced like other laws - jurists and scholars the world over would\nnot have conducted their debates over the constitutionalization of social\nrights in the terms that we have grown used to.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">Constitutions, to be sure, are regulatory laws of a special kind, setting\nterms and conditions for the making and execution of all other laws.\nTypically, although not necessarily, some of the. terms and conditions are\ncast in the form of a bill of rights; a list of certain interests of\npersons, upon whom are conferred what are considered to be legal rights,\nnot just background moral claims, to have these interests at least\nnegatively respected, and maybe positively secured and redeemed, by the\nstate&#x27;s legislature and other actions yet to come.&#x27;\n\nThe power of the State in the sphere of exercise of its constitutional\npower including those contained in <a href=\"/doc/1174818/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 298</a> of the Constitution of India\ninheres in it a duty towards public, whose money is being invested <a href=\"/doc/1174818/\" id=\"a_56\">Article\n298</a> of the Constitution of India confers a prerogative upon the State to\ncarry on trade or business While so the State must fulfil its\nconstitutional obligations.

A\nprogressive state is one that is a good host state for global capital. A\nprogressive state is one that protects global capital against political\ninstability and market failures. A progressive state is one that represents\naccountability not so much directly to its peoples, but to the World Bank\nand International Monetary Fund. A progressive state is one that instead of\npromoting would visions of a just international order learns the virtues of\ndebt repayment on schedule.

Therefore, the\nRight to Food doesn&#x27;t make people lazy but busy, enabling them to feed\nthemselves.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">Would the Right to Food be asking for too much from the government, and\nadvocating for big government? The Right to Food in the context of Human\nRights doesn&#x27;t mean that the state is a super-entrepreneur determining and\ncarrying out economic activities according to its own wisdom. It means the\nRight to Feed Oneself, which emphasizes dignity and self-reliance, very\ndifferent from command economics of big government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">Does the Right to Food require a moral revolution of society,  allowing\nhuman rights to become the foundation of interpersonal ethics? The Right to\nFood does require a moral revolution. However, this moral revolution does\nnot concern interpersonal ethics, but the duty to operationalize the\nstate&#x27;s obligations under Economic and Social Human Rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">Is hunger a violation of Human Rights? Lack of access to tood can have many\nreason. If the state fails to respect, protect or fulfill this access,\nunless for lack of resources in a society, this must he termed a violation\nof the human right to food. Very often, the obligations of states vis-a-vis\nthe vulnerable groups and persons are obvious and so is the availability of\nresources in society.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">Is the Right to Food about good governance? Good governance is negotiable,\nHuman Rights are not. The central concept for Human Rights is the concept\nof &quot;violation&quot;, referring to the suppression of vulnerable groups and\nindividuals, whereas the concepts of good governance all too often deal\nwith political theory and statistical indicators. If a country has the\nresources, but people gel marginalized or continue in deprivation, this is\nnot bad government, but oppression, intentional or not. Is the Right to\nFood realized if nobody is hungry anymore? Not necessarily. The Right to\nFood not only means that hunger and malnutrition are eradicated, but that\nfuture malnutrition can be eradicated by court action or other comparable\nmechanisms holding the state accountable on its obligations under the Right\nto Food.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">In Kishen Pattnayak and Am: v.

In no uncertain terms, this Court\nheld that exaction of labour and services against payment of less than the\nminimum wages amounts to forced labour within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 23</a> of\nthe Constitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"699319\" id=\"span_47\">Explaining the rights of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/699319/\" id=\"a_92\">S.M.D. Kiran Pasha v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and\nOrs.</a>, [1990] 1 SCC 328 observed that <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia would be maintainable also when a right is threatened as contra\ndistinguished from the right when infringed. This Court held :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">&quot;In the language of Kelsen the right of an individual is either a mere\nreflex right - the reflex of a legal obligation existing towards this\nindividual; or a private right in the technical sense the legal power\nbestowed upon an individual to bring about by legal action the enforcement\nof the fulfillment of an obligation existing towards him, that is, the\nlegal power. From the above analysis it is clear that in the instant case\nthe appellant&#x27;s fundamental right to liberty is the reflex of a legal\nobligation of the rest of the society, including the State, and it is the\nappellant&#x27;s legal power bestowed upon him to bring about by a legal action\nthe enforcement of the fulfillment of that obligation existing towards him.\nDenial of the legal action would, therefore, amount to denial of his right\nof enforcement of his right to liberty....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"560467\" id=\"span_48\">It is also well-settled that interpretation of the Constitution of India or\nstatutes would change from time to time. Being a living organ, it is\nongoing and with the passage of time, law must change. New rights may have\nto be found out within the constitutional scheme. Horizons of\nconstitutional law are expanding. The necessity to take recourse to such\ninterpretative changes has recently found favour with the Division Bench of\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/560467/\" id=\"a_94\">The State of Maharashtra v. Dr. Praful B. Desai, JT</a> (2003) 3\nSC 382\n\n&quot;13. One needs to set out the approach which a court must adopt in deciding\nsuch questions. It must be remembered that the first duty of the court is\nto do justice.</span> As has been held by this Court in the case of Sri Krishna\nGobe v. Stale of Maharashtra, [1973] 4 SCC 23 courts must endeavour to find\nthe truth. It has been held that there would be failure of justice not only\nby an unjust conviction but also by acquittal of the guilty for unjustified\nfailure to produce available evidence. Of course the rights of the accused\nhave to be kept in mind and safeguarded, but they should not be over\nemphasized to the extent of forgetting that the victims also have rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">14. It must also be remembered that the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_95\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> is an\nongoing statute. The principles of interpreting an ongoing statute have\nbeen very succinctly set out by the leading jurist Francis Bennion in his\ncommentaries titled &quot;Statutory Interpretation&#x27;, 2nd Edition page 617:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">&quot;It is presumed the Parliament intends the court to apply to an ongoing Act\na construction that continuously updates its wordings to allow for changes\nsince the Act was initially framed. While it remains law, it has to be\ntreated as always speaking. This means that in its application on any day,\nthe language of the Act though necessarily embedded in its own time, is\nnevertheless to be construed in accordance with the need to treat it as a\ncurrent law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">In construing an ongoing Act, the interpreter is to presume that Parliament\nintended the Act to be applied at any future time in such a way as to give\neffect to the original intention. Accordingly, the interpreter is to make\nallowances for any relevant charges that have occurred since the Act&#x27;s\npassing, in law, in social conditions, technology, the meaning of words and\nother matters..\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">That today&#x27;s construction involves the supposition that Parliament was\ncatering long ago for a state of affairs that did not then exist is no\nargument against that construction. Parliament, in the wording of an\nenactment, is expected to anticipate temporal developments. The drafter\nwill foresee the future and allow for it in the wording. An enactment of\nformer days is thus to be read today, in the light of dynamic processing\nreceived over the years, with such modification of the current meaning of\nits language as will now give effect to the original legislative intention.\nThe reality and effect of dynamic processing provides the gradual\nadjustment It is constituted by judicial interpretation, year in and year\nout It also comprises processing by executive officials.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"800950\" id=\"span_49\">15. At this stage the words of Justice Bhagwati. in the case of <a href=\"/doc/800950/\" id=\"a_96\">National\nTextile Workers&#x27; Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan</a>, [1983] 1 SCR 922 at page 956,\nneed to be set out. They are:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">&quot;We cannot allow the dead hand of the past to stifle the growth of the\nliving present. Law cannot stand still: it must change with the changing\nsocial concepts and values. If the bark that protects the tree fails to\ngrow and expand along with the tree, it will either choke the tree or if it\nis a living tree, it will shed that bark and grow a new living bark for\nitself. Similarly, if the law fails to respond to the needs of changing\nsociety, then either it will stifle the growth of the society and choke its\nprogress or if the society is vigorous enough, it will cast away the law\nwhich stands in the way of its growth. Law must therefore Constantly be on\nthe move adapting itself to the fast changing society and not lag behind.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">The liability of the shareholders or even a third party in a given case\nwould depend upon the nature of the situation and the extent of the statute\ncovering the same. Participation in the functioning of a company has led to\nan independent liability by the secured creditors under the Comprehensive\nEnvironment Response Compensation and Liability Act, if its involvement\nwith the management of the facility is sufficiently broad to support the\ninference that it could affect hazardous waste disposal decisions although\nit was not currently an owner or operation of the facility within the\nmeaning thereof in United States v. Fleet Factors Corp., 20 ELR 208 )2\n(1990) 901 F 2d 1550. Thus a liability can be fastened both upon the owner\nas also the operator of the company under certain situations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">The right to development in the developing countries is itself a human\nright. The same has been made a part of WTO and GATT  In &#x27;The World Trade\nOrganisation, Law, Practice, and Policy (Oxford) be Matusushita Schoenbaum\nand Mauroidis at page 389, it is stated :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">&quot;The United Nations has proclaimed the existence of a human right to\ndevelopment. This right refers not only to economic growth but also to\nhuman welfare, including health, education, employment, social security,\nand a wide-range of other human needs. This human right to development is\nvaguely defined as a so-called third-generation human right that cannot be\nimplemented in the same way as civil and political human rights. Rather, it\nis the obligation of states and intergovernmental organizations to work\nwithin the scope of their authority to combat poverty and misery in\ndisadvantaged countries.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">[Emphasis supplied]\n\nThe matter may be considered from another angle. While the State expects\nthe industrial houses and multi-national companies to take such measures\nwhich would provide a decent life to the persons living in the society in\ngeneral and to their employees in particular and in that premise it is too\nmuch to ask the State to practice what it preaches? This gives rise to\nanother question. Can the State be so insensitive to the plight of its own\ncitizens in general and the employee of the public sector undertakings in\nparticular?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">The court in a situation of this nature is obligated to issue necessary\ndirections to mitigate the extreme hardship of the employees involving\nviolation of human rights of the citizens of India at the hands of the\nState of Bihar and the government companies and corporations fully owned or\ncontrolled by it. A right to carry on business is subject to compliance of\nconstitutional obligations as also limitations provided for in the\nConstitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1949293\" id=\"span_50\">Financial stringency may not be a ground for not issuing requisite\ndirections when a question of violation of fundamental right arises. This\nCourt has been highlighting this aspect in the matters concerning\nfundamental rights and maintenance of ecology. See <a href=\"/doc/1949293/\" id=\"a_97\">Rural Litigation and\nEntitlement Kendra and Ors. v.

It was also\nurged that the number of mosques is so large that it would entail heavy\nexpenditure which the Boards of different States would not be able to bear.\nWe do not find any correlation between the two. Financial difficulties of\nthe institution cannot be above fundamental right of a citizen. If the\nBoards have been entrusted with the responsibility of supervising and\nadministering the Wakf then it is their duty to harness resources to pay\nthose persons who perform the most important duty namely of leading\ncommunity prayer in a mosque the very purpose for which it is created.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1263230\" id=\"span_53\">[Emphasis supplied]\n\nIn <a href=\"/doc/1263230/\" id=\"a_100\">State of H.P. v.

Only because the Union of India allegedly is repository of\nfunds raised by it through Central excise and other levies and impost, the\nsame by itself would not mean that it is indirectly or vicariously liable\nfor the failings on the part of the State Public Sector Undertakings.\nEither precedentially or jurisprudentially the Union of India cannot be\nheld liable and no such direction can be issued as has been submitted by\nMr. Shanti Bhushan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">The investments made by the State in the public sector undertakings in\npursuit of social justice is from public account. It is in this behalf\naccountable to the public through the legislature.
