An isolated act or commission cannot be\ncharacterised as a habitual act or commission involving breach of peace or law\nand order.  While forming an opinion that the person is believed to be addicted\nto or aid or abet, the commission of crime, whether convicted or not, the Sub-\nInspector of Police and his men have to collect information and that the same\nhas to be ascertained before making a recommendation to an officer of and above\nthe rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, in whose jurisdiction, such person\nis ordinarily resident either permanently or temporarily.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t46.Opening of history sheet in the case of persons convicted for offences\ninvolving imprisonment for life under Chapter XII and XVII and conviction for\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/1119707/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 395</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_12\">402</a>, I.P.C. in the case of prisoners, <a href=\"/doc/329571/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 392</a>\nto <a href=\"/doc/764237/\" id=\"a_14\">394</a>, I.P.C. and under <a href=\"/doc/378408/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 75</a> of the Indian Penal Code, house breaking\ntheft <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 109</a> Cr.P.C., 110 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_17\">Cr.P.C</a>. depending upon the number of convictions\nstated in Police Standing Order 747, is automatic, at the time of conviction of\nsuch persons.  \t\t\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\t47.Whereas, in the case of opening of history sheets for  rowdies as per\nForm 112, where, some persons are classified as rowdies, the orders of the\nSuperintendent of Police or concerned Sub-divisional Officer have to be\nobtained, on the basis of the information and facts ascertained by the Station\nHouse Officer, and his men. Persons who habitually commit, attempt to commit, or\nabet, the commission of offences involving breach of peace or (b) Persons bound\nover under <a href=\"/doc/622891/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 106</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_19\">107</a>, Criminal Procedure Code or (c) Persons who have\nbeen convicted under <a href=\"/doc/19244746/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 75</a> of the Madras City Police Act or twice in two\nconsecutive years, under <a href=\"/doc/159493123/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3</a> Clause 12 of the Town Nuisance Act, or (d)\nPersons either convicted under <a href=\"/doc/95302477/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 49-A</a> of the Madras City Police Act, 1888\n(Madras Act III of 1888) or under Section 4 of the Madras Gaming Act, 1930\n(Madras Act III of 1930), or reasonably suspected to be habitually committing or\nabetting the commission of the offences, are classified as rowdies.  Clause 4 of\nPolice Standing Order 749, enjoins a  duty on the police to enter the names of\nhistory-sheeted rowdies in the station register of a known depredator and that\nrowdies should be checked regularly by beat Police Constable Constables in rural\nPolice Stations and by rowdy patrols in large towns, as also by the Sub-\nInspectors (Law and Order). The checking, however should be discretely done by\nthe method of enquiries and not in the manner of domiciliary checks.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t48.Police Standing Order dealing with opening and retention of History\nSheets in relation to the nature of offences stated in Police Standing Order\n749(2)(a) to (d), makes it explicit that a duty is cast on the Sub-Inspector of\nPolice, Station House Officer/ Inspector of Police and his men to collect,\nverify and ascertain as to whether a person is known or believed to be addicted\nto or aid and abet, the commission of crime and that there should be active\ncriminality, affecting breach of peace or law and order. Criminality, as\nconceived in the police Standing Orders, is commission of offences by the\nindividual or aiding commission of offences or, by inducing/instigating\ncommission of offences by other some person.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t49.History sheet is ordinarily retained for two years, in the case of\npersons convicted of offences mentioned in Police Standing Order 747.  Where\nretention of history sheet is considered necessary after two years of\nregistration, orders of an officer of and above the rank of Assistant\nSuperintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police, must be taken for\nextension in the first instance upto the end of the next December and further\nannual extension from January to December.  Police Standing Orders, thus, makes\nit clear that the conduct and activities of history-sheeted persons shall be\nmonitored for a specified period during which period, they should not come to\nany adverse notice and  the authority empowered to extend the period of\nretaining his name in the history sheet, should have reason to believe that such\nhistory- sheeted person is habitually addicted to or aid or abet, the commission\nof offence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t50.Keeping surveillance or vigil on a history-sheeted person should not be\nmade permanent, mechanically, as it would affect his freedom of life and\nliberty. The discretion conferred on the police is both objective and subjective\nin nature.  Objective satisfaction with reference to the conduct of a history-\nsheeted person, to prevent commission or aiding or abetting of offences, by such\npersons, involving breach of peace or law and order.  The subjective\nsatisfaction should be based on valid materials and it cannot be at the whims\nand fancies of the police officers.  Reading of the Police Standing Order shows\nthat the discretion conferred on the police officers is in-built, subject to the\nlimitations, including a specific period, provided under the said orders and it\nis not for any unlimited period, unless the conduct of the history-sheeted\nperson is required to be monitored continuously.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t51.As the discretionary jurisdiction conferred on the Police Officers to\nopen and retain a history sheet is to curtail his freedom and right of privacy,\nthere should be awareness on the part of the authority and it should be on the\nbasis of surveillance materials, where that a reasonable man would by probable\nreasoning arrive at a conclusion or infer that a person has to be necessarily\nincluded in the History sheet. &#x27;Belief&#x27;, in the case on hand, means a degree of\nconviction of the truth of something especially based on a consideration or\nexamination of the evidence and the authorities vested with discretion of\nopening and retaining history sheets should prove that on the examination of the\ndata that there is awareness on their part indicating their state of mind that\nby probable reasoning, they come to a conclusion or infer, about the conduct of\nperson, for whom a History sheet is opened or retained.  The record of events\nand the materials should be considered with care and the authority concerned\nshould pass an order, reflecting that he has thought over the matter\ndeliberately with care and it has been found necessary, as a result of such\ncareful examination, an order opening or retaining a history sheet is required\nto be passed.\t\t\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t52. The Discretion conferred on the authorities is controlled by factors\nwhich are in built in PSO 746, which states that history sheets can be broadly\nopened in respect of persons who are &quot;known or believed to be addicted to or aid\nand abet the commission of crime, whether convicted or not, or who are believed\nto be habitual receivers&quot;. History sheets can also be re-opened in respect of\nfollowing persons:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t&quot;a)Persons once convicted under any section of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">Indian Penal Code</a> are\nconsidered to be likely to commit crime;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\tb)Persons, not convicted, but believed to be addicted to crime&quot;.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\t53.PSO 747 deals with automatic opening of history sheets at the time of\nconviction for persons convicted and shall be retained for two years after\nrelease from jail. It also deals with opening of a history sheet of a known\ndepredator against whom an order has been passed under <a href=\"/doc/1709471/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 356</a> Cr.P.C., and\nit shall not be closed, until the period during which he is required to report\nchanges of residence, has elapsed.

The names of History\nsheeted rowdies should be entered in the Station check register of KDs and the\nrowdies should be checked regularly by beat police constables in rural police\nstations and by rowdy patrols in large towns as also by the Sub Inspectors (Law\nand Order). The checking however should be discretely done by the method of\nenquiries and not in the manner of domiciliary checks. Inspectors and Divisional\nOfficers when they visit the area should make their own independent enquiries\nand note their findings in the history sheets and in inspection reports, if any.\nAll reports against notorious rowdies entered in the General diary of the\nStation or matters brought to light on enquiries in the petitions should be\nentered against them in the personal sheets and should be dated.\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\t55.As per PSO 748, where retention of a history sheet is considered\nnecessary after two years of registration, orders of an officer of and above the\nrank of Assistant Superintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police must\nbe taken for the extension in the first instance upto the end of the next\nDecember.

The said order states\nthat history sheet of a person who changes his residence to another station\nlimits, shall be forwarded to that station through the Divisional Officer.\n(2)The history sheet of a bad character who changes his residence from police\nstation in the State of Tamil Nadu to a Station in another State shall be\nforwarded by the Station House Officer of the Tamil Nadu Station to the\nSuperintendent of Police, through the usual channel, and the latter shall\nforward the sheet confidentially to the Superintendent of Police of the District\nin which the individual concerned has taken up residence.  Reciprocal\narrangements have been made with other States in this matter and History sheets\nof bad characters who have changed their residence from other States, when\nreceived by the Superintendents of Police from the Police authorities of these\nState will be dealt within accordance with Orders Nos.757, 758, 759 (1).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\t58.As per PSO 762, the surveillance of a suspect, other than ordinary\ncriminal shall be conducted in a confidential manner.  As per PSO 763, persons\nfor whom history sheets have been opened may, at the discretion of the Station\nHouse officer, be entered in the village headman&#x27;s register of known depredators\nand suspects  (Appendix XVIII to the village officer&#x27;s and riot manual, 1931\nedition) and it shall be obligatory upon the village headman to report their\nmovements to the police station.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\t59.Chapter XLIII deals with Surveillance and PSO 764 deals with reporting\nmovements.  As per said order,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">\ti)movements of persons closely watched under order No.752 and of those\nregistered under the <a href=\"/doc/32339738/\" id=\"a_25\">Tamil Nadu Restriction of Habitual Offenders Act, 1948</a>,\nshall be promptly reported by one Station House officer to another (in Enquiry\nRoll Form A) (Form No.118). The receipt of such roll shall be immediately\nacknowledged and a report as to the presence of the bad character made with the\nleast possible delay. If the bad character is a person to be closely watched and\nbecomes a temporary resident within the limits of another station, he should be\nentered by the police of the latter station in the register in Form No.57, vide\norder No.368.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">\tii)The roll shall be retained until the individual moves on,when it will\nbe forwarded to the Station of his destination. If this State is other than the\none at which the criminal is registered, the Station House Officer of the latter\nstation shall be informed of the movement. When persons closely watched under\nOrder No.752 are likely to use the Railway, intimation of their movements should\nalso be given to the nearest Railway Police Station.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">\t60.Police Standing Orders makes it explicit that the Sub Inspector of\nPolice has to make necessary enquiries and ascertain the same before making a\nrequest to the Sub Divisional Officer to open or retain a history sheet. The Sub\nDivisional Officer or the Superintendent of Police after consideration of the\nsurveillance report should arrive at a reasonable conclusion, as to the\nexistence of materials warranting retention of the rowdy list. The discretion\nconferred on the police authorities under the Police Standing Orders is to\nsubserve the object, viz., to control the prevention of crime and protection to\nothers from crime and the surveillance data has to be carefully examined by the\nStation House Officer or the Competent Person, while recommending opening or\nretaining a rowdy list.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t61.Thus it could be seen, that an elaborate procedure and the manner in\nwhich the surveillance data has to be collected and ascertained,  are set out in\nthe Police Standing Orders. Intimation of the movements of the persons closely\nwatched under PSO 752 is also given to the nearest railway police stations.\nNeedless to say that when movements of the persons are watched, there is an\ninvasion of right of privacy. This intrusion of privacy is authorised to\ncontrol, prevention of crime and to protect others from crime and if the person\nagainst whom the history sheet is opened is free from any taint or suspicion for\nover a considerable period of time, the Sub Divisional Officers/Superintendent\nof Police has to exercise his discretion in favour of those branded as rowdy, so\nas to allow himself to be free in the best interest of the society.  The Sub\nDivisional Officers should not be swayed away by any bald statement of his\nsubordinates seeking opening or retention of history sheets, unless it is\nconsidered necessary or where an automatic opening of history sheet is\nnecessary, as in the case of conviction for the offences stated in the police\nstanding orders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\t62. In a situation of this nature, keeping in mind the nature of the\nduties required to be performed by the law enforcing agencies, the discretion to\nbe exercised by the second respondent should be on sound principles of fairness,\nreasonableness and it should be in accordance with the object sought to be\nachieved while opening or retaining a rowdy history sheet.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">\t63...\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">\t64. The power has to be exercised with regard to the duty arising from the\nnature of the action to be performed by the Sub-Divisional Officers. The\nconditions on the basis of which the power has to be exercised and the\nrepercussions or consequences of such exercise on the price and freedom of the\nindividual has to considered. It has to borne in mind, that the power exercised,\nrestricts the freedom and liberty of an individual.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\t65. The criteria for opening a history sheet therefore, is the subjective\nsatisfaction of the authority and it has to be arrived at, on the reasonable\nbelief or knowledge that the person, for whom the history sheet is opened or\nretained, is habitually addicted or aid or abet, the Commission of Crime,\nwhether convicted or not etc.  While arriving at the subjective satisfaction,\ncurrent doings in other words, the activities of such persons which are\ninformative and useful, based on the facts ascertained both by the Sub-Inspector\nand his men from the date of last entry shall be made month-wise for close watch\nof characters and quarterly for non-close watch of characters.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">\t8. Reverting back to the case on hand, it could be deduced from the\nsupporting affidavit that there were three criminal cases pending against the\npetitioner between 2009-2011. The contention of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that a person can be included or retained in the History Sheet, only\nif there is any breach of peace or tranquility, cannot be countenanced in law,\nas Police Standing Orders do not impose such a stringent condition.  What is\nrequired to be considered by the Police Officers is adherence to the provisions\nfrom PSO 746 to 749.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">\t9. To countenance the submission of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, this Court deems it fit to extract few decisions, which explain the\nexpressions &quot;Law and Order&quot;, &quot;Public Order, Peace and Public Tranquility&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_2\">(a) On the aspect of &quot;public safety&quot;, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_26\">Romesh\nThappar Vs.

The largest of them\nrepresented law and order, next represented public order and the smallest\nrepresented the security of the State.

Disturbance of public order is\nto be distinguished from acts directed against individuals which do not disturb\nthe society to the extent of causing a general disturbance of public\ntranquility. It is the degree of disturbance and its effect upon the life of the\ncommunity in a locality which determines whether the disturbance amounts only to\na breach of law and order. Take for instance, a man stabs another. People may be\nshocked and even disturbed, but the life of the community keeps moving at an\neven tempo, however much one may dislike the act. Take another case of a town\nwhere there is communal tension. A man stabs a member of the other community.\nThis is an act of a very different sort. Its implications are deeper and it\naffects the even tempo of life and public order is jeopardized because the\nrepercussions of the act embrace large sections of the community and incite them\nto make further breaches of the law and order and to subvert the public order.\nAn act by itself is not determinant of its own gravity.

In the light of what has been observed\nabove, we have no doubt that each one of the incidents of September 26, 1971 and\nNovember 4, 1971, was prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.

While the expression &quot;law and order&quot; is wider in\nscope inasmuch as contravention of law always affects order, &quot;public order&quot; has\na narrower ambit, and public order could be affected by only such contravention\nwhich affects the community or the public at large. Public order is the even\ntempo of life of the community taking the country as a whole or even a specified\nlocality. The distinction between the areas of &quot;law and order&quot; and &quot;public\norder&quot; is one of the degree and extent of the reach of the act in question on\nsociety. It is the potentiality of the act to disturb the even tempo of life of\nthe community which makes it prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order.\nIf a contravention in its effect is confined only to a few individuals directly\ninvolved as distinct from a wide spectrum of the public, it could raise problem\nof law and order only. It is the length, magnitude and intensity of the terror\nwave unleashed by a particular eruption of disorder that helps to distinguish it\nas an act affecting &quot;public order&quot; from that concerning &quot;law and order&quot;. The\nquestion to ask is:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">&quot;Does it lead to disturbance of the current life of the community so as to\namount to a disturbance of the public order or does it affect merely an\nindividual leaving the tranquility of the society undisturbed?&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">This question has to be faced in every case on its facts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\t8. &quot;Public order&quot; is what the French call &quot;ordre publique&quot; and is\nsomething more than ordinary maintenance of law and order.

In one\ncase it might affect specific individuals only, and, therefore, touches the\nproblem of law and order only, while in another it might affect public order.\nThe act by itself, therefore, is not determinant of its own gravity.

Powers exercised by the Police officers in opening and retaining\nHistory / Rowdy sheets cannot be narrowed down or crippled only to the extent of\nactivities effecting public peace and tranquility.  Police standing orders\nconfer powers on the authorities, to take into consideration the larger meaning\nto the expression &quot;public order&quot;, which also includes public peace and\ntranquility.  Merely because there is absence of public peace and public\ntranquility, those involved in crimes, cannot claim any indefeasible right that\nhis name should be removed from the History / Rowdy sheet.

The contention that the Police Officers are precluded from exercising\ntheir discretion to arrive at a subjective satisfaction for opening or retention\nof History / Rowdy sheet, except under the circumstances of breach of peace and\ntranquility, cannot be countenanced. Maintenance of public peace and tranquility\nis also the duty of the law enforcing agencies to maintain public order and that\nit may also be taken into consideration as one of the factors to monitor a\nperson.  Breach of public peace and tranquility cannot be the only decisive\nfactor, to be considered for opening or removal of the person&#x27;s name from the\nHistory sheet. Danger to peace and public tranquility is inbuilt in maintenance\nof public order.  The Police has to play an important and effective role in\nmaintenance of public order and in the matter of opening and retention of\nHistory Sheet, they cannot be restricted to arrive at a conclusion, only on the\nbasis of breach of peace and tranquility, which has a limited meaning and which\nis within the scope and connotation of the expression &quot;Public Order&quot;.\nPotentiality to disturb public peace and tranquility is also a ground to monitor\nactivities of a person, by the Police, even if a person is not involved in a\ncrime, which would be essentially one of the functions of the police, but that\nhas to be done, only when there are adequate materials to exercise that\ndiscretion, otherwise, it would be affecting right of privacy of an individual.\nThe conduct leading to breach of peace or public tranquility or likely to cause,\nmay also be one of the factors to keep monitoring for any specified period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">\t12.

Mere acquittal\nin criminal cases does not mean that surveillance is not required. Police\nStanding Orders dealing with the opening or retention of the History Sheet\nspecifically states that if there are materials to indicate that a person is\nknown or believed to be addicted to or to aid and abet the commission of crime,\nwhether convicted or not convicted or believed to be habitual offender, then,\nretention of the petitioner&#x27;s name in the History Sheet is permissible. In any\nevent, it may not be for a permanent period, but, it may be for a specified\nperiod, to be reviewed periodically, and if the authority, after considering all\nthe materials, including current doings, arrives at a conclusion that the name\nhas to be deleted from the history sheet, it should be done immediately.  In\nsuch an event, display of the photograph should be removed, but a record, with\nthe photograph, should be maintained in the office or in the District Crime\nRecord Bureau. It should not be presumed that a person included in the History\nSheet will always indulge in criminal activities.  Reformation is possible, even\nin the case of a hard core criminal. If the photographs of all the persons,\naddicted to or abet the crime and convicted have to be displayed in public\nplaces, it would be long list. Only those who fall within the parameters of the\nPolice Standing Orders should be maintained in the respective Police Stations\nand the District Crime Record Bureau and   after proper consideration of their\ncurrent doings, their photographs may be displayed to caution the general\npublic.  On the aspect of displaying their photographs, this Court in Ganesan\ncase cited supra at para 67 has held as follows;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t&quot;67.\tBranding a person as a history sheeted rowdy has a tainted image in\nthe society as compared to others. Needless to say that his relationship with\nothers and the prospects of personal development may not remain the same.\nCharacterisation of a person is stigmatic, if any photographs is displayed in\nsome conspicuous places in the area where he resides, or in public places, and\nit affects not only his personal rights, but there is every likelihood of damage\nbeing caused to the members of his family and it cannot be lost sight of.\nInnocent children of such persons could be even looked down, if the officer,\nmechanically under the guise of prevention of crime and to protect others, open\nor extend history sheets, which has an impact on the right of privacy of not\nonly the individual against whom the order is passed, but also causes harm to\nother person&#x27;s rights.  Therefore, a fair and reasonable decision should be\ntaken, taking into consideration the Constitutional rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India and the interests of the State. It should be noted\nthat at time of opening a history sheet, the individual is not informed of the\ndecision taken by the authorities behind his back and that the information\ncollected is discreet. Needless to say that every person wants to live with\ndignity and he cannot be condemned arbitrarily. It is also to be borne in mind\nthat estrangement of the members of a history sheeted rowdy, in social\ngatherings, etc., is not uncommon in our society.  Therefore, opening or\nretention of history sheets, which interferes with the right of privacy of a\nperson, should be done strictly adhering to the parameters inbuilt in the Police\nStanding Orders, keeping in mind the object sought to be achieved.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"251249\" id=\"span_26\">13.

Sharma v.\nSatish Chandra</a> , AIR 1954 SC 300, the Supreme Court held that there is no\njustification to import the right to privacy into our Constitution by a process\nof strained construction, analogous to American Fourth Amendment, it was for the\nfirst time in the year 1963 that the right to privacy was recognised as part of\nthe right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, in the minority view\nexpressed by Justice Subba Rao in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_61\">Kharak Singh v. State of U.P.</a> , AIR 1963 SC\n1295. Though the majority view was otherwise, Justice Subba Rao held that the\nconcept of liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 21</a> was comprehensive enough to include privacy and\nthat a person&#x27;s house, where he lives with his family is his &quot;castle&quot; and that\nnothing is more deleterious to a man&#x27;s physical happiness and health than a\ncalculated interference with his privacy . The following extract from the\nminority view expressed by Justice Subba Rao and Justice Shah in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_63\">the said\njudgment</a>, laid the foundation for the development of the Law relating to the\nright to privacy:</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\t&quot;The Scientific methods used to condition a man&#x27;s mind are in a real sense\nphysical restraints, for they engender physical fear channelling one&#x27;s actions\nthrough anticipated and expected grooves. So also the creation of conditions\nwhich necessarily engender inhibitions and fear complexes can be described as\nphysical restraints. Further, the right to personal liberty takes in not only a\nright to be free from restrictions placed on his movements, but also free from\nencroachments on his private life.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_30\">10. The right to privacy came into focus in a much more pronounced way in\n<a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_64\">Govind v. State of M.P. And Others</a> , 1975 (2) SCC 148. Recognising that the\nright to privacy is not explicit in our Constitution, the Supreme Court held in\nparagraph-23 of <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_65\">the said judgment</a> as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\t&quot; 23. Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any system of\nlimited Government, is protected in part under our Constitution by explicit\nConstitutional guarantees. &quot;In the application of the Constitution our\ncontemplation cannot only be of what has been but what may be&quot;. Time works\nchanges and brings into existence new conditions. Subtler and far-reaching means\nof invading privacy will make it possible to be heard in the street what is\nwhispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition of privacy raises serious\nquestion about the propriety of judicial reliance on a right that is not\nexplicit in the Constitution . Of course, privacy primarily concerns the\nindividual. It therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty.\nThe most serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious\nproblems of defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights and values&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\t11. After holding that the right to privacy must encompass and protect the\npersonal intimacies of the home, family, marriage, mother hood, procreation and\nchild rearing, the Supreme Court went on to hold in the same judgment that a\nclaimed right must be a Fundamental Right implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty . In paragraphs 25 and 27, the Supreme Court expounded the theory\nfurther, on the following lines:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\t&quot; 25. Rights and freedoms of citizens are set forth in the Constitution in\norder to guarantee that the individual, his personality and those things stamped\nwith his personality shall be free from official interference except where a\nreasonable basis for intrusion exists. &quot;Liberty against Government&quot;, a phrase\ncoined by Professor Corwin expresses this idea forcefully. In this sense, many\nof the Fundamental Rights of Citizens can be described as contributing to the\nright to privacy.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\t&quot; 27. There are two possible theories for protecting privacy of home. The\nfirst is that activities in the home harms others only to the extent that they\ncause offence resulting from the mere thought that individuals might be engaging\nin such activities and that such &#x27;harm&#x27; is not constitutionally protectible by\nthe State. The second is that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they\ncan be free from societal control. The importance of such a sanctuary is that\nindividuals can drop the mask, desist for a while from projecting on the World\nthe image they want to be accepted themselves, an image that may reflect the\nvalues of their peers rather than the realities of their natures.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_31\">12.

But the question which arises is whether the right to life is limited\nonly to protection of limb or faculty or does it go further and embrace\nsomething more.

Every act which offends against or\nimpairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to\nlive and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and just\nprocedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_33\">14. <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_72\">R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> , 1994 (6) SCC 632 is a turning\npoint in the history of the development of the law of privacy in India. The\nquestion concerning the freedom of the press vis-a-vis the right to privacy was\nexamined by the Supreme Court at length in the said case. Dealing with the\norigin of the said right, the Supreme Court held in paragraph 9 as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">\t&quot; 9. The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept\noriginated in the field of Tort law, under which a new cause of action for\ndamages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy was recognised. This right\nhas two aspects which are but two faces of the same coin - (1) the general law\nof privacy which affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful\ninvasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to the right to\nprivacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful governmental invasion.\nThe first aspect of this right must be said to have been violated where, for\nexample, a person&#x27;s name or likeness is used, without his consent, for\nadvertising - or non-advertising - purposes or for that matter, his life story\nis written - whether laudatory or otherwise - and published without his consent\nas explained hereinafter. In recent times, however, this right has acquired a\nconstitutional status. We shall proceed to explain how? Right to privacy is not\nenumerated as a fundamental right in our Constitution but has been inferred from\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21 .&quot;</a>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\t15. After an elaborate discussion of the American, Australian and English\nCase Law, the Supreme Court summarised the principles flowing from the\ndiscussion, in paragraph 26 as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">\t&quot; 26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above\ndiscussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">\t(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be\nlet alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\nfamily, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education among\nother matters. None can publish anything concerning the above matters without\nhis consent - whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">If he does so, he would be violating the right to pri vacy of the person\nconcerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however,\nbe different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or\nvoluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\t(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\nconcerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is\nbased upon public records including Court records. This is for the reason that\nonce a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\nsubsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media\namong others . We are, however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency\n[<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz. , a female\nwho is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence\nshould not further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident\nbeing publicised in press/media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">\t(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above - indeed, this\nis not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it\nis obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for\ndamages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant\nto the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication\nis based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the official\nestablishes that the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\ndisregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant\n(member of the press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\nverification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he was\nwritten is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be false and\nactuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence\nand would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not\nrelevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\nprotection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no\nreiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for\ncontempt of Court and Parliament and legislatures protected as their privileges\nare by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_76\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_77\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\nexceptions to this rule.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\t(4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and\ninstitutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain a\nsuit for damages for defaming them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">\t(5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_78\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>,\nor any similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not bind the\npress or media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">\t(6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or\nto impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\t16. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_34\">In People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_79\">Civil Liberties v.

Right of privacy may, apart from contract, also arise out of a\nparticular specific relationship which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even\npolitical. As already discussed above, doctor-patient relationship, though\nbasically commercial, is, professionally, a matter of confidence and, therefore,\ndoctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality. In such a\nsituation, the public disclosure of even true private facts may amount to an\ninvasion of the right of privacy which may sometimes lead to the clash of one\nperson&#x27;s &quot;right to be let alone&quot; with another person&#x27;s &quot;right to be informed&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">\t&quot; 28.
