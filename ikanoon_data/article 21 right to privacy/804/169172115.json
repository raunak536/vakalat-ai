The\n\n        petitioner&#x27;s daughter, a 13-year-old minor, was subjected to a grievous\n\n        sexual assault resulting in her agonizing pregnancy. The petition\n\n        implores this Court to refer her case to the Medical Board at MKCG\n\n        Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur, and to issue a direction\n\n        permitting the medical termination of her pregnancy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">7.

The Board, comprising experienced medical professionals,\n\n     conducted a meticulous evaluation. Their unanimous and unequivocal\n\n     opinion concluded that the continuation of the pregnancy poses a grave\n\n     risk of life-threatening complications and would severely impair the\n\n     minor&#x27;s physical and mental well-being. The Board further emphasized\n\n     the necessity of immediate medical intervention to safeguard her health\n\n     and life.

The right\n\n      to make decisions about one&#x27;s own body is not a privilege to be granted\n\n      at the state&#x27;s discretion.

The statutory recognition of the right is relatable\n                     to the constitutional right to make reproductive choices which\n                     has been held to be an ingredient of personal liberty under\n                     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21.</a> The Court deduced the existence of such a right\n                     from a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily\n                     integrity.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">15.

The question of reproductive rights and abortion is far from uncharted\n\n      in the landscape of international jurisprudence. In R v. Morgentaler,5\n\n      the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the nation&#x27;s federal abortion\n\n      law, dismantling the legal barriers that once stood between women and\n\n      their right to bodily autonomy. In doing so, the Court not only\n\n      decriminalized abortion but placed the responsibility of regulation in\n\n      the hands of provinces and medical professionals, where scientific\n\n      expertise and individual agency, not punitive statutes, would shape\n\n      reproductive healthcare. Framing bodily autonomy as an inalienable\n\n      right woven into the fabric of democratic principles, the Court held as\n\n      follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                    &quot;It should also be noted, however, that an emphasis on\n                    individual conscience and individual judgment also lies at the\n                    heart of our democratic political tradition. The ability of each\n                    citizen to make free and informed decisions is the absolute\n                    prerequisite for the legitimacy, acceptability, and efficacy of\n                    our system of self-government. It is because of the centrality of\n                    the rights associated with freedom of individual conscience\n                    both to basic beliefs about human worth and dignity and to a\n                    free and democratic political system that American\n                    jurisprudence has emphasized the primacy or &quot;firstness&quot; of the\n                    First Amendment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      5   1988 SCC OnLine Can SC 4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                                                              Page 12 of 21</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                 Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                                                Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                                                Signed by: BHABAGRAHI JHANKAR</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                                                                Designation: AR-CUM-SR.

The abovementioned precedents make it clear that the principle of\n\n      bodily autonomy is foundational to the constitutional guarantee of\n\n      personal liberty and human dignity. At its core, respect for bodily\n\n      autonomy     necessitates   minimal      state   interference    in     decisions\n\n      concerning an individual&#x27;s body, particularly in matters as intimate and\n\n      consequential as pregnancy. This principle is not diminished in the case\n\n      of a minor; rather, it is safeguarded through the role of her legal\n\n      guardians, who are best positioned to make decisions in her best\n\n      interests. In the present case, the parents of the minor girl, as her natural\n\n      guardians and well-wishers, bear the legal and moral responsibility to\n\n      act in a manner that ensures her well-being.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">19.   Ultimately, the role of the court, in cases of pregnancies resulting from\n\n      rape, is to intervene in a way that empowers the victim by granting\n\n      them the authority to make decisions regarding their own body and\n\n      future. In this case, there is a risk of complications in both termination\n\n      and delivery. But when the law is faced with two difficult choices, it\n\n      must take the path of the lesser evil. Forcing a thirteen-year-old to carry\n\n      a pregnancy to term would place an unbearable burden on her body\n\n      and mind, one that she is neither prepared for nor capable of bearing.\n\n      While termination is not without risk, it prevents the far graver\n\n      consequences of childbirth and forced motherhood at an age where\n\n      such responsibilities are unthinkable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">20.   Although the Court has intervened to render a decision in this case, it\n\n      cannot overlook the deeply troubling aspect inherent in cases of this\n\n      nature, the unwarranted reliance on judicial intervention where the law\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                       Page 13 of 21</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                             Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                            Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                                            Signed by: BHABAGRAHI JHANKAR</span>\n                                                            Designation: AR-CUM-SR.

The\n\n      consequence is an undue burden placed upon those in crisis, forcing\n\n      them to navigate legal complexities where none should exist. The\n\n      urgency inherent in the termination of pregnancy, particularly in the\n\n      case of a sexual assault victim, brooks no unnecessary delay. Here, time\n\n      is not a passive measure but an active force and each moment lost bears\n\n      its own weight in consequence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">21.   The report confirming X&#x27;s pregnancy was issued on 13.02.2025; today,\n\n      we stand at 03.03.2025. A delay of more than two weeks in a matter,\n\n      where time is the arbiter of both possibility and peril, is unwarranted.\n\n      This delay did not arise from the natural course of justice but from a\n\n      failure to direct the case immediately to the Medical Board.

To subject a victim and her family to prolonged legal formalities is to\n\n      impose a burden that extends beyond the courtroom, adding to their\n\n      distress rather than alleviating it. When legal processes become\n\n      unnecessarily complex and unyielding, they risk creating additional\n\n      hardship for those already in a vulnerable position. The law, at its best,\n\n      serves as a shield of protection, but when applied without sensitivity, it\n\n      can become an obstacle rather than a source of relief. At its core, this is\n\n      not merely a question of policy or procedural compliance but one of\n\n      principle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">26.

However, providers seek judicial authorisation prior\n               to terminating a pregnancy out of a fear of backlash from the\n               pregnant woman&#x27;s partner or family. They are also\n               apprehensive of being dragged into criminal proceedings if the\n               woman is a rape victim. A senior gynaecologist in Chennai\n               stated that &quot;a court order [was] required for all MTP cases\n               where the pregnancy [was] an outcome of rape.&quot; Judicial\n               authorisation may also be insisted on in &quot;special cases&quot; such\n               as those where the woman is &quot;psychologically&quot; unstable.\n\n               .....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">               Although in such cases a permission for termination of\n               pregnancy is usually granted the extralegal requirement\n               of judicial authorisation, and the consequent delay in\n               termination of a pregnancy, causes significant physical\n               and mental agony to women.

The medical termination of pregnancy\n\n      in this case is not only legally permissible but also morally imperative.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">35.   Accordingly, this Writ Petition is allowed, and the concerned\n\n      authorities are directed to ensure the procedure is carried out without\n\n      further delay or obstruction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">36.   The concerned Department is further directed to take necessary steps\n\n      for the formulation of the aforementioned SOP, ensuring its completion\n\n      within six months from the date of this judgment.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">37.
