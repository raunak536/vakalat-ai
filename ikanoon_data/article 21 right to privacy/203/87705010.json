The issue before us is limited but one of considerable public\n\n                         importance – whether sexual intercourse between a man and his wife being a\n\n                         girl between 15 and 18 years of age is rape? Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 375</a> of\n\n                         the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>) answers this in the negative, but in\n\n                         our opinion sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years of age is rape\n\n                         regardless of whether she is married or not. The exception carved out in the\n\n                         <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a> creates an unnecessary and artificial distinction between a married girl\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n\n\n                         child and an unmarried girl child and has no rational nexus with any unclear\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">SANJAY KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2017.10.11</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">16:20:29 IST</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Reason:</span>\n\n\n\n                         objective sought to be achieved. The artificial distinction is arbitrary and\n\n                              W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                       Page 1\n\fdiscriminatory and is definitely not in the best interest of the girl child. The\n\nartificial distinction is contrary to the philosophy and ethos of <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 15(3)</a>\n\nof the Constitution as well as contrary to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and\n\nour commitments in international conventions. It is also contrary to the\n\nphilosophy behind some statutes, the bodily integrity of the girl child and\n\nher reproductive choice. What is equally dreadful, the artificial distinction\n\nturns a blind eye to trafficking of the girl child and surely each one of us\n\nmust discourage trafficking which is such a horrible social evil.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.       We make it clear that we have refrained from making any observation\n\nwith regard to the marital rape of a woman who is 18 years of age and above\n\nsince that issue is not before us at all. Therefore we should not be understood\n\nto advert to that issue even collaterally.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">The writ petition\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.       The petitioner is a society registered on 6th August, 2009 and has since\n\nbeen working in the area of child rights. The society provides technical and\n\nhand-holding support to non-governmental organizations as also to\n\ngovernment and multilateral bodies in several States in India. It has also\n\nbeen involved in legal intervention, research and training on issues\n\nconcerning children and their rights. The society has filed a petition under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution in public interest with a view to draw attention\n     W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                            Page 2\n\fto the violation of the rights of girls who are married between the ages of 15\n\nand 18 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.       According to the petitioner, <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 375</a> of the IPC prescribes the age\n\nof consent for sexual intercourse as 18 years meaning thereby that any\n\nperson having sexual intercourse with a girl child below 18 years of age\n\nwould be statutorily guilty of rape even if the sexual activity was with her\n\nconsent. Almost every statute in India recognizes that a girl below 18 years\n\nof age is a child and it is for this reason that the law penalizes sexual\n\nintercourse with a girl who is below 18 years of age. Unfortunately, by virtue\n\nof Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, if a girl child between 15 and 18\n\nyears of age is married, her husband can have non-consensual sexual\n\nintercourse with her, without being penalized under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a>, only because\n\nshe is married to him and for no other reason. The right of such a girl child\n\nto bodily integrity and to decline to have sexual intercourse with her\n\nhusband has been statutorily taken away and non-consensual sexual\n\nintercourse with her husband is not an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.       Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that absolutely nothing is\n\nachieved by entitling the husband of a girl child between 15 and 18 years of\n\nage to have non-consensual sexual intercourse with her. It was also\n\nsubmitted that whatever be the (unclear) objective sought to be achieved by\n\n     W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                           Page 3\n\fthis, the marital status of the girl child between 15 and 18 years of age has\n\nno rational nexus with that unclear object. Moreover, merely because a girl\n\nchild between 15 and 18 years of age is married does not result in her\n\nceasing to be a child or being mentally or physically capable of having\n\nsexual intercourse or indulging in any other sexual activity and conjugal\n\nrelations. It was submitted that to this extent Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 375</a> of\n\nthe IPC is not only arbitrary but is also discriminatory and contrary to the\n\nbeneficial intent of <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 15(3)</a> of the Constitution which enables\n\nParliament to make special provision for women and children. In fact, by\n\nenacting Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 375</a> of the IPC in the statute book, the girl\n\nchild is placed at a great disadvantage, contrary to the visionary and\n\nbeneficent philosophy propounded by <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 15(3)</a> of the Constitution.\n\nLaw Commission of India – 84th Report\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.       Learned counsel for the petitioner drew our attention to the 84 th report\n\nof the Law Commission of India (LCI) presented on 25 th April, 1980 dealing\n\nwith the rape of a girl child below the prescribed minimum age. The report\n\nconsidered the anomalies in the law relating to rape, particularly in the\n\ncontext of the age of consent for sexual intercourse with a girl child. The\n\nview expressed by the LCI is quite explicit and is to be found in paragraph\n\n2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 of the report. The view is that since the Child Marriage\n\n     W.P.

Since marriage with a girl below 18 years is\n                prohibited (though it is not void as a matter of personal law),\n                sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years should also be\n                prohibited.

The issue was re-considered by the LCI in its 172 nd report presented\n\non 25th March, 2000. In that report, it is recommended that an exception be\n\nadded to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 375</a> of the IPC to the effect that sexual intercourse by a\n\nman with his own wife, the wife not being under 16 years of age, is not\n\nsexual assault. In other words, the earlier recommendation made by the LCI\n\nwas not approved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">8.       Apparently at the stage of discussions, the recommendation of the LCI\n\n(still at the stage of proposal) did not find favour with an NGO called Sakshi\n\nwho suggested deletion of the exception. According to the NGO, “where a\n\nhusband causes some physical injury to his wife, he is punishable under the\n\nappropriate offence and the fact that he is the husband of the victim is not an\n\nextenuating circumstance recognized by law.” Therefore, there is no reason\n\n     W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                                Page 6\n\fwhy a concession should be made in the matter of an offence of rape/sexual\n\nassault only because the wife happens to be above 15/16 years of age. The\n\nLCI did not agree with the NGO and the reason given is that if the exception\n\nthat is recommended is deleted, it “may amount to excessive interference\n\nwith the marital relationship.” In other words, according to the LCI the\n\nhusband of a girl child who is not below 16 years of age can sexually assault\n\nand even rape his wife and the assault or rape would not be punishable - and\n\nif it is made punishable, then it would amount to excessive interference with\n\nthe marital relationship. (It may be mentioned that Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n\n375</a> of the IPC has not increased the age to 16 years from 15 years as\n\nrecommended by the LCI but has retained it at 15 years. According to the\n\ncounter affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India, the age of 15 years\n\nhas been kept to give protection to the husband and the wife against\n\ncriminalizing the sexual activity between them).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">Counter affidavit of the Union of India\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">9.       Since we have adverted to the counter affidavit filed by the Union of\n\nIndia opposing the writ petition, we propose to make a very brief reference\n\nto it. A somewhat more detailed reference is made to the counter affidavit of\n\nthe Union of India at a later stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">     W.P.

For the present, the counter affidavit of the Union of India refers to\n\nthe National Family Health Survey - 3 (of 2005) in which it is stated that\n\n46% of women in India between the ages of 18 and 29 years were married\n\nbefore the age of 18 years. It is also estimated, interestingly but disturbingly,\n\nthat there are about 23 million child brides in the country. As far as any\n\nremedy available to a child bride is concerned, the counter affidavit draws\n\nattention to <a href=\"/doc/1422776/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3</a> of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (the\n\nPCMA). Under <a href=\"/doc/1321422/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 3(1)</a> of the PCMA a child marriage is voidable at the\n\noption of any contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage.\n\nThe marriage can be declared a nullity in terms of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1321422/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n\n3(1)</a> of the PCMA through an appropriate petition filed by the child within\n\ntwo years of attaining majority and by approaching an appropriate court of\n\nlaw. It is also stated that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/352219/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 13(2)(iv)</a> of the Hindu Marriage\n\nAct, 1955 a child bride can petition for a divorce on the ground that her\n\nmarriage (whether consummated or not) was solemnized before she attained\n\nthe age of 15 years and she has repudiated the marriage after attaining that\n\nage but before attaining 18 years of age. In other words a child marriage is\n\nsought to be somehow ‘legitimized’ by the Union of India and the onus for\n\nhaving it declared voidable or a nullity is placed on the child bride or the\n\nchild groom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">  W.P.

This refers to the consequences of child marriage in Chapter 5.\n\n    Broadly, it is stated :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           “Child marriage is not only a violation of human rights, but is also\n           recognized as an obstacle to the development of young people. The\n           practice of child marriage cut shorts a critical stage of self-discovery\n           and exploring one’s identity. Child marriage is an imposition of a\n           marriage partner on children or adolescents who are in no way ready\n           and matured, and thus, are at a loss to understand the significance of\n           marriage. Their development gets comprised due to being deprived\n           of freedom, opportunity for personal development, and other rights\n           including health and well-being, education, and participation in civic\n           life and nullifies their basic rights as envisaged in the United\n           Nation’s Convention on the Right of the Child ratified by India in\n           1989. Marriage at a young age prevents both girls and boys from\n           exercising agency in making important life decisions and securing\n           basic freedoms, including pursuing opportunities for education,\n           earning a sustainable livelihood and accessing sexual health and\n           rights.” ………..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           “The key consequences of child marriage of girls may include\n           early pregnancy; maternal and neonatal mortality; child health\n           problems; educational setbacks; lower employment/livelihood\n           prospects; exposure to violence and abuse, including a range of\n           controlling and inequitable behaviours, leading to inevitable\n           negative physical and psychological consequences; and limited\n           agency of girls to influence decisions about their lives.\n           Census data have demonstrated an upswing of female deaths in the\n           age group of 15-19 years. This high mortality rate could be attributed\n           to the deaths of teenage mothers. Child marriage virtually works\n           like a double-edged sword; lower age at marriage is significantly\n           associated with worse outcomes for the child and worse pregnancy\n           outcomes for the mother. All these factors push girls and their\n           families into perpetuation of intergenerational poverty and\n           marginalization. The impact of early marriage on girls - and to a\n           lesser extent on boys - is wide-ranging, opines the Innocenti Digest\n           on child marriage. Child brides often experience overlapping\n           vulnerabilities - they are young, often poor and undereducated. This\n           affects the resources and assets they can bring into their marital\n           household, thus reducing their decision-making ability. Child\n           marriage places a girl under the control of her husband and often\n\nW.P.

While child marriage is\n             bound to have a detrimental effect on boys who would need to\n             shoulder the responsibility of a wife and in most cases, have to also\n             discontinue their education, there is very little research evidence to\n             capture the long term economic and psychological effect on boys\n             who are married early. The Lancet 2015 acknowledges that\n             adolescent boys are not important and neglected part of the equation.\n             The assumption that girls need more attention than boys is now\n             being challenged.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">             Looking at the impact of early marriage from rights perspective, it\n             can be said that the key concerns are denial of childhood and\n             adolescence, curtailment of personal freedom, deprivation of\n             opportunities to develop a full sense of selfhood and denial of\n             psychosocial and emotional well-being reproductive health and\n             educational opportunity along with consequences described earlier.”\n             (Emphasis supplied by us).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">13.   There is a specific discussion in the Statistical Analysis on the impact\n\nof early child birth on health in which it is stated that “girls aged 15 to 19\n\n[years] are twice more likely than older women to die from childbirth and\n\npregnancy, making pregnancy the leading cause of death in poor countries\n\nfor these age groups. Girls from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n\nwere on an average 10 per cent more likely (after accounting for other\n\nvariables) to give birth earlier than girls from the other castes.” It has been\n\nfound that girls most likely to have had a child by 19 years (as compared\n\nwith all other married and unmarried girls) were from the poorest groups;\n\nwere more likely to live in rural areas; had the least educated mothers; had\n\nearlier experiences of menarche; had lower education aspirations; and were\n\n  W.P.

There is also a useful discussion on violence, neglect and\n\nabandonment; psychosocial disadvantage; low self-esteem; low education\n\nand limited employability; human trafficking and under-nutrition, all of\n\nwhich are of considerable importance for the well-being of a girl child.\n\nWe are not dealing with these reports in any detail but draw attention to\n\nthem since they support the view canvassed by learned counsel. All that we\n\nneed say is that a reading of these reports gives a good idea of the variety\n\nand magnitude of problems that a girl child who is married between 15 and\n\n18 years of age could ordinarily encounter, including those caused by having\n\nsexual intercourse and child-bearing at an early age.\n\nIn-depth Study on all forms of violence against women\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">15.   On 6th July, 2006 the Secretary-General of the United Nations\n\nsubmitted a report to the General Assembly called the “In-depth Study on\n\nall forms of violence against women”. In the chapter relating to violence\n\nagainst women within the family and harmful traditional practices, early\n  W.P.

An early marriage is explained as involving the marriage of a child,\n\n      that is, a person below the age of 18 years. It is stated that “Minor girls have\n\n      not achieved full maturity and capacity to act and lack ability to control their\n\n      sexuality. When they marry and have children, their health can be adversely\n\n      affected, their education impeded and economic autonomy restricted. Early\n\n      marriage also increases the risk of HIV infection.” Among the\n\n      under-documented forms of violence against women are included traditional\n\n      harmful practices, prenatal sex selection, early marriage, acid throwing and\n\n      dowry or “honour” related violence etc.3\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">      17.    On the concern of appropriate legislation to deal with issues of\n\n      violence against women, the right of a woman to bodily integrity and\n\n      legislations that allow early marriages, the Secretary General had this to say:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                   “The treaty bodies have expressed concerns about the scope and\n                   coverage of existing legislation, in particular in regard to:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">1 Paragraph 111\n\n2 Paragraph 118\n\n3 Paragraph 222\n\n\n        W.P.

What has been the response of the Government of India to studies\n\n      carried out from time to time and views expressed? The National Charter for\n\n      Children, 2003 was notified on 9th February, 2004. While it failed to define\n\n      a child, we assume that it was framed keeping in mind the generally\n\n      accepted definition of a child as being someone below 18 years of age.\n\n      Proceeding on this basis, for the present purposes, Clause 11 of the National\n\n      Charter is of relevance in the context of child marriages. It recognized that\n\n      child marriage is a crime and an atrocity committed against the girl child. It\n\n      also provided for taking “serious measures” to speedily abolish the practice\n\n      of child marriage. Clause 11 reads:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">4 Paragraph 277\n\n\n        W.P.

As a first step in this direction, child marriages were criminalized by\n\nenacting the PCMA in 2006 but no corresponding amendment was made in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, as it existed in 2006, to decriminalize marital rape of\n\na girl child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">20.    The National Charter was followed by the National Policy for\n\nChildren notified on 26th April, 2013.             The National Policy explicitly\n\nrecognized in Clause 2.1 that every person below the age of 18 years is a\n\nchild. Among the Guiding Principles for the National Policy was the\n\nrecognition that every child has universal, inalienable and indivisible human\n\nrights; every child has the right to life, survival, development, education,\n\nprotection and participation; the best interest of a child is the primary\n\nconcern in all decisions and actions affecting the child, whether taken by\n\nlegislative bodies, courts of law, administrative authorities, public, private,\n\nsocial, religious or cultural institutions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">21.    The large ‘to do list’ in the National Policy led to the National Plan\n  W.P.

The\n\nNational Plan appears to have been made available on 24 th January, 2017.\n\nWhile dealing with child marriage, it is stated as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">             “In India, between NFHS-3 (2005-06) to RSOC (2013-14), there has\n             been a considerable decline in the percentage of women, between the\n             ages 20-24, who were married before the age of 18 (from 47.4% to\n             30.3%). The incidence is higher among SC (34.9%) and ST (31%)\n             and in families with lowest wealth index (44.1%). Child marriage\n             violates children’s basic rights to health, education, development,\n             and protection and is also used as a means of trafficking of young\n             girls.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">             Child marriage leads to pregnancy during adolescence, posing\n             life-threatening risks to both mother and child. It is indicated by the\n             Age-specific Marital Fertility Rate (ASMFR) which is measured as a\n             number of births per year in a given age group to the total number of\n             married women in that age group. SRS 2013 reveals that in the age\n             group of 15-19 years; there has been an upward trend during the\n             period 2001-2013.

The National Plan of Action for Children recognizes that the early\n\nmarriage of girls is one of the factors for neo-natal deaths; early marriage\n\nposes various risks for the survival, health and development of young girls\n\nand to children born to them and most unfortunately it is also used as a\n\nmeans of trafficking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">23.   A reading of the National Policy and the National Plan of Action for\n\nChildren reveals, quite astonishingly, that even though the Government of\n\nIndia realizes the dangers of early marriages, it is merely dishing out\n\n\n  W.P.

In other words, the issue\n\nraised by the petitioner has attracted considerable international attention and\n\ndiscussion and ought to be taken very seriously by the Union of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">25.   In our opinion, it is not necessary to detail the contents of every report\n\nor study placed before us except to say that there is a strong established link\n\nbetween early marriage and sexual intercourse with a married girl child\n\nbetween 15 and 18 years of age. There is a plethora of material to clearly\n\nindicate that sexual intercourse with a girl child below the age of 18 years\n\n(even within marriage) is not at all advisable for her for a variety of reasons,\n\nincluding her physical and mental well-being and her social standing – all of\n\nwhich should ordinarily be of paramount importance to everybody,\n\nparticularly the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">  W.P.

The social cost of a child marriage (and therefore of sexual\n\nintercourse with a girl child) is itself quite enormous and in the long run\n\nmight not even be worth it. This is in addition to the economic cost to the\n\ncountry which would be obliged to take care of infants who might be\n\nmalnourished and sickly; the young mother of the infant might also require\n\nmedical assistance in most cases. All these costs eventually add up and\n\napparently only for supporting a pernicious practice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">27.   We can only express the hope that the Government of India and the\n\nState Governments intensively study and analyze these and other reports and\n\ntake an informed decision on the effective implementation of the PCMA and\n\nactively prohibit child marriages which ‘encourages’ sexual intercourse with\n\na girl child. Welfare schemes and catchy slogans are excellent for awareness\n\ncampaigns but they must be backed up by focused implementation\n\nprogrammes, other positive and remedial action so that the pendulum swings\n\nin favour of the girl child who can then look forward to a better future.\n\nProvisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_30\">Indian Penal Code</a> (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a>)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">28.   <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 375</a> of the IPC defines ‘rape’. This section was inserted in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_33\">IPC</a> in its present form by an amendment carried out on 3 rd February, 2013\n\nand it provides that a man is said to commit rape if, broadly speaking, he has\n\nsexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of\n  W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                            Page 19\n\fthe seven descriptions mentioned in the section. (A woman is defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980183/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 10</a> of the IPC as a female human being of any age). Among the\n\nseven descriptions is sexual intercourse against the will or without the\n\nconsent of the woman; clause ‘Sixthly’ of Section 375 makes it clear that if\n\nthe woman is under 18 years of age, then sexual intercourse with her - with\n\nor without her consent - is rape. This is commonly referred to as ‘statutory\n\nrape’ in which the willingness or consent of a woman below the age of 18\n\nyears    for   having   sexual   intercourse   is   rendered   irrelevant   and\n\ninconsequential.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">29.     However, Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 375</a> of the IPC provides that it is not\n\nrape if a man has sexual intercourse with a girl above 15 years of age and if\n\nthat girl is his wife. In other words, a husband can have sexual intercourse\n\nwith his wife provided she is not below 15 years of age and this is not rape\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_36\">IPC</a> regardless of her willingness or her consent.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">30.     However, sexual intercourse with a girl under 15 years of age is rape,\n\nwhether it is with or without her consent, against her will or not, whether it\n\nis by her husband or anybody else. This is clear from a reading of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n\n375</a> of the IPC including Exception 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">31.     Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 375</a> of the IPC provides for three circumstances\n\nrelating to ‘rape’. Firstly sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years of\n  W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                            Page 20\n\fage is rape (statutory rape). Secondly and by way of an exception, if a\n\nwoman is between 15 and 18 years of age then sexual intercourse with her is\n\nnot rape if the person having sexual intercourse with her is her husband. Her\n\nwillingness or consent is irrelevant under this circumstance. Thirdly sexual\n\nintercourse with a woman above 18 years of age is rape if it is under any of\n\nthe seven descriptions given in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 375</a> of the IPC (non-consensual\n\nsexual intercourse).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">32.   The result of the above three situations is that the husband of a girl\n\nchild between 15 and 18 years of age has blanket liberty and freedom to\n\nhave non-consensual sexual intercourse with his wife and he would not be\n\npunishable for rape under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_40\">IPC</a> since such non-consensual sexual\n\nintercourse is not rape for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 375</a> of the IPC. Very\n\nstrangely, and as pointed out by Sakshi before the LCI, the husband of a girl\n\nchild does not have the liberty and freedom under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_42\">IPC</a> to commit a lesser\n\n‘sexual’ act with his wife, as for example, if the husband of a girl child\n\nassaults her with the intention of outraging her modesty, he would be\n\npunishable under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 354</a> of the IPC. In other words,\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_44\">IPC</a> permits a man to have non-consensual sexual intercourse with his\n\nwife if she is between 15 and 18 years of age but not to molest her.

One of the more important legislations on the subject of protective\n\nrights of children is the <a href=\"/doc/790355/\" id=\"a_53\">Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006</a> (for short\n\n‘the PCMA’). For the purposes of the PCMA, a ‘child’ is a male who has not\n\ncompleted 21 years of age and a female who has not completed 18 years of\n\nage and a ‘child marriage’ means a marriage to which either contracting\n\nparty is a child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">36.    <a href=\"/doc/1422776/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 3</a> of the PCMA provides that a child marriage is voidable at\n\nthe option of any one of the parties to the child marriage – a child marriage\n\nis not void, but only voidable. Interestingly, and notwithstanding the fact that\n\na child marriage is only voidable, Parliament has made a child marriage an\n\noffence and has provided punishments for contracting a child marriage. For\n\ninstance, <a href=\"/doc/1773018/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 9</a> of the PCMA provides that any male adult above 18\n\nyears of age marrying a child shall be punishable with rigorous\n\nimprisonment which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend\n\nto one lakh rupees or with both. Therefore regardless of his age, a male is\n\npenalized under this section if he marries a girl child. <a href=\"/doc/1447445/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 10</a> of the\n\nPCMA provides that whoever performs, conducts, directs or abets any child\n\n  W.P.

It is quite clear from the above that Parliament is not in favour of child\n\nmarriages per se but is somewhat ambivalent about it. However, Parliament\n\nrecognizes that although a child marriage is a criminal activity, the reality of\n\nlife in India is that traditional child marriages do take place and as the\n\nstudies (referred to above) reveal, it is a harmful practice. Strangely, while\n\nprohibiting a child marriage and criminalizing it, a child marriage has not\n\nbeen declared void and what is worse, sexual intercourse within a child\n\nmarriage is not rape under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_61\">IPC</a> even though it is a punishable offence\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_62\">Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012</a>.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_63\">Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012</a> (POCSO)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">38.     <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_64\">The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012</a> (for short\n\n‘the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_65\">POCSO Act</a>’) is an important statute for the purposes of our discussion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">  W.P.

The Preamble to the POCSO Act states that it was enacted with\n\n       reference to <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 15(3)</a> of the Constitution. The Preamble recognizes that\n\n       the best interest of a child should be secured, a child being defined under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/127722677/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 2(d)</a> as any person below the age of 18 years. In fact, securing the\n\n       best interest of the child is an obligation cast upon the Government of India\n\n       having acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CRC).\n\n       The Preamble to the POCSO Act also recognizes that it is imperative that the\n\n       law should operate “in a manner that the best interest and well being of the\n\n       child are regarded as being of paramount importance at every stage, to\n\n       ensure the healthy, physical, emotional, intellectual and social development\n\n\n5 India became a signatory to the CEDAW Convention on 30th July, 1980 (ratified on 9th July,\n1993) but with a reservation to the extent of making registration of marriage compulsory\nstating that it is not practical in a vast country like India with its variety of customs, religions\nand level of literacy. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1037437/\" id=\"a_70\">Seema (Smt.) v.\nAshwani Kumar</a>, (2006) 2 SCC 578 directed the States and Central Government to notify\nRules making registration of marriages compulsory.

Finally, the Preamble also provides that “sexual exploitation\n\nand sexual abuse of children are heinous crimes and need to be effectively\n\naddressed”. This is directly in conflict with Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 375</a> of\n\nthe IPC which effectively provides that the sexual exploitation or sexual\n\nabuse of a girl child is not even a crime, let alone a heinous crime – on the\n\ncontrary, it is a perfectly legitimate activity if the sexual exploitation or\n\nsexual abuse of the girl child is by her husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">43.   Under <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 34</a> of the CRC, the Government of India is bound to\n\n“undertake all appropriate national, bilateral and multi-lateral measures to\n\nprevent the coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity”.\n\nThe key words are ‘unlawful sexual activity’ but the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_73\">IPC</a> declares that a girl\n\nchild having sexual intercourse with her husband is not ‘unlawful sexual\n\nactivity’ within the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_74\">IPC</a>, regardless of any coercion.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_75\">POCSO Act</a>, any sexual activity engaged in\n\nby any person (husband or otherwise) with a girl child is unlawful and a\n\npunishable offence.

But,\n\ncontrarily the rape of a married girl child (called ‘aggravated penetrative\n\nsexual assault’ in the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_80\">POCSO Act</a>) is made an offence for the purposes of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_81\">POCSO Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">45.   <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 3</a> of the POCSO Act defines “penetrative sexual assault”.\n\nClause (n) of <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 5</a> provides that if a person commits penetrative sexual\n\nassault with a child, then that person actually commits aggravated\n\npenetrative sexual assault if that person is related to the child, inter alia,\n\nthrough marriage.    Therefore, if the husband of a girl child commits\n\npenetrative sexual assault on his wife, he actually commits aggravated\n\npenetrative sexual assault as defined in <a href=\"/doc/107316183/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 5(n)</a> of the POCSO Act\n\nwhich is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 6</a> of the POCSO Act by a term of rigorous\n\nimprisonment of not less than ten years and which may extend to\n\nimprisonment for life and fine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">46.

There is an apparent conflict or incongruity between the provisions of\n\nthe IPC and the POCSO Act. The rape of a married girl child (a girl child\n\nbetween 15 and 18 years of age) is not rape under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_168\">IPC</a> and therefore not\n\nan offence in view of Exception 2 to Section 375 thereof but it is an offence\n\nof aggravated penetrative sexual assault under <a href=\"/doc/107316183/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 5(n)</a> of the POCSO\n\nAct and punishable under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 6</a> of that Act.

The most obvious and appropriate resolution of the conflict has been\n\nprovided by the State of Karnataka – the State Legislature has inserted\n\nsub-Section (1A) in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 3</a> of the PCMA (on obtaining the assent of the\n\nPresident on 20th April, 2017) declaring that henceforth every child marriage\n\nthat is solemnized is void ab initio. Therefore, the husband of a girl child\n\nwould be liable for punishment for a child marriage under the PCMA, for\n\npenetrative sexual assault or aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_172\">POCSO Act</a> and if the husband and the girl child are living together in the\n\n  W.P.

It would be wise for all the State Legislatures to adopt the route taken\n\nby Karnataka to void child marriages and thereby ensure that sexual\n\nintercourse between a girl child and her husband is a punishable offence\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_175\">POCSO Act</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_176\">IPC</a>.

There is no doubt that pro-child statutes are intended to and do\n\nconsider the best interest of the child. These statutes have been enacted in\n\nthe recent past though not effectively implemented. Given this situation, we\n\nare of opinion that a few facts need to be acknowledged and accepted.\n\nFirstly, a child is and remains a child regardless of the description or\n\nnomenclature given to the child. It is universally accepted in almost all\n\nrelevant statutes in our country that a child is a person below 18 years of\n\nage. Therefore, a child remains a child whether she is described as a street\n\nchild or a surrendered child or an abandoned child or an adopted child.\n\nSimilarly, a child remains a child whether she is a married child or an\n\n  W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                           Page 47\n\funmarried child or a divorced child or a separated child or a widowed child.\n\nAt this stage we are reminded of Shakespeare’s eternal view that a rose by\n\nany other name would smell as sweet - so also with the status of a child,\n\ndespite any prefix. Secondly, the age of consent for sexual intercourse is\n\ndefinitively 18 years and there is no dispute about this. Therefore, under no\n\ncircumstance can a child below 18 years of age give consent, express or\n\nimplied, for sexual intercourse. The age of consent has not been specifically\n\nreduced by any statute and unless there is such a specific reduction, we must\n\nproceed on the basis that the age of consent and willingness to sexual\n\nintercourse remains at 18 years of age. Thirdly, Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 375</a>\n\nof the IPC creates an artificial distinction between a married girl child and an\n\nunmarried girl child with no real rationale and thereby does away with\n\nconsent for sexual intercourse by a husband with his wife who is a girl child\n\nbetween 15 and 18 years of age. Such an unnecessary and artificial\n\ndistinction if accepted can again be introduced for other occasions for\n\ndivorced children or separated children or widowed children.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">78.   What is sought to be achieved by this artificial distinction is not at all\n\nclear except perhaps to acknowledge that child marriages are taking place in\n\nthe country. Such child marriages certainly cannot be in the best interest of\n\nthe girl child. That the solemnization of a child marriage violates the\n\n  W.P.

Therefore, it is for the State to\n\neffectively implement and enforce the law rather than dilute it by creating\n\nartificial distinctions. Can it not be said, in a sense, that through the artificial\n\ndistinction, Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 375</a> of the IPC encourages violation of\n\nthe PCMA? Perhaps ‘yes’ and looked at from another point of view, perhaps\n\n‘no’ for it cannot reasonably be argued that one statute (the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_179\">IPC</a>) condones\n\nan offence under another statute (the PCMA). Therefore the basic question\n\nremains - what exactly is the artificial distinction intended to achieve?\n\nJustification given by the Union of India\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">79.

The second\n\njustification is that traditionally child marriages have been performed in\n\ndifferent parts of the country and therefore such traditions must be respected\n\nand not destroyed.

To make matters worse, the\n\ndetrimental impact could pass on to the children of the girl child who may be\n\nmalnourished and may be required to live in an impoverished state due to a\n\nvariety of factors. An early marriage therefore could have an\n\ninter-generational adverse impact. In effect therefore the practice of early\n\nmarriage or child marriage even if sanctified by tradition and custom may\n\nyet be an undesirable practice today with increasing awareness and\n\nknowledge of its detrimental effects and the detrimental effects of an early\n\npregnancy.

We must not and cannot forget the existence of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution which gives a fundamental right to a girl child to live a life of\n\ndignity. The documentary material placed before us clearly suggests that an\n\nearly marriage takes away the self esteem and confidence of a girl child and\n\nsubjects her, in a sense, to sexual abuse. Under no circumstances can it be\n\nsaid that such a girl child lives a life of dignity. The right of a girl child to\n\nmaintain her bodily integrity is effectively destroyed by a traditional practice\n\nsanctified by the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_199\">IPC</a>. Her husband, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 375</a> of the\n\nIPC, effectively has full control over her body and can subject her to sexual\n\nintercourse without her consent or without her willingness since such an\n\nactivity would not be rape. Anomalously, although her husband can rape her\n\nbut he cannot molest her for if he does so he could be punished under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_201\">IPC</a>.

Looked at from another perspective, the PCMA actually makes child\n\nmarriages voidable and makes the parties to a child marriage (other than the\n\ngirl child) punishable for an offence under the said Act. For someone who\n\nsupports the institution of marriage, nothing could be more destructive of the\n\ninstitution of marriage than the PCMA which makes a child marriage\n\nvoidable and punishable on the one hand and on the other, it otherwise\n\ncollaterally legitimizes the pernicious practice of child marriages.

The punishment for rape (assuming it is\n\ncommitted) and the punishment for penetrative sexual assault is the same,\n\nnamely imprisonment for a minimum period of 7 years which may extend to\n\nimprisonment for life.

A rather lengthy but useful discussion on this subject of special laws is\n\n      to be found in <a href=\"/doc/791872/\" id=\"a_221\">Life Insurance Corporation of India v. D.J. Bahadur</a> 27 in\n\n      paragraphs 52 and 53 of the Report. Briefly, it was held that the\n\n      subject-matter and the perspective of the statute are determinative of the\n\n      question whether a statute is a general law or a special law. Therefore, for\n\n      certain purposes a statute might be a special law but for other purposes, as\n\n      compared to another statute, it might be a general law. In respect of a dispute\n\n      between the Life Insurance Corporation and its workmen qua workmen, the\n\n\n27 (1981) 1 SCC 315\n\n\n        W.P.

It was held\n\nas follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">              “In determining whether a statute is a special or a general one, the\n              focus must be on the principal subject-matter plus the particular\n              perspective. For certain purposes, an Act may be general and for\n              certain other purposes it may be special and we cannot blur\n              distinctions when dealing with finer points of law. In law, we have a\n              cosmos of relativity, not absolutes — so too in life. <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_225\">The ID Act</a> is a\n              special statute devoted wholly to investigation and settlement of\n              industrial disputes which provides definitionally for the nature of\n              industrial disputes coming within its ambit. It creates an\n              infrastructure for investigation into, solution of and adjudication\n              upon industrial disputes. It also provides the necessary machinery\n              for enforcement of awards and settlements. From alpha to omega the\n              <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_226\">ID Act</a> has one special mission — the resolution of industrial\n              disputes through specialised agencies according to specialised\n              procedures and with special reference to the weaker categories of\n              employees coming within the definition of workmen. Therefore,\n              with reference to industrial disputes between employers and\n              workmen, the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_227\">ID Act</a> is a special statute, and the <a href=\"/doc/1643240/\" id=\"a_228\">LIC Act</a> does not\n              speak at all with specific reference to workmen. On the other hand,\n              its powers relate to the general aspects of nationalisation, of\n              management when private businesses are nationalised and a plurality\n              of problems which, incidentally, involve transfer of service of\n              existing employees of insurers. The workmen qua workmen and\n              industrial disputes between workmen and the employer as such, are\n              beyond the orbit of and have no specific or special place in the\n              scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1643240/\" id=\"a_229\">LIC Act</a>. And whenever there was a dispute between\n              workmen and management the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_230\">ID Act</a> mechanism was resorted to.\n              What are we confronted with in the present case, so that I may\n              determine as between the two enactments which is the special? <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"791872\" id=\"span_27\">The\n              only subject which has led to this litigation and which is the bone of\n              contention between the parties is an industrial dispute between the\n              Corporation and its workmen qua workmen.

An application of the generalia maxim\n              as expounded by English textbooks and decisions leaves us in no\n              doubt that the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_234\">ID Act</a> being special law, prevails over the <a href=\"/doc/1643240/\" id=\"a_235\">LIC Act</a>\n              which is but general law.”\n\n\nThe scope and amplitude of the two significant pro-child statutes may now\n\nbe examined in light of the law <a href=\"/doc/791872/\" id=\"a_236\">laid down by</a> this Court including <a href=\"/doc/1227639/\" id=\"a_237\">Sections 5</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/170198/\" id=\"a_238\">41</a> of the IPC.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(i)     The JJ Act\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">95.

In our opinion, it cannot be said with any degree of rationality that\n\nsuch a girl child loses her status as a child in need of care and protection\n\nsoon after she gets married. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_241\">The JJ Act</a> provides that efforts must be made\n\nto ensure the care, protection, appropriate rehabilitation or restoration of a\n\ngirl child who is at imminent risk of marriage and therefore a child in need\n\nof care and protection.

For this purpose, special provisions have been made in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_247\">POCSO Act</a> as for example <a href=\"/doc/194699880/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 28</a> thereof which provides for the\n\nestablishment of a Special Court to try offences under the Act. <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 29</a> of\n\nthe POCSO Act provides that where a person is prosecuted for committing\n\nor abetting or attempting to commit an offence under <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 3</a> (penetrative\n\nsexual assault) or under <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_251\">Section 5</a> (aggravated penetrative sexual assault)\n\nthen the Special Court shall presume that such a person has committed or\n\nabetted or attempted to commit the offence unless the contrary is proved.\n\nSimilarly, the procedure and powers of a Special Court have been delineated\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/25370054/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 33</a> of the POCSO Act and this section provides for not only a\n\nchild friendly atmosphere in the Special Court but also child friendly\n\n  W.P.

However, of much greater importance and significance is <a href=\"/doc/136804760/\" id=\"a_254\">Section\n\n42-A</a> of the POCSO Act. This section provides that the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_255\">POCSO Act</a> are in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any\n\nother law in force which includes the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_256\">IPC</a>. Moreover, the section provides\n\nthat in the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_257\">POCSO\n\nAct</a> and any other law, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_258\">POCSO Act</a> shall have\n\noverriding effect. It follows from this that even though the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_259\">IPC</a>\n\ndecriminalizes the marital rape of a girl child, the husband of the girl child\n\nwould nevertheless be liable for punishment under the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_260\">POCSO Act</a> for aggravated penetrative sexual assault.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">98.   Prima facie it might appear that since rape is an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_261\">IPC</a>\n\n(subject to Exception 2 to Section 375) while penetrative sexual assault or\n\naggravated penetrative sexual assault is an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_262\">POCSO Act</a>\n\nand both are distinct and separate statutes, therefore there is no inconsistency\n\nbetween the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_263\">IPC</a> and the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_264\">POCSO Act</a>.\n\nHowever the fact is that there is no real distinction between the definition of\n\nrape under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_265\">IPC</a> and the definition of penetrative sexual assault under the\n\n  W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                            Page 64\n\f<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_266\">POCSO Act</a>. There is also no real distinction between the rape of a married\n\ngirl child and aggravated penetrative sexual assault punishable under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_267\">Section\n\n6</a> of the POCSO Act. Additionally, the punishment for the respective\n\noffences is the same, except that the marital rape of a girl child between 15\n\nand 18 years of age is not rape in view of Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 375</a> of the\n\nIPC. In sum, marital rape of a girl child is effectively nothing but aggravated\n\npenetrative sexual assault and there is no reason why it should not be\n\npunishable under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_269\">IPC</a>. Therefore, it does appear that\n\nonly a notional or linguistic distinction is sought to be made between rape\n\nand penetrative sexual assault and rape of a married girl child and\n\naggravated penetrative sexual assault. There is no rationale for this\n\ndistinction and it is nothing but a completely arbitrary and discriminatory\n\ndistinction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">Harmonious and purposive interpretation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">99.

On a complete assessment of the law and the documentary material, it\n\n     appears that there are really five options before us: (i) To let the incongruity\n\n     remain as it is – this does not seem a viable option to us, given that the lives\n\n     of thousands of young girls are at stake; (ii) To strike down as\n\n     unconstitutional Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_278\">Section 375</a> of the IPC – in the present case\n\n       W.P.

Being purposive and harmonious constructionists, we are\n\nof opinion that this is the only pragmatic option available. Therefore, we are\n\nleft with absolutely no other option but to harmonize the system of laws\n\nrelating to children and require Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_284\">Section 375</a> of the IPC to now\n\nbe meaningfully read as: “Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with\n\nhis own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.” It\n\nis only through this reading that the intent of social justice to the married girl\n\nchild and the constitutional vision of the framers of our Constitution can be\n\npreserved and protected and perhaps given impetus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">  W.P.

In this\n\nregard, the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_314\">IPC</a> was amended in 1891 and the age under both the provisions was\n\nraised to 12 years. In 1925, the age of consent was raised under clause Sixthly to\n\n14 years but under the Exception 2 the age was retained at 13 years. In 1929, the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/323064/\" id=\"a_315\">Child Marriage Restraint Act</a> was enacted. <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_316\">Section 3</a> of this Act provided that the\n\n        W.P.

Surprisingly, the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_336\">Section 6</a> provided that no\n\nwomen could be punished with imprisonment. The punishments provided under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/5937407/\" id=\"a_337\">Restraint Act</a> were virtually illusory and no minimum punishment was\n\nprescribed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">14.   <a href=\"/doc/5937407/\" id=\"a_338\">The Restraint Act</a> was repealed and replaced by the PCMA. The provisions\n\nof the PCMA are slightly more stringent. Under <a href=\"/doc/189856688/\" id=\"a_339\">Section 9</a> of the PCMA, if a male\n\nadult above 18 years of age contracts a child marriage, he can be sentenced to\n\nrigorous imprisonment up to 2 years or fine which may extend up to one lakh\n\nrupees or both. However, no minimum sentence is provided even under this Act.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/174845796/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 10</a> of the PCMA provides punishment for those persons who perform,\n\n\n        W.P.

As far\n\nas the guardians and parents are concerned, the punishment for them is provided\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/195567966/\" id=\"a_341\">Section 11</a> and it is the same. Again, the proviso lays down that no woman\n\nshall be punishable with imprisonment. Though this Court is not dealing with this\n\nquestion directly in the present petition, it is obvious that a woman would be\n\nplaced in the forefront by any person who gets a child marriage conducted. Such a\n\nwoman cannot be sentenced to undergo imprisonment and at the most, a fine can\n\nbe levied.    The punishments provided are neither sufficiently punitive nor\n\ndeterrent. Therefore, the PCMA has been breached with impunity. I think the\n\ntime has come when this Act needs serious reconsideration, especially in view of\n\nthe harsh reality that a lot of child trafficking is taking place under the garb of\n\nmarriage including child marriage.       More stringent punishments should be\n\nprovided and some minimum punishment should definitely be provided especially\n\nto those mature adults who promote such marriages and who perform, conduct,\n\ndirect or abet any such marriage. Otherwise, this legislation will never act as a\n\nsufficient deterrent to prevent or even reduce child marriages.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">15.

This provision deals with\n\ngirls below the age of 15 years who are got married. Such a girl is required to\n\nrepudiate her marriage before she attains majority and she can only repudiate the\n\nmarriage if the marriage has not been consummated.           This virtually makes\n\nmockery of the PCMA. Therefore, even in a marriage which is void under\n\nPCMA, the girl will have to obtain a decree for dissolution of her marriage, that\n\ntoo before she attains the age of majority and only if the marriage has not been\n\nconsummated. Another anomalous situation is that if the husband has forcible sex\n\nwith such a girl, the marriage is consummated and the girl child is deprived of her\n\nright to get the marriage annulled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_190\">18.

This is also not in consonance with the provisions of\n\nPCMA, according to which marriage of a child bride below the age of 15 years is\n\nvoid and there is no question of seeking a divorce. A void marriage is no\n\nmarriage. Another anomaly is that whereas a child bride, who is above 15 years\n\nunder PCMA, can apply for annulment of marriage up to the age of 20 years,\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/352219/\" id=\"a_348\">Section 13(2)(iv)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, a child bride under the age of\n\n15 years must repudiate the marriage after attaining the age of 15 years but before\n\nshe attains the age of 18 years, i.e. even before she attains majority. The question\n\nthat remains unanswered is who will represent or help this child, who has been\n\nforced to marry to approach the Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">19.   It is obvious that while making amendments to various laws, some laws are\n\nforgotten and consequential amendments are not made in those laws.

In my opinion, the PCMA is a secular Act\n\napplicable to all.

It\n\nis, therefore, apparent that while amending Section 198 of the Code, the legislature\n\nwas visualising that there can be marital rape with a “wife” aged less than 18 years\n\nbut was prescribing a limitation of one year, for taking cognizance of such an\n\noffence.

As far as marriage laws are concerned, as far back as 1978, the minimum\n\nage of marriage of a girl child was increased to 18 years. <a href=\"/doc/5937407/\" id=\"a_393\">The Restraint Act</a>, was\n\nreplaced by the PCMA wherein also marriage of a girl child aged below 18 years\n\nis prohibited. However, <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_394\">Section 3</a> of the PCMA makes a child marriage voidable\n\nat the option of that party, who was a child at the time of marriage. The petition\n\nfor annulling the child marriage must be filed within 2 years of the child attaining\n\nmajority. Therefore, a girl who was married before she attained the age of 18\n\nyears, can get her marriage annulled before she attains the age of 20 years.\n\nSimilarly, a male child can get the marriage annulled before attaining the age of 23\n\nyears. Even when the child is minor, a petition for annulment can be filed by the\n\nguardian or next friend of the child along with the Child Marriage Prohibition\n\nOfficer.

The fact that child marriage is a reprehensible\n\npractice; that it is an abhorrent practice; that it violates the human rights of a child,\n\ncannot be seriously disputed. I am not oblivious to the harsh reality that most of\n\nthe child brides are even below the age of 15 years. There is a practice in many\n\nparts of the country where children, both girls and boys, are married off, even\n\nbefore they attain puberty.          They are innocent children, who do not even\n\nunderstand what marriage is. The practice which is widely prevalent is that a girl\n\nwho is married pre-puberty is normally kept at her parents’ home and is sent to her\n\nmatrimonial home after she attains puberty in a ceremony which is commonly\n\nreferred to as ‘gauna’. Can the marriage of a child aged 3-4 years, by any stretch\n\nof imagination, be called a legal and valid marriage?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_209\">30.

It is distressing to note that the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_407\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860\n                acquiesces child marriage. The exception to Section 375 specifically\n                lays down that sexual intercourse of man with his own wife, the wife\n                not being under fifteen years of age is not rape, thus ruling out the\n                possibility of marital rape when the age of wife is above fifteen years.\n                On the other hand, if the girl is not the wife of the man, but is below\n                sixteen, then the sexual intercourse even with the consent of the girl\n                amounts to rape? It is rather shocking to note the specific relaxation is\n                given to a husband who rapes his wife, when she happens to be\n                between 15-16 years. This provision in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_408\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860\n                is a specific illustration of legislative endorsement and sanction to\n                child marriages.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47946406\" id=\"span_35\">43.

The said marriage is not a “valid marriage” stricto\n               sensu as per the classification but it is “not invalid”. The male\n               contracting party shall not enjoin all the rights which would otherwise\n               emanate from a valid marriage stricto sensu, instead he will enjoin\n               only limited rights.”\n\n\n\nReference to these judgments has been made only for the purpose of highlighting\n\nthe concern shown by the Courts with regard to child marriage and the manner in\n\nwhich the Courts have consistently held that the child marriage is an evil which\n\nshould be avoided.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">THE KARNATAKA EXPERIENCE\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">44.

The photographs reveal, the marriage of minor\n              girls, not yet in their teens, to fully grown men. In one of the\n              photographs, the girl has been made to stand on a chair, so that she\n              could garland her tall and fully grown groom. Forced marriage of the\n              girl child, one realises, is one of the manifestations of cruelty, possibly\n              without any equivalent comparison. It seems that the practice is\n              common place in this part of the world. It may have remained\n              unchecked for a variety of reasons including, poverty, lack of\n              education, culture and ignorance. We are of the view that allowing the\n              evil to continue without redressing it, would make us a party to the\n              disgraceful activity.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">45.   After making the aforesaid observations, the Karnataka High Court\n\nconstituted a four Member committee, headed by Dr. Justice Shivraj V. Patil,\n\nformer Judge of this Court, to expose the extent of practice of child marriage. The\n\nCommittee was also requested to suggest ways and means to root out the evil of\n\nchild marriage from society and to prevent it to the maximum extent possible. The\n\nCore Committee submitted its report and made various recommendations. One of\n\nits recommendations was that marriage of a girl child below the age of 18 years\n\nshould be declared void ab initio. Pursuant to the report of the Core Committee, in\n\nthe State of Karnataka an amendment was made in the PCMA and <a href=\"/doc/168582861/\" id=\"a_411\">Section 1(A)</a>\n\nhas been inserted after sub-<a href=\"/doc/127722677/\" id=\"a_412\">section 2</a> <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_413\">Section 3</a>, which reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">              “(1A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) every\n              child marriage solemnized on or after the date of coming into force of\n              the <a href=\"/doc/790355/\" id=\"a_414\">Prohibition of Child Marriage (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 2016</a>\n              shall be void ab initio.”\n\n\n\n\n        W.P.

Therefore, any marriage of a child, i.e. a female aged below 18 years and a\n\nmale below 21 years is void ab initio in the State of Karnataka. This is how the\n\nlaw should have been throughout the country. Where the marriage is void, there\n\ncannot be a husband or a wife and I have no doubt that protection of Exception 2\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_415\">Section 375</a> IPC cannot be availed of by those persons, who claim to be\n\n“husband” of “child brides” pursuant to a marriage which is illegal and void.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_232\">47.   This leads to an anomalous situation. In Karnataka, if a husband has sexual\n\nintercourse with his “wife” aged below 18 years, since such marriage would be\n\nvoid ab initio, the wife cannot be treated to be a legal wife and, therefore, the\n\nhusband cannot get the benefit of Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_416\">Section 375</a> IPC whereas in rest\n\nof the country he would be entitled to the benefit of such exception and be\n\nimmune from prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_233\">\n\nTHE DEFENCE OF SOCIAL REALITY\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_234\">48.   The main defence raised on behalf of the Union of India is that though the\n\npractice of child marriage may be reprehensible, though it may have been made\n\nillegal, the harsh reality is that 20% to 30% of female children below the age of 18\n\nyears are got married in total violation of the PCMA. According to the Union of\n\nIndia, keeping in view this stark reality and also keeping in view the sanctity\n\nwhich is attached to a union like marriage, the Parliament, in its wisdom, thought\n\n\n        W.P.

It has also been\n\nurged that when Parliament enacts any law which falls within its jurisdiction, then\n\nthis Court should not normally interfere with that Act. When any law is passed,\n\nthe Court must presume that the Parliament has gone into all aspects of the matter.\n\nThough it was faintly urged before us by learned counsel for the petitioner that the\n\nParliament did not go into certain aspects, this Court is clearly of the view that\n\nsuch ignorance cannot be imputed to Parliament. In our constitutional framework,\n\nwhere there is division of powers, each repository of power must respect the other\n\nand this Court must extend to the Parliament the respect it deserves. One cannot\n\nand should not impute ignorance to the legislature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">49.

These\n\nfacts clearly show that Parliament knowingly took a decision not to criminalize\n\nsexual activity between husband and wife.             In the 84th Report of the Law\n\nCommission, it was recommended that the age of consent under clause Sixthly of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_424\">Section 375</a> IPC, should be increased to 18 years and Exception 2 should be\n\ndeleted. In the 172nd Report of the Law Commission, it was recommended that the\n\nage of consent under clause Sixthly should be retained at 16 years, but the Law\n\nCommission specifically opined that there should be no distinction on account of\n\nmarriage of the girl child and the age in Exception 2 be raised from 15 to 16 years.\n\nThe Justice Verma Committee did not make any recommendation to change the\n\nage of consent under clause Sixthly. However Parliament, while amending the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_425\">IPC</a>\n\nin the year 2014, in the wake of the “Nirbhaya” incident, decided to increase the\n\n        W.P.

Interestingly, though the Verma Committee did not recommend that the age\n\nof consent should be increased under clause Sixthly from 16 to 18 years, but it did\n\nrecommend that Exception 2 should be completely deleted. The Parliament took\n\nnote of the Verma Committee report. It also took note of the recommendations of\n\nthe Law Commission and a Standing Committee was constituted and Parliament\n\nenacted this law pursuant to the recommendations of the Standing Committee. It\n\nwould also be pertinent to mention that one Member of Parliament, Mr. Saugata\n\nRoy moved a Private Member’s Bill to fix the age at 18 years in Exception 2 of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_427\">Section 375</a> IPC, but that amendment was not carried.

Where there is challenge to the constitutional validity of a law\n               enacted by the legislature, the Court must keep in view that there is\n               always a presumption of constitutionality of an enactment, and a clear\n               transgression of constitutional principles must be shown. The\n               fundamental nature and importance of the legislative process needs to\n               be recognised by the Court and due regard and deference must be\n               accorded to the legislative process. Where the legislation is sought to\n               be challenged as being unconstitutional and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_437\">Article 14</a> of\n               the Constitution, the Court must remind itself to the principles relating\n               to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_438\">Article 14</a> in relation to invalidation of\n               legislation. The two dimensions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_439\">Article 14</a> in its application to\n               legislation and rendering legislation invalid are now well recognised\n               and these are: (i) discrimination, based on an impermissible or invalid\n               classification, and (ii) excessive delegation of powers; conferment of\n               uncanalised and unguided powers on the executive, whether in the\n               form of delegated legislation or by way of conferment of authority to\n               pass administrative orders – if such conferment is without any\n               guidance, control or checks, it is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_440\">Article 14</a> of the\n               Constitution. The Court also needs to be mindful that a legislation\n               does not become unconstitutional merely because there is another\n               view or because another method may be considered to be as good or\n               even more effective, like any issue of social, or even economic policy.\n               It is well settled that the courts do not substitute their views on what\n               the policy is.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">57.

The relevant\n\nobservations are as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">               “12. It would be wrong to assume that there is an element of judicial\n               arrogance in the act of the Courts in striking down an enactment. The\n               Constitution has assigned to the Courts the function of determining as\n               to whether the laws made by the Legislature are in conformity with\n               the provisions of the Constitution. In adjudicating the constitutional\n               validity of statutes, the Courts discharge an obligation which has been\n               imposed upon them by the Constitution. The Courts would be shirking\n               their responsibility if they hesitate to declare the provisions of a\n               statute to be unconstitutional, even though those provisions are found\n               to be violative of the Articles of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_443\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_444\">226</a>\n               are an integral part of the Constitution and provide remedies for\n               enforcement of fundamental rights and other rights conferred by the\n               Constitution. Hesitation or refusal on the part of the Courts to declare\n               the provisions of an enactment to be unconstitutional, even though\n               they are found to infringe the Constitution because of any notion of\n               judicial humility would in a large number of cases have the effect of\n               taking away or in any case eroding the remedy provided to the\n               aggrieved parties by the Constitution. Abnegation in matters affecting\n               one’s own interest may sometimes be commendable but abnegation in\n               a matter where power is conferred to protect the interest of others\n               against measures which are violative of the Constitution is fraught\n               with serious consequences. It is as much the duty of the Courts to\n               declare a provision of an enactment to be unconstitutional if it\n               contravenes any Article of the Constitution as it is theirs to uphold its\n               validity in case it is found to suffer from no such infirmity.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">59.    Therefore, the principle is that normally the Courts should raise a\n\npresumption in favour of the impugned law; however, if the law under challenge\n\nviolates the fundamental rights of the citizens, the law is arbitrary, or is\n\ndiscriminatory, the Courts can either hold the law to be totally unconstitutional and\n\nstrike down the law or the Court may read down the law in such a manner that the\n        W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                                    Page 106\n\flaw when read down does not violate the Constitution. While the Courts must\n\nshow restraint while dealing with such issues, the Court cannot shut its eyes to the\n\nviolations of the fundamental rights of the citizens. Therefore, if the legislature\n\nenacts a law which is violative of the fundamental rights of the citizens, is\n\narbitrary and discriminatory, then the Court would be failing in its duty if it does\n\nnot either strike down the law or read down the law in such a manner that it falls\n\nwithin the four corners of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">60.    It is not the job of the Court to decide whether a law is good or bad. Policy\n\nmatters fall within the realm of legislature and not of the Courts. The Court,\n\nhowever, is empowered and has the jurisdiction to decide whether a law is\n\nunconstitutional or not.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">61.    “The law is an ass” said Mr. Bumble51. That may be so. The law, however,\n\ncannot be arbitrary or discriminatory. Merely because a law is asinine, it cannot\n\nbe set aside. However, if the law is arbitrary, discriminatory and violates the\n\nfundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens of the country, then the law can\n\neither be struck down or can be read down to make it in consonance with the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_250\">51 Oliver Twist: Author Charles Dickens\n\n\n         W.P.

In this case, we are concerned mainly with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_480\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_481\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. The legislative history given above clearly indicates that a\n\nchild has universally been defined as a person below 18 years of age in all the\n\nenactments. This has been done for the reason that it is perceived that a person\n\nbelow the age of 18 years is not fully developed and does not know the\n\nconsequences of his/her actions. Not only is a person below the age of 18 years\n\ntreated to be a child, but is also not even entitled to deal with his property, enter\n\ninto a contract or even vote.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_258\">68.   The fact that child marriage is an abhorrent practice and is violative of\n\nhuman rights of the child is not seriously disputed by the Union of India. The only\n\njustification given is that since a large number of child marriages are taking place,\n\nit would not be proper to criminalize the consummation of such child marriages.\n\nIt is urged that, keeping in view age old traditions and evolving social norms, the\n\npractice of child marriage cannot be wished away and, therefore, legislature in its\n\nwisdom has thought it fit not to criminalize the consummation of such child\n\nmarriages.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_259\">69.   I am not impressed with the arguments raised by the Union of India. Merely\n\nbecause something is going on for a long time is no ground to legitimise and\n\nlegalise an activity which is per se illegal and a criminal offence. No doubt, it is\n\ntotally within the realm of Parliament to decide what should be the age of consent\n\n\n        W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                          Page 112\n\funder clause Sixthly of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_482\">Section 375</a> IPC. It is also within the domain of the\n\nParliament to decide what should be the minimum age of marriage.                  The\n\nParliament has decided in both the enactments that a girl below 18 years is not\n\ncapable of giving consent to have sex and legally she cannot marry.       Parliament\n\nhas also, in no uncertain terms, prohibited child marriage and come to the\n\nconclusion that child marriage is an activity which must come to an end. If that be\n\nso, can the practice of child marriage which is admittedly “an evil”, and is also a\n\ncriminal offence be set up as an exception in a case of a girl child, who is\n\nsubjected to sexual intercourse by her so called husband. Shockingly, even if this\n\nsexual intercourse is forcible and without the consent of the girl child, then also\n\nthe husband is not liable for any offence. This law is definitely not right, just and\n\nfair and is, therefore, arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_260\">70.   There can be no dispute that every citizen of this country has the right to get\n\ngood healthcare.      Every citizen can expect that the State shall make best\n\nendeavours for ensuring that the health of the citizen is not adversely affected. By\n\nnow it is well settled by a catena of judgments of this Court that the “right to life”\n\nenvisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_483\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is not merely a right to live an\n\nanimal existence. This Court has repeatedly held that right to life means a right to\n\nlive with human dignity. Life should be meaningful and worth living. Life has\n\nmany shades. Good health is the raison d’etre of a good life. Without good health\n\n\n         W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                          Page 113\n\fthere cannot be a good life. In the case of a minor girl child good health would\n\nmean her right to develop as a healthy woman. This not only requires good\n\nphysical health but also good mental health. The girl child must be encouraged to\n\nbloom into a healthy woman. The girl child must not be deprived of her right of\n\nchoice. The girl child must not be deprived of her right to study further. When the\n\ngirl child is deprived of her right to study further, she is actually deprived of her\n\nright to develop into a mature woman, who can earn independently and live as a\n\nself sufficient independent woman. In the modern age, when we talk of gender\n\nequality, the girl child must be given equal opportunity to develop like a male\n\nchild. In fact, in my view, because of the patriarchal nature of our society, some\n\nextra benefit must be showered upon the girl child to ensure that she is not\n\ndeprived of her right to life, which would include her right to grow and develop\n\nphysically, mentally and economically as an independent self sufficient female\n\nadult.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">71.      It is true that at times the State, because of paucity of funds, or other reasons\n\nbeyond its control, cannot live up to the expectations of the people. At the same\n\ntime, it is not expected that the State should frame a law, which adversely affects\n\nthe health of a citizen, that too a minor girl child. The State, under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_484\">Article 15</a> of\n\nthe Constitution, is in fact, empowered to make laws favouring women.\n\nReservation for women is envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_485\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution. In\n\n\n           W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                            Page 114\n\fVishakha v. State of Rajasthan62, this Court held that sexual harassment of\n\nworking women amounts to violation of the rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_486\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_487\">, 15</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_488\">23</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_262\">72.   When a girl is compelled to marry before she attains the age of 18 years, her\n\nhealth is put in serious jeopardy. As is evident from various reports referred to\n\nabove, girls who were married before the age of 19 years are likely to suffer\n\nmedical and psychological problems. A 15 or 16 year old girl, when forcibly\n\nsubjected to sexual intercourse by her “husband”, undergoes a trauma, which her\n\nbody and mind is not ready to face. The girl child is also twice as more likely to\n\ndie in child birth than a grown up woman. The least, that one would expect in\n\nsuch a situation, is that the State would not take the defence of tradition and\n\nsanctity of marriage in respect of girl child, which would be totally violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_489\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_490\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_491\">21</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, this Court is of the view that\n\nException 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_492\">Section 375</a> IPC is arbitrary since it is violative of the principles\n\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_493\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_494\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_495\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_263\">73.   Approaching this aspect from another angle. As is evident from various\n\nreports filed in this case, child marriages are not restricted to girls aged above 15\n\nyears. Even as per the National Plan of Action for Children, 2016 prepared by the\n\nMinistry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, 30.3%\n\n\n62 (1997) 6 SCC 241\n\n\n        W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                          Page 115\n\fmarriages i.e. almost 1 in every 3 marriage takes place in violation of the PCMA.\n\nMany of these relate to child brides aged less than 15 years. A girl may be married\n\nwhen she is 3-4 years or may be 10-11 years old. She may be sent to her\n\nmatrimonial home on attaining the age of puberty, which may be well before she\n\nattains the age of 15 years. In such an eventuality, what is the reason for fixing the\n\nmagic figure of 15 years. This figure had relevance when under the criminal law\n\nand the marriage laws the age was similar. In the year 1940, the age of consent\n\nwas 16 years, the age of marriage was 15 years and the age under the exception\n\nwas also 15 years; in 1975, the age of consent was 16 years, the age of marriage\n\nwas 18 years, but the age under the exception remained 15 years. That may have\n\nbeen there because there was no change in the age of consent under Clause\n\nSixthly. Now when the age of consent is changed to 18 years, the minimum age of\n\nmarriage is also 18 years and, therefore, fixing a lower age under Exception 2 is\n\ntotally irrational. It strikes against the concept of equality. It violates the right of\n\nfair treatment of the girl child, who is unable to look after herself. The magic\n\nfigure of 15 years is not based on any scientific evaluation, but is based on the\n\nmere fact that it has been existing for a long time. The age of 15 years in\n\nException 2 was fixed in the year 1940 when the minimum age for marriage was\n\nalso 15 and the age of consent under clause Sixthly was 16. In the present context\n\nwhen the age for marriage has been fixed at 18 years and when the age of consent\n\n\n        W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                             Page 116\n\fis also fixed at 18 years, keeping the age under Exception 2 at 15 years, cannot be\n\nsaid to be right, just and fair. In fact, it is arbitrary and oppressive to the girl child.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_264\">74.   Law cannot be hidebound and static. It has to evolve and change with the\n\nneeds of the society. Recognising these factors, the Parliament increased the\n\nminimum age for marriage. The Parliament also increased the minimum age of\n\nconsent but the inaction in raising the age in Exception 2 is by itself an arbitrary\n\nnon-exercise of power. When the age was being raised in all other laws, the age\n\nunder Exception 2 should also have been raised to bring it in line with the\n\nevolving laws especially the laws to protect women and the girl child aged below\n\n18 years. Therefore, I have no hesitation in holding that the Exception 2, in so far\n\nas it relates to the girl child below eighteen years, is unreasonable, unjust, unfair\n\nand violative of the rights of the girl child. To that extent the same is arbitrary and\n\nliable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_265\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_11\">WHETHER    EXCEPTION                   2     TO       SECTION          375     <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_496\">IPC</a>      IS\nDISCRIMINATORY?\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_266\">75.   There can be no dispute that a law can be set aside if it is discriminatory.\n\nSome elements of discrimination have already been dealt with while dealing with\n\nthe issue of arbitrariness. However, there are certain other aspects which make\n\nException 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_497\">Section 375</a> IPC in so far as it deals with the girl child totally\n\ndiscriminatory. The law discriminates between a girl child aged less than 18 years,\n\n         W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                              Page 117\n\fwho may be educated and has sexual intercourse with her consent and a girl child\n\nwho may be married even before the age of 15 years, but her marriage has been\n\nconsummated after 15 years even against her consent.             This is invidious\n\ndiscrimination which is writ large. The discrimination is between a consenting girl\n\nchild, who is almost an adult and non-consenting child bride. To give an example,\n\nif a girl aged 15 years is married off by her parents without her consent and the\n\nmarriage is consummated against her consent, then also this girl child cannot file a\n\ncriminal case against her husband. The State is talking of the reality of the child\n\nmarriages. What about the reality of the rights of the girl child? Can this helpless,\n\nunderprivileged girl be deprived of her rights to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to marriage? Can\n\nshe be deprived of her right to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to having sex with her husband,\n\neven if she has consented for the marriage? In my view, there is only one answer\n\nto this and the answer must be a resounding “NO”. While interpreting such a law\n\nthe interpretation which must be preferred is the one which protects the human\n\nrights of the child, which protects the fundamental rights of the child, the one\n\nwhich ensures the good health of the child and not the one which tries to say that\n\nthough the practice is “evil” but since it is going on for a long time, such\n\n“criminal” acts should be decriminalised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_267\">76.   The State is entitled and empowered to fix the age of consent. The State can\n\nmake reasonable classification but while making any classification it must show\n\n\n        W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                          Page 118\n\fthat the classification has been made with the object of achieving a certain end.\n\nThe classification must have a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be\n\nachieved. In this case the justification given by the State is only that it does not\n\nwant to punish those who consummate their marriage. The stand of the State is\n\nthat keeping in view the sanctity attached to the institution of marriage, it has\n\ndecided to make a provision in the nature of Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_498\">Section 375</a> IPC. This\n\nbegs the question as to why in this exception the age has been fixed as 15 years\n\nand not 18 years. As pointed out earlier, a girl can legally consent to have sex only\n\nafter she attains the age of 18 years. She can legally enter into marriage only after\n\nattaining the age of 18 years. When a girl gets married below the age of 18 years,\n\nthe persons who contract such a marriage or abet in contracting such child\n\nmarriage, commit a criminal offence and are liable for punishment under the\n\nPCMA. In view of this position there is no rationale for fixing the age at 15 years.\n\nThis age has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved viz., maintaining the\n\nsanctity of marriage because by law such a marriage is not legal. It may be true\n\nthat this marriage is voidable and not void ab initio (except in the State of\n\nKarnataka) but the fact remains that if the girl has got married before the age of 18\n\nyears, she has right to get her marriage annulled. Irrespective of the fact that the\n\nright of the girl child to get her marriage annulled, it is indisputable that a criminal\n\noffence has been committed and other than the girl child, all other persons\n\n\n        W.P.

In my opinion, when the\n\nState on the one hand, has, by legislation, laid down that abetting child marriage is\n\na criminal offence, it cannot, on the other hand defend this classification of girls\n\nbelow 18 years on the ground of sanctity of marriage because such classification\n\nhas no nexus with the object sought to be achieved. Therefore, also Exception 2 in\n\nso far as it relates to girls below 18 years is discriminatory and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_499\">Article\n\n14</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_268\">77.   One more ground for holding that Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_500\">Section 375</a> IPC is\n\ndiscriminatory is that this is the only provision in various penal laws which gives\n\nimmunity to the husband. The husband is not immune from prosecution as far as\n\nother offences are concerned. Therefore, if the husband beats a girl child and has\n\nforcible sexual intercourse with her, he may be charged for offences under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_501\">Sections 323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_502\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_503\">325</a> IPC etc. but he cannot be charged with rape. This leads to\n\nan anomalous and astounding situation where the husband can be charged with\n\nlesser offences, but not with the more serious offence of rape. As far as sexual\n\ncrimes against women are concerned, these are covered by <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_504\">Sections 354</a>, <a href=\"/doc/106760949/\" id=\"a_505\">354A</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/166765731/\" id=\"a_506\">354B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/26970281/\" id=\"a_507\">354C</a>, <a href=\"/doc/27280854/\" id=\"a_508\">354D</a> of the IPC. These relate to assault or use of criminal force\n\nagainst a woman with intent to outrage her modesty; sexual harassment and\n\npunishment for sexual harassment; assault or use of criminal force to woman with\n\n\n        W.P.

There is no exception\n\nclause giving immunity to the husband for such offences. <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_509\">The Domestic Violence\n\nAct</a> will also apply in such cases and the husband does not get immunity. There\n\nare many other offences where the husband is either specifically liable or may be\n\none of the accused. The husband is not given the immunity in any other penal\n\nprovision except in Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_510\">Section 375</a> IPC. It does not stand to reason\n\nthat only for the offence of rape the husband should be granted such an immunity\n\nespecially where the “victim wife” is aged below 18 years i.e. below the legal age\n\nof marriage and is also not legally capable of giving consent to have sexual\n\nintercourse. Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_511\">Section 375</a> IPC is, therefore, discriminatory and\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_512\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India, on this count also.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_269\">78.   The discrimination is absolutely patent and, therefore, in my view, Exception\n\n2, in so far as it relates to the girl child between 15 to 18 years is not only arbitrary\n\nbut also discriminatory, against the girl child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_270\">\n\nLAW IN CONFLICT WITH POCSO\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_271\">79.   Another aspect of the matter is that the POSCO was enacted by Parliament\n\nin the year 2012 and it came into force on 14th November, 2012. Certain\n\namendments were made by <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_513\">Criminal Law Amendment Act</a> of 2013, whereby\n\n<a href=\"/doc/174867083/\" id=\"a_514\">Section 42</a> and <a href=\"/doc/136804760/\" id=\"a_515\">Section 42A</a>, which have been enumerated above, were added. It\n\n\n        W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                             Page 121\n\fwould be pertinent to note that these amendments in POCSO were brought by the\n\nsame Amendment Act by which Section 375, Section 376 and other sections of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_516\">IPC</a> relating to crimes against women were amended. The definition of rape was\n\nenlarged and the punishment under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_517\">Section 375</a> IPC was made much more severe.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/174867083/\" id=\"a_518\">Section 42</a> of POCSO, as mentioned above, makes it clear that where an offence is\n\npunishable, both under POCSO and also under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_519\">IPC</a>, then the offender, if found\n\nguilty of such offence, is liable to be punished under that Act, which provides for\n\nmore severe punishment.       This is against the traditional concept of criminal\n\njurisprudence that if two punishments are provided, then the benefit of the lower\n\npunishment should be given to the offender. The legislature knowingly introduced\n\n<a href=\"/doc/174867083/\" id=\"a_520\">Section 42</a> of POCSO to protect the interests of the child. As the objects and\n\nreasons of the POCSO show, this Act was enacted as a special provision for\n\nprotection of children, with a view to ensure that children of tender age are not\n\nabused during their childhood and youth. These children were to be protected\n\nfrom exploitation and given facilities to develop in a healthy manner. When a girl\n\nis married at the age of 15 years, it is not only her human right of choice, which is\n\nviolated. She is also deprived of having an education; she is deprived of leading a\n\nyouthful life. Early marriage and consummation of child marriage affects the\n\nhealth of the girl child. All these ill effects of early marriage have been recognised\n\nby the Government of India in its own documents, referred to hereinabove.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_272\">        W.P.

The first part of the Section provides\n\nthat the Act is in addition to and not in derogation of any other law. Therefore, the\n\nprovisions of POCSO are in addition to and not above any other law. However,\n\nthe second part of <a href=\"/doc/136804760/\" id=\"a_522\">Section 42A</a> provides that in case of any inconsistency between\n\nthe provisions of POCSO and any other law, then it is the provisions of POCSO,\n\nwhich will have an overriding effect to the extent of inconsistency. POCSO\n\ndefines a child to be a person below the age of 18 years. Penetrative sexual assault\n\nand aggravated penetrative sexual assault have been defined in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_523\">Section 3</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_524\">Section 5</a> of POCSO. Provisions of <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_525\">Section 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_526\">5</a> are by and large similar to\n\nSection 375 and <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_527\">Section 376</a> of IPC. <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_528\">Section 3</a> of the POCSO is identical to the\n\nopening portion of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_529\">Section 375</a> of IPC whereas <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_530\">Section 5</a> of POCSO is similar to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1677485/\" id=\"a_531\">Section 376(2)</a> of the IPC. Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_532\">Section 375</a> of IPC, which makes\n\nsexual intercourse or acts of consensual sex of a man with his own “wife” not\n\nbeing under 15 years of age, not an offence, is not found in any provision of\n\nPOCSO. Therefore, this is a major inconsistency between POCSO and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_533\">IPC</a>. As\n\nprovided in <a href=\"/doc/136804760/\" id=\"a_534\">Section 42A</a>, in case of such an inconsistency, POCSO will prevail.\n\nMoreover, POCSO is a special Act, dealing with the children whereas <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_535\">IPC</a> is the\n\ngeneral criminal law. Therefore, POCSO will prevail over <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_536\">IPC</a> and Exception 2 in\n\nso far as it relates to children, is inconsistent with POCSO.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_274\">        W.P.

One of the doubts raised was if this Court strikes down, partially or fully,\n\nException 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_537\">Section 375</a> IPC, is the Court creating a new offence. There can be\n\nno cavil of doubt that the Courts cannot create an offence. However, there can be\n\nno manner of doubt that by partly striking down <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_538\">Section 375</a> IPC, no new offence\n\nis being created. The offence already exists in the main part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_539\">Section 375</a> IPC as\n\nwell as in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_540\">Section 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_541\">5</a> of POCSO. What has been done is only to read down\n\nException 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_542\">Section 375</a> IPC to bring it in consonance with the Constitution and\n\nPOCSO.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_276\">82.    In this behalf, reference may be made to some English decisions.                  In\n\nEngland, there was never any such statutory exception granting immunity to the\n\nhusband from the offence of marital rape. However, Sir Mathew Hale, who was\n\nChief Justice of England for five years prior to his death in 1676, was credited\n\nwith having laid down the following principle:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">                 “But the husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself\n                 upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and\n                 contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband\n                 which she cannot retract.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_277\">83.    The aforesaid principle, commonly known as Hale’s principle, was recorded\n\nin the History of the Pleas of the Crown 63 and was followed in England for many\n\nyears. Under Hale’s principle a husband could not be held guilty of raping his\n63 (1736), Vol. 1, Ch. 58, P. 629\n\n\n          W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013                                                Page 124\n\fwife. This principle was based on the proposition that the wife gives up her body\n\nto her husband at the time of marriage. Women, at that time, were considered to be\n\nchattel. It was also presumed that on marriage, a woman had given her irrevocable\n\nconsent to have sexual intercourse with her husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_278\">84.    The aforesaid principle was followed in England for more than two\n\ncenturies. For the first time in Reg v. Clarence64, some doubts were raised by\n\nJustice Wills with regard to this proposition. In Rex v. Clarke65, Hale’s principle\n\nwas given the burial it deserved and it was held that the husband’s immunity as\n\nexpounded by Hale, no longer exists. Dealing with the creation of new offence,\n\nthe House of Lords held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">                “The remaining and no less difficult question is whether, despite that\n                view, this is an area where the court should step aside to leave the\n                matter to the Parliamentary process. This is not the creation of a new\n                offence, it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become\n                anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having\n                reached that conclusion to act upon it.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_279\">85.    In my view, as far as this case is concerned, this Court is not creating any\n\nnew offence but only removing what was unconstitutional and offensive.\n\nTHE PRIVACY DEBATE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_280\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_57\">86.

I\n\nhave purposely not gone into this aspect of the matter because anything said or\n\nurged in this behalf would affect any case being argued on “marital rape” even in\n\nrelation to “women over 18 years of age”.

Since this Court has not dealt with the wider issue of “marital rape”,\n\nException 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_545\">Section 375</a> IPC should be read down to bring it within the four\n\ncorners of law and make it consistent with the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_282\">88.
