Further prayer has been made to take\n     action against Opposite Party No.4 in making derogatory\n     remarks against the Petitioner which violates her right to\n     privacy and to live with dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">2.1 Contents of the writ petition reveals that both the Petitioner and\n     Opposite Party No.4 are reputed actors of Odia Film Industry\n     and Opposite Party No.4 is also a Member of Parliament from\n     Kendrapara Parliamentary Constituency. There is a marital\n     discord between them for which CP No.312 of 2020 and CP\n     No.246 of 2021 are pending before learned Judge, Family\n     Court, Cuttack. Further, a proceeding under the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_2\">Protection of\n     Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</a> in DV Case No.94\n     of 2020 is also pending before learned Sub-Divisional Judicial\n     Magistrate, Sadar Cuttack.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">2.2 Initially the Opposite Party No.4 filed HMA No.267 of 2020\n     praying, inter alia, for dissolution of their marriage by a decree\n     of divorce, which was subsequently transferred to the Family\n     Court, Cuttack as per the direction of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n     Court and registered as CP No.246 of 2021. Similarly, the\n     Petitioner has also filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 9</a> of the\n     Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for restoration of their conjugal life\n     in CP No.312 of 2020, which is also pending before the said\n     Family Court, Cuttack.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                           Page 2 of 23</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">                                      // 3 //\n\n\n\n\n2.3 It is alleged in the writ petition that soon after the aforesaid cases\n     were filed, the Opposite Party No.4 started giving statements in\n     print and electronic media about their personal life, which were\n     published in different newspapers and also telecast in print and\n     electronic media. Such publications and telecast seriously\n     infringe the private life of the Petitioner so also her right to live\n     with dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">2.4 In DV Case No.94 of 2020, learned SDJM was pleased to pass\n     an order restraining the Opposite Party No.4 from entering into\n     the room of the Petitioner where she was staying and also not to\n     interfere with her personal life. Looking at the situation two\n     women Police personnel were also deployed at the house where\n     the Petitioner was staying. Due to the alleged derogatory\n     remarks and release of videos, Petitioner&#x27;s dignity was lowered\n     in the society and she had to face a lot of queries from her fans\n     and friends. In the writ petition, the Petitioner also annexed the\n     videos played in You Tube channel in a pen drive, statements\n     made by Opposite Party No.4 in social media for his fans and\n     followers, and the complaint dated 22nd May, 2022 lodged\n     before You Tube Channel by the Petitioner, as Annexures-1 to\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">     4. Viewing the release of videos in You Tube Channel people\n     started giving their derogatory opinions. The said Videos and\n     statements in You Tube Channel became such that the\n     Petitioner was scared of going outside and continue her social\n     activities. The conduct of the Opposite Party No.4 is not only\n     violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution but also frustrate the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                              Page 3 of 23</span>\n                                      // 4 //\n\n\n\n\n     purpose of <a href=\"/doc/50217/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 22</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The act\n     and action of Opposite Party No.4 being intolerable, the\n     Petitioner reported the matter to the Inspector in-charge of\n     Purighat Police Station (Annexure-5) requesting him to enquire\n     into the matter and take appropriate action, but to no effect. As\n     such, the Petitioner finding no other alternative has filed this\n     Writ Petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">3.   A detailed counter affidavit has been filed by the Opposite\n     Party No.4 raising preliminary objection with regard to\n     maintainability of the writ petition. It is contented, inter alia,\n     that the writ petition involves serious disputed questions of fact.\n     The prayers made therein are also vague and omnibus and no\n     writ can be issued under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India\n     against an individual granting such prayers. As a counter-blast\n     to the petition filed by Opposite Party No.4 for dissolution of\n     marriage, the Petitioner filed DV Case No.94 of 2020 before\n     learned SDJM, Cuttack Sadar, lodged FIR in Purighat PS under\n     <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_8\">506</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">34</a> IPC. In order to gain sympathy, the\n     Petitioner also filed a petition for restoration of conjugal right.\n     It is also alleged, inter alia, that the Petitioner has left no stone\n     unturned to see that Opposite Party No.4 withdraws the petition\n     for dissolution of marriage. It is also stated in the counter\n     affidavit that learned SDJM, Sadar Cuttack in the aforesaid DV\n     Case, vide order dated 5th February, 2021 along with certain\n     directions to the Opposite Party No.4 also, directed the present\n     Petitioner not to prevent the Opposite Party No.4 accessing the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                              Page 4 of 23</span>\n                                // 5 //\n\n\n\n\nshare household including drawing room and kitchen situated\nin the first floor and not to lock the entrance of the said floor.\nThe Opposite Party No.4 had never broadcast his statement\nrelating to the case pending in the Family Court, Cuttack by\nmaking derogatory remarks against the Petitioner, as alleged.\nTo the contrary, Opposite Party No.4 had filed an interim\napplication in CP No.246 of 2021 praying, inter alia, to direct\nthe media not to telecast anything about the Family Court\nproceedings. Petitioner objected to the said petition by filing\nher objection before learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack\nstating that the media platform is an independent process of the\npresent society of developing countries and the mouth of the\nmedia should not be gagged by a judicial order. Learned Judge,\nFamily Court, Cuttack rejected the application filed by\nOpposite party No.4 vide order dated 15th July, 2021 observing\nthat the Press is the 4th pillar of democracy. Importance of the\nrole of media in our day-to-day life is pretty evidence. It was\nalso observed therein that the media must act as 3rd eye to keep\nthe citizens aware of what is happening around the world and\nthus the right of 4th pillar of democracy to print and publish,\ncannot be snatched away. In view of the stand of the Petitioner\nbefore the learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack she is estopped\nfrom making any claim before this Court more particularly as\nsought for in this writ petition. These facts were deliberately\nsuppressed by the Petitioner in the writ petition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1593707\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1272928\" id=\"span_6\">In the counter\naffidavit, Opposite Party No.4 also relied upon the observations\nof the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1272928/\" id=\"a_10\">Prestige Lights\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                      Page 5 of 23</span>\n                                     // 6 //\n\n\n\n\n     Ltd.

State of Uttar Pradesh and others</a>, reported in\n     (2008) 1 SCC 560 and contended that while claiming relief of\n     equity, the applicant must come to the Court with clean hands.\n     It is, therefore, contended that the Writ Petition suffers from\n     suppression of aforesaid material facts and thus is liable to be\n     dismissed.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">4.   So far as publication of video is concerned, it was contended\n     that Opposite Party No.4 had up-loaded some videos expressing\n     the gratitude to his fans for supporting him in his hard time on\n     his own personal and private You Tube channel. Sharing\n     someone&#x27;s own thought and freedom of speech expression is\n     very much protected and guaranteed under the Constitution and\n     the Opposite party No.4 has only exercised his right to speech\n     without defaming and demeaning anyone including the\n     Petitioner. The Opposite Party No.4 also alleged that\n     publication and telecast of news item regarding their marital\n     discord is without his knowledge. In order to save his image as\n     a law maker and to protect his reputation being tarnished on\n     daily basis in media, he released the video on 21st May, 2022\n     disclosing his case details and the cases filed by the Petitioner.\n     On the other hand, the Petitioner is playing a victim card by\n     filing the present petition only to draw attention of the media\n     and public. The Opposite Party No.4 also wrote to the Hon&#x27;ble\n     Speaker, Lok Sabha to refrain media from publishing news\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                           Page 6 of 23</span>\n                                           // 7 //\n\n\n\n\n     about their marital discord, which is sub judice before different\n     courts vide his letters dated 11th September, 2020 and 12th\n     February, 2022 (Annexures-D/4 and E/4) respectively. The\n     Opposite Party No.4 also denied all other allegations the writ\n     petition and prayed for dismissal of the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_9\">5.   Mrs. Jena, learned counsel buttressing the case of the\n     Petitioner, submitted that this Court has ample jurisdiction\n     under Article-226 of the Constitution to issue direction to print\n     and electronic media not to publish/broadcast/telecast any\n     derogatory news items concerning the marital discord between\n     the Petitioner and Opposite Party No.4. Narrating the facts in\n     detail, she further submitted that every citizen of the country, as\n     the Petitioner, has right to privacy. Every citizen has\n     fundamental right of expression, but said fundamental right\n     should not infringe the dignity and integrity of any other\n     person. Otherwise, it would amount to misuse of right of\n     expression. In support of her submission, she relied upon the\n     observation of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of\n     Justice K S Puttaswamy (retd.) and <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_12\">Anr.

In the said application, the Opposite Party No.4 had\n      made a prayer to prohibit the Petitioner from publishing\n      contents of petition, pleadings, provisions, documents and any\n      part thereof in the media platform. The Petitioner had filed her\n      objection to the said petition stating that the Opposite Party\n      No.4 himself initially published the information relating their\n      marital dispute in the electronic, print as well as social media.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">      It is from the said sources, the Petitioner could know filing of\n      a case for dissolution of their marriage by decree of divorce in\n      the Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Patiala House,\n      New Delhi. Thus, the Petitioner filed a transfer petition before\n      Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and pursuant to the direction of the\n      Hon&#x27;ble Court, the matter was transferred to the Court of\n      learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack and registered as CP\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                          Page 16 of 23</span>\n                               // 17 //\n\n\n\n\nNo.246 of 2021. It is further contended in her objection that\nsince the Opposite party No.4 initially made publication of\nmatters relating to their marital dispute in the print, electronic\nas well as social media, he would not be prejudiced if the\nPetitioner published information about their marital dispute as\nwell as day-to-day progress of the proceeding in the media.\nConsidering the rival contentions of the parties, learned Judge\nFamily Court observing that the Press being the fourth pillar\nof democracy important role of media in our day today life is\npretty evident. Thus, the right of the fourth pillar of\ndemocracy to publish and print cannot be snatched away when\nit has been disclosed before them by the parties or by their\nrespective learned counsel. It was further observed that at the\nsame time, such electronic, print and social media cannot be\npermitted to scan day-to-day proceedings of the Court so also\npronounce pre-trial judgment on the oral version of the parties\nso also their respective counsels, right of which is vested in\nCourt only. As such, the petition filed by the Opposite Party\nNo.4 was rejected vide order dated 15th July, 2021 (Annexure-\nC/4 to the Counter Affidavit filed by Opposite Party No.4).\nThe case record also reveals that the Petitioner has filed a case\nin ICC No.377 of 2022 before learned SDJM, Sadar, Cuttack\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1820068/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 501</a> IPC and 67 of <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_40\">Information and Technology\nAct</a>.

Thus, the\n      question that cropped up for consideration as to whether the\n      Petitioner has still any cause of action to seek for the aforesaid\n      relief in the present writ petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">9.3   No doubt, the Petitioner has not disclosed about filing of\n      similar nature of application by Opposite Party No.4 before\n      learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack and also filing of a\n      criminal proceeding, which is pending in the Court of learned\n      SDJM, Sadar Cuttack. It further appears that order dated 15th\n      July, 2021 passed by learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack in\n      CP No.246 of 2021 has not yet been varied or set aside by any\n      higher forum. In the above factual backdrop, it has to be\n      considered whether the Petitioner has still any cause of action\n      to agitate her grievance before this Court. On perusal of the\n      writ petition, it discloses that inaction on the FIR filed by the\n      Petitioner in Purighat PS at Cuttack and publication of\n      derogatory remarks on the character of the Petitioner as well\n      as her family members is the cause of action to file the writ\n      petition. No material has been produced before this Court to\n      arrive at a conclusion that filing of either the petition by\n      Opposite Party No.4 before learned Judge, Family Court or\n      filing of a criminal defamation case by the Petitioner, which is\n      pending before learned SDJM, Sadar Cuttack was filed on the\n      cause of action of the writ petition. On the other hand, it\n      appears that cause of action for filing of the petition either\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                           Page 18 of 23</span>\n                                     // 19 //\n\n\n\n\n      before learned Judge, Family Court or complaint before\n      learned SDJM, Sadar Cuttack are quite different than in the\n      present writ petition. Cause of action is a bundle of facts and\n      the Petitioner can bring a legal action on any one of such fact.\n      Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion that in view of\n      either suppression of material fact or filing of the petitions\n      before different Courts, as stated above, cannot be a ground to\n      throw away the present Writ Petition on the ground of lack of\n      cause of action. Thus, this Court holds that the Petitioner has\n      cause of action to file the present writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">10.   Maintainability of the writ petition:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      Maintainability of the writ petition is vital issue to be\n      considered in this writ petition. Broadly speaking case of the\n      Petitioner is that in the facts and circumstances of a particular\n      case, a writ of maintenance can be issued against a private\n      individual restraining him from doing any act which violates\n      his/her fundamental right. On the other hand, the stand of\n      Opposite Party No.4 is that a writ petition under Article-226 is\n      not maintainable against a private individual for issuance of a\n      prohibitory order in the matter of publication of contents\n      relating to matrimonial dispute between the parties in print,\n      electronic and social media. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63700409\" id=\"span_33\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/63700409/\" id=\"a_41\">Chandra Bhan\n      Dubey</a> (supra), it is held that the expensive and extraordinary\n      power of High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 226</a> is as wide as the\n      amplitude of the language used indicates and so can affect any\n      person, even a private individual and be available for any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                           Page 19 of 23</span>\n                               // 20 //\n\n\n\n\n(other) purpose, even one for which another remedy may\nexist. It is also held therein that &quot;But it is one thing to affirm\nthe jurisdiction, another authorizes its free exercise like a bull\nin a china shop. This Court has spelt out wise and clear\nrestraints on the use of this extra-ordinary remedy and the\nHigh Courts will not go beyond the monstrosity of the\nsituation or other exceptional circumstances cry for timely\njudicial interdict or mandate. The mentor of law is justice and\na potent drug should be judiciously administered speaking in\ncritical retrospect and portentous prospect, the writ power\nhas, by and large, being the people&#x27;s sentinel on the qui vive\nand to cut back on or liquidate that power may cast a peril to\nhuman rights.&quot;</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1272928\" id=\"span_35\">Further, in Zee Tele films <a href=\"/doc/1272928/\" id=\"a_43\">Ltd.</a> (supra), it is\nheld that any violation of a fundamental right will have the\nclaim against the State and unlike the rights under Articles-17\nand 21, which can be claimed against a non-state actors\nincluding individuals, the right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> cannot\nbe claimed against an individual or a non state entity.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86964673\" id=\"span_36\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/86964673/\" id=\"a_45\">Sahara India Real Estate Corp.

From the above it transpires that the writ\ncourt under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is not denuded of\nthe power to entertain a writ petition where there is violation\nof <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_48\">Articles 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">21</a> of the Constitution. But that should be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                     Page 20 of 23</span>\n                                     // 21 //\n\n\n\n\n     exercised in an          exceptional case and that too with\n     circumspection. For that the aggrieved person (the writ\n     Petitioner) must make out a strong case to satisfy the Court\n     that he/she has an indefeasible right to invoke writ jurisdiction\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against a non-state\n     entity, i.e., a private individual.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">10.1 In the instant case, perusal of the prayer made in the writ\n     petition makes it abundantly clear that the Petitioner has\n     sought for a direction to Opposite Party Nos.1 and 2 to\n     instruct the print, electronic and social media operators not to\n     publish any material with regard to matrimonial proceedings\n     pending in different Courts between the Petitioner and\n     Opposite Party No.4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">10.2 In course of hearing, this Court made a query to Mrs. Jena,\n     learned counsel for the Petitioner to satisfy the Court that if\n     the Opposite Party Nos.1 and 2 have any statutory/legal and\n     legal obligation to issue the instruction as prayed for. But it\n     could not be satisfactorily replied by learned counsel for the\n     Petitioner. Moreover, the learned counsel for the Petitioner\n     could not satisfy the Court as to whether Opposite Party No.2\n     as described in the writ petition, namely, Registrar of\n     Newspapers      of    India,   Ministry   of   Information   and\n     Broadcasting is really existing or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">10.3 Ms. Luthra, learned Senior Advocate relying upon the\n     aforesaid case laws as detailed herein above stating that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                         Page 21 of 23</span>\n                                     // 22 //\n\n\n\n\n      prayer sought for in the writ petition cannot be granted in\n      exercise of power granted under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 226</a> of the\n      Constitution. The case law cited by Ms. Luthra, learned Senior\n      Advocate has also bearing in adjudication of the case. The\n      general principle that a writ petition is not maintainable against\n      a private individual cannot be brushed aside completely. As\n      discussed above, the Petitioner has to make out a strong case\n      for issuance of a direction as sought for. No case is made out\n      by the Petitioner in this writ petition to call for an immediate\n      intervention of this Court. No material is placed before this\n      Court to infer that the Petitioner had no efficacious remedy for\n      redressal of her grievance. No doubt, a writ petition is\n      maintainable even if an alternative remedy is available. But\n      when the alternative remedy is equally efficacious the writ\n      Court should be slow to intervene in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">10.4 In addition to the above, the allegations and counter\n      allegations require factual adjudication by receiving evidence\n      from the parties. A competent Civil Court has jurisdiction to\n      delve and adjudicate the issue involved in the instant writ\n      petition. It has also the power to grant any interim relief as\n      sought for in the present writ petition. Thus, in my considered\n      opinion the writ petition, in the facts and circumstances of the\n      case, is not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">11.   What relief the Petitioner is entitled to:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      In the facts and circumstances of the case, when this Court is\n      of the considered opinion that the writ petition as laid down is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                           Page 22 of 23</span>\n                                                       // 23 //\n\n\n\n\n                         not maintainable, the Petitioner is not entitled to any relief as\n                         prayed for. But the same does not take away her right to work\n                         out her remedy before a common law forum in accordance\n                         with law.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">                12.      While parting with the case, this Court feels and expects that\n                         both Petitioner and Opposite Party No.4 should maintain self-\n                         restraint and mutual respect in asserting their legal and\n                         constitutional right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">                12.1.
