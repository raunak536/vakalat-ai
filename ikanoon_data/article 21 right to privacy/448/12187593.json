As regards the tender for the buses, the whole exercise was on\n                          account of the Supreme Court directing the Govt. of NCT of Delhi to\n                          convert the entire fleet of buses in Delhi from diesel to CNG propelled\n                          buses, to meet emission standards, as applicable under the Central Motor\n                          Vehicles Rules, 1989, and the further directions of the Supreme Court for\n                          induction of low floor buses fully disabled friendly, including wheel chair\n                          bound passengers/commuters. Thus, the buses required by the Govt. of\n                          NCT of Delhi had to be manufactured against these specific\n                          requirements.

There was also need for annual maintenance and supply of\n                          genuine parts for the entire life-cycle of the vehicle i.e., 12 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                          8.    Thus, it was that the DTC invited a tender for the purchase of 1000\n                          low floor buses as well as for their maintenance. The pre-bid conference\n                          was held on 26th August, 2020. The period of contract for the said 1000\n                          buses were upto 7,50,000 KMs over a tentative period of 12 years. The\n                          techno-commercial bid was opened on 1 st October, 2020 and the tender\n                          for the supply of buses as well as for their life-time maintenance was\n                          awarded on 29th January, 2021/1st February, 2021. LoA (Letter of\n                          Acceptance) dated 29th January, 2021/1st February, 2021 for CAMC upto\n                          7,50,000 KMs over a tentative period of 12 years for 700 fully built AC\n                          CNG Buses, was issued in favour of M/s JBM Auto Ltd. as its referred\n                          proposal was lowest (L-1) out of the qualified proposals.

The total cost of the tender for acquiring the said 1000\n                          buses was Rs.875 crores and for the CAMC, it was Rs.3412 crores for the\n                          entire period of 12 years/7,50,000 KMs. According to the learned senior\n                          counsel, the entire transaction was above board and transparent.

Taking these points, the learned counsel for the defendant has\n                          submitted that admittedly, the plaintiff was a politician and therefore, was\n                          a public person. The first tweet had been made on 8 th March, 2021, just\n                          before the Assembly was convened, when no Minutes of the meetings of\n                          the DTC in connection to the purchase of 1000 buses had been uploaded.\n                          No relief in respect of the 8th March, 2021 or 10th March, 2021 tweet has\n                          been sought, though these have been referred to in the plaint. Therefore,\n                          no relief qua these tweets could be granted. In respect of several tweets\n                          included in the prayer no relief could be granted as these are not referred\n                          to in the plaint. Merely annexing two Schedules to the plaint, listing out\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                       Page 20 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">20:34:14</span>\n                           the tweets and the Facebook posts, would not suffice to explain what was\n                          defamatory in them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">                          23.   According to the learned counsel for defendant No.1, the tweet of\n                          15th June, 2020 related to the office order dated 11 th June, 2021, whereby\n                          the Department/Govt. of NCT of Delhi had of their own sweet will put\n                          the entire process of procurement and CAMC in abeyance. But the\n                          plaintiff had deliberately suppressed this fact and the said order had been\n                          filed by the defendant No.1 at page 59 of his documents. Nowhere has the\n                          plaintiff explained why the Government had taken such a decision,\n                          despite the claim of a favourable Committee Report, which had been\n                          released on 10th/11th July, 2021. There was nothing in the plaint to\n                          connect the voluntary placing of the orders in abeyance to the tweets of\n                          the defendant No.1 and therefore, it was only rhetorical to claim that the\n                          defendant No.1 had denied a sound transport system to the citizens of\n                          Delhi. The tweet was actually only stating a truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">                          24.   It was submitted that the defendant No.1 was only discharging his\n                          public duties by drawing attention to irregularities in the procurement\n                          process of buses and it was an apparent political strategy to shift the\n                          blame on the opposition, as if they were blocking the procurement\n                          process, whereas, the truth was that the plaintiff and the Government\n                          were themselves not interested in creating a good transport system in\n                          Delhi. By reproducing all these orders and other details, including press\n                          report in the tweets by the defendant No.1, he had acted in public interest\n                          and not against it as alleged by the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                     Page 21 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">20:34:14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">                           25.   Learned counsel submitted that while accusations had been leveled\n                          against defendant No.1, for &quot;obtaining&quot; the Committee Report, but on 6th\n                          July, 2021, after the report had been published and, as claimed by the\n                          plaintiff was widely circulated in newspapers and in the electronic media,\n                          in the morning of 10 th July, 2021, the plaintiff alongwith the Deputy Chief\n                          Minister of Delhi, had held a press conference announcing that the\n                          Committee had gone through 3000 pages of documentation and had\n                          found no corruption. Both these statements cannot stand together, for if\n                          the report was available with the Media, there was nothing under hand if\n                          the defendant No.1 had come across it. However, the Committee had\n                          itself clarified that it was only focusing on the process qua the CAMC\n                          and not the procurement of the buses and therefore, to claim that there\n                          was no adverse finding against the Government by the Committee was\n                          incorrect. The defendant No.1 had only stated as much in his tweets\n                          which was the truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">                          26.   Moreover, the question that the defendant No.1 had raised,\n                          including in the Assembly, was as to how the weighted value of Rs.45.5\n                          per KM had been arrived at. Learned counsel submitted that there was a\n                          method of arriving at a weighted value which was given under the GFR,\n                          but that was not followed. The Committee had faulted the procedure\n                          adopted by the DTC, as the weighted value was usually low in the initial\n                          years, increasing towards the end of the life of the bus, whereas, by\n                          having a flat rate of Rs.45.5 per KM for the entire 12 years period, the\n                          difference in payment annually was huge, entailing an overpayment of\n                          Rs.17/- per KM per year per bus. That was why the defendant No.1 said\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                      Page 22 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">20:34:14</span>\n                           that there was a &#x27;stench&#x27; of corruption in the deal, and he was justified in\n                          saying so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">                          27.   The Committee found the fixing of the weighted value without\n                          basis and against the Rules and asked the Government to cancel the\n                          contract for CAMC. When the Committee had found fault with the\n                          CAMC and had asked that it be ended, it was not possible for the plaintiff\n                          to claim that they had got a clean chit. In any case, the Central Bureau of\n                          Investigation (&#x27;CBI&#x27;) had also commenced a preliminary inquiry. It was\n                          not possible for the plaintiff to have not seen the report to have known\n                          that the claims made in the press conference were not true. It was\n                          submitted that it was only after the Central Government asked the CBI to\n                          hold a preliminary inquiry, that this defamation suit has been filed. Thus,\n                          all statements made in the tweets were justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">                          28.   It was further submitted that the tweets came on the heels of the\n                          earlier problematic procurement process of the DTC, which was why the\n                          procurement in the previous years were called off. Being a vigilant public\n                          figure, the defendant No.1 was only keeping a tab on what was happening\n                          with the DTC procurement process this time and found it opaque, as\n                          initially even the Minutes were not uploaded and thereafter despite\n                          queries, a logical explanation for a flat rate weighted value was not given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">                          29.   By merely stating suspicions, there could be no defamation caused.\n                          Learned counsel for the defendant No.1 further submitted that on the\n                          basis of all the documents placed on record, both by the plaintiff as well\n                          as the defendant No.1, he would be able to justify every tweet that he had\n                          made. According to the learned counsel, there was enough material which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                       Page 23 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">20:34:14</span>\n                           raised suspicion on the conduct of the meetings, the decisions taken in\n                          those meetings, the resolutions passed and the ultimate grant of the tender\n                          to M/s Tata Motors and M/s JBM Auto Ltd.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">                          30.   The learned counsel submitted that on the other hand, on the\n                          material filed on record, the plaintiff has not been able to show how the\n                          tweets of defendant No.1 contained false facts since the entire process\n                          was over-shadowed with unexplained decisions and improper procedure.\n                          Nor have facts reflecting defamation been pleaded and established.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">                          31.   It was submitted that this was not a commercial suit and therefore,\n                          the index as filed qua admission and denial may be ignored. The written\n                          statement was filed within time and an irregularity in verification was\n                          curable. Hence, the application I.A.12535/2021 seeking permission to\n                          amend the written statement along with the affidavit be allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">                          32.   Since the plaintiff filed the statement of the witness recorded\n                          before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate in connection with the filing\n                          of the Committee Report with the Chief Secretary on 5 th October, 2021,\n                          the learned counsel submitted that the original report was already with the\n                          Government much prior to the filing of the suit and it was next to\n                          impossible that the plaintiff was unaware of its contents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">                          33.

Further, the arguments raised on behalf of the\n                          defendant No.1 were to be considered at the final disposal of the suit,\n                          whereas the plaintiff was required only to show &quot;an arguable case&quot;,\n                          which he has.

I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the plaintiff\n                          and defendant No.1 at great length and have considered the documents on\n                          record, as also the cited judgments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">                          38.   Before proceeding further, the objections taken by the learned\n                          senior counsel for the plaintiff in respect of the written statement may be\n                          considered. The objection taken is to the verification clause, which does\n                          not confirm to the Delhi High Court Rules. The defendant No.1 has filed\n                          I.A. 12535/2021 under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_41\">Order VI Rule 17 CPC</a>, seeking an opportunity to\n                          amend the verification. A reply has also been filed thereto by the plaintiff\n                          submitting that an improper verification has been filed intentionally by\n                          the defendant No.1 in order to escape the rigours of <a href=\"/doc/908644/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 340</a> Cr.P.C.,\n                          as the written statement contains only falsehood. Further, it was\n                          submitted that the defect in the verification was fatal and the amendment\n                          could not be allowed. It was also submitted that the written statement was\n                          directed to be filed within a week from the date of the order of the\n                          Division Bench of this Court i.e., 6th September, 2021 and since the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                      Page 27 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">20:34:14</span>\n                           written statement was filed only on 12 th September, 2021, it could not be\n                          taken on record and there could be no question of amendment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                          39.   Though parties are entitled to raise objections based on procedure,\n                          it cannot be overlooked that procedure is meant to advance substantive\n                          justice and is rarely used to unsuit any person, unless the timeline was\n                          strictly provided for by the statute. This is an ordinary civil suit. The\n                          Division Bench of this Court had granted a week&#x27;s time to file the written\n                          statement w.e.f. 6th September, 2021 i.e. by 13 th September, 2021. The\n                          written statement was filed on 12 th September, 2021. The reply to the I.A.\n                          10839/2021 was filed on 13 th September, 2021. Thus, evidently, the\n                          defendant No.1 has complied with the orders of the Division Bench of\n                          this Court. The reason why the learned senior counsel submitted that the\n                          order has not been complied with, is on account of the improper\n                          verification of the written statement. However, the courts have repeatedly\n                          taken the view that the defect in verification is a curable defect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                          40.   Reference may be made to the decision of a Division Bench of this\n                          Court in Suman Jain &amp; ors. Vs. Jaimala Jain &amp; ors. 2007 SCC Online\n                          Del 615, and several decisions of Coordinate Benches of this Court,\n                          including in Sudesh Garg Vs. Dipender Kumar, 2011 SCC Online Del\n                          5181. In these cases too, specific objections to the filing of the written\n                          statement with improper or defective verification were raised and the\n                          view taken was that procedural defects and irregularities which are\n                          curable should not be allowed to defeat substantive rights or to cause\n                          injustice. Defects with regard to signature, verification or presentation,\n                          may be permitted to be cured. When the attention of the court is drawn to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                           Page 28 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">20:34:14</span>\n                           a defect in verification of the written statement, the defendant should be\n                          given an opportunity to cure the same. There is no requirement for an\n                          application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_43\">Order VI Rule 17 CPC</a>. The opportunity is to be given\n                          irrespective of such an application. I.A. 12535/2021 is therefore, quite\n                          unnecessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">                          41.   The learned senior counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out to\n                          errors, even in this &quot;amended&quot; verification. Be that as it may, the\n                          application is disposed of by granting a final opportunity to the defendant\n                          No.1 to file the correct verification. The written statement having been\n                          filed with a curable defect, there is no occasion to reject it, as all that is\n                          required is a direction to the defendant No.1 to cure this defect. The\n                          objection raised is thus, without force. There is also no merit in the\n                          argument urged that deeming there is no written statement on the record,\n                          the suit be decreed qua defendant No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">                          42.   Turning to the interim application being I.A. 10839/2021, it may be\n                          noticed that there is an incongruity in the prayers made in the application\n                          and the averments in the pleadings.

It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to\n                                safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage,\n                                procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education\n                                among other matters. None can publish anything\n                                concerning the above matters without his consent --\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">                                whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or\n                                critical.

Position may, however, be different, if\n                                a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or\n                                voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                                (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n                                publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\n                                unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n                                records including court records. This is for the reason that\n                                once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right\n                                to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate\n                                subject for comment by press and media among others.

This is so even where the publication is based upon\n                           facts and statements which are not true, unless the official\n                           establishes that the publication was made (by the\n                           defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a\n                           case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the\n                           press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\n                           verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove\n                           that what he has written is true. Of course, where the\n                           publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n                           personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence\n                           and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that\n                           in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the\n                           public official enjoys the same protection as any other\n                           citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above.

The remedy for the person, who fears that he would\n                          be defamed would arise only after the publication and would be governed\n                          by the principles as enunciated by the Supreme Court. On a probability\n                          that a publication could defame a person, there is no right to seek a prior\n                          restraint.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_158\">46.

There is a right vested in the Opposition to question the\n                          government on its actions, as the Executive is subject to the Legislature\n                          under the Constitution.

There is no dispute that a preliminary inquiry has in\n                                fact been directed. The 2nd tweet of 19th August, 2021 informs that\n                                the CBI inquiry has commenced on allegations of corruption in\n                                regard to which an attempt had been made to bury it, are also\n                                recorded in the said tweet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">                                (xv) The tweet at page 63 of the plaint demands the removal of\n                                those, who were in charge and so behind the conspiracy to settle\n                                and execute a corrupt deal, to ensure a fair inquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">                                (xvi) At page 64 of the plaint is a re-tweet by the defendant No.1\n                                of an Interview he has given to &#x27;AajTak&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">                          56.   The tone and tenor of these tweets would show that the defendant\n                          No.1 being a &#x27;public figure&#x27; was relentlessly pursuing the Government in\n                          respect of the purchase of and grant of an AMC for 1000 buses, in which\n                          the Committee had also found irregularities and had recommended its\n                          cancellation. The tweets are also contemporaneous to the convening of\n                          the Delhi Assembly and also to the appointment of a Committee by the\n                          Hon&#x27;ble Lieutenant Governor to make inquiry into the alleged corrupt\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">Signature Not VerifiedCS(OS) 403/2021                                                     Page 40 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">Signed By:MANJEET KAUR</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">Signing Date:07.03.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">20:34:14</span>\n                           practices, based on a complaint received by him. Thus, it is difficult to\n                          accept that these tweets were personally targeted against the plaintiff\n                          alone and were per se defamatory and were totally false on the face of it.\n                          Had these accusations been absolutely false, the Hon&#x27;ble Lieutenant\n                          Governor would not have constituted a Committee. Moreover, the CBI\n                          has also initiated a preliminary inquiry. The Delhi Government, through\n                          the plaintiff, has kept the purchase and maintenance orders on hold,\n                          stating no reason. Hence, it is reasonable to infer that the Committee\n                          report and the CBI inquiry may have had some effect on this decision of\n                          the Government. It would, no doubt be upon the defendant No.1 to\n                          actually prove justification during trial. But on the material placed on the\n                          record, there is nothing on which basis the tweets can be treated as blatant\n                          lies and hence defamatory.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176929306\" id=\"span_195\">57.
