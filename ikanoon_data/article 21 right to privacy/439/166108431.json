Shorn of unnecessary details, facts in brief germane are as\n\nfollows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      It is the case of the prosecution that one Smt. W.Gladys\n\nJayanthi, Deputy Superintendent, CBI, ACB, Bengaluru directs the\n\npetitioner to implement cancellation of licence of one LPG storage\n\nunit located in Ramanagara District. This happens in the month of\n\nJuly 2019. On 08-07-2019 and 23-07-2019 the petitioner in turn\n\ncommunicates to the Head of the CBI reporting that Smt. Gladys\n\nJayanthi has demanded illegal cancellation of the licence of the LPG\n\nstorage unit. After the said complaint to the higher up, the\n\npetitioner visits Smt. Gladys Jayanthi with concerned documents\n\nexplaining as to why he could not execute the instructions of\n\ncancellation of licence as mentioned supra. Smt. Gladys Jayanthi\n\ndirects inspection of M/s Sanghvi Cylinders Private Limited along\n\nwith two others.   The others are accused No.2 and accused no.3.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">The inspection is conducted on 18-09-2019 and 19-09-2019.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 4</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">      3. During the pendency of further orders with regard to\n\ninvestigation, orders were passed by the Secretary, Ministry of\n\nHome Affairs to intercept mobile phone of the petitioner. These\n\norders were also on 2 days i.e., on 22-08-2019 and 18-09-2019. It\n\nis alleged that on 20-09-2019 one M. Santha Kumar is said to have\n\ncalled the petitioner and the petitioner then demanded `50,000/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">and the same was agreed to be paid by M. Santha Kumar on\n\nvisiting his office on 23-09-2019. Just the previous day i.e., on 22-\n\n09-2019 a crime comes to be registered against the petitioner and\n\ntwo others by the CBI for offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_9\">8</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1324019/\" id=\"a_10\">9</a> of the Act.      On the next day i.e., on 23-09-2019 the\n\npetitioner is said to have accepted illegal gratification of `50,000/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">from one Rishab Bipin Desai who is arrayed as accused No.3. The\n\nhouse of the petitioner was searched and no other item except `\n\n50,000/- was recovered from his house and mahazar was drawn.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">The CBI, after investigation, file a charge sheet against the\n\npetitioner and four others for offences as afore-quoted adding the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_12\">8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1324019/\" id=\"a_13\">9</a> of the Act. On 29-12-2020, the\n\nconcerned Court takes cognizance of the aforesaid offences against\n\nthe petitioner and others. The petitioner is knocking at the doors of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   5</span>\n\n\n\nthis Court, calling in question the filing of the charge sheet against\n\nhim in the subject petition.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">      4. Heard Sri Sandesh J.Chouta, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner and Sri P. Prasanna Kumar, learned\n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      5. The learned senior counsel representing the petitioner\n\nSri Sandesh J.Chouta would vehemently contend that the petitioner\n\nrefused to succumb to the pressure and harassment of Smt. Gladys\n\nJayanthi and, therefore, it is an act of taking vengeance upon the\n\npetitioner for not having obeyed the direction to cancel the licence\n\nof Gas Cylinder storage unit these events have taken place. The\n\nlearned senior counsel would submit that the telephone of the\n\npetitioner   could   not   have   been intercepted   contrary   to the\n\nprovisions of the Indian Telegraph Act and the Rules and the\n\nInformation Technology Act and the Rules. It is his submission that\n\na telephone can be intercepted only on grounds where there was\n\npublic emergency, public safety element involved and any other\n\ncondition of public interest.     It is the submission of the learned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 6</span>\n\n\n\nsenior counsel that interception orders passed by the Ministry of\n\nHome Affairs are illegal and were not placed before the Review\n\nCommittee, as is necessary in law within seven days from the date\n\nof inception order.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">      6. The other submission is that there is no approval granted\n\nfor registration of an FIR as obtaining under <a href=\"/doc/155945925/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 17A</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">It is his further submission that, prima facie, ingredients necessary\n\nfor invocation of <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 7</a> of the Act is conspicuously missing in the\n\ncase at hand, as the alleged illegal gratification as found in the\n\ncharge sheet is said to have been demanded for an undue\n\nadvantage to the tune of `50,000/- from accused No.2 and there is\n\nno other material produced to demonstrate, even in the charge\n\nsheet, that the petitioner had demanded money for some undue\n\nadvantage from accused No.2.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">      7.   Per-contra,   the   learned   Special   Public   Prosecutor\n\nSri P.Prasanna Kumar representing the CBI would contend that the\n\npetitioner except making allegations against Smt. Gladys Jayanthi\n\nhas not placed any material to show that there was forceful illegal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                               7</span>\n\n\n\ndemand to close or cancel the licence of the LPG storage unit. He\n\nwould submit that <a href=\"/doc/155945925/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 17A</a> of the Act would not come into play\n\nin the case at hand, as it would be necessary only when a public\n\nservant takes a decision or makes any recommendation in the\n\ndischarge of his official duty. It is only then, <a href=\"/doc/155945925/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 17A</a> would\n\nbecome necessary. It is the submission of the learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent that the petitioner was found in possession of\n\nRs.50,000/-, which accused No.3 admits to have paid and the\n\nidentification of such payment is based upon the same envelope\n\nfound in the cupboard of the petitioner, at the time of search\n\nconducted.   The learned counsel would further vehemently refute\n\nthe submission that there is no case made out against the\n\npetitioner of demand and acceptance. The telephonic conversations\n\nwhich were intercepted are clearly indicative of the fact that the\n\npetitioner had demanded money which was agreed to be paid by\n\naccused No.2 and executed through the accused No.3.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">     8. Insofar as the matter being placed before the Review\n\nCommittee, the respondent has sought time to place entire\n\nproceedings, but only a letter written by the Department of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 8</span>\n\n\n\nTelecommunications dated 21-07-2023 is placed on record, holding\n\nthat the records of the Review Committee are confidential and thus,\n\nit would not be in public interest to disclose such documents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">Insofar as the statement of prima facie ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 7</a> of\n\nthe Act being absent, the respondent again reiterates that the\n\npetitioner though not a final authority for granting any approval or\n\ncancellation, the fact that the file was processed by the petitioner\n\nwould clearly indicate that he has demanded and accepted illegal\n\ngratification. On these grounds, he seeks dismissal of the petition.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      9. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions\n\nmade by the respective learned counsel and have perused the\n\nmaterial on record.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">THE GENESIS:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">      10. The petition narrates events that happened during the\n\nmonth of June and July 2019, to be the foundation for the\n\nimpugned proceedings.       It is the case of the petitioner that\n\neverything is done at the instance of one Smt.W.Gladys Jayanthi,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                9</span>\n\n\n\nthe Deputy Superintendent of Police, CBI of the Anti-corruption\n\nBureau. It is the case of the petitioner that she had been insisting\n\nupon forceful cancellation of licence of a unit held by one\n\nH.T.Rajesh.   The petitioner did not accede to the instructions of\n\nSmt.W.Gladys Jayanthi.    The backdrop is narrated on the events\n\nthat have happened in the aforesaid two months.          A detailed\n\nnarration is not necessary for resolution of the issue in the lis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">The CBI draws up a source report on 22-09-2019 and that forms to\n\nbe the foundation against the petitioner and two others. The other\n\ntwo are one M.Santha Kumar, Accused No.2 and one Rishab Bipin\n\nDesai, Accused No.3 both employees of M/s Sanghvi Cylinders\n\nPrivate Limited. It is the case of the respondent that while the\n\npetitioner was working as Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives,\n\nPetroleum and Explosives Safety Organization had demanded\n\n`50,000/- from Sri M.Santha Kumar, accused No.2 who was the\n\nQuality Assurance Manager of the Unit, for the purpose of issuance\n\nof favourable inspection report, for which Sri M.Santa Kumar is\n\nalleged to have agreed that the amount would be handed over to\n\nthe petitioner on 22-09-2019 at the petitioner&#x27;s office through\n\naccused No.3 - Sri. Rishab Bipin Desai.      The CBI, based upon\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                        10</span>\n\n\n\ncertain investigation, alleges that the petitioner accepted illegal\n\ngratification from accused No.3. The call interceptions are the\n\nfoundational basis for registration of the crime. There is no other\n\nsource that is drawn for drawing the source report or initiating\n\nfurther proceedings.        It is an admitted fact that on 20-09-2019 at\n\nabout 13.04.25 p.m. the accused No.2 had called from his mobile to\n\nthe   mobile     number     of   the    petitioner   and   during   the     said\n\nconversation, the petitioner is said to have demanded illegal\n\ngratification of Rs.50,000/- and the accused No.2 agreed to give\n\nthe same. In the light of this being the genesis of the issue and the\n\ngenesis being interception of the mobile phone of the petitioner and\n\nthe other accused, it becomes necessary to go to the root of the\n\nmatter, i.e., the legality of such interception of the telephone\n\nconversation or what is globally known as &quot;wiretapping&quot;, or\n\n&quot;telephone tapping&quot;.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">STATUTORY FRAME WORK:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">      11.

The right to privacy -- by itself -- has not been\n        identified under the Constitution. As a concept it may be\n        too broad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether\n        right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a\n        given case would depend on the facts of the said case.\n        But the right to hold a telephone conversation in the\n        privacy of one&#x27;s home or office without interference can\n        certainly be claimed as &quot;right to privacy&quot;. Conversations\n        on the telephone are often of an intimate and confidential\n        character. Telephone conversation is a part of modern\n        man&#x27;s life. It is considered so important that more and\n        more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments\n        in their pockets. Telephone conversation is an important\n        facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would\n        certainly include telephone conversation in the privacy of\n        one&#x27;s home or office.

Learned counsel assisting us in this case have not\nseriously challenged the constitutional vires of <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 5(2)</a> of\nthe Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_21\">In this respect it would be useful to refer to the\nobservations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_33\">Hukam Chand Shyam Lal v. Union\nof India</a> [(1976) 2 SCC 128] : (SCC pp. 131-32, para 13)\n\n              &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 5(1)</a> if properly construed, does not confer\n      unguided     and    unbridled    power     on    the   Central\n      Government/State Government/specially authorised officer\n      to take possession of any telegraph. Firstly, the occurrence\n      of a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; is the sine qua non for the exercise\n      of power under this section. As a preliminary step to the\n      exercise of further jurisdiction under this section the\n      Government or the authority concerned must record its\n      satisfaction as to the existence of such an emergency.\n      Further, the existence of the emergency which is a\n      prerequisite for the exercise of power under this section,\n      must be a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; and not any other kind of\n      emergency. The expression &#x27;public emergency&#x27; has not been\n      defined in the statute, but contours broadly delineating its\n      scope and features are discernible from the section which\n      has to be read as a whole. In sub-section (1) the phrase\n      &#x27;occurrence of any public emergency&#x27; is connected with and\n      is immediately followed by the phrase &#x27;or in the interests of\n      the public safety&#x27;. These two phrases appear to take colour\n      from each other. In the first part of sub-section (2) those\n      two phrases again occur in association with each other, and\n      the context further clarifies with amplification that a public\n      &#x27;emergency&#x27; within the contemplation of this section is one\n      which raises problems concerning the interest of the public\n      safety, the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of\n      the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public\n      order or the prevention of incitement to the commission of\n      an offence. It is in the context of these matters that the\n      appropriate authority has to form an opinion with regard to\n      the occurrence of a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; with a view to taking\n      further action under this section. Economic emergency is\n      not one of those matters expressly mentioned in the\n      statute. Mere &#x27;economic emergency&#x27; -- as the High Court\n      calls it -- may not necessarily amount to a &#x27;public\n      emergency&#x27; and justify action under this section unless it\n      raises problems relating to the matters indicated in the\n      section.&quot;</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                            21</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">As mentioned above, the primary contention raised by the\nlearned counsel is to lay down necessary safeguards to rule out\nthe arbitrary exercise of power under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">       28. <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act permits the interception\nof messages in accordance with the provisions of the said\nsection. &quot;Occurrence of any public emergency&quot; or &quot;in the\ninterest of public safety&quot; are the sine qua non for the\napplication of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act.\nUnless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of\npublic safety demands, the authorities have no\njurisdiction to exercise the powers under the said section.\nPublic emergency would mean the prevailing of a sudden\ncondition or state of affairs affecting the people at large\ncalling for immediate action. The expression &quot;public\nsafety&quot; means the state or condition of freedom from\ndanger or risk for the people at large. When either of\nthese two conditions are not in existence, the Central\nGovernment or a State Government or the authorised\nofficer cannot resort to telephone-tapping even though\nthere is satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient so to\ndo in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India\netc. In other words, even if the Central Government is\nsatisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do in the\ninterest of the sovereignty and integrity of India or the\nsecurity of the State or friendly relations with sovereign\nStates or public order or for preventing incitement to the\ncommission of an offence, it cannot intercept the\nmessages or resort to telephone-tapping unless a public\nemergency has occurred or the interest of public safety or\nthe existence of the interest of public safety requires.\nNeither the occurrence of public emergency nor the\ninterest of public safety are secretive conditions or\nsituations. Either of the situations would be apparent to a\nreasonable person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">      29. The first step under <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act,\ntherefore, is the occurrence of any public emergency or\nthe existence of a public safety interest. Thereafter the\ncompetent authority under <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act is\nempowered to pass an order of interception after\nrecording its satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient\nso to do in the interest of (i) sovereignty and integrity of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                              22</span>\n\n\n\nIndia, (ii) the security of the State, (iii) friendly relations\nwith foreign States, (iv) public order or (v) for preventing\nincitement to the commission of an offence. When any of\nthe five situations mentioned above to the satisfaction of\nthe competent authority require then the said authority\nmay pass the order for interception of messages by\nrecording reasons in writing for doing so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">      ...                ...                   ..\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">      35.

The entire controversy has arisen out of an\nalleged bribery made for allowing the admissions into the\n4th Batch of MBBS of the GSMCH, Patiala by bypassing the\nalleged deficiencies in the process. The Petitioner is\naccused of having acted as a middleman in the alleged\nbribery. However, no direct or indirect evidence\nimplicating the petitioner is available on record that can\nbe legally relied on to proceed with the matter. The\nevidence collected and produced by the investigation\nagency before the Court below is fraught with illegalities\nand no sufficient cause is made to proceed with the\ncase qua the petitioner for the reasons as detailed\nhereunder:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">i) The main basis of the matter for which the bribe was\nallegedly given i.e., the auditorium was not actually\nrequired to be constructed as a condition precedent for\nconducting admissions of the 4th batch of MBBS course.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">The factum has been verified by the appropriate\nauthorities at various stages as stated above, hence there\nis no rationale of committing the alleged offence of giving\nof bribe.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">ii) Further, the Approver on the basis of whose statement\npetitioner has been made an accused, was impleaded in\nthe case without sanction from the appropriate\nauthorities and his statement is thus inadmissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">iii) Nothing as alleged in the recorded conversation\nintercepted by the investigating agency forms direct\nbasis or has any connection whatsoever with the need for\nbribery, nor is there any rationale for offering of the\nalleged bribe. The recovery made has also been explained\nand accounted for by the Petitioner with evidence as\nbeing a part of the advance received by the Petitioner in\nlieu of sale of his village land.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                27</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">     iv) Tape records of the calls intercepted in the instant\n     case are not admissible since the due procedure for such\n     interception as mandated by the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_60\">Telegraph Act</a> and the\n     Rules framed thereunder has not been followed. Further,\n     even the same has not been verified in the FSL report. No\n     further witness/evidence to implicate the petitioner is on\n     record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">     v) Additionally, the public servant who is alleged to have\n     been involved in the said transaction has already been\n     discharged and cannot, therefore, be prosecuted under\n     the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_61\">PC Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">                                        (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThe High Court of Delhi holds that Rule 419A framed under the\n\nTelegraph Rules cannot be brushed aside.

The said fact itself shows that the impugned\n         order was passed mechanically without application of\n         mind to the facts and circumstances of the case on hand.\n         Hence, on the face of it, the impugned order is not in\n         compliance with the mandatory requirement of sub-\n         section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 5</a>. Not only the satisfaction of the\n         authority as to the occurrence of public emergency or the\n         existence of public safety interest is absent, but even the\n         satisfaction expressed with regard to the other situations\n         enumerated under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 5</a> of the Act\n         does not stand the legal scrutiny.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_37\">24.

On the other hand, the material furnished to this\nCourt &quot;in a sealed cover by the learned Counsel appearing for\nthe Government of India shows that the Review Committee\nconstituted under Rule 419-A (8) met on 6-12-2004 for the\npurpose of review of the orders authorizing interception/tapping\nof telephones under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 5 (2)</a> of the Act. In the Minutes\nBook of the meeting, it was recorded that the consolidated\nstatement of the orders authorizing interception passed by the\nHome Secretary since 23-6-2003 was placed before the\nCommittee and that the Committee had decided to hold another\nmeeting during which the following information was desired to\nbe placed before it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">        (i) Total number of telephone lines/E-Mail for which\nauthorizations were issued indicating separately -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">        (a) No. of lines for which sanction was issued for the first\ntime (90 days or less);\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">        (b) No. of lines for which extension (180 days or less)\nwas given;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">        (c) No. of lines for which sanction was issued resulting in\nmonitoring for more than 180 days indicating those where\nmonitoring may be beyond 200 days,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">        (ii) Total number of lines monitoring of which has proved\n&quot;fruitful, indicating the results broadly.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">      26. However, no other material has been, placed\nbefore this Court to show that the Review Committee has\nmet subsequently for the said purpose and that the\ninformation required by the Committee was made\navailable to the Committee.

The fact that the consequences of non-\ncompliance of the procedure prescribed under Rule 419-A\nare also provided under the same Rule further makes\nclear the intention of the Legislature to make the said\nprocedure mandatory.

The word &quot;emergency&quot; has various connotations.\nEveryday emergency, needs to be distinguished from the type of\nemergency wherein events which involve, or might involve,\nserious and sometimes widespread risk of injury or harm to\nmembers of the public or the destruction of, or serious damage\nto, property. <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 4</a> of the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights, notes that &#x27;[I]n time of public emergency which\nthreatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is\nofficially proclaimed...&#x27;. Comparable language has also been\nused in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 15</a> of the European Convention on Human Rights\nwhich says &quot;In time of war or other public emergency\nthreatening the life of the nation&quot;. We may only point out that\nthe &quot;public emergency&quot; is required to be of serious nature, and\nneeds to be determined on a case-to-case basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">      102. The second requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\nTelegraph Act is for the authority to be satisfied that it is\nnecessary or expedient to pass the orders in the interest\nof the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of\nthe State, friendly relations with foreign States or public\norder or for preventing incitement to the commission of\nan offence, and must record reasons thereupon. The\nterms &quot;necessity&quot; and &quot;expediency&quot; bring along the\nstages an emergency is going to pass through usually. A\npublic emergency usually would involve different stages\nand the authorities are required to have regard to the\nstage, before the power can be utilised under the\naforesaid Rules. The appropriate balancing of the factors\ndiffers, when considering the stages of emergency and\naccordingly, the authorities are required to triangulate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                 33</span>\n\n\n\n     the necessity of imposition of such restriction after\n     satisfying the proportionality requirement.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">                                         (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court holds that the word &#x27;emergency&#x27; found in sub-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 5</a> cannot be construed to be an everyday\n\nemergency. It needs to be distinguished from an emergency of\n\nserious nature which is likely to cause widespread risk or injury or\n\nharm to members of public. It is the afore-quoted, that is public\n\nemergency, is what is found in sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 5</a>. It is\n\nonly in those circumstances, wiretapping can be permitted under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_92\">Telegraph Act</a> or the Rules made thereunder, is what the Apex\n\nCourt and other Courts hold. In the teeth of the aforesaid mandate\n\nof the Statute i.e., the Act and the law <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_93\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court\n\nand the other High Courts, I deem it appropriate to notice the\n\nrequisition and permission granted to wiretap the conversation\n\nbetween the petitioner and the other accused.

In the present case, the complainant did not\nsupport the prosecution case insofar as demand by the\naccused is concerned. The prosecution has not\nexamined any other witness, present at the time when\nthe money was allegedly handed over to the accused\nby the complainant, to prove that the same was\npursuant to any demand made by the accused. When\nthe complainant himself had disowned what he had\nstated in the initial complaint (Ext. P-11) before LW 9,\nand there is no other evidence to prove that the\naccused had made any demand, the evidence of PW 1\nand the contents of Ext. P-11 cannot be relied upon to\ncome to the conclusion that the above material\nfurnishes proof of the demand allegedly made by the\naccused. We are, therefore, inclined to hold that the\nlearned trial court as well as the High Court was not\ncorrect in holding the demand alleged to be made by\nthe accused as proved. The only other material\navailable is the recovery of the tainted currency notes\nfrom the possession of the accused. In fact such\npossession is admitted by the accused himself. Mere\npossession and recovery of the currency notes from\nthe accused without proof of demand will not bring\nhome the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 7</a>. The above also will\nbe conclusive insofar as the offence under <a href=\"/doc/537666/\" id=\"a_148\">Sections\n13(1)(d)(i)</a> and (ii) is concerned as in the absence of\nany proof of demand for illegal gratification, the use of\ncorrupt or illegal means or abuse of position as a\npublic servant to obtain any valuable thing or\npecuniary advantage cannot be held to be established.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">        9. Insofar as the presumption permissible to be\ndrawn under <a href=\"/doc/400137/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 20</a> of the Act is concerned, such\npresumption can only be in respect of the offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 7</a> and not the offences under <a href=\"/doc/537666/\" id=\"a_151\">Sections\n13(1)(d)(i)</a> and (ii) of the Act. In any event, it is only\non proof of acceptance of illegal gratification that\npresumption can be drawn under <a href=\"/doc/400137/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 20</a> of the Act\nthat such gratification was received for doing or\nforbearing to do any official act. Proof of acceptance of\nillegal gratification can follow only if there is proof of\ndemand.

In view of the contradictions noticed by us\n         above in the depositions of key witnesses examined on behalf of\n         the prosecution, we are of the view that the demand for and\n         acceptance of bribe amount and cellphone by the appellant, is\n         not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Having regard to such\n         evidence on record the acquittal recorded by the trial court is a\n         &quot;possible view&quot; as such the judgment [<a href=\"/doc/120263382/\" id=\"a_154\">State of T.N. v. N.\n         Vijayakumar</a>, 2020 SCC OnLine Mad 7098] of the High Court is\n         fit to be set aside. Before recording conviction under the\n         provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_155\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, the courts have\n         to take utmost care in scanning the evidence. Once conviction is\n         recorded under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_156\">Prevention of Corruption\n         Act</a>, it casts a social stigma on the person in the society apart\n         from serious consequences on the service rendered. At the\n         same time it is also to be noted that whether the view taken by\n         the trial court is a possible view or not, there cannot be any\n         definite proposition and each case has to be judged on its own\n         merits, having regard to evidence on record.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">                                                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172622065\" id=\"span_74\">(Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThe Apex Court, later, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/172622065/\" id=\"a_157\">K.SHANTHAMMA v.

The appellant had issued a notice dated\n14-2-2000 to the said Society calling upon the said Society to\nproduce the record. Accordingly, the necessary books were\nproduced by the said Society. The case made out by PW 1 is\nthat when he repeatedly visited the office of the appellant in\nFebruary 2020, the demand of Rs 3000 by way of illegal\ngratification was made by the appellant for passing the\nassessment order. However, PW 1, in his cross-examination,\naccepted that the notice dated 26-2-2000 issued by the\nappellant was received by the said Society on 15-3-2000 in\nwhich it was mentioned that after verification of the books of\naccounts of the said Society, exemption from payment of\ncommercial tax as claimed by the said Society was allowed. PW\n1 accepted that it was stated in the said notice that there was\nno necessity for the said Society to pay any commercial tax for\nAssessment Year 1996-97.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_121\">       13. According to the case of PW 1, on 23-3-2000, he\nvisited the appellant&#x27;s office to request her to issue final\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                            49</span>\n\n\n\nassessment order. According to his case, at that time, initially,\nthe appellant reiterated her demand of Rs 3000. But she scaled\nit down to Rs 2000. Admittedly, on 15-3-2000, the said Society\nwas served with a notice informing the said Society that an\nexemption has been granted from payment of commercial tax to\nthe said Society. Therefore, the said Society was not liable to\npay any tax for the year 1996-97. The issue of the final\nassessment order was only a procedural formality. Therefore,\nthe prosecution&#x27;s case about the demand of bribe made on 23-\n3-2000 by the appellant appears to be highly doubtful.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">       14. PW 1 described how the trap was laid. In the pre-trap\nmediator report, it has been recorded that LW 8, Shri R. Hari\nKishan, was to accompany PW 1 -- complainant at the time of\noffering the bribe. PW 7 Shri P.V.S.S.P. Raju deposed that PW 8\nShri U.V.S. Raju, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB, had\ninstructed LW 8 to accompany PW 1 -- complainant inside the\nchamber of the appellant. PW 8 has accepted this fact by stating\nin the examination-in-chief that LW 8 was asked to accompany\nPW 1 and observe what transpires between the appellant and\nPW 1. PW 8, in his evidence, accepted that only PW 1 entered\nthe chamber of the appellant and LW 8 waited outside the\nchamber. Even PW 7 admitted in the cross-examination that\nwhen PW 1 entered the appellant&#x27;s chamber, LW 8 remained\noutside in the corridor. Thus, LW 8 was supposed to be an\nindependent witness accompanying PW 1. In breach of the\ndirections issued to him by PW 8, he did not accompany PW 1\ninside the chamber of the appellant, and he waited outside the\nchamber in the corridor. The prosecution offered no explanation\nwhy LW 8 did not accompany PW 1 inside the chamber of the\nappellant at the time of the trap.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_123\">      15. Therefore, PW 1 is the only witness to the alleged\ndemand and acceptance. According to PW 1, firstly, the demand\nwas made of Rs 3000 by the appellant on 24-2-2000.\nThereafter, continuously for three days, she reiterated the\ndemand when he visited the appellant&#x27;s office. Lastly, the\nappellant made the demand on 29-2-2000 and 23-3-2000. On\nthis aspect, he was cross-examined in detail by the learned\nSenior Counsel appearing for the appellant. His version about\nthe demand and acceptance is relevant which reads thus:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                            50</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">             &quot;In the vicinity of office of AO the jeep, in which\n      we went there was stopped and I was asked to go into\n      the office of AO and the trap party took vantage\n      positions. Accordingly, I went inside the office of AO. I\n      wished AO. At that time apart from AO some other\n      person was found in the office room of AO and he was\n      talking to the AO. AO offered me a chair. After\n      discussion with the AO the said other person left the\n      room of AO. I informed AO that I brought the bribe\n      amount as demanded by her and also asked her to issue\n      the final assessment orders. Then I took the said tainted\n      currency notes from my shirt pocket and I was about to\n      give the same to the AO and on which instead of taking\n      the same amount directly by her with her hands she\n      took out a diary from her table drawer, opened the diary\n      and asked me to keep the said amount in the diary.\n      Accordingly, I kept the amount in the said diary. She\n      closed the said diary and again kept the same in her\n      table drawer and locked the drawer and kept the keys in\n      her hand bag which was hanging to her seat. She\n      pressed the calling bell and a lady attender came into\n      the room of AO, then she instructed the lady attender to\n      call ACTO concerned to her along with the society\n      records concerned.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">Accordingly, ACTO came to AO along with record. After going\nthrough the ledger and cash book, etc. AO signed on the last\npage of the said ledger and cash book mentioning 26-2-2000\nbelow her signature in the said register though she signed on\n27-3-2000 in my presence. AO directed her attender to affix\nofficial rubber stamp below her signature in the ledger and cash\nbook and accordingly attender affixed the same. AO also signed\non the office note of final assessment orders at that time.\nThereafter, I collected the general ledger and cash book from\nthe attender after affixing the said rubber stamp thereon and\ncame out of the office of AO and relayed the pre-arranged signal\nto the trap party.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">       16. Thus, PW 1 did not state that the appellant reiterated\nher demand at the time of trap. His version is that on his own,\nhe told her that he had brought the amount. What is material is\nthe cross-examination on this aspect. In the cross-examination,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                            51</span>\n\n\n\nPW 1 accepted that his version regarding the demand made by\nthe appellant on various dates was an improvement. The\nrelevant part of the cross-examination of the appellant reads\nthus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">             &quot;I did not state to ACB Inspector in <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 161</a>\n      CrPC statement that on the evening of 24-2-2000 I met\n      the AO and that she demanded the bribe. I did not\n      mention in Ext. P-3 complaint that continuously for 3\n      days after 24-2-2000 I met the AO and the AO reiterated\n      her demand. I did not mention in Ext. P-3 complaint that\n      on 29-2-2000 I approached the AO and the AO demanded\n      bribe of Rs 3000 and that unless I pay the said bribe\n      amount she will not issue final assessment orders. I did\n      not state in my Section 164 statement before the\n      Magistrate that 13-3-2000 to 16-3-2000 I was on leave\n      and from 1-3-2000 to 12-3-2000, I was engaged in\n      recovering the dues of the society. It is not true to\n      suggest that I did not meet the AO continuously 3 days\n      i.e. on 25-2-2000, 26-2-2000 and 27-2-2000 and that\n      27-2-2000 is Sunday. It is not true to suggest that I did\n      not meet the AO in the evening of 24-2-2000 and that AO\n      did not demand any money from me. I did not state in\n      my <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 161</a> CrPC statement to Inspector of ACB that\n      before I left the office of DSP on the date of trap I made a\n      phone call enquiring about the availability of AO and the\n      AO was in the office and informed me that she should be\n      available in the office from 6.00 to 7.00 p.m. on that day\n      so also in my <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 164</a> CrPC.

I do not remember as to\n      from which phone number I made phone call on that day.\n      I cannot describe office telephone number of the AO. It is\n      not true to suggest that I did not make any such phone\n      call to AO and that she did not give any such reply to\n      me. I did not state to ACB Inspector in my <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 161</a>\n      CrPC statement or to the Magistrate in my <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 164</a>\n      CrPC statement that I went inside the office of AO and I\n      wished AO and at that time apart from AO some other\n      person was found in the office room of AO and that he\n      was talking to the AO and that the AO offered me a chair\n      and that after discussion with the AO the said person left\n      the room of AO and then I informed the AO that I brought\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                            52</span>\n\n\n\n      the bribe amount.

Thus, the version of PW 1 in his examination-in-chief\nabout the demand made by the appellant from time to time is\nan improvement. As stated earlier, LW 8 did not enter the\nappellant&#x27;s chamber at the time of trap. There is no other\nevidence of the alleged demand. Thus, the evidence of PW 1\nabout the demand for bribe by the appellant is not at all\nreliable. Hence, we conclude that the demand made by the\nappellant has not been conclusively proved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">       18. PW 2, Shri B.D.V. Ramakrishna had no personal\nknowledge about the demand. However, he accepted that on\n15-3-2000, the said Society received a communication\ninforming that the said Society need not pay any tax for the\nyear 1996-97. PW 3 Shri L. Madhusudhan was working as\nGodown Incharge with the said Society. He stated that on 15-3-\n2000, when he visited the appellant&#x27;s office, ACTO served the\noriginal notice dated 26-2-2000 in which it was mentioned that\nthe Society was not liable to pay any tax. It is his version that\nwhen he met the appellant on the same day, she enquired\nwhether he had brought the demanded amount of Rs 3000.\nHowever, PW 3 did not state that the appellant demanded the\nsaid amount for granting any favour to the said society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">      19. PW 4 Ahmed Moinuddin was ACTO at the relevant\ntime. He deposed that on 27-3-2000, the appellant instructed\nhim to prepare the final assessment order, which was kept\nready in the morning. He stated that he was called at 6 p.m. to\nthe chamber of the appellant along with books of the said\nSociety. At that time, PW 1 was sitting there. He stated that the\nappellant subscribed her signature on a Register of the said\nSociety and put the date as 26-2-2000 below it. He was not a\nwitness to the alleged demand. However, in the cross-\nexamination, he admitted that the appellant had served a memo\ndated 21-3-2000 to him alleging that he was careless in\nperforming his duties.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                     53</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">The afore-quoted judgments were rendered interpreting <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 7</a>\n\nas it stood prior to amendment.

Even the issue of presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 20</a> of\nthe PC Act has been answered by the Constitution Bench by\nholding that only on proof of the facts in issue, <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 20</a>\nmandates the Court to raise a presumption that illegal\ngratification was for the purpose of motive or reward as\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 7</a> (as it existed prior to the amendment of\n2018). In fact, the Constitution Bench has approved two\ndecisions by the benches of three Hon&#x27;ble Judges in the cases\nof B. Jayaraj1 and P. Satyanarayana Murthy2. There is another\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                            59</span>\n\n\n\ndecision of a three Judges&#x27; bench in the case of <a href=\"/doc/57503010/\" id=\"a_200\">N.\nVijayakumar v. State of Tamil Nadu5</a>, which follows the view\ntaken in the cases of B. Jayaraj1 and P. Satyanarayana Murthy2.\nIn paragraph 9 of the decision in the case of B. Jayaraj1, this\nCourt has dealt with the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 20</a> of the PC\nAct. In paragraph 9, this Court held thus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">              &quot;9. Insofar as the presumption permissible\n      to be drawn under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 20</a> of the Act is\n      concerned, such presumption can only be in\n      respect of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 7</a> and not the\n      offences under <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_204\">Sections 13(1)(d)(i)</a> and (ii) of the\n      Act. In any event, it is only on proof of acceptance\n      of illegal gratification that presumption can be\n      drawn under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 20</a> of the Act that such\n      gratification was received for doing or forbearing\n      to do any official act. Proof of acceptance of illegal\n      gratification can follow only if there is proof of demand.\n      As the same is lacking in the present case the primary\n      facts on the basis of which the legal presumption under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 20</a> can be drawn are wholly absent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">                                             (emphasis added)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">        14. The presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 20</a> can be invoked\nonly when the two basic facts required to be proved under\n<a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 7</a>, are proved. The said two basic facts are &#x27;demand&#x27; and\n&#x27;acceptance&#x27; of gratification. The presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 20</a>\nis that unless the contrary is proved, the acceptance of\ngratification shall be presumed to be for a motive or reward, as\ncontemplated by <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 7</a>. It means that once the basic facts of\nthe demand of illegal gratification and acceptance thereof are\nproved, unless the contrary are proved, the Court will have to\npresume that the gratification was demanded and accepted as a\nmotive or reward as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 7</a>. However, this\npresumption is rebuttable. Even on the basis of the\npreponderance of probability, the accused can rebut the\npresumption.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\">      15. In the case of N. Vijayakumar5, another bench of\nthree Hon&#x27;ble Judges dealt with the issue of presumption under\n<a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 20</a> and the degree of proof required to establish the\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 7</a> and clauses (i) and (ii)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                             60</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 13(2)</a> of PC Act. In\nparagraph 26, the bench held thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">              &quot;26. It is equally well settled that mere recovery\n      by itself cannot prove the charge of the prosecution\n      against the accused. Reference can be made to the\n      judgments of this Court in C.M. Girish Babu v. CBI [C.M.\n      Girish Babu v. CBI, (2009) 3 SCC 779 : (2009) 2 SCC\n      (Cri) 1] and in B. Jayaraj v. State of A.P. [B.\n      Jayaraj v. State of A.P., (2014) 13 SCC 55 : (2014) 5\n      SCC (Cri) 543] In the aforesaid judgments of this\n      Court     while      considering      the    case   under\n      <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_216\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_217\">13(1) (d)(i)</a> and (ii) of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_218\">Prevention\n      of Corruption Act, 1988</a> it is reiterated that to\n      prove the charge, it has to be proved beyond\n      reasonable doubt that the accused voluntarily\n      accepted money knowing it to be bribe. Absence of\n      proof of demand for illegal gratification and mere\n      possession or recovery of currency notes is not\n      sufficient to constitute such offence. In the said\n      judgments it is also held that even the presumption\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 20</a> of the Act can be drawn only after\n      demand for and acceptance of illegal gratification is\n      proved. It is also fairly well settled that initial\n      presumption of innocence in the criminal jurisprudence\n      gets doubled by acquittal recorded by the trial court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_153\">                                              (emphasis added)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">      16. Thus, the demand for gratification and its acceptance\nmust be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">       17. <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 7</a>, as existed prior to 26th July 2018, was\ndifferent from the present <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 7</a>. The unamended <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 7</a>\nwhich is applicable in the present case, specifically refers to\n&quot;any gratification&quot;. The substituted <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_223\">Section 7</a> does not use the\nword &quot;gratification&quot;, but it uses a wider term &quot;undue\nadvantage&quot;. When the allegation is of demand of gratification\nand acceptance thereof by the accused, it must be as a motive\nor reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act. The fact\nthat the demand and acceptance of gratification were for motive\nor reward as provided in <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 7</a> can be proved by invoking\nthe presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 20</a> provided the basic allegations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                             61</span>\n\n\n\nof the demand and acceptance are proved. In this case, we are\nalso concerned with the offence punishable under clauses (i)\nand (ii) <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> which is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_227\">Section\n13(2)</a> of the PC Act. Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_228\">Section 13</a>,\nwhich existed on the statute book prior to the amendment of\n26th July 2018, has been quoted earlier. On a plain reading of\nclauses (i) and (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 13(1)(d)</a>, it is apparent that proof\nof acceptance of illegal gratification will be necessary to prove\nthe offences under clauses (i) and (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 13(1)(d)</a>. In\nview of what is laid down by the Constitution Bench, in a given\ncase, the demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by a\npublic servant can be proved by circumstantial evidence in the\nabsence of direct oral or documentary evidence. While\nanswering the referred question, the Constitution Bench has\nobserved that it is permissible to draw an inferential deduction\nof culpability and/or guilt of the public servant for the offences\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_231\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_232\">13(1)(d)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_233\">Section\n13(2)</a> of the PC Act. The conclusion is that in absence of direct\nevidence, the demand and/or acceptance can always be proved\nby other evidence such as circumstantial evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">       18. The allegation of demand of gratification and\nacceptance made by a public servant has to be established\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The decision of the Constitution\nBench does not dilute this elementary requirement of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The Constitution Bench was dealing\nwith the issue of the modes by which the demand can be\nproved. The Constitution Bench has laid down that the proof\nneed not be only by direct oral or documentary evidence, but it\ncan be by way of other evidence including circumstantial\nevidence. When reliance is placed on circumstantial evidence to\nprove the demand for gratification, the prosecution must\nestablish each and every circumstance from which the\nprosecution wants the Court to draw a conclusion of guilt. The\nfacts so established must be consistent with only one hypothesis\nthat there was a demand made for gratification by the accused.\nTherefore, in this case, we will have to examine whether there is\nany direct evidence of demand. If we come to a conclusion that\nthere is no direct evidence of demand, this Court will have to\nconsider whether there is any circumstantial evidence to prove\nthe demand.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                     62</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47208355\" id=\"span_94\">Subsequent to NEERAJ DUTTA&#x27;S case the Apex Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/47208355/\" id=\"a_234\">SOUNDARAJAN v.

Moreover,\n        the Constitution Bench in the case of Neeraj Dutta3 has\n        reiterated that the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 20</a> of the PC\n        Act can be invoked only on proof of facts in issue, namely, the\n        demand of gratification by the accused and the acceptance\n        thereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">               10.

He has not said anything in his\n        examination-in-chief about the demand made by the appellant.\n        The public prosecutor cross-examined PW-2. The witness stated\n        that there was no demand of a bribe made by the appellant.\n        According to him, he filed a complaint as the return of the sale\n        deed was delayed. Though PW-2 accepted that he had filed the\n        complaint, in the cross-examination, he was not confronted with\n        the material portions of the complaint in which he had narrated\n        how the alleged demand was made. The public prosecutor ought\n        to have confronted the witness with his alleged prior statements\n        in the complaint and proved that part of the complaint through\n        the concerned police officer who had reduced the complaint into\n        writing. However, that was not done.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">                11. Now, we turn to the evidence of the shadow witness\n        (PW-3). In the examination-in-chief, he stated that the\n        appellant asked the PW-2 whether he had brought the amount.\n        PW-3 did not say that the appellant made a specific demand of\n        gratification in his presence to PW-2. To attract <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 7</a> of\n        the PC Act, the demand for gratification has to be proved by the\n        prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. The word used in\n        <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 7</a>, as it existed before 26th July 2018, is &#x27;gratification&#x27;.\n        There has to be a demand for gratification.

On the bedrock of the principles <a href=\"/doc/47208355/\" id=\"a_252\">laid down by</a> the Apex\n\nCourt interpreting <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 7</a>, the facts obtaining in the case at hand\n\nare required to be noticed. It is an admitted fact that no complaint\n\nis registered by any complainant being aggrieved of any demand or\n\nacceptance of illegal gratification.   The complaint is registered on\n\nthe tapping of the mobile conversation between the accused. The\n\naccused No.2 Shantha Kumar is said to have agreed to pay\n\nRs.50,000/-.    Accused No.3 is said to have delivered the said\n\nRs.50,000/-.   No trap is laid against the petitioner.     When the\n\nsleuths of the CBI go to the office of the petitioner, they are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                   65</span>\n\n\n\ninformed that he has left to his residence. They go to his residence\n\nand meet accused No.3 outside the house. It is said when he was\n\nquestioned as to why was he there, he is said to have confessed\n\nthat he had come to deliver Rs.50,000/- in an envelope. The house\n\nis searched based upon the said information. The petitioner, during\n\nthe search, pulls out an envelope containing Rs.50,000/- from his\n\ncupboard. This is said to have been identified by the accused No.3,\n\nthat the colour of the envelope is the same, that he had given\n\nRs.50,000/-. So the case of the prosecution is not built upon any\n\ndemand or acceptance, for any work pending on the table of the\n\npetitioner, and neither on any undue advantage being taken. It is\n\nsought to be built on the colour of the envelope and the amount in\n\nthe envelope i.e., Rs.50,000/-.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">     21. As observed hereinabove, no trap is laid, no search legally\n\nis conducted, no permission to tap the mobile phone of the\n\npetitioner is legally granted.    It runs completely counter to the\n\njudgments rendered by the Apex Court supra. Therefore, if the\n\nprosecution wants to build up its case on the colour of a plain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                 66</span>\n\n\n\nenvelope, it is too bleak an effort to taint the petitioner and permit\n\nfurther proceedings.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">      22. As observed hereinabove, prosecution is wanting to build\n\nup its case on the colour of an envelope and the manner in which\n\nthey have sought to build it up, turns the colour of the case to a\n\nmonochrome, resulting in unsustainability of the entire proceedings\n\nagainst the petitioner, as the envelope has completely lost its\n\ncolour. I have used this metaphor to drive home that the case of\n\nthe prosecution has completely lost its steam being shrouded with\n\nthe afore considered illegality.     In the light of the preceding\n\nanalysis, permitting further proceedings against the petitioner\n\nwould become an abuse of the process of the law and result in\n\npatent injustice, both of which would lead to miscarriage of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">Therefore, I deem it appropriate to exercise my jurisdiction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. and obliterate the proceedings against\n\nthe petitioner.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                     67</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_168\">        23.
