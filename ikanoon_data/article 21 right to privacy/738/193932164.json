On 27.11.1996 at about 07.30 PM, she was returning to her house after attending the coaching centre and was in the way, due to electric light gone of, there was darkness in the way and in the meantime accused Haneef, his brother in law Rashid and one unknown person forcibly took her to their house in Mohalla Adarsh Nagar where mother and sister of accused Haneef locked her in a room. She was given a paper and was compelled to sign on it and when she refused to sign on the paper she was beaten and threatened to face dire consequences. The mother of accused Haneef tide her hands and after that she went away. Thereafter accused Haneef entered into the room and committed rape with the victim. She was confined in the house of the appellants for 3 to 4 days. On 02.12.1996 accused Haneef took her to Kanpur and when they came to the bus stand at Unnao, the victim raised alarm and at about 12.00 noon the police personnel came there and took her in custody but accused succeeded to flew away from there. When the victim did not return to her house on 27.11.1996 after attending the coaching, her mother Smt. Parmeshwari made search for her and ultimately she lodged a report at Police Station Kotwali on 05.12.1996 at about 06.35 PM whereupon  a case at Crime No.1695 of 1996 was registered under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 363</a> and <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_5\">366</a> IPC. After recovery of the victim she was brought before the Magistrate for recording the statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. on 10.12.1996 and she was also medically examined at Women&#x27;s Hospital, Unnao. After recording the statement of the witnesses and completing the investigation, the Investigating Officer submitted a charge sheet against all the accused persons. Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and committed the case to the Court of Sessions where all the accused persons were summoned and charges under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 363</a> and <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_8\">366</a> were levelled against all the accused persons for which they pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial. A charge under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 376</a> IPC was also levelled against accused Haneef for which he pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.\tIn order to prove the prosecution case, PW-1 Constable Moharrir Bhanu Pratap Singh, PW-2 Parmeshwari, mother of the victim, PW-3 the victim, PW-4 Dr. Ram Pati Devi, PW-5 SI Suraj Singh and PW-6 Dr. Satya Prakash were examined.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.\tIn the statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the accused Haneef had stated that the victim was major at the time of occurrence and she went away from her house voluntarily and on 30.11.1996 an application was presented before one Ram Autar Advocate for marriage which was verified by the victim. Rest of the accused appellants have denied the charges and stated that they have been falsely implicated in this case and also stated that a false charge sheet has been submitted against them.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.\tI have heard Mr. Alok Kapoor, learned counsel for the appellants, and Mr. Shesh Nath Singh, learned Additional Government Advocate for the State.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">6.\tBefore proceeding with the case, it would be appropriate to simply narrate the things on the basis of the statement recorded by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Unnao on 10.12.1996. On that day, the victim was taken to the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, who recorded the statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">The victim was studying in Class X at the time of recording the statement. She had narrated that on 27.11.1996 at about 07.30 PM when she was returning after attending the coaching centre named Manhar Coaching Centre, Adarsh Nagar, Police Station Kotwali, Unnao, the accused Haneef, his one relative Rashid and one boy met to her. It was dark due to non-supply of the electricity. All these three persons caught hold the victim and took her to their house at Adarsh Nagar. Mother and sister of accused Haneef met there, took the victim in a room and locked there. When she cried, they threatened to beat her. They forced her to put her signature on a paper and when she refused, she was brutally beaten and also threatened that if she would refuse to sign on the paper, her mother and father will be finished. When she did not sign the paper, she was taken to one room in underground and was locked there and was brutally beaten. Mother of Haneef tide her hands and after that she went out of the room. Haneef came there and committed &quot;bad work&quot;. Haneef opened all the clothes of the victim and also opened his clothes and after that forcefully &quot;Meri Ijjat Loot Lee&quot;. She was kept in that underground room for two days and again she was kept in the house for 3-4 days and was pressurized to put her signature. On 02.12.1996 when Haneef with his friends was taking her towards Kanpur and reached at Kanpur Bus Stand Unnao at about 12.00 in the day, she shouted to save her and the police came there and escaped her. She expressed her desire to go with her parents. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">7.\tAfter recovery by the police personnel, she was taken to the hospital where Emergency Medical Officer examined her on 06.12.1996, who reported that hymen was torn and healed and vagina admits two fingers. Copy of the GD entry dated 06.12.1996 reveals that the victim was recovered from the Bus Stand and was taken by the police personnel and was produced before learned Magistrate for recording her statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.\tLearned counsel for the appellants has stated that the victim had put her signature on one of the papers which have been filed by the appellants in the Court below and was verified by the Advocate notary on 30.11.1996 which is on record which reveals that an instrument by notary had been prepared in which they have been shown as major and expressed their desire to live as husband and wife.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">9.\tLearned counsel for the State has submitted that the victim was put under threat and her signature was obtained by forceful means. It has further been submitted that the paper which is a form of declaration is not admissible in evidence nor it is a certificate of marriage. Firstly the notary advocate is not entitled to certify the marriage. Secondly, the marriage, as stated by the appellants, is not known to <a href=\"/doc/134686354/\" id=\"a_12\">Muslim Marriage Act</a>. Thirdly, the tradition is not admissible in the family or the relatives of the appellants. Fourthly, the marriage is not admissible in the family or relatives of the victim. Fifthly, the marriage is not known or recognized in either Mohammedan Law or Hindu Law. Learned counsel for the State has submitted that on  false pretext of marriage appellant Haneef had committed sexual offence and raped her forcefully without her consent and prepared this document in his defence. It is known fact that if anything is morally correct, it can never be legally wrong. Similarly, if anything is legally correct that can never be morally wrong. If the parties or the appellant Haneef was willing to marry the victim, they might have performed the ceremony according to law or admissibility in their family traditions. It is neither Nikah nor marriage nor it is admissible in both families in tradition. In the circumstances, when the victim, while she was produced before learned Magistrate for recording the statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C., had  stated that she was forced to put her signature, total papers should be read in light of her statement. It is the version of the appellants that she put her signature willingly as stated under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. but when the victim was produced before the Magistrate she had stated otherwise and also stated that she was forcibly taken while she was returning after attending the coaching and was forcibly locked in the underground room and was forcibly sexually assaulted and raped and was forced to put her signature.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">10.\tNow the question raised before the court by the learned counsel for appellants is that offence as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 376</a> IPC has not been committed by the appellants. <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 376</a> IPC reads as under:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;376.

Before parting with the case we would like to point out that the Courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape.

The Courts should examine the broader       probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor       contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw out allegations of rape. This is all the more important because of late crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating woman&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection and we must emphasise that the Courts must deal with rape cases in particular with utmost sensitivity and appreciate the evidence in the totality of the background of the entire case and not in isolation.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_2\">One of us (Dr. Anand J.) has observed in <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_18\">State of  Punjab v.

Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase, It is an irony that while we are celebrating women&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violates the victim&#x27;s privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault - it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Court, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. ..... &quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">13.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91149\" id=\"span_4\">In Rameshwar S/o.Kalyan <a href=\"/doc/91149/\" id=\"a_20\">Singh v. The State of Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1952 SC 54), the accused was charged with the offence of raping a girl below eight years of age. The Supreme Court held that the High Court was right in holding that the guilt of the accused was proved by the evidence of the victim which was legally corroborated by the girl&#x27;s statement to her mother. The Supreme Court held thus:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"> &quot;Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice. If she was ravished she is the  victim of an outrage. If she consented there is no offence unless she is a married woman, in which case questions of adultery may arise. .. That, in my opinion, is exactly the law in India so far as accomplices are concerned and it Is certainly not any higher in the case of sexual offences. The only clarification necessary for purposes of this country is where this class of offence is sometimes tried by a judge without the aid of jury. In these cases, it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had this rule of caution in mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it  unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the  particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corroboration in that particular case. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\t  The nature and extent of the corroboration is required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it. Here, again, the rules are lucidly expounded by Lord Reading in Baskerville&#x27;s case,(1916) 2, K. B. 658 at p. 664 to 669. It would be impossible, indeed it would be dangerous, to formulate the kind of evidence which should, or would, be regarded as corroboration. Its nature and extent must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged. But to this extent the rules are clear.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\t First, it is not necessary that there should be  independent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independent evidence in the case,apart from the testimony of the complainant or the accomplice, should in itself be sufficient to sustain conviction. As Lord Reading says:\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\t&quot;Indeed, if it were required that  the accomplice should be confirmed in every detail of the crime, his evidence would not be essential to the case, it would be merely confirmatory of other and independent testimony.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">\tAll that is required is that there must be &quot;some additional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or complainant) is true and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it.&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">\tSecondly, the independent evidence must not only make it safe to believe that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect or tend to connect the accused with it by confirming in some material particular the testimony of the accomplice or complainant that the accused committed the crime.This does not mean the corroboration as to identity must extend to all the circumstances necessary to identify the accused with the offence. ......&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"207774\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1273458\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91149\" id=\"span_7\">14.\tThe decision in Rameshwar S/o.Kalyan <a href=\"/doc/91149/\" id=\"a_21\">Singh v.

Thus, the testimony of an injured witness is accorded a special status in law. Such a witness  comes with a built-in guarantee of his presence at the scene of the crime and is unlikely to spare his actual assailant(s) in order to falsely implicate someone.\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">&quot;Convincing evidence is required to discredit an injured witness&quot;.

It is well settled that the prosecutrix cannot be considered as an accomplice and, therefore, her testimony cannot be equated with that of an accomplice in an offence. As a rule of prudence, however; court  normally looks for some corroboration of her testimony so as to satisfy its conscience that she is telling the truth and that the person accused of rape on her has not been falsely implicated.

It has been held that the prosecutrix cannot be considered to be an accomplice. As a rule of prudence, however, it has been emphasised that Courts should normally look for some corroboration of her testimony in order to satisfy itself that the prosecutrix is telling the truth and that a person, accused of abduction or rape, has not been falsely implicated. The view that, as a matter of law, no conviction without corroboration was possible has not been accepted. The only rule of law is the rule of prudence namely the advisability of corroboration should be present in the mind of the Judge or the Jury, as the case may be. There is no rule of practice that there must in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. As to what type of corroboration may be required when the court is of the opinion that it is not safe to dispense with that requirement, it has also been laid down that the type of corroboration required must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence with which a person is charged.<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1502418\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1420504\" id=\"span_10\">(See <a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_25\">Rameshwar v.

She is in fact a victim of the crime. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_30\">The Evidence Act</a> nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under S. 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_31\">Evidence Act</a> similar to illustration (b) to<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_32\"> S. 114</a> which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend  assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage:\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the Court   finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">It would have proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex-violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the Western and European countries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the Court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a  person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts     must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity.&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">21.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_33\">State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh and others</a> (AIR 1996 SC 1393), the Supreme Court held:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">&quot;The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases  involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations  which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent    bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in  the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost at par with the evidence of an injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable, Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, is considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a Victim of another person&#x27;s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Inferences have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity least that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a    casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">22.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366037\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/366037/\" id=\"a_34\">Aman Kumar and another v.

In the latter case, there is injury on the physical form, while in the former it is both physical as well as psychological and emotional. However, if the Court of facts finds it difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix on its face value, it may search for evidence, direct or circumstantial, which would lend assurance to her testimony.

It is now well settled principle of law that conviction can be founded on the testimony of the prosecutrix alone unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration.

It is purely and solely a mental process to be ascertained, in a prosecution for rape, by what the prosecuting witness may have said or done. It being a mental process there is no other manner by which her will can be ascertained, and it must be left to the jury to determine that will by her acts and statements, as disclosed by the evidence. It is but natural, therefore, that in charging the jury upon the subject of rape, or assault with intent to commit rape, the courts should have almost universally, and, in many cases, exclusively, discussed &quot;consent&quot; and resistance. There can be no better evidence of willingness is a condition or state of mind no better evidence of unwillingness than resistance. No lexicographer recognizes &quot;consent&quot; as a synonym of willingness, and it is apparent that they are not synonymous. It is equally apparent, on the other hand, that the true relation between the words is that willingness is a condition or     state of mind and &quot;consent&quot; one of the evidences of that condition. Likewise resistance is not a synonym of unwillingness, though it is an evidence thereof. In all cases, therefore, where the prosecuting witness has an intelligent will, the court should charge upon the elements of &quot;consent&quot; and resistance as being proper elements from which the jury may infer either a favourable or an opposing will. It must, however, be recognized in all cases that the real test is whether the assault was committed against the will of the prosecuting witness. State v.

So, the courts should deal with such cases sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not only an offence against the person of a woman, rather a crime against the entire society. It is a crime against basic human rights and also violates the most cherished fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">58.\tIn view of International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights 1966; United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power 1985, rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not retraumatize them or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity.

State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi</a>), (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 240 a 15 years old victim was kidnapped on knife point and raped in a hotel and again in house by two accused persons High Court reduced sentence from seven years to five years. The Supreme Court analyzed that Law of Rape and pointed out that it is a trite law that a woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person&#x27;s lust. The prosecutrix stands at a higher pedestal than an injured witness as she suffers from emotional injury. Therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_89\">The Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under <a href=\"/doc/371095/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 118</a> of Evidence Act and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_91\">Evidence Act</a> similar to illustration (b) to <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 114</a> which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. The court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Rape is not merely a physical assault, rather it often distracts the whole personality of the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the commission of the offence.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732998\" id=\"span_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1974122\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199575\" id=\"span_52\">(Vide: <a href=\"/doc/199575/\" id=\"a_93\">State of Maharashtra v.

Again, if the investigating officer did not conduct the investigation properly or was negligent in not being able to trace out the driver or the car, how car that become a ground to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix? The prosecutrix had no control over the investigating agency and the negligence of an investigating officer could not affect the credibility of the statement of the prosecutrix. The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances&quot;.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">61.\tThe important thing that the court has to bear in mind is that what is lost by a rape victim. The victim loses value as a person. Ours is a conservative society and, therefore, a woman and more so a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault. In examining the evidence of the prosecutrix the courts must be alive to the conditions prevalent in the Indian society and must not be swayed by beliefs in other countries. The courts must be sensitive and responsive to the plight of the female victim of sexual assault. Society&#x27;s belief and value systems need to be kept uppermost in mind as rape is the worst form of woman&#x27;s oppression. A forcible sexual assault brings in humiliation, feeling of disgust, tremendous embarrassment, sense of shame, trauma and lifelong emotional scar to a victim and it is, therefore, most unlikely of a woman, and more so by a young woman, roping in somebody falsely in the crime of rape. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"207774\" id=\"span_54\">The stigma that attaches to the victim of rape in Indian society ordinarily rules out the leveling of false accusations. An Indian woman traditionally will not concoct an untruthful story and bring charges of rape for the purpose of blackmail, hatred, spite or revenge. The Supreme Court has repeatedly laid down the guidelines as to how the evidence of the prosecutrix in the crime of rape should be evaluated by the court. The observations made in the case of <a href=\"/doc/207774/\" id=\"a_97\">Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat</a> (1983) 3 SCC 217 deserve special mention where the Supreme Court observed as follows:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">&quot;In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? To do so is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominated society. We must analyze the argument in support of the need for corroboration and subject it to relentless and remorseless cross-examination. And we must do so with a logical, and not an opiniated, eye in the light of probabilities with our feet firmly planted on the soil of India and with our eyes focussed on the Indian horizon. We must not be swept off the feet by the approach made in the Western World which has its own social mileu, its own social mores, its own permissive values, and its own code of life. Corroboration may be considered essential to establish a sexual offence in the backdrop of the social ecology of the Western World. It is wholly unnecessary to import the said concept on a turn-key basis and to transplate it on the Indian soil regardless of the altogether different atmosphere, attitudes, mores, responses of the Indian Society and its profile. The identities of the two worlds are different. The solution of problems cannot therefore be identical. It is conceivable in the Western Society that a female may level false accusation as regards sexual molestation against a male for several reasons such as: \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">(1) The female may be a &#x27;gold digger&#x27; and may well have an economic motive to extract money by holding out the gun of prosecution or public exposure. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">(2) She may be suffering from psychological neurosis and may seek an escape from the neurotic prison by phantasizing or imagining a situation where she is desired, wanted, and chased by males. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">(3) She may want to wreak vengence on the male for real or imaginary wrongs. She may have a grudge against a particular male, or males in general, and may have the design to square the account. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">(4) She may have been induced to do so in consideration of economic rewards, by a person interested in placing the accused in a compromising or embarassing position, on account of personal or political vendatta. (5) She may do so to gain notoriety or publicity or to appease her own ego or to satisfy her feeling of self-importance in the context of her inferiority complex. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">(6) She may do so on account of jealousy. (7) She may do so to win sympathy of others. (8) She may do so upon being repulsed.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">By and large these factors are not relevant to India, and the Indian conditions. Without the fear of making too wide a statements or of overstating the case, it can be said that rarely will a girl or a woman in India make false allegations of sexual assault on account of any such factor as has been just enlisted. The statement is generally true in the context of the urban as also rural Society. It is also by and large true in the context of the sophisticated, not so sophisticated, and unsophisticated society. Only very rarely can one conceivably come across an exception or two and that too possibly from amongst the urban elites. Because: (1) A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non- permissive Society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. (2) She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracised by the Society or being looked down by the Society including by her own family members, relatives, friends and neighbours. (3) She would have to brave the whole world. (4) She would face the risk of losing the love and respect of her own husband and near relatives, and of her matrimonial home and happiness being shattered. (S) If she is unmarried, she would apprehend that it would be difficult to secure an alliance with a suitable match from a respectable or an acceptable family. (6) It would almost inevitably and almost invariably result in mental torture and suffering to herself. (7) The fear of being taunted by others will always haunt her. (8) She would feel extremely embarrassed in relating the incident to others being over powered by a feeling of shame on account of the upbringing in a tradition bound society where by and large sex is taboo. (9) The natural inclination would be to avoid giving publicity to the incident lest the family name and family honour is brought into controversy. (10) The parents of an unmarried girl as also the husband and members of the husband&#x27;s family of a married woman would also more often than not, want to avoid publicity on account of the fear of social stigma on the family name and family honour. (11) The fear of the victim herself being considered to be promiscuous or in some way responsible for the incident regardless of her innocence. (12) The reluctance to face interrogation by the investigating agency, to face the court, to face the cross examination by Counsel for the culprit, and the risk of being disbelieved, acts as a deterrent&quot; \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">62.\tRape is a heinous crime and once it is established against a person charged of the offence, justice must be done to the victim of crime by awarding suitable punishment to the crime doer. The criminal justice system in not working in our country as it should. The police reforms have not taken place despite directions of this Court in the case of Prakash Singh &amp; amp; Ors. Union of India &amp; amp; Ors. (2006) 8 SCC 1. The investigators hardly have professional orientation; they od not have modern tools. On many occasions impartial investigation suffers because of political interference. The criminal trials are protracted because of non-appearance of official witnesses on time and the non-availability of the facilities for recording evidence by video conferencing. The public prosecutors have their limitation; the defence lawyers do not make themselves available and the court would be routinely informed about their pre-occupation with other matters; the courts remain overburdened with the briefs listed on the day and they do not have adequate infrastructure. The adjournments thus become routine; the casualty is justice. It is imperative that the criminal cases  relating to offences against the State, corruption, dowry death, domestic violence, sexual assault, financial fraud and cyber crimes are fast tracked and decided in a fixed time frame, preferably, of three years including the appeal provisions. It is high time that immediate and urgent steps are taken in amending the procedural and other laws to achieve the above objectives. We must remember that a strong and efficient criminal justice system is a guarantee to the rule of law and vibrant civil society. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">63.\tValue of Medical Evidence: Appreciating Sociological and Psychological Aspect of Rape:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"915673\" id=\"span_55\">Courts used to take the position that if there was no proof of physical assault there would be no rape. The presumption that if no physical injury is evident on the victim, no sexual intercourse has taken place or rape has not been committed, ignores the fact that rape is not only an offence involving physical violence, but also psychological violence. This too when existing laws recognize mental agony and psychological violence as offences against the body. The victim of rape besides being physically ravished is psychologically wounded. It is the feeling of having been exploited and violated more that anything else which leaves lifelong scars on the mind of the victim. Perhaps this trauma has been recognized in a case where it was held that the absence of injuries on private parts of the prosecutrix would not rule out her being subjected to rape  1. Krishna Iyer. J. who is famous for his humanistic approach towards law, observed in <a href=\"/doc/915673/\" id=\"a_98\">Rafiq Vs. State of U.P.</a> (1980) 4 SCC 262:</span> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">&quot;when no woman of honour will accuse another of rape since she sacrifices thereby what is dearest to her, we cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroborative testimony, even if taken as a whole, the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as probable. In this case, the testimony has commanded acceptance from two courts. When a woman is ravished what is inflicted is not merely physical injury. but &#x27;the deep sense of some deathless shame&quot;.

Naval Dubey</a>, (1992) 3 SCC 2014, where the question as to what constitutes sexual intercourse and rape was discussed, the Apex Court has put the matter in perspective:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">&quot;Sexual intercourse: In law, this term is held to mean the slightest degree of penetration of the vulva by the penis with or without emission of semen. It is therefore quite possible to commit legally the offence of rape without producing any injury to the genitals or leaving any seminal stains.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">66.\tIt was further held:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">&quot;To constitute the offence of rape it is not necessary that there should be complete penetration of penis with emission of semen and rupture of hymen. Partial penetration of the penis within the Labia majora or the vulva or pudenda with or without emission of semen or even an attempt at penetration is quite sufficient for the purpose of the law. It is therefore quite possible to commit legally the offence of rape without producing any injury to the genitals or leaving any seminal stains. In such a case the medical officer should mention the negative facts in his report, but should not give his opinion that no rape had been committed. Rape is crime and not a medical condition. Rape is a legal term and not a diagnosis to be made by the medical officer treating the victim. The only statement that can be made by the medical officer is that there is evidence of recent sexual activity. Whether the rape has occurred or not is a legal conclusion, not a medical one.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">67.\tAbsence of injury to the prosecutrix advanced as a plea to disprove the allegation of rape was dismissed by the Supreme Court thus:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">&quot;The mere fact that no injury was found on the private parts of the prosecutrix or her hymen was found to be intact does not belie the statement of the prosecutrix as she nowhere stated that she bled per vagina as a result of the penetration of the penis in her vagina. She was subjected to sexual intercourse in a standing posture and that itself indicates the absence of any injury on her private pans. To constitute the offence of rape, penetration, however slight, is sufficient. The prosecutrix deposed about the performance of sexual intercourse by the appellant and her statement has remained unchallenged in the cross-examination. Neither the non-rupture of the hymen nor the absence of injuries on her private parts, therefore, belies the testimony of the prosecutrix particularly when we find that in the cross-examination of the prosecutrix, nothing has been brought out to doubt her veracity or to suggest as to why she would falsely implicate the appellant and put her own reputation at stake. The opinion of the doctor that no rape appeared to have been committed was based only on the absence of rupture of the hymen and injuries on the private parts of the prosecutrix. This opinion cannot throw out an otherwise cogent and trustworthy evidence of the prosecutrix. Besides, the opinion of the doctor appears to be based on &quot;no reasons&quot;. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">68.\tIn the appeal the counsel of the appellant sought to bring out that, in the absence of corroboration of statement of the prosecutrix by medical evidence, the conviction of the appellant was bad.

Hardly one comes across a witness whose evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or at any rate exaggerations, embroideries or embellishments. It is, therefore, the duty of the court to scrutinise the evidence carefully and, in terms of the felicitous metaphor, separate the grain from the chaff.

The court while appreciating the evidence should not lose sight of these realities of life and cannot afford to take an unrealistic approach by sitting in an ivory tower.

It is very easy to pass an order of acquittal on the basis of minor points raised in the case by a short judgment so as to achieve the yardstick of disposal. Some discrepancy is bound to be there in each and every case which should not weigh with the court so long it does not materially affect the prosecution case. In case discrepancies pointed out are in the realm of pebbles, the court should tread upon it, but if the same are boulders, the court should not make an attempt to jump over the same. These days when crime is looming large and humanity is suffering and the society is so much affected thereby, duties and responsibilities of the courts have become much more. Now the maxim &quot;let hundred guilty persons be acquitted, but not a single innocent be convicted&quot; is, in practice, changing the world over and courts have been compelled to accept that &quot;society suffers by wrong convictions and it equally suffers by wrong acquittals&quot;.

Learned court below had acquitted the accused/appellant Haneef from the charges under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 376</a> IPC only on the ground that &quot;Haneef Kamre Me Aya .... Bura Kam Kiya&quot;. Learned court below interpreted it that the victim had not stated that appellant Haneef penetrated his penis into her vagina. This is an absurd interpretation of the words. The victim was narrating the facts before the Court where the court staff including the advocates were present when she said &quot;Kamre Me Aya .....Wa Bura Kam Kiya .....Meri Ijjat Loot Lee&quot;. All these means that there was forceful rape. It is surprising that learned court below has interpreted that these acts do not come within the purview of even <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 354</a> IPC. The circumstances under which the offence was committed were, as narrated by the prosecution and the victim, that she was taken in an underground room where her hands were made tide and the lady accused went away from there and later on accused Haneef entered into the room, opened all the clothes of the victim even she objected and then he opened his own clothes and then committed &quot;Bura Kam ......Ijjat Loot Lee. Even if it is not interpreted to commit rape, what does it mean. Learned court below while interpreting all these facts has narrated as under:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">&quot;8. \tThe last charge against all the accused persons is under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 366</a> IPC. From the statement of PW-3 Km. Prabha Sharma, I find that this offence is duly proved. She has stated on oath that while she was returning from the Coaching Classes, she was abducted from the way by accused Haneef and Rashid, who forcibly took her to the house of Haneef in the darkness, as electric light had gone off. It has also been proved from her statement that accused Haneef and Smt. Khatoon compelled her to sign a blank paper and she was confined in a room and beaten. The accused have also filed a declaration of marriage before the Notary to show that the prosecutrix had married accused Haneef out of her own free will. This shows that abduction was made to compel Km. Prabha Sharma to marry against her will. The defence case is that the prosecutrix was a consenting party and that she herself went to the house of the accused. However, the prosecutrix denies it. Declaration of marriage has not been properly proved because neither Notary has been examined nor the signature of the prosecutrix thereon have been proved. As regards the photograph, I cannot attach much importance to it, particularly in the absence of its negative and particularly when the prosecutrix denies to have got photographed. It is also alleged by the prosecutrix that accused Haneef raped her though the charge of rape is not proved beyond doubt on account of insufficient evidence and on account of details having not been divulged by the prosecutrix. This allegation is, however, a circumstance to show that the adbudction was done to compel the marriage of Km. Prabha Sharma with accused Haneef against her will. Since accused Haneef and Rashid abducted Km. Prabha Sharma to compel her marriage against her will knowing that she may be forced to illicit intercourse and since Smt. Khatoon abetted the commission of the offence by confining the prosecutrix in a room of her house knowing that Km. Prabha Sharma had been abducted and the circumstances that after Smt. Khatoon came out of the room after tying her hands, accused Haneef went inside the room and committed rape on Km. Prabha Sharma. Thus, I find that all the three accused had the knowledge that Km. Prabha Sharma was abducted to compel her for marriage against her will and that they also knew that she would be forced to illicit intercourse, I thus find charge under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 366</a> IPC duly proved against all the three accused persons.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">77.\tThe version as narrated by the trial court totally discloses the commission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 366</a> IPC against all the accused persons and charges under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 376</a> IPC against accused Haneef were found proved.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">78.\tLearned counsel for the State has submitted that the prosecution has been able to establish the role of accused Haneef in committing the offence mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 376</a> IPC in addtion to the offence under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 366</a> IPC and acquittal of accused Haneef under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 376</a> IPC is perverse and against the records and appellant Haneef will also be convicted and sentenced under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 376</a> IPC.

State of Karnataka MANU/SC/7108/2007 : (2007) 4 SCC 415, this Court culled out the general principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal. The said principles are enumerated below:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">(1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">(2) The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_127\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">(3) Various expressions, such as, &#x27;substantial and compelling reasons&#x27;, &#x27;good and sufficient grounds&#x27;, &#x27;very strong circumstances&#x27;, &#x27;distorted conclusions&#x27;, &#x27;glaring mistakes&#x27;, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of &#x27;flourishes of language&#x27; to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">(4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the Accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">(5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">85. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035123\" id=\"span_71\">In <a href=\"/doc/1035123/\" id=\"a_128\">Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade</a> (supra), taking note of the contemporary context, the Court held:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">....The dangers of exaggerated devotion to the Rule of benefit of doubt at the expense of social defence and to the soothing sentiment that all acquittals are always good regardless of justice to the victim and the community, demand especial emphasis in the contemporary context of escalating crime and escape. The judicial instrument has a public accountability. The cherished principles or golden thread of proof beyond reasonable doubt which runs through the web of our law should not be stretched morbidly to embrace every hunch, hesitancy and degree of doubt. The excessive solicitude reflected in the attitude that a thousand guilty men may go but one innocent martyr shall not suffer is a false dilemma. Only reasonable doubts belong to the accused. Otherwise any practical system of justice will then break down and lose credibility with the community. The evil of acquitting a guilty person light heartedly as a learned Author1 has sapiently observed, goes much beyond the simple fact that just one guilty person has gone unpunished. If unmerited acquittals become general, they tend to lead to a cynical disregard of the law, and this in turn leads to a public demand for harsher legal presumptions against indicted &quot;persons&quot; and more severe punishment of those who are found guilty. Thus, too frequent acquittals of the guilty may lead to a ferocious penal law, eventually eroding the judicial protection of the guiltless. For all these reasons it is true to say, with Viscount Simon, that &quot;a miscarriage of justice may arise from the acquittal of the guilty no less than from the conviction of the innocent....&quot; In short, our jurisprudential enthusiasm for presumed innocence must be moderated by the pragmatic need to make criminal justice potent and realistic.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_97\">86.\tLearned counsel for the State has submitted that when the accused Haneef himself had admitted the commission of rape in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., while he had stated voluntarily that the victim was major and voluntarily flew away from her house and presented an application before Ram Autar Advocate for marriage who verified it, it means that the appellant Haneef had all those relations which are said to be relations of marriage. Learned court below has discussed it in detail and also came to the conclusion that this paper has not been proved nor admissible in evidence and also not a certificate of marriage. Further the concerned Advocate was not authorized by any competent authority to issue such a certificate. Learned counsel for the State has further submitted that the incident as narrated in the statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. and the documents which were produced by the defence are admission of the fact that the appellant Haneef had taken away the victim and committed sexual offence within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 376</a> IPC and she was forced to put her signature to marry or to had sexual intercourse within the definition of an offence as mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 376</a> IPC. Since this paper is not admissible nor proved thus the Court cannot presume it as a certificate of marriage.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">89.\tIt is a settled principle of law that the statement made by the accused under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. can be used by the Court to the extent that it is in line with the case of the prosecution. The same cannot be the sole basis for convicting an accused. In the present case, the statement of accused before the Court, to some extent, falls in line with the case of the prosecution and to that extent, the case of the prosecution can be substantiated and treated as correct by the Court. The legislative intent behind this section appears to have twin objects. Firstly, to provide an opportunity to the accused to explain the circumstances appearing against him. Secondly, for the Court to have an opportunity to examine the accused and to elicit an explanation from him, which may be free from the fear of being trapped for an embarrassing admission or statement.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">90.\tThe proper methodology to be adopted by the Court while recording the statement of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. is to invite the attention of the accused to the circumstances and substantial evidence in relation to the offence, for which he has been charged and invite his explanation. In other words, it provides an opportunity to an accused to state before the Court as to what is the truth and what is his defence, in accordance with law. It was for the accused to avail of that opportunity and if he fails to do so then it is for the Court to examine the case of the prosecution on its evidence with reference to the statement made by the accused under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">91.\tIn Hate Singh Bhagat Singh vs. State of Madhya Bharat [AIR1953 SC 468], while dealing with Section 342 of the old <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_135\">Cr.P.C</a>. equivalent to Section 313 of the present <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_136\">Cr.P.C</a>. observed that answer of the accused given can be used in other enquiries or trials for other offences.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">92.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134973229\" id=\"span_72\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/134973229/\" id=\"a_137\">Narayan Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> [(1963) 3 SCR 678 a Three Judge Bench of this Court held as under:</span> \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">&quot;Under <a href=\"/doc/697591/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 342</a> of the Cr.P.C. of Criminal Procedure by the first Sub-section, insofar as it is material, the Court may at any stage of the enquiry or trial and after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before the accused is called upon for his defence shall put questions to the accused person for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstance appearing in the evidence against him. Examination under Section 342 is primarily to be directed to those matters on which evidence has been led for the prosecution to ascertain from the accused his version or explanation if any, of the incident which forms the subject matter of the charge and his defence. By Sub-section (3), the answers given by the accused may &quot;be taken into consideration&quot; at the enquiry or the trial. If the accused person in his examination under Section 342 confesses to the commission of the offence charged against him the Court may, relying upon that confession, proceed to convict him, but if he does not confess and in explaining circumstance appearing in the evidence against him sets up his own version and seeks to explain his conduct pleading that he has committed no offence, the statement of the accused can only be taken into consideration in its entirety. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1824507\" id=\"span_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134973229\" id=\"span_74\">93.\tFollowing the law <a href=\"/doc/134973229/\" id=\"a_139\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/134973229/\" id=\"a_140\">Narayan Singh</a>&#x27;s case (supra) the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1824507/\" id=\"a_141\">State of Maharashtra v.

Accused/appellant Haneef has admitted the act of sexual intercourse in his application for bail moved on 21.10.1997 before learned trial court while in paragraph 6 and in other paragraphs he had admitted sexual relations but with the consent while the prosecutrix has denied any consent.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_106\">96.\tLearned State Counsel has contented that there was no consent at all.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">97.\tAccordingly, on the basis of above discussions, learned court below has correctly appreciated the evidence while concluding the finding under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 366</a> IPC against all the appellants but committed error while acquitting accused Haneef from the charges levelled against him under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 376</a> IPC. Perusal of the statement of the victim recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C., the statement on oath before the Court and the papers filed in defence including the contents in the bail application, reveal that there was sexual intercourse by the appellant Haneef. From the date of recovery of and coming out of the hands and clutches of the appellants till the statement is recorded before the Court, she says that she was forcibly taken away and was subjected to sexual intercourse without her consent. Thus, this Court has no option but to hold that the accused/appellant Haneef is also found guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 376</a> IPC and according to the propositions of law as laid down above, the accused Haneef can be sentenced appropriately in accordance with law.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_108\">98.\tLearned counsel for the appellants has further submitted that the main role while committing the offence has been assigned to appellant Haneef. The role of appellant no.2 Smt. Khatoon and appellant no.3 Rashid is stated to be taking the victim into the room or locking into the room and thus a lenient view should be taken on the point of sentence with regard to appellant nos. 2 and 3.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">99.\tThis Court is of the view that under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 366</a> IPC it would suffice the purpose of law if they are punished with imprisonment of one year with fine of Rs.10,000/- each with default stipulation of six months&#x27; imprisonment. In addition to above, accused/appellant Haneef is also found guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 376</a> IPC and it would meet the ends of justice if he is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of  five years with fine of Rs.10,000/- with default stipulation of one years&#x27; imprisonment. Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed. The conviction of appellants Haneef, Smt. Khatoon and Rashid under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 366</a> IPC is confirmed but the sentence is modified and they are punished with imprisonment of one year with  fine of Rs.10,000/- each with default stipulation of six months&#x27; imprisonment. The acquittal of accused/appellant Haneef from charges under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 376</a> IPC is set-aside. He is also found guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 376</a> IPC and is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of  five years with fine of Rs.10,000/- with default stipulation of one years&#x27; imprisonment. All the sentences shall run concurrently. Out of the fine amount so deposited, 50% of the same shall be paid to the victim. Appellants are on bail. Their bail is cancelled. Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate is directed to take the appellants into custody forthwith to serve out the sentence.
