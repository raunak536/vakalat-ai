This petition manifests the conflict which may arise between\n\nmatrimonial bliss and the call of duty in the armed forces because of\n\nthe requirement of a serving personnel having to serve at locations far\n\nremoved from her/his matrimonial home or the restrictions on\n\nmovement even though there may be no separation by location.         It\n\ndraws attention to the urgent necessity of balancing personal and\n\nprofessional lives of the defence personnel and raises issues of the\n\nnature of the right to marriage and infringement of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nright to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> and violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India by the respondents by the manner of rejection of\n\nher application for resignation from service.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">     WP (C) No.166/2010                         Page No.1 of 55</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> 2.    Captain Mrs. Krishna, the petitioner herein, took admission in the\n\nB.Sc. (Nursing) course at the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, in\n\n1997 which she successfully completed in June, 2001. The petitioner\n\ngot her permanent commission in the Indian Army on 7th June, 2001 in\n\nthe Military Nursing Service (&#x27;MNS&#x27; hereafter). By dint of her service,\n\nshe was subsequently promoted to the rank of Captain as Nursing\n\nOfficer in the service. It is on record that from the 7 th of June, 2001 to\n\nthe 10th of September, 2001, the petitioner was posted at the CH (SC),\n\nPune; and thereafter from the 14th of September, 2001 to the 9th of\n\nJune, 2005 was posted at CH (NC) C/O 56 APO. From 10th June, 2005\n\ntill the passing of the impugned order, the petitioner remained posted\n\nat the Military Hospital, Roorkee, Uttranchal as Nursing Officer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">3.    On the 10th of December, 2004, the petitioner is stated to have\n\nmarried one Shri Rajeev Vishwakarma in accordance with Hindu\n\ncustoms and traditions. From this wedlock, on the 23rd of September,\n\n2005, the parties were blessed with a daughter who is presently aged\n\nabout five years.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">4.    So far as the matrimonial home of the petitioner is concerned,\n\nher husband is stated to be employed with the Bharat Heavy Electrical\n\nLimited (BHEL) located at Ranipur, Haridwar.         After marriage, for\n\nsometime the petitioner stayed with her husband at BHEL, Ranipur,\n\nHaridwar. However, on account of the distance between her place of\n\nresidence and posting as well as service requirements, the petitioner\n\nhas not been able to spend much time in the matrimonial home. The\n\npetitioner submits that after the birth of their daughter, her husband\n\nasked her to stay permanently with him along with their daughter and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">     WP (C) No.166/2010                          Page No.2 of 55</span>\n called upon her to resign from service. He expressed objection to the\n\nseparation necessitated by her job requirements. The pressures of the\n\nservice thus resulted in stress and strain on the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nmatrimonial life.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">5.    In view of the ensuing turmoil and expressing inability to tolerate\n\nthe same any further, on the 5th of September, 2008, the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nhusband filed a petition seeking dissolution of their marriage by\n\ndecree of divorce under <a href=\"/doc/1151479/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 13(1)(i)(a)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act,\n\n1955. This petition is premised, inter alia, on the ground that it was\n\nagreed by the parties before marriage that after its solemnization, the\n\npetitioner shall resign from service.     The petitioner&#x27;s husband has\n\nmade a grievance that she is not performing her matrimonial duties; is\n\nnot residing permanently with him and is not resigning from her job.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">He has also complained in his petition that thereby he has been\n\ndeprived of wedded bliss and that not only he has to cook his own\n\nfood and cope with a separation from his wife but is compelled to\n\nendure a separation also from his daughter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">6.    The petitioner&#x27;s husband contends that service compulsions have\n\nnecessitated the separation of the petitioner from her husband and\n\ninduced dejection and loneliness in him and he is desperate to end\n\nthis kind of an arrangement.      In this background, the petitioner is\n\nfaced with the twin alternatives of either resigning from service or\n\ndissolving her marriage from her husband by a decree of divorce.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">7.    On account of this predicament coupled with the extreme\n\nemotional strife in her life, the petitioner submits that she is unable to\n\nconcentrate on her duties and to give her best in service. Physically\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">     WP (C) No.166/2010                         Page No.3 of 55</span>\n and mentally strained, the petitioner submits that the continuous\n\nstress and tension have also resulted in the deterioration of her health\n\nand as a result, she is now suffering from thalasemia minor.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      The writ petitioner has stated that she does not want divorce\n\nunder any circumstance and wants an opportunity to end the\n\nacrimony and discord in her matrimonial life. In this background, she\n\nsought time from her husband to process her resignation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">8.    The petitioner states that, in view of all these facts, she had no\n\noption but to make an application on 8th November, 2008 to the\n\nCommandant, MH Roorkee seeking permission to apply for resignation\n\nfrom commission on the above grounds.               Our attention has been\n\ndrawn to the recommendations on this application by the Principal\n\nMatron dated 10th November, 2008; the Registrar of the hospital dated\n\n10th November, 2008 as well as the recommendations of the\n\nCommandant of the Military Hospital, Roorkee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">9.    After   obtaining   such    permission   to    resign,   the    petitioner\n\nsubmitted an application for resignation in the form prescribed in the\n\nannexure-1     to appendix       `A&#x27; of   the Army     Headquarters       letter\n\nno.B/70030/DGMS-4A        dated    31st   December,     1999,     which     was\n\nregistered as no.11048/Retire/Nur(o)/2008 dated 16th December, 2008\n\nand also referred to as letter no.340023/M-F 25 dated 5th January,\n\n2009.    The petitioner furnished the requisite information, enclosing\n\ntherewith a copy of the divorce petition, her medical records as well as\n\nall requisite undertakings including the undertaking that she had not\n\nattended any course involving an obligatory period of service during\n\nthe last five years. The petitioner also submitted the certificate with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">     WP (C) No.166/2010                             Page No.4 of 55</span>\n the application in terms of appendix `B&#x27; to the Army Headquarter\n\nletter dated 31st December, 1999 to the effect that she had not been\n\nallotted a PPO number by the CDA (P) and had not drawn any amount\n\non    account     of   pensionary   awards   including   pension    and   an\n\nundertaking to pay amounts, if any, due to the Government before she\n\nwas relieved of her duties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">10.    As the petitioner did not hear anything on the fate of her\n\nresignation letter despite the passage of eight months, she addressed\n\na letter dated 18th August, 2009 to the Commandant of the Military\n\nHospital, Roorkee to know about the status of her resignation citing\n\nthe problems stated in her request on account of which she would not\n\nbe able to join her duties again. She requested the commandant to\n\nsend a reminder to the authorities concerned with regard to her\n\nresignation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">11.    In the meantime, a communication dated 17th August, 2009 was\n\nissued by the Integrated Headquarters of the MOD (Army), Adjutant\n\nGeneral&#x27;s Branch of the Director General of Medical Services (Army),\n\nNew Delhi addressed to the Headquarters of the Central Command\n\n(Med), informing that the petitioner&#x27;s request for resignation was\n\nrejected on the following grounds:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              &quot;..................the nursing  officer   had     sought\n              resignation on the ground of marital disharmony\n              leading to filing of divorce petition by her spouse.\n              From the perusal of the contents of the petition, it is\n              revealed that reasons for filing of court case is not\n              merely the service of the nursing officer but also the\n              ill treatment to her-in-laws by the nursing officer. In\n              the petition her spouse has also alleged that the\n              nursing officer is least interested in staying with him.\n              Therefore, even her resignation from service will not\n              resolve their marital disharmony. Hence her request\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                          Page No.5 of 55</span>\n               for resignation from service has not been acceded\n              to.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">12.    The petitioner was informed of the rejection of this request under\n\ncover of a letter dated 31st August, 2009 issued by Shri A.S. Rathor,\n\nColonel Sr. Registrar &amp; OC TPS for Commandant and was called upon\n\nto join her unit. It was also informed that sixty days furlough leave\n\nhad been sanctioned to her w.e.f. 8th September, 2009 and that an\n\norder dated 17th August, 2009 posting her to 7 AFH had been received.\n\nThis movement was required to be implemented by 19th October,\n\n2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">13.    Aggrieved by the rejection of her request for resignation from\n\nservice as well as by order of her posting, the petitioner has filed the\n\npresent writ petition seeking quashing of the order dated 17th August,\n\n2009 with a direction to the respondents to accept her application for\n\nresignation and to discharge her from military service.\n\nPetitioner&#x27;s contentions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">14.    In support of her writ petition, the petitioner has placed reliance\n\non      the    instructions   issued   for   applying     for      premature\n\nretirement/resignation from commission for Nursing Officers as are\n\nprovided in appendix `A&#x27; to the Army Headquarters letter No.B-\n\n70030/DGMS-4A dated 31st December, 1999.            It is contended that\n\nthese army instructions govern processing and consideration of\n\napplications seeking to resign from service of members of the Military\n\nNursing Service.      The petitioner contends that having regard to the\n\nstated reasons, the respondents had no discretion at all thereunder so\n\nfar as consideration of her application was concerned and were bound\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                         Page No.6 of 55</span>\n to have granted the same.         The primary submission is that the\n\nrejection is arbitrary, is based on irrelevant considerations and fails to\n\nconsider the relevant material.       The challenge to her posting is\n\npremised on the illegality attributed to this rejection.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">15.    The petitioner has contended that her request for voluntary\n\nresignation falls under clause 4(b)(v)(aa) of the said instructions. It\n\nhas been urged that the petitioner has been compelled to put in her\n\nrequest for voluntary resignation on the ground of extreme marital\n\ndiscord which she is facing due to her employment.           The petitioner\n\nmakes a grievance that the order violates her right to life, privacy and\n\ndignity guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">16.    The petitioner has explained that on account of the exigency of\n\nservice, she is unable to continuously cohabit with her husband. Her\n\ninability to fulfil her marital obligations is putting extreme pressure on\n\nher marriage so much so that her husband has filed a petition for\n\ndivorce.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"964598\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"790887\" id=\"span_8\">In support of the prayer made in the writ petition, learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court in (<a href=\"/doc/790887/\" id=\"a_5\">1990) 4 SCC 27 J.K. Cotton Spinning and Weaving\n\nMills Company Ltd. Vs. State of UP &amp; Ors.</a> and the          pronouncements\n\nof this court reported at 1996 (1) SLR 505 : 1995 (59) DLT 573 Major\n\nRahul Shukla Vs.

Union of India</a>.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">17.    The submission is    that the respondents were bound by the\n\nafore-noticed instructions and could not have rejected the application\n\non any ground other than those stipulated thereunder.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                         Page No.7 of 55</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\"> 18.    It is further contended that in the judicial pronouncements afore-\n\nnoticed, the courts have held that the respondents were entitled to\n\nkeep in view service exigencies and inability to make immediate\n\nalternative arrangements in consideration.         However, even in such\n\neventuality,     the   respondents   had   no   jurisdiction   to    reject   an\n\napplication seeking to resign from service, but, had to keep the\n\ndecision thereon it in abeyance till such time alternative arrangements\n\nare made. In this background, the petitioner has assailed the order\n\ndated 17th August, 2009 contending that the order is arbitrary,\n\nirrational and contrary to the binding instructions and guidelines read\n\nwith the applicable law and is therefore also violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 14</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India. The petitioner contends that unlike a prayer\n\nfor voluntary retirement which is fettered by several riders and\n\ndiscretion lies with the competent authority to accept or reject the\n\nsame but a request for resignation has to be treated on a differential\n\nfooting as the discretionary power vested in the authorities for a\n\ndecision on an application for resignation is limited and circumscribed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">       It has also been urged that the petitioner is not bound by any\n\nbond or undertaking which would compel her to continue in service.\n\nRespondent&#x27;s submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">19.    The writ petition is vehemently opposed by Mr. Jatan Singh,\n\nlearned Standing Counsel for the respondents who contends that the\n\npetitioner has no absolute right to acceptance of her prayer for\n\nresignation or premature release from the Army. It is urged that such\n\nrequest is required to be considered by the Government and\n\ndiscretion in this regard lies with the respondents in terms of Section\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                           Page No.8 of 55</span>\n 11 of the Military Nursing Service Ordinance 1943 (`MNS Ordinance&#x27;\n\nhereafter) which stands elaborated by para 105(f) of the Defence\n\nService Regulations (Vol.1) 1987.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">20.    It has further been contended that though the policy letter states\n\nthat marital disharmony shall be considered as one of the grounds for\n\nsympathetic consideration of the request for release from service so\n\nfar as the petitioner was concerned, the competent authority rejected\n\nher application for the reason         that the basic ground for marital\n\ndisharmony is not the separation of the petitioner and her husband\n\nbut their mal-adjustment in personal relations.         In this regard, the\n\nrespondents have extensively quoted from the divorce petition in the\n\ncounter affidavit and in the oral submissions and contended that the\n\napplication of the petitioner was rightly rejected since it was devoid of\n\nany merit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">21.    We may note that as per the respondents, only such applications\n\nfor    resignation    are   accepted   on   marital   grounds   where   the\n\nrespondents feel that the acceptance of the request will provide relief\n\nto the Nursing Officer and that she will thereafter live with her\n\nhusband to lead a happy married life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">Applicable rules\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">22.    Before considering the contentions of the parties on the merits,\n\nwe may consider the applicable rules and instructions governing the\n\nsubject. The respondents have drawn our attention to the contents of\n\nthe Defence Service Regulations Vol. 1, 1987. In this behalf, reliance\n\nhas been placed on para 102 and 104(d) which may be usefully\n\nextracted and read as follows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                          Page No.9 of 55</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             &quot;102.

If the country is a\n        signatory thereto subject of course to the provisions\n        of the domestic law, the International Covenants can\n        be utilized.

It is also    the object, spirit and\n\nintendment of the several laws relating to marriage.             The social\n\nimportance of the family unit as a social institution between persons\n\nof opposite sexes also stands emphasised in several judgments.\n\nPersonal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> would take into its ambit the right to\n\nmarry,      cohabit and socialise with spouse and other members of\n\nfamily. Without such right and opportunity the `family&#x27; as a unit would\n\nbe meaningless and marriage would be an empty shell.                 Thus the\n\nclaimed right of the petitioner to marriage and cohabitation with her\n\nfamily, which is involved in the instant case, is an essential part of her\n\nfundamental right to life guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.

The exercise of the right to marry obviously gives rise to\n\npersonal, social as well as legal consequences. It would be subject to\n\nthe constitutional provisions and the prevailing laws.

However, the limitations thereby must not restrict or\n\nreduce right to such an extent or in such a way that the very existence\n\nof the right is irreparably damaged or permanently impaired.            The\n\ndissolution of marriage by decree of divorce obviously results in\n\ndemolition of the very edifice on which a marital relationship rests.

Albeit, the employee would have\n              to give notice of his intention to snap the existing\n              relationship to enable the employer to make\n              alternative arrangements so that his work does not\n              suffer. The period of notice will depend on the period\n              prescribed by the terms of employment and if no such\n              period is prescribed, a reasonable time must be given\n              before the relationship is determined.

The same\n\nread as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">            &quot;9. There may be substance in the submission of\n            learned counsel for the respondent that the service\n            jurisprudence applicable to the civil services cannot\n            be ipso facto extended and applied to defence\n            services which are a class by themselves and\n            therein considerations of secrecy, and of safety,\n            security and sovereignty of the country have vital\n            role to play enabling personal interest to be\n            sacrificed for or giving way to the larger interests of\n            the nation. Yet it cannot be forgotten that the\n            persons serving the army are citizens of the country\n            and the authorities in the army are subject to the\n            Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">            10.    Assuming that the right of an army personnel\n            to resign from his commission in army may not be\n            so wide and absolute as it may be in civil services,\n            yet the authorities in the army are bound to follow\n            the regulations of the army and they have to play\n            within the four corners laid down thereby subject to\n            provision of law. A reading of the several provisions\n            of that Section of the Army Manual which deals with\n            the removal resignation and retirement of army\n            personnel, specially the provisions which we have\n            quoted hereinabove, in our opinion, leads to a few\n            inferences. The applications for voluntary retirement\n            or resignation though dealt with on similar footing\n            do not in fact deserve so. While an application\n            seeking voluntary retirement is fettered by several\n            riders and discretion lies with Competent Authority\n            to accept or not to accept the prayer; a prayer for\n            resignation has to be dealt with on different footing\n            as the discretionary power vested in the authorities\n            taking decision on application for resignation is\n            limited and circumscribed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">            11. An application for resignation may be rejected if it is not\n            based on adequate and justifiable reasons. The over-riding\n            consideration is whether the officer&#x27;s continuance in service for\n            a specific period is necessary to meet exigencies in a\n            service and alternative arrangements cannot be\n            made. Even in such a case the application for resignation\n            cannot be rejected. It can only be held in abeyance. In the\n            case at hand it is not the case of the respondent that\n            the facts stated by the petitioner in his application\n            for resignation were false or were not adequate or\n            not justifiable. That finding could not have been\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">    WP (C) No.166/2010                                 Page No.34 of 55</span>\n               arrived at in as much as the Colonel Commanding\n              Officer having personally reviewed the application,\n              was satisfied of the validity thereof. Any higher\n              authority to form an opinion different from the one\n              expressed by the Colonel Commanding Officer must\n              have been possessed of material concrete enough to\n              form a different opinion which it is not so.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">              12. The ground on which the application has been\n              turned down is the necessity of the petitioner\n              continuing in service to meet exigencies .thereof.\n              That cannot be a ground for rejection of the\n              application. It may be a ground for keeping the\n              application in abeyance. Unfortunately on two\n              occasions the grounds available-for keeping the\n              application in abeyance was utilised for rejecting the\n              application.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">              13. The petitioner moved the application for\n              resignation earlier on 22.3.93 and later on 6.6.94.\n              The respondents should have formed an opinion\n              about the period for which the petitioner&#x27;s\n              continuance in service was necessary and how much\n              time it would take to make an alternative\n              arrangement. It is difficult to believe the authorities\n              of the respondents could not have succeeded in\n              making alternative arrangements during the period\n              of over two years by this time and if that be so then\n              it is not a happy reflection on them.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">                                          (Emphasis by us)\n       This court had allowed the above petition and set aside the\n\nimpugned order rejecting the petitioner&#x27;s request for resignation.

This application had been rejected by the\n\nrespondents which order was the subject matter of challenge. In this\n\ncase, the petitioner had placed reliance on policy guidelines dated 20th\n\nJanuary, 1979 governing the consideration of an application for\n\npremature retirement.

So far as the criterion for acceptance of such a request\n\nis concerned, the same is to be found in para 4 of the afore-noticed\n\ninstructions.    `Marital disharmony&#x27; is one of the stated reasons and\n\nhas been put under the category of `Extreme Compassionate\n\nGrounds&#x27;.       The respondents have specifically indicated in these\n\nguidelines that the marital disharmony is required to be manifested by\n\na threat of divorce.

The respondents have rejected the application of the petitioner\n\nreferring to the petitioner&#x27;s conduct as stated in the petition and\n\nfurther that her husband has alleged that the petitioner was least\n\ninterested in staying with him. The respondents have concluded that\n\nthe reason for filing the divorce case was not merely the service of the\n\nnursing officer and that her resignation from service will not resolve\n\ntheir marital disharmony and therefore rejected her application.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">75.

Such\n\nconsiderations are also statutorily recognized in some of the statutes.\n\nThe cultural background and sociological evolution would show that\n\nmarriage as an institution in this country is placed on the highest\n\npedestal. The importance of its preservation does stand recognised in\n\nseveral legislations and by all religions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">76.      <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_81\">The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a> which is concerned with\n\nmarriages between hindus provides for dissolution of marriage by\n\ndecree of divorce on certain grounds which have been set out in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 13</a> of the enactment.

Such being the statutory\n\nspirit, intendment and purpose, it would be the mandatory duty of\n\nevery court or authority who could effect a reconciliation between\n\nwarring spouses, to facilitate the same. These matters are required to\n\nbe considered by courts sensitively with a human angle.

Ahmed, J on a detailed\n\nexamination of the Muslim law held that Islam discourages divorce,\n\nyet it is permissible on grounds of pragmatism, at the core of which is\n\nthe concept of an irretrievably broken marriage. The court reiterated\n\nthe observations of Baharul Islam, J (then in the Gauhati High Court) in\n\nSri Jiauddin vs. Mrs. Anwara Begum (1981) 1 GLR 358 wherein\n\nnecessity of reconciliation was recognised.

For\n\nthis reason, the legislation and jurisprudence which has evolved,\n\nemphasise that the same deserves to be brought to an end. An effort\n\nfor reconciliation may result in the parties burying their differences\n\nand agreeing to live together.      Or they may agree to, disagree and\n\npart.

The instructions dated 31st December, 1999 issued by the\n\nrespondents      are   in   consonance   with   the spirit   of   the above\n\ninternational covenants and jurisprudence.           They encompass the\n\nspecial needs and strains which a marriage may face on account of\n\nthe rigors of service with the armed forces.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">       It is clearly evident that the ground of marital discord recognised\n\nin para 4(b)(v)(aa) of the said instructions dated 31st December, 1999\n\nis a reflection on the recognition of the right to marriage and the\n\naforenoticed principles by the respondents and the importance given\n\nby the armed forces also to the institution of marriage. This is clearly\n\nin consonance with the recognition of such right nationally and\n\ninternationally. The respondents recognise the importance of bringing\n\nmarital discord to an end.          The instructions also indicate the\n\nawareness about the possible need of cohabitation to nurture a\n\nmarriage.

For these reasons, the instructions\n\non the subject have provided that filing of a divorce petition would be\n\nconsidered as an extreme compassionate ground to justify the\n\nseverance of the ties of employment with the armed forces, so as to\n\nfurther possible preservation or amicable resolution and dissolution of\n\nbonds of another kind.       The aforenoticed Instructions thus manifest\n\nthe high degree of protection to the families of the members of the\n\nMNS which is accorded by the respondents.

The aspiration and desire of the petitioner to make an effort to\n\nresolve disputes and cohabit with her husband and daughter as a\n\nfamily by itself deserves to be protected and encouraged. It is a fact\n\nthat her employment is not only interfering with the same, but has\n\nbecome a root cause of such discord and is exposing the petitioner to\n\na threat of severance of her matrimonial ties on account of dissolution\n\nof her marriage by a decree of divorce. This manifests the essential\n\nand immediate need of taking such measures which could facilitate\n\nrapprochement and restoration of harmony in the petitioner&#x27;s family\n\nlife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">90.      We find that the valid criterion for the favourable consideration\n\nof a request for resignation and the limits within which the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">        WP (C) No.166/2010                        Page No.43 of 55</span>\n respondents would exercise discretion to consider such an application\n\nare stipulated under the said instructions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"4697683\" id=\"span_71\">In <a href=\"/doc/4697683/\" id=\"a_90\">Major Rahul Shukla Vs.\n\nUnion     of   India   &amp;    Ors.</a>   (supra),   it has been stated that the\n\ncontingencies stated in similar instructions are merely illustrative and\n\nnot exhaustive. It has been held that the same, however, do bind the\n\nrespondents to consider a request for resignation on the grounds\n\nstated in the illustration.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">91.    The respondents have not rejected the petitioner&#x27;s application on\n\nany consideration relating to non-availability of adequate manpower in\n\nthe category of officers in which the petitioner is employed.           No\n\nexigency of service, let alone any extremity is even suggested in the\n\nimpugned order. The respondents have not disputed the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nstatement that she has not given any bond and that she is not\n\nshackled by any service liability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">92.    On the factual aspect, It is also not disputed that the petitioner\n\nhas a daughter who was an infant in the year 2005. The respondents\n\nalso do not dispute that the petitioner&#x27;s husband has filed a petition\n\nseeking divorce.           In this background, the petitioner&#x27;s request for\n\nresignation in the admitted facts clearly falls within the criterion <a href=\"/doc/4697683/\" id=\"a_91\">laid\n\ndown in</a> para 4(b)(v)(aa) of `marital disharmony&#x27; and appears to be\n\ncovered within the nature of Extreme Compassionate Grounds\n\nmentioned in the instructions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">93.    An issue has been raised with regard to the parameters within\n\nwhich the respondents can examine the contents of the divorce\n\npetition which is mentioned in the applicable instructions. Even\n\nassuming that the respondents could examine the grounds on which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                            Page No.44 of 55</span>\n the divorce petition has been filed, perusal of the opening paragraph\n\nof the divorce petition shows that the petitioner&#x27;s husband has\n\nreferred to      the pre-nuptial agreement between the parties to the\n\neffect that after the marriage, she would resign from service.               A\n\ngrievance is made by him against the petitioner shifting to the official\n\nquarters.       This   was   obviously   in order   to meet      the service\n\nrequirements, its nature and demands.        The petitioner&#x27;s husband has\n\nexpressed distress because of his separation from the petitioner and\n\nhe complains in the petition that he is not only compelled to live far\n\nfrom his wife and daughter, but as a result is having to do his own\n\ncooking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">94.    The failure to have resigned from service has been perceived by\n\nher husband as an extreme ambition on the part of the petitioner and\n\na dream not fulfilled by her marriage.       The allegations made in the\n\ndivorce petition thus may very well be an erroneous construction or\n\nmisunderstanding on the part of the petitioner&#x27;s husband. As noticed\n\nhereinabove, the petitioner was posted at Roorkee, which may be\n\nconsidered as close to Haridwar.          However, the impugned order\n\ndiscloses that the petitioner stands posted out therefrom.             It is on\n\nrecord that while posted as Roorkee, the petitioner had to reside in\n\nofficial quarters.     It cannot be disputed that continuation in military\n\nservice warrants separation from her husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">95.    It would also appear that the petitioner&#x27;s submission with regard\n\nto the constraints in leaving her job, has been considered by her\n\nspouse as an incident of cruelty to him.     Every action of the petitioner\n\nis being construed by her husband as an effort to further ambitious\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                            Page No.45 of 55</span>\n desires which perception has resulted in a prayer for dissolution of the\n\nmarriage by a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty on the part\n\nof the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">96.     This petition seeking dissolution of marriage appears to have\n\nbeen filed by the petitioner&#x27;s husband on 5th September, 2008. The\n\npetitioner&#x27;s application for permission to apply for resignation was\n\nmade only on 8th November, 2008 which would be indicative of the\n\nfact that the divorce action is not collusive and does not appear to\n\nhave been created or urged as a shield and device to seek resignation\n\nfrom service. We may note that the petitioner&#x27;s resignation manifests\n\nher desire to make an effort to restore some order to her matrimonial\n\nlife. It also displays a lack of ambition as against a desire to restore\n\nnormalcy to her matrimonial life with her husband.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">97.    The petitioner has urged that her husband has clearly indicated\n\nthat she must resign from service or divorce him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_128\">98.    The respondents in the instant case, do not dispute the existence\n\nof marital disharmony in the marriage of the petitioner.          On the\n\ncontrary, the respondents place reliance on the averments in the\n\ndivorce petition filed by the petitioner&#x27;s husband. The impugned order\n\nreflects that a subjective picking of the allegations against the\n\npetitioner by her husband has been effected without taking a\n\ncomprehensive view in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">99.    The impugned order does not manifest any effort by the\n\nrespondents for reconciliation or resolution of the grievance expressed\n\nby the petitioner&#x27;s husband.    It makes no reference at all to the fact\n\nthat the petitioner&#x27;s husband refers to his desire for cohabitation with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">      WP (C) No.166/2010                       Page No.46 of 55</span>\n his wife. The order also does not refer to grievance of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nhusband in more than one place with regard to the failure of the\n\npetitioner to resign from service and that he is thus compelled to live\n\naway from his wife and daughter because of the same.                The\n\nrespondents have erred in failing to consider that the primary\n\nallegations against the petitioner is her husband&#x27;s contention about\n\nher refusal to resign from service and the impact of the consequent\n\nseparation. The other allegations really arise out of the pressures of\n\nthe kind of existence which is thereby enforced.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">100. From the above, it would appear that the criterion in the\n\ninstructions dated 31st December, 1999 are also premised on a\n\npresumption of inability of a serving personnel to give the essential\n\nhundred per cent to the service if he/she is faced with a divorce\n\npetition.   The prescribed criteria in the binding instructions, clearly\n\naccepts that continuation in service may be one of the attributes of or\n\na contributory factor for marital disharmony.      A threat of divorce\n\nevidenced by the filing of a case for the same has been prescribed as\n\nsufficient for a favourable consideration of a request for resignation.\n\nThe imperative nature of such ground is manifested from the fact that\n\nthe respondents have placed the same under the category captioned\n\nas &quot;Extreme Compassionate Grounds&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_131\">101. It is important to note that the criterion laid down under the\n\ninstructions do not stipulate that continuation in service must be the\n\nground for the marital disharmony or the only ground on which the\n\ndivorce petition must rest.    On the contrary, a threat of divorce is\n\nperceived as sufficient reason for favourable consideration of an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">    WP (C) No.166/2010                         Page No.47 of 55</span>\n application for resignation from service.      The instructions presume\n\nthat being relieved from service is an essential step to reduce marital\n\ndisputes.    The instructions do not refer to either the nature of\n\nallegations or the result of the divorce action.      In this background, it\n\nmay not be appropriate for the respondents to analyse the grounds on\n\nwhich the petitioner&#x27;s spouse has sought divorce and premise an order\n\non the same, without anything more.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">102. We may point out that it is also not essential that acceptance of\n\na resignation, as in the case in hand, may necessarily put an end to\n\nthe parties&#x27; matrimonial woes.          However, recognition of such an\n\nopportunity to resolve the disputes by acceptance of the resignation\n\nand provision of an opportunity to do so, is an effort to implement and\n\nafford protection to the right to family of every person, the mandate of\n\nthe provisions of the Constitution, the International Covenants and the\n\nspirit of the statutes set out above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">103. There is another aspect to this matter.               The possibility of\n\nfrustration and set back to the afore-noticed statutorily mandated\n\nreconciliation process by the court seized of the matrimonial action\n\nagainst the petitioner which could result from the separation between\n\nthe spouses on account of the posting of the serving spouse, cannot\n\nbe ignored. In the instant case, the divorce litigation is in the court at\n\nHaridwar while the petitioner stands posted out to a distant location.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">104. The    impugned     order   completely        fails   to   consider   the\n\nrecommendations on the application of the petitioner&#x27;s immediate\n\nsuperiors and fails to give any reasons for overruling them.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">105. It has been settled by various previous pronouncements that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">    WP (C) No.166/2010                              Page No.48 of 55</span>\n state or its instrumentalities while implementing their policy and in\n\ndecisions based thereon cannot be unreasonable or arbitrary and\n\nmust be guided by reason.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">106. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168450156\" id=\"span_77\">In a recent judgment of the Supreme Court reported at\n\n<a href=\"/doc/168450156/\" id=\"a_92\">MANU/SC/0476/2010 Sindhu Education Society &amp; Anr. Vs. The Chief\n\nSecretary, Govt. of NCT of Delhi &amp; Ors.</a>, the Supreme Court observed\n\nthat framing a policy is a domain of the Government.         However, the\n\nworking of a government policy has essentially to be done within the\n\nframework of the Constitution &amp; the laws.        The framework of policy\n\nshould be such as to fit in of the Constitutional scheme of our\n\ndemocracy.       It has been held by the court that even when\n\nGovernment changes its policy decision, it is expected to give valid\n\nreasons and act in the larger interest of the entire community rather\n\nthan a section thereof.     In para 66 of the judgment, the Supreme\n\nCourt held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">            &quot;........... It is a settled canon of administrative\n            jurisprudence that state action, must be supported by\n            some valid reasons and should be upon due\n            application of mind. In the affidavits filed on behalf of\n            the state, nothing in this regard could be pointed out\n            and in fact, none was pointed out during the course\n            of arguments. Absence of reasoning and apparent\n            non-application of mind would give colour of\n            arbitrariness to the state action.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">107. The reasons in the impugned order are certainly not valid and\n\nfail to consider the relevant facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">108. The impugned order in the instant case raises yet another\n\nimportant aspect on the right to life of the petitioner. Its impact on the\n\ndignity and privacy, integral and essential components of the right to\n\nlife of the petitioner require to be examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">    WP (C) No.166/2010                           Page No.49 of 55</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\"> 109. Marriage and issues relating thereto are certainly matters\n\ninvolving the core issues of the privacy and dignity of the individual\n\nconcerned which are essentials of the fundamental right to life. We\n\nfind that the impugned order on the other hand has scrutinized the\n\ndivorce petition and reached a conclusion on the merits of the\n\nallegations made therein without even hearing the petitioner&#x27;s side on\n\nthe allegations. The observations in the order would only add to the\n\ndifferences between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">110. The afore-noticed instructions contain clear directions. Yet, the\n\nrespondents have completely misdirected themselves in presuming\n\nthe correctness of the averments, made in the divorce petition against\n\nthe petitioner and deduced that her resignation from service would\n\nnot resolve the marital disharmony in the petitioner&#x27;s marriage. This is\n\ncertainly not the spirit, intendment and purport of the guidelines and\n\ninstructions issued by the respondents.        It is important that the\n\nauthorities must apply the criteria in its true spirit and must not\n\noverlook material points while dealing with the applicability of such\n\nguidelines. In our view, the respondents have limited jurisdiction to go\n\ninto the reasons or grounds on which a petition for dissolution of\n\nmarriage has been filed. The instant case underlines the need of the\n\nworking of the right to marriage and family life so far as the members\n\nof the forces is concerned and the urgency to reflect on the need to\n\nreconcile family and working life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">111. The matter of verification of the allegations in matrimonial\n\nmatters requires sensitive handling. The instructions suggest that the\n\nfactor which is to be verified, is the existence of marital discord in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">    WP (C) No.166/2010                          Page No.50 of 55</span>\n life of the personnel concerned which is manifested by the existence\n\nof a threat of divorce and nothing more. The impugned order certainly\n\nencroaches into matters which are strictly within the confidential\n\nspace occupied by delicate and sensitive disputes between two\n\nspouses and not permitted by the instructions on the subject.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">112. These observations are based only on some of the contents of\n\nthe divorce petition and do not reflect any effort made by the\n\nauthorities to verify the real facts.   The conclusions arrived at by the\n\nrespondents mock at the most private conduct of the petitioner, relate\n\nto issues and allegations of happenings which were within the four\n\nwalls of her home and make public disclosure of the same in the\n\nimpugned order. They certainly degrade and devalue the self worth of\n\nthe petitioner, and hence make an improper intrusion on her privacy\n\nand dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">113. Merely because the respondents had access to the divorce\n\npetition filed by the husband of the petitioner does not permit\n\ncomment on the correctness or tenability of the averments therein by\n\nany person or authority, other than the court before whom it is filed.\n\nEven the decision making by the court has to rest on a trial and\n\nevidence after sincere reconciliation efforts.    The same is subject to\n\ndefence by the other side.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">        To say the least, the observations in the impugned order are not\n\nonly wholly unwarranted but suggest ignorance about human relations\n\nand the requirement of matrimonial adjustments to nurture marital\n\nties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">114. It is evident that the petitioner&#x27;s predicament with regard to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">    WP (C) No.166/2010                           Page No.51 of 55</span>\n choice between her personal and professional life appears to be that\n\nof a person placed between the devil and the deep blue sea.             A\n\nhumanitarian     and     compassionate   view   envisaged      under   the\n\ninstructions in keeping with the constitutional principles was required\n\nto be taken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_148\">115. The impugned order, therefore, certainly tantamounts to a gross\n\nviolation of the privacy and dignity of the petitioner and hence of her\n\nconstitutional right to life guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.     Such order premised on the contents and\n\nevaluation of the merits of allegations in the divorce petition is\n\ncontrary to the spirit, intendment and purpose of the international\n\ninstruments noticed above, the Constitutional provisions, the marriage\n\nlaws of the country as well as the specific Army Instructions noted\n\nabove.    The respondents have also failed to abide by the clear\n\ndirections in Major Rahul Shukla&#x27;s case (supra).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">116. We, therefore, hold that the rejection of the application for\n\nresignation by the respondents is not based on relevant material but is\n\npremised on extraneous grounds. The impugned order is also contrary\n\nto the instructions which govern the subject. The same violates the\n\nrequirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as well and thereby\n\njustifies the interference by this court.   The order of posting of the\n\npetitioner in the given facts and circumstance was unwarranted and\n\nunjust.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">Result\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">117.

Before parting with this case, we may advert to the statutory\n\nrecognition of yet another dispute redressal mechanism which has\n\nfound statutory recognition in <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 89</a> of the Code of Civil\n\nProcedure and has been successfully implemented in the courts in\n\nDelhi. Inter alia, mediation and conciliation have been provided as an\n\nalternate dispute redressal mechanism. This court has pioneered\n\ninstitutionalised mediation mechanisms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">         Long separations, as in the case in hand, are essential having\n\nregard to the size of the work force and nature of duties in the defence\n\nservices. Coping with the separation and bringing up children single\n\nhandedly, while husband and/or wife is on a field posting or away on\n\ntraining and exercises or for any other exigency, is no mean a task.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">        WP (C) No.166/2010                         Page No.53 of 55</span>\n Undoubtedly, the separation involved by the nature of postings and\n\nduties in the armed forces must be putting a strain on the most\n\nundemanding of spouses of the force personnel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">119. In this background, it may perhaps be appropriate that a\n\nmediation and conciliation mechanism is explored and created by the\n\nrespondents to facilitate resolution of disputes and differences, if any,\n\nin the areas of marriage and other related areas. The nature of issues\n\nbetween the parties in the present case clearly suggests that perhaps,\n\nif such a facility was available, the petitioner may not have been\n\nfacing the proceedings which she is now defending.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">120. We may notice that several welfare mechanisms are already in\n\nplace in the defence forces.   It is time that the defence forces also\n\nexplore the institutionalization and putting in place of a formal\n\nmediation and conciliation framework, perhaps even within the\n\nexisting welfare schemes and agencies worked by them, which may\n\nfacilitate dispute resolution, or in any case provide a forum for\n\nventilating grievances of the parties, before they seek dispute\n\nredressal in courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">121. Of course, lest it be said that this court has encroached on their\n\njurisdiction, we hasten to add the examination of such possibility, and\n\nputting it in place, are in the absolute domain of the respondents.
