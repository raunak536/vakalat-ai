Leave granted.\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\">2.     A Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in\n\nC.W.P. No. 8760 of 2009, by orders dated 9.6.2009 and 17.7.2009,\n\nruled that it was in the best interests of a mentally retarded woman\n\nto undergo an abortion. The said woman (name withheld, hereinafter\n\n`victim&#x27;) had become pregnant as a result of an alleged rape that\n\ntook place     while   she   was      an   inmate    at   a   government-run      welfare\n\ninstitution    located     in       Chandigarh.     After     the    discovery    of     her\n\npregnancy, the Chandigarh Administration, which is the respondent in\n\nthis case, had approached the High Court seeking approval for the\n\ntermination of her pregnancy, keeping in mind that in addition to\n\nbeing mentally retarded she was also an orphan who did not have any\n\nparent or guardian to look after her or her prospective child. The\n\nHigh   Court   had   the   opportunity         to   peruse    a     preliminary   medical\n\fopinion and chose to constitute an Expert Body consisting of medical\n\nexperts and a judicial officer for the purpose of a more thorough\n\ninquiry into the facts. In its order dated 9.6.2009, the High Court\n\nframed a comprehensive set of questions that were to be answered by\n\nthe Expert Body. In such cases, the presumption is that the findings\n\nof the Expert Body would be given due weightage in arriving at a\n\ndecision.     However,        in     its    order       dated    17.7.2009       the    High    Court\n\ndirected the termination of the pregnancy in spite of the Expert\n\nBody&#x27;s      findings      which      show       that     the    victim    had     expressed       her\n\nwillingness to bear a child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">3. Aggrieved by these orders, the appellants moved this Court and\n\nthe second appellant - Ms. Tanu Bedi, Adv. appeared in person on\n\n20.7.2009 and sought a hearing on an urgent basis because the woman\n\nin question had been pregnant for more than 19 weeks at that point\n\nof   time.    We    agreed      to    the       same    since    the     statutory       limit    for\n\npermitting the termination of a pregnancy, i.e. 20 weeks was fast\n\napproaching.        We    issued      notice       to    the    Chandigarh       Administration,\n\npursuant to which Mr. Anupam Gupta, Adv. appeared before us and made\n\noral submissions on behalf of the respondent. In the regular hearing\n\nheld   on    21.7.2009,        both        sides    presenting         compelling       reasons    in\n\nsupport of their respective stands. Mr. Colin Gonsalves, Sr. Adv.\n\nalso     appeared        on   behalf       of    an     intervenor       in   support      of     the\n\nChandigarh     Administration&#x27;s              stand.      After    hearing        the    counsel    at\n\nlength we had also considered the opinions of some of the medical\n\nexperts      who    had       previously           examined      the     woman     in    question.\n\nSubsequent     to    the      oral    submissions         made    by    the   counsel      and    the\n\nmedical experts, we had granted a stay on the High Court&#x27;s orders\n\fthereby ruling against the termination of the pregnancy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">4.     The    rationale       behind    our    decision        hinges      on        two        broad\n\nconsiderations. The first consideration is whether it was correct on\n\npart    of   the    High   Court   to    direct    the    termination           of    pregnancy\n\nwithout the consent of the woman in question. This was the foremost\n\nissue since a plain reading of the relevant provision in the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_1\">Medical\n\nTermination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</a> clearly indicates that consent is\n\nan essential condition for performing an abortion on a woman who has\n\nattained the age of majority and does not suffer from any `mental\n\nillness&#x27;. As will be explained below, there is a clear distinction\n\nbetween `mental illness&#x27; and `mental retardation&#x27; for the purpose of\n\nthis statute. The second consideration before us is that even if the\n\nsaid    woman      was   assumed   to    be    mentally       incapable     of       making        an\n\ninformed decision, what are the appropriate standards for a Court to\n\nexercise      `Parens      Patriae&#x27;     jurisdiction?         If   the    intent           was     to\n\nascertain the `best interests&#x27; of the woman in question, it is our\n\nconsidered opinion that the direction for termination of pregnancy\n\ndid not serve that objective. Of special importance is the fact that\n\nat the time of hearing, the woman had already been pregnant for more\n\nthan 19 weeks and there is a medico-legal consensus that a late-term\n\nabortion can endanger the health of the woman who undergoes the\n\nsame.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">5. Before explaining both of the above-mentioned considerations at\n\nlength,      it   will   be   useful    to    present    an     overview    of       the        fact-\n\nsituation which led to the present proceeding. The woman in question\n\nis an orphan who had been abandoned by her parents at an early age\n\nand     subsequently       she   had    been    under     the      guardianship            of     the\n\fMissionaries     of    Charity,       New     Delhi.       Thereafter,         she    had   been\n\nadmitted in the Government Institute for Mentally Retarded Children\n\nlocated in Sector 32, Chandigarh and was later on brought to the\n\n`Nari Niketan&#x27; a welfare institution in Sector 26, Chandigarh. On\n\n13.3.2009,    she     was    shifted    to    `Ashreya&#x27;       -     a       newly    established\n\nwelfare     institution.       Both     `Nari        Niketan&#x27;       and        `Ashreya&#x27;     are\n\ngovernment-run      institutions       run     by    the    Chandigarh         Administration\n\nwhich fall under the administrative control of the Director, Social\n\nWelfare and the Director-Principal, Government Medical College and\n\nHospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh respectively.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">6. On 16.5.2009, a medical social worker and a staff nurse working\n\nat `Ashreya&#x27; observed that the victim was showing signs of nausea\n\nand had complained about pain in her lower abdomen in addition to\n\ndisclosing    the     fact   that   she      had    missed    her       last    two    menstrual\n\nperiods. Acting on their own initiative, the medical social worker\n\nand the staff nurse conducted a pregnancy test with a urine sample\n\nand found it to be positive. Following this development, a medical\n\nboard     consisting    of    two     gynaecologists          and       a    radiologist     was\n\nconstituted    on     18.5.2009.       The    gynaecologists            then    examined     the\n\nvictim in a clinical environment and concluded that she had been\n\npregnant for 8-10 weeks at the time. The radiologist also confirmed\n\nthe fact of pregnancy on the basis of an ultrasound examination and\n\nrecorded a gestation of approximately 9 weeks on the same day.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">7. After the discovery of the pregnancy, the concerned authorities\n\nhad informed the Chandigarh Police who filed FIR No. 155 (dated\n\n18.5.2009) under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 376</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_3\">120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code at\n\nthe Police Station located in Sector 26, Chandigarh. Subsequently,\n\fan    ossification     test     conducted        on   the    victim    on     20.5.2009     had\n\nindicated     her   bone   age    to    be   around     19-20    years.       The   Director-\n\nPrincipal of the GMCH thereafter constituted a three member medical\n\nboard   on    25.5.2009       which    was   headed     by    the     Chairperson     of    the\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry in the said hospital. Their task was to\n\nevaluate the mental status of the victim and they opined that the\n\nvictim&#x27;s condition was that of `mild mental retardation&#x27;. Thereafter\n\nanother multi-disciplinary medical board was constituted by the same\n\nauthority     which    consisted       of    a   gynaecologist,        a     radiologist,     a\n\npaediatrician and a psychiatrist. This board was asked `to submit\n\nits     considered opinion as to the consequences of continuation of\n\npregnancy and the capability of the victim to cope with the same&#x27;.\n\nBoard&#x27;s opinion was submitted on 27.5.2009, which recommended the\n\ntermination of the victim&#x27;s pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">8. Since there was no clear statutory basis for proceeding with the\n\nabortion,     the   Chandigarh        Administration         moved    the    High   Court    of\n\nPunjab and Haryana seeking a judicial opinion on the said matter. In\n\nits   order   dated    9.6.2009        the   High     Court    had    taken    note   of    the\n\nopinion given by the multi-disciplinary medical board on 27.5.2009.\n\nHowever, as a measure of abundant caution the High Court directed\n\nthe authorities to constitute an Expert Body consisting of medical\n\nexperts and framed a set of questions to be answered by this Body.\n\nThe High Court stressed on the need for ensuring that this Expert\n\nBody would be independent from the administrative control or any\n\nform of influence by the Chandigarh Administration. The intention\n\nwas that the Expert Body&#x27;s findings would enable the High Court to\n\nascertain     the     `best    interests&#x27;        of    the    woman     in    question.      In\n\fpursuance of these directions, the Director of the Post Graduate\n\nInstitute      of    Medical   Education      and    Research     (PGIMER),    Chandigarh\n\nconstituted             an          expert           body          comprising             of\n\n(1)    Dr.    Ajit    Awasthi,     Department       of   Psychiatry    (2)    Dr.     Savita\n\nKumari,       Department     of    Internal     Medicine     (3)    Dr.     Vanita     Jain,\n\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and (4) Dr. Meenu Singh,\n\nDepartment of Paediatrics. The High Court had also directed Smt. Raj\n\nRahul Garg, Additional District and Sessions Judge, Chandigarh to\n\nact as the member-cum-coordinator of the Expert Body.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">9. At this juncture, it would be pertinent to refer to the Expert\n\nBody&#x27;s findings which were duly recorded by the High Court in its\n\norder dated 17.7.2009. The text of the same is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Question framed by High Court in its order dated 9.6.2009 in C.W.P.\n\n8760 of 2009\n\nExpert Body&#x27;s findings\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)The mental condition of the retardee\n\nShe suffers from mild to moderate mental retardation\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(ii)    Her    mental    and      physical    condition     and    ability     for     self-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">sustenance\n\nA case of mild to moderate mental retardation,\n\nPregnant: Single live foetus corresponding to 13 weeks 3 days +/- 2\n\nweeks, Post-operative scars for spinal surgery, HbsAG positive.\n\n\n\nHer    mental       status   affects    her     ability     for    independent        socio-\n\noccupational         functioning      and     self-sustenance.

However,\n\nshe has adequate physical capacity to bear and raise a child.\n\nShe is a case of mild to moderate mental retardation which often\n\nlimits the mental capacity to bear and raise a child in the absence\n\nof adequate social support and supervision\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">(vi) Her perception about bringing up a child and the role of an\n\nideal mother\n\nShe has grossly limited perception about bringing up a child and the\n\nrole of an ideal mother\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">(vii)    Does   she   believe   that    she   has   been   impregnated   through\n\nunvolunteered sex?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">She has a limited understanding of the sexual act and relationship\n\fand even the concept of getting pregnant.

She is happy with\n\nthe idea that she has a baby inside her and looks forward to seeing\n\nthe same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">(ix) Is there any risk of injury to the physical or mental health of\n\nthe victim on account of her present foreseeable environment?\n\nHer internal environment of pregnancy does not pose any particular\n\nrisk of injury to the physical health of the victim. Her mental\n\nhealth can be further affected by the stress of bearing and raising\n\na child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">Her external environment in terms of her place of stay and the\n\nsupport available thereof is difficult to comment on because of our\n\nlack of familiarity with the same. She definitely needs a congenial\n\nand supportive environment for her as well as for the safety of the\n\npregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">(x) Is there any possibility of exerting undue influence through any\n\nmeans on the decision-making capability of the victim?\n\nHer   mental   state   indicates   high   suggestibility   because   of   her\n\nreliance on rote memory and imitative behaviour for learning. Being\n\nhighly suggestible her decision-making can be easily influenced.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">(xi) Do the overall surroundings provide reasonable space to the\n\nvictim to indulge in independent thinking process and take firm\n\ndecisions on the issues vital to her life prospects?\n\fWe are not familiar with her overall surroundings, hence unable to\n\ncomment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">(xii)    What   is    the      possible    nature    of   the    major   spinal       surgery\n\nalleged to have been undergone by the victim during her childhood?\n\nDoes it directly or indirectly relate to the bony abnormalities of\n\nthe   victim?      Can    such    abnormalities      have    a   genetic      basis    to   be\n\ninherited by the baby?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">As per the neurosurgeon, spinal surgery during childhood could have\n\nbeen due to neural tube defect or spinal cord tumour. This could\n\nhave been confirmed by MRI tests, but the same could not be carried\n\nthrough as those were considered to be potentially hazardous for the\n\nfoetus. There        is   no     history    /   records     available    for   the     spinal\n\nsurgery, hence, the safety profile issues relevant for the patient\n\nundergoing MRI like the possibility of use of any mental screws to\n\nfix the spine wherein MRI can be hazardous cannot be definitely\n\ncommented upon in this case. The neural tube defect in the patient\n\ncan lead to an increased chance of neural tube defect in the baby.\n\nHowever, these defects can be detected by blood tests of the mother\n\nand ultrasound. Presence of neural tube defect in the parent is not\n\nan indication for termination of pregnancy. It is not possible to\n\ncomment on the inheritance of spinal cord tumours without knowing\n\nthe exact nature of the tumour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">(xiii) Is there a genuine possibility of certain complications like\n\nchances of abortion, anaemia, hypertension, prematurity, low birth\n\nweight     baby,     foetal      distress       including    chances     of    anaesthetic\n\ncomplications, if the victim in the present case is permitted to\n\ncarry on the pregnancy?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">\fThe    possibility        of    complications        like   abortion,     hypertension,\n\nprematurity, low birth weight baby and foetal distress are similar\n\nto any pregnancy in a woman of this age group.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">\n\nDue to the spinal abnormality and gait defect she has a higher\n\nchance         of     operative        delivery      and    associated         anaesthetic\n\ncomplications. Spinal and gait abnormalities are not an indication\n\nfor termination of pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">\n\nPregnancy in women with Hepatitis B surface antigen positive status\n\nis    usually       uneventful.    The    prenatal      transmission   from     mother   to\n\ninfant can be prevented by giving immunoprophylaxis to the neonate.\n\nAcute or chronic Hepatitis B infection during pregnancy is not an\n\nindication for termination of pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">(xiv) What can be the most prudent course to be followed in the best\n\ninterest of the victim?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">Her physical status poses no major physical contraindications to\n\ncontinue with the pregnancy. The health of foetus can be monitored\n\nfor any major congenital defects. Her mental state indicates limited\n\nmental     capacity       [intellectual,          social    adaptive     and    emotional\n\ncapacity] to bear and raise the child. Social support and care for\n\nboth     the    mother    and     the    child     is   another   crucial      component.\n\nTherefore, any decision that is taken keeping her best interests in\n\nmind as well as those of her unborn child - has to be based on the\n\nholistic        assessment        of     physical,       psychological      and    social\n\nparameters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">\fTERMINATION OF PREGNANCY CANNOT BE PERMITTED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF\n\nTHE VICTIM IN THIS CASE\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">10.   Even   though     the       Expert      Body&#x27;s    findings    were     in    favour   of\n\ncontinuation of the pregnancy, the High Court decided to direct the\n\ntermination of the same in its order dated 17.7.2009. We disagree\n\nwith this conclusion since the victim had clearly expressed her\n\nwillingness      to   bear    a    child.       Her    reproductive    choice      should   be\n\nrespected     in      spite   of        other     factors    such      as    the    lack    of\n\nunderstanding of the sexual act as well as apprehensions about her\n\ncapacity to carry the pregnancy to its full term and the assumption\n\nof    maternal     responsibilities           thereafter.     We      have   adopted       this\n\nposition since the applicable statute clearly contemplates that even\n\na woman who is found to be `mentally retarded&#x27; should give her\n\nconsent for the termination of a pregnancy. In this regard we must\n\nstress upon the language of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 3</a> of the Medical Termination of\n\nPregnancy Act, 1971 [Hereinafter also referred to as `<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_5\">MTP Act</a>&#x27;]\n\nwhich reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;3.

A plain reading of the above-quoted provision makes it clear\n\nthat Indian law allows for abortion only if the specified conditions\n\nare met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_7\">When the MTP Act</a> was first enacted in 1971 it was largely\n\nmodelled on the Abortion Act of 1967 which had been passed in the\n\nUnited Kingdom. The legislative intent was to provide a qualified\n\n`right to abortion&#x27; and the termination of pregnancy has never been\n\nrecognised as a normal recourse for expecting mothers. There is no\n\ndoubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive choices is also a\n\ndimension of `personal liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe       Constitution    of    India.    It   is     important   to    recognise       that\n\nreproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to\n\nabstain       from    procreating.       The   crucial    consideration     is    that     a\n\nwoman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be\n\nrespected. This means that there should be no restriction whatsoever\n\non the exercise of reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to\n\nrefuse       participation       in   sexual     activity    or     alternatively        the\n\finsistence on use of contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are\n\nalso     free    to    choose     birth-control        methods       such      as    undergoing\n\nsterilisation         procedures.        Taken    to       their    logical         conclusion,\n\nreproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement                              to        carry    a\n\npregnancy        to     its       full         term, to        give       birth          and     to\n\nsubsequently          raise     children.             However,            in        the        case\n\nof     pregnant women there        is     also    a    `compelling          state     interest&#x27;\n\nin protecting the life of the prospective child. Therefore, the\n\ntermination of a pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions\n\nspecified in the applicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_9\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be viewed as reasonable\n\nrestrictions that have been placed on the exercise of reproductive\n\nchoices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">12. A perusal of the above mentioned provision makes it clear that\n\nordinarily       a    pregnancy    can    be     terminated        only     when     a    medical\n\npractitioner is satisfied that a `continuance of the pregnancy would\n\ninvolve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury\n\nto her physical or mental health&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 3(2)(i)</a>] or when\n\n`there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would\n\nsuffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously\n\nhandicapped&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3(2)(ii)</a>]. While the satisfaction of\n\none medical practitioner is required for terminating a pregnancy\n\nwithin     twelve       weeks     of     the     gestation         period,      two       medical\n\npractitioners must be satisfied about either of these grounds in\n\norder to terminate a pregnancy between twelve to twenty weeks of the\n\ngestation       period.   The     explanations        to    this    provision        have      also\n\fcontemplated         the   termination      of    pregnancy       when   the   same    is   the\n\nresult of a rape or a failure of birth-control methods since both of\n\nthese eventualities have been equated with a `grave injury to the\n\nmental health&#x27; of a woman. In all such circumstances, the consent of\n\nthe pregnant woman is an essential requirement for proceeding with\n\nthe termination of pregnancy. This position has been unambiguously\n\nstated in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 3(4)(b)</a> of the MTP Act, 1971. The exceptions to\n\nthis rule of consent have been laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the\n\nAct. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> lays down that when the pregnant woman is below\n\neighteen years of age or is a `mentally ill&#x27; person, the pregnancy\n\ncan    be    terminated      if    the    guardian     of   the    pregnant    woman    gives\n\nconsent for the same. The only other exception is found in <a href=\"/doc/1294807/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n\n5(1)</a> of the MTP Act which permits a registered medical practitioner\n\nto proceed with a termination of pregnancy when he/she is of an\n\nopinion formed in good faith that the same is `immediately necessary\n\nto save the life of the pregnant woman&#x27;. Clearly, none of these\n\nexceptions are applicable to the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">13. In the facts before us, the State could claim that it is the\n\nguardian of the pregnant victim since she is an orphan and has been\n\nplaced in government-run welfare institutions. However, the State&#x27;s\n\nclaim to guardianship cannot be mechanically extended in order to\n\nmake    decisions          about    the     termination       of     her   pregnancy.        An\n\nossification test has revealed that the physical age of the victim\n\nis around 19-20 years. This conclusively shows that she is not a\n\nminor. Furthermore, her condition has been described as that of\n\n`mild       mental    retardation&#x27;        which   is    clearly      different    from      the\n\fcondition of a `mentally ill person&#x27; as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n\n3(4)(a)</a> of the MTP Act. It is pertinent to note that the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_17\">MTP Act</a> had\n\nbeen    amended    in   2002,      by     way    of   which     the   word     `lunatic&#x27;        was\n\nreplaced by the expression `mentally ill person&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 3(4)(a)</a>\n\nof the said statute. The said amendment also amended <a href=\"/doc/759927/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 2(b)</a> of\n\nthe MTP Act, where the erstwhile definition of the word `lunatic&#x27;\n\nwas    replaced    by   the     definition       of   the      expression      `mentally        ill\n\nperson&#x27; which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;2(b)    `mentally      ill   person&#x27;       means     a   person      who    is   in     need    of\n\ntreatment    by    reason     of    any     mental        disorder     other      than    mental\n\nretardation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">14. The 2002 amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">MTP Act</a> indicates that the legislative\n\nintent was to narrow down the class of persons on behalf of whom\n\ntheir    guardians      could      make    decisions          about   the    termination         of\n\npregnancy. It is apparent from the definition of the expression\n\n`mentally    ill    person&#x27;      that      the    same    is    different      from      that    of\n\n`mental retardation&#x27;. A similar distinction can also be found in the\n\nPersons with <a href=\"/doc/376202/\" id=\"a_21\">Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights\n\nand Full Participation) Act, 1995</a>. This legislation treats `mental\n\nillness&#x27;    and    `mental       retardation&#x27;            as    two    different        forms     of\n\n`disability&#x27;. This distinction is apparent if one refers to <a href=\"/doc/1333524/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n\n2(i)</a>, (q) and (r) which define `disability&#x27;, `mental illness&#x27; and\n\n`mental retardation&#x27; in the following manner:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;2(i) `disability&#x27; means - (i) blindness; (ii) low vision; (iii)\n\fleprosy-cured; (iv) hearing impairment; (v) locomotor disability;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(vi) mental retardation; (vii) mental illness;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">2(q) `mental illness&#x27; means any mental disorder other than mental\n\nretardation\n\n2(r)    `mental         retardation&#x27;            means     a      condition      of   arrested        or\n\nincomplete        development         of    mind     of     a    person    which     is    specially\n\ncharacterised by subnormality of intelligence.&quot;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">15.    The   same       definition         of    `mental        retardation&#x27;       has     also   been\n\nincorporated in <a href=\"/doc/1333524/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 2(g)</a> of                      The National Trust for Welfare of\n\nPersons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple\n\nDisabilities Act, 1999. These legislative provisions clearly show\n\nthat persons who are in a condition of `mental retardation&#x27; should\n\nordinarily be treated differently from those who are found to be\n\n`mentally ill&#x27;. While a guardian can make decisions on behalf a\n\n`mentally ill person&#x27; as per <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the MTP Act, the\n\nsame cannot be done on behalf of a person who is in a condition of\n\n`mental retardation&#x27;. The only reasonable conclusion that can be\n\narrived      at    in   this     regard         is   that       the   State   must    respect       the\n\npersonal      autonomy      of    a    mentally         retarded        woman   with       regard   to\n\ndecisions about terminating a pregnancy. It can also be reasoned\n\nthat while the explicit consent of the woman in question is not a\n\nnecessary         condition      for       continuing         the     pregnancy,     the    <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_25\">MTP     Act</a>\n\nclearly lays down that obtaining the consent of the pregnant woman\n\nis indeed an essential condition for proceeding with the termination\n\nof a pregnancy. As mentioned earlier, in the facts before us the\n\nvictim has not given consent for the termination of pregnancy. We\n\fcannot permit a dilution of this requirement of consent since the\n\nsame would amount to an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction on\n\nthe reproductive rights of the victim. We must also be mindful of\n\nthe    fact     that     any        dilution        of     the     requirement         of     consent\n\ncontemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3(4)(b)</a> of the MTP Act is liable to be\n\nmisused in a society where sex-selective abortion is a pervasive\n\nsocial evil.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">16. Besides placing substantial reliance on the preliminary medical\n\nopinions       presented       before       it,     the     High     Court       has   noted     some\n\nstatutory       provisions       in     the       Persons        with     <a href=\"/doc/376202/\" id=\"a_27\">Disabilities         (Equal\n\nOpportunities,        Protection        of    Rights       and     Full   Participation)         Act,\n\n1995</a> as well as The National Trust for Welfare of Persons with\n\nAutism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities\n\nAct, 1999 where the distinction between `mental illness&#x27; and `mental\n\nretardation&#x27; has been collapsed. The same has been done for the\n\npurpose of providing affirmative action in public employment and\n\neducation       as    well     as     for     the        purpose     of    implementing        anti-\n\ndiscrimination        measures.       The     High       Court     has    also    taken     note   of\n\nprovisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">IPC</a> which lay down strong criminal law remedies\n\nthat   can     be     sought    in     cases       involving        the    sexual      assault     of\n\n`mentally      ill&#x27;    and     `mentally          retarded&#x27;        persons.      The   High     Court\n\npoints    to    the    blurring       of     these       distinctions      and     uses     this   to\n\nsupport      its     conclusion       that        `mentally        ill&#x27;    persons      and     those\n\nsuffering from `mental retardation&#x27; ought to be treated similarly\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_29\">MTP Act, 1971</a>. We do not agree with this proposition. We\n\nmust emphasize that while the distinction between these statutory\n\fcategories    can    be    collapsed      for    the    purpose     of    empowering      the\n\nrespective    classes      of     persons,      the    same     distinction     cannot      be\n\ndisregarded so as to interfere with the personal autonomy that has\n\nbeen   accorded     to    mentally   retarded         persons    for     exercising      their\n\nreproductive rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n\nTERMINATION    OF   PREGNANCY       IS    NOT    IN   THE   `BEST      INTERESTS&#x27;     OF THE\n\nVICTIM\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">17. In the impugned orders, the High Court has in fact agreed with\n\nthe proposition that a literal reading of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act\n\nwould lead to the conclusion that a mentally retarded woman should\n\ngive her consent in order to proceed with the termination of a\n\npregnancy.    However,      the    High    Court      has   invoked      the   doctrine    of\n\n`Parens Patriae&#x27; while exercising its writ jurisdiction to go beyond\n\nthe literal interpretation of the statute and adopt a purposive\n\napproach.     The   same     doctrine      has     been     used    to    arrive    at    the\n\nconclusion that the termination of pregnancy would serve the `best\n\ninterests&#x27; of the victim in the present case even though she has not\n\ngiven her consent for the same. We are unable to accept that line of\n\nreasoning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">18. The doctrine of `Parens Patriae&#x27; has been evolved in common law\n\nand is applied in situations where the State must make decisions in\n\norder to protect the interests of those persons who are unable to\n\ntake   care   of    themselves.      Traditionally          this    doctrine       has    been\n\napplied in cases involving the rights of minors and those persons\n\fwho have been found to be mentally incapable of making informed\n\ndecisions for themselves. Courts in other common law jurisdictions\n\nhave   developed    two     distinct   standards        while       exercising   `Parens\n\nPatriae&#x27;    jurisdiction      for    the   purpose       of     making      reproductive\n\ndecisions   on     behalf    of     mentally   retarded         persons.     These    two\n\nstandards   are    the    `Best     interests&#x27;      test      and    the    `Substituted\n\njudgment&#x27; test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">19. As evident from its literal description, the `Best interests&#x27;\n\ntest requires the Court to ascertain the course of action which\n\nwould serve the best interests of the person in question. In the\n\npresent setting this means that the Court must undertake a careful\n\ninquiry of the medical opinion on the feasibility of the pregnancy\n\nas well as social circumstances faced by the victim. It is important\n\nto note that the Court&#x27;s decision should be guided by the interests\n\nof the victim alone and not those of other stakeholders such as\n\nguardians or society in general. It is evident that the woman in\n\nquestion will need care and assistance which will in turn entail\n\nsome   costs.    However,    that    cannot    be   a    ground       for   denying   the\n\nexercise of reproductive rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">20. The application of the `Substituted Judgment&#x27; test requires the\n\ncourt to step into the shoes of a person who is considered to be\n\nmentally incapable and attempt to make the decision which the said\n\nperson would have made, if she was competent to do so. This is a\n\nmore complex inquiry but this test can only be applied to make\n\ndecisions on behalf of persons who are conclusively shown to be\n\fmentally    incompetent.       In    the     present     case   the    victim     has   been\n\ndescribed as a person suffering from `mild mental retardation&#x27;. This\n\ndoes not mean that she is entirely incapable of making decisions for\n\nherself. The findings recorded by the Expert Body indicate that her\n\nmental age is close to that of a nine-year old child and that she is\n\ncapable of learning through rote-memorisation and imitation. Even\n\nthe preliminary medical opinion indicated that she had learnt to\n\nperform     basic    bodily         functions      and    was      capable      of    simple\n\ncommunications.      In    light      of   these     findings,        it   is   the     `Best\n\nInterests&#x27; test alone which should govern the inquiry in the present\n\ncase and not the `Substituted Judgment&#x27; test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">21.   We   must   also    be   mindful       of   the    varying    degrees      of   mental\n\nretardation - namely those described as borderline, mild, moderate,\n\nsevere and profound instances of the same. Persons suffering from\n\nsevere and    profound      mental     retardation        usually     require     intensive\n\ncare and supervision and a perusal of academic materials suggests\n\nthat there is a strong preference for placing such persons in an\n\ninstitutionalised        environment.        However,     persons      with     borderline,\n\nmild or moderate mental retardation are capable of living in normal\n\nsocial conditions even though they may need some supervision and\n\nassistance    from   time      to    time.    A   developmental        delay     in   mental\n\nintelligence should not be equated with mental incapacity and as far\n\nas possible the law should respect the decisions made by persons who\n\nare found to be in a state of mild to moderate `mental retardation&#x27;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">22. In the present case, the victim has expressed her willingness to\n\fcarry the pregnancy till its full term and bear a child. The Expert\n\nbody has found that she has a limited understanding of the idea of\n\npregnancy    and    may    not    be    fully      prepared   for    assuming    the\n\nresponsibilities of a mother. As per the findings, the victim is\n\nphysically capable of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible\n\nrisks to her physical health are similar to those of any other\n\nexpecting mother. There is also no indication that the prospective\n\nchild may    be    born   with   any   congenital     defects.    However,    it was\n\nrepeatedly   stressed      before      us   that   the   victim     has   a   limited\n\nunderstanding of the sexual act and perhaps does not anticipate the\n\nsocial stigma that may be attached to a child which will be born on\n\naccount of an act of rape. Furthermore, the medical experts who\n\nappeared before us also voiced the concern that the victim will need\n\nconstant care and supervision throughout the pregnancy as well as\n\nfor the purposes of delivery and childcare after birth. Maternal\n\nresponsibilities do entail a certain degree of physical, emotional\n\nand social burdens and it was proper for the medical experts to\n\ngauge whether the victim is capable of handling them. The counsel\n\nfor the respondent also alerted us to the possibility that even\n\nthough the victim had told the members of the Expert Body that she\n\nwas willing to bear the child, her opinion may change in the future\n\nsince she was also found to be highly suggestible.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">23. Even if it were to be assumed that the victim&#x27;s willingness to\n\nbear a child was questionable since it may have been the product of\n\nsuggestive questioning or because the victim may change her mind in\n\nthe future, there is another important concern that should have been\n\fweighed by the High Court. At the time of the order dated 17.7.2009,\n\nthe victim had already been pregnant for almost 19 weeks. By the\n\ntime the matter was heard by this Court on an urgent basis on\n\n21.7.2009, the statutory limit for terminating a pregnancy, i.e. 20\n\nweeks, was fast approaching. There is of a course a cogent rationale\n\nfor the provision of this upper limit of 20 weeks (of the gestation\n\nperiod) within which the termination of a pregnancy is allowed. This\n\nis so because there is a clear medical consensus that an abortion\n\nperformed during the later stages of a pregnancy is very likely to\n\ncause harm to the physical health of the woman who undergoes the\n\nsame. This rationale was also noted in a prominent decision of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 US 113 (1973), which\n\nrecognised that the right of a woman to seek an abortion during the\n\nearly-stages of pregnancy came within the constitutionally protected\n\n`right to privacy&#x27;. Even though this decision had struck down a\n\nstatutory provision in the State of Texas which had criminalized the\n\nact of undergoing or performing an abortion, (except in cases where\n\nthe pregnancy posed a grave risk to the health of the mother) it had\n\nalso recognised a `compelling state interest&#x27; in protecting the life\n\nof the prospective child as well as the health of the pregnant woman\n\nafter a certain point in the gestation period. This reasoning was\n\nexplained in the majority opinion delivered by Blackmun, J., 410 US\n\n113, 162-163 (1973):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory\n\nof life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that\n\nare   at   stake.   We   repeat,   however,   that   the   State   does   have   an\n\fimportant and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the\n\nhealth of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State\n\nor    a    non-resident           who     seeks      medical   consultation         and       treatment\n\nthere,         and       that    it    has   still     another      important      and    legitimate\n\ninterest            in    protecting         the    potentiality      of   human     life.          These\n\ninterests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as\n\nthe woman approaches term and, at a point during pregnancy, each\n\nbecomes `compelling&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(internal citations omitted)\n\n\n\nWith respect to the State&#x27;s important and legitimate interest in the\n\nhealth         of    the    mother,       the      `compelling&#x27;     point,    in    the       light    of\n\npresent medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first\n\ntrimester. This is so because of the now-established medical fact,\n\n(internal            citation         omitted),      that   until    the     end   of     the       first\n\ntrimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal\n\nchildbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a State may\n\nregulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation\n\nreasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal\n\nhealth. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">24.       In    light       of    the     above-mentioned         observations,          it    is     our\n\nconsidered opinion that the direction given by the High Court (in\n\nits order dated 17.7.2009) to terminate the victim&#x27;s pregnancy was\n\nnot in pursuance of her `best interests&#x27;. Performing an abortion at\n\nsuch a late-stage could have endangered the victims&#x27; physical health\n\nand the same could have also caused further mental anguish to the\n\fvictim since she had not consented to such a procedure. We must also\n\nmention   that     the    High    Court     in   its    earlier     order    had    already\n\nexpressed    its     preference       for    the    termination      of     the    victim&#x27;s\n\npregnancy    (See    Para.       38   in    Order   dated    9.6.2009)       even    as    it\n\nproceeded to frame a set of questions that were to be answered by a\n\nExpert Body which was appointed at the instance of the High Court\n\nitself. In such a scenario, it would have been more appropriate for\n\nthe   High   Court       to   express      its   inclination       only   after     it     had\n\nconsidered the findings of the Expert Body.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">25. Our conclusions in this case are strengthened by some norms\n\ndeveloped in the realm of international law. For instance one can\n\nrefer to the principles contained in the United Nations Declaration\n\non the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, 1971 [G.A. Res. 2856\n\n(XXVI) of 20 December, 1971] which have been reproduced below:-\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;1. The mentally          retarded    person     has,   to   the    maximum       degree    of\n\nfeasibility, the same rights as other human beings.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">2. The mentally retarded person has a right to proper medical care\n\nand physical therapy and to such education, training, rehabilitation\n\nand guidance as will enable him to develop his ability and maximum\n\npotential.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">3. The mentally retarded person has a right to economic security and\n\nto a decent standard of living. He has a right to perform productive\n\nwork or to engage in any other meaningful occupation to the fullest\n\npossible extent of his capabilities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">4. Whenever possible, the mentally retarded person should live with\n\fhis own family or with foster parents and participate in different\n\nforms of       community       life.     The        family      with       which   he     lives    should\n\nreceive assistance. If care in an institution becomes necessary, it\n\nshould be provided in surroundings and other circumstances as close\n\nas possible to those of normal life.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">5. The mentally retarded person has a right to a qualified guardian\n\nwhen    this      is    required        to    protect          his    personal          well-being    and\n\ninterests.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">6. The mentally             retarded     person          has    a    right    to    protection        from\n\nexploitation, abuse and degrading treatment. If prosecuted for any\n\noffence, he shall have a right to due process of law with full\n\nrecognition being given to his degree of mental responsibility.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">7. Whenever mentally retarded persons are unable, because of the\n\nseverity     of    their       handicap,        to       exercise      all    their       rights     in    a\n\nmeaningful way or it should become necessary to restrict or deny\n\nsome or all of these rights, the procedure used for that restriction\n\nor denial of rights must contain proper legal safeguards against\n\nevery form of abuse. This procedure must be based on an evaluation\n\nof     the   social         capability        of     the       mentally      retarded       person        by\n\nqualified experts and must be subject to periodic review and to the\n\nright of appeal to higher authorities.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">26. Special emphasis should be placed on Principle 7 (cited above)\n\nwhich    prescribes          that   a    fair       procedure         should       be    used   for   the\n\n`restriction           or   denial&#x27;      of        the     rights      guaranteed         to    mentally\n\nretarded persons, which should ordinarily be the same as those given\n\nto   other     human        beings.     In    respecting             the    personal       autonomy       of\n\fmentally retarded persons with regard to the reproductive choice of\n\ncontinuing or terminating a pregnancy, the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_31\">MTP Act</a> lays down such a\n\nprocedure. We must also bear in mind that India has ratified the\n\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) on\n\nOctober 1, 2007 and the contents of the same are binding on our\n\nlegal system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">27.    The   facts    of    the    present     case   indeed   posed     some     complex\n\nquestions before us. While we must commend the counsel for their\n\nrigorous argumentation, this case also presents an opportunity to\n\nconfront some social stereotypes and prejudices that operate to the\n\ndetriment of mentally retarded persons. Without reference to the\n\npresent proceedings, we must admit to the fact that even medical\n\nexperts      and     judges       are     unconsciously     susceptible      to     these\n\nprejudices. [See generally: Susan Stefan, `Whose Egg is it anyway?\n\nReproductive         Rights       of    Incarcerated,       Institutionalized          and\n\nIncompetent Women&#x27;, 13 Nova Law Review 405-456 (November 1989)] We\n\nhave    already      stressed      that     persons   who    are     found   to   be    in\n\nborderline,        mild    and    moderate    forms   of    mental    retardation      are\n\ncapable of living in normal social conditions and do not need the\n\nintensive supervision of an institutionalised environment. As in the\n\ncase before us, institutional upbringing tends to be associated with\n\neven more social stigma and the mentally retarded person is denied\n\nthe opportunity to be exposed to the elements of routine living. For\n\ninstance, if the victim in the present case had received the care of\n\na family environment, her guardians would have probably made the\n\nefforts to train her to avoid unwelcome sexual acts. However, the\n\fvictim     in    the    present     case       is    an   orphan      who    has    lived      in    an\n\ninstitutional setting all her life and she was in no position to\n\nunderstand       or     avoid     the    sexual       activity       that    resulted       in      her\n\npregnancy. The responsibility of course lies with the State and\n\nfact-situations such as those in the present case should alert all\n\nof us to the alarming need for improving the administration of the\n\ngovernment-run welfare institutions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">28. It would also be proper to emphasize that persons who are found\n\nto    be   in    a     condition    of     borderline,         mild     or    moderate      mental\n\nretardation are capable of being good parents. Empirical studies\n\nhave conclusively disproved the eugenics theory that mental defects\n\nare    likely     to    be    passed      on    to    the     next    generation.        The     said\n\n`Eugenics theory&#x27; has been used in the past to perform forcible\n\nsterilisations         and    abortions        on    mentally        retarded      persons.      [See\n\ngenerally: Elizabeth C. Scott, `Sterilization of Mentally Retarded\n\nPersons: Reproductive Rights and Family Privacy&#x27;, Duke Law Journal\n\n806-865 (November 1986)]                 We firmly believe that such measures are\n\nanti-democratic and violative of the guarantee of `equal protection\n\nbefore the law&#x27; as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 14</a> of our Constitution. It\n\nis also pertinent to note that a condition of `mental retardation&#x27;\n\nor developmental delay is gauged on the basis of parameters such as\n\nIntelligence         Quotient     (I.Q.)       and    Mental    Age     (M.A.)      which   mostly\n\nrelate to academic abilities. It is quite possible that a person\n\nwith   a   low       I.Q.    or   M.A.    may       possess    the     social      and   emotional\n\ncapacities that will enable him or her to be a good parent. Hence,\n\nit is important to evaluate each case in a thorough manner with due\n\fweightage being given to medical opinion for deciding whether a\n\nmentally      retarded      person     is    capable          of     performing            parental\n\nresponsibilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n\nCONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">29. With regard to the facts that led to the present proceeding, the\n\nquestion of whether or not the victim was capable of consenting to\n\nthe sexual activity that resulted in her pregnancy will be addressed\n\nin the criminal proceedings before a trial court. An FIR has already\n\nbeen filed in the said matter and two security-guards from Nari\n\nNiketan are being investigated for their role in the alleged rape.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">30.    The   substantive     questions      posed     before        us   were    whether          the\n\nvictim&#x27;s pregnancy could be terminated even though she had expressed\n\nher willingness to bear a child and whether her `best interests&#x27;\n\nwould be     served   by    such     termination.        As    explained        in    the     fore-\n\nmentioned discussion, our conclusion is that the victim&#x27;s pregnancy\n\ncannot be terminated without her consent and proceeding with the\n\nsame would not have served her `best interests&#x27;. In our considered\n\nopinion, the language of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_33\">MTP Act</a> clearly respects the personal\n\nautonomy of     mentally     retarded       persons      who       are   above       the    age    of\n\nmajority. Since none of the other statutory conditions have been met\n\nin this case, it is amply clear that we cannot permit a dilution of\n\nthe requirement of consent for proceeding with a termination of\n\npregnancy. We have also reasoned that proceeding with an abortion at\n\nsuch    a    late   stage     (19-20     weeks      of        gestation     period)          poses\n\fsignificant risks to the physical health of the victim.                   Lastly,     we\n\nhave     urged    the need to look beyond social prejudices in order to\n\nobjectively decide whether a person who is in a condition of mild\n\nmental retardation can perform parental responsibilities.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">31. The findings recorded by the Expert body which had examined the\n\nvictim indicate that the continuation of the pregnancy does not pose\n\nany grave risk to the physical or mental health of the victim and\n\nthat there is no indication that the prospective child is likely to\n\nsuffer    from    a    congenital    disorder.     However,    concerns      have    been\n\nexpressed      about    the   victim&#x27;s    mental    capacity    to    cope    with   the\n\ndemands of carrying the pregnancy to its full term, the act of\n\ndelivering a child and subsequent childcare. In this regard, we\n\ndirect that the best medical facilities be made available so as to\n\nensure proper care and supervision during the period of pregnancy as\n\nwell as for post-natal care. Since there is an apprehension that the\n\nwoman    in   question    may   find     it   difficult   to   cope    with   maternal\n\nresponsibilities, the Chairperson of the National Trust for Welfare\n\nof   Persons     with    Autism,    Cerebral    Palsy,    Mental     Retardation      and\n\nMultiple Disabilities (constituted under the similarly named 1999\n\nAct) has stated in an affidavit that the said Trust is prepared to\n\nlook after the interests of the woman in question which will include\n\nassistance with childcare. In the said affidavit, it has been stated\n\nthat this Trust will consult the Chandigarh Administration as well\n\nas experts from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and\n\nResearch (PGIMER) in order to ensure proper care and supervision. If\n\nany grievances arise with respect to the same subject matter in the\n\ffuture, the respondent can seek directions from the High Court of\n\nPunjab and Haryana under its writ jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">32.
