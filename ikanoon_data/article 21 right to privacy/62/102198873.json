Petitioner claims to be doing petty business and hails from\n\nthe middle class and respectable family. Persons who are inimical\n\nto petitioner, having an evil eye on his property, created several\n\nproblems and in the process, crime was registered, which resulted\n\nin showing him as accused in C.C. No.489 of 2018 pending for trial\n\nin the Court of VIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,\n\nHyderabad. On the insistence of persons, who are responsible for\n\nimplicating the petitioner in the above case, a rowdy sheet was\n\nopened against him.          In the guise of opening a rowdy sheet,\n\npetitioner is frequently called to the police station and the same is\n\nillegal. Seeking to declare the action of the respondent - police in\n\nopening rowdy sheet and calling him to the police station and\n\nmaking him to sit over for hours together as illegal, arbitrary and\n\nunconstitutional, this Writ Petition is filed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">3.    According to learned counsel for the petitioner, right to life,\n\nliberty and privacy are sacrosanct guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.       Such right cannot be infringed except by\n\ndue process of law.          Merely on the ground that crime was\n\nregistered against the petitioner, the respondent - police could not\n\nhave opened rowdy sheet and on the ground of opening of a rowdy\n\nsheet, harass and humiliate the petitioner infringing his right to\n\nlife, liberty and privacy.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there is no\n\nprovision of law which enables the police to open a rowdy sheet\n\nand on the ground that rowdy sheet is opened, harass the\n\npetitioner and ask him to visit the police station. The only source\n\nof power available to the respondent - police is Police Standing\n\nOrders (for short, &#x27;the PSO&#x27;). The PSOs are non-statutory and are\n\nonly in the form of guidelines to the police and the same cannot be\n\nrelied upon infringing upon the right to life, liberty and privacy. In\n\nsupport of his contention, learned counsel for the petitioner placed\n\nreliance on the decisions of this Court in W.P.Nos.40853 of 2018,\n\ndated 28.11.2018, 18584 of 2017, dated 07.08.2018, and 19194 of\n\n2012, dated 24.08.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.    Per contra, according to learned Government Pleader for\n\nHome, petitioner is a habitual offender and is involved in several\n\ncrimes.    Petitioner is involved in committing bodily offences\n\nhabitually since the year 2006.        Having regard to the history of\n\ninvolvement     of   petitioner,   rowdy    sheet   was   opened    in\n\nBhavaninagar Police Station, Hyderabad, on 13.05.2009.          As of\n\nnow, he is convicted in petty offence case and C.C.No.489 of 2018\n\nis pending for trial. In addition, petitioner was bound over in seven\n\ncrimes. He breached bound over for good conduct and involved in\n\ntwo cases, one of them being under <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_2\">Arms Act</a> where he is now\n\nfacing trial.    Learned Government Pleader therefore justifies\n\nopening of rowdy sheet and continuing the same. Learned\n\nGovernment Pleader placed reliance on several decisions in\n\nsupport of his contention that rowdy sheet was validly opened and\n\nsurveillance is necessary.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">6.        Right to life and liberty are sacrosanct to a person. A person\n\nis entitled to lead his life with dignity and self respect.               He is\n\nentitled to privacy.          His rights flow out of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.          Surveillance on person certainly infringes\n\non his right to life, privacy and liberty.            These rights cannot be\n\ninfringed except by due process of law. Compelling public interest\n\nmay require intrusion into privacy of a person but while doing so\n\ngreat care and caution has to be observed. Thus, if police open a\n\nrowdy sheet to keep surveillance on a person it must show\n\njustification, impelled to ensure peace and order in the society.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1470089\" id=\"span_4\">7.        The scope and width of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia, scope of power of police to infringe privacy of a person and\n\nscope and ambit of Police Standing Orders (for short PSO) were\n\nvividly analysed and dealt with extensively by two learned Judges\n\nof this Court, one of whom, Hon&#x27;ble Sri Justice B.Sudershan\n\nReddy, adorned the office of Judgeship in the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia, in <a href=\"/doc/1470089/\" id=\"a_5\">Mohammed Quadeer and others Vs. Commissioner of\n\nPolice</a>, Hyderabad and another1                and <a href=\"/doc/232602/\" id=\"a_6\">Sunkara Satyanarayana\n\nVs State of Andhra Pradesh, Home Department</a> and others2.\n\nIn both these decisions it is held that PSOs are non statutory\n\nexecutive instructions and have no binding force of law. However,\n\nin the instant case, that issue need not be elaborated further.\n\n\n7.1.      In Mohammed Quadeer and others, it is held:</span></span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               &quot;31. Opening of a rowdy sheet against a citizen is\n               undoubtedly fraught with serious consequences. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article\n               21</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees right to life\n               with dignity and the right to live, as a dignified man,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1</span>\n     1999 (3) ALD 60\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">2</span>\n    1999 (6) ALT 249\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  5</span>\n\n\n\ncarries with it the right to reputation. Right to reputation\nis an integral part of right to life guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article\n21</a>, and such a right cannot be deprived except in\naccordance with the procedure established by law. Such\nlaws which authorise the Police to open rowdy sheets and\nexercise surveillance are required to be very strictly\nconstrued. Opening of the rowdy sheets and retention\nthereof except in accordance with law would amount to\ninfringement of fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is true that the State is\nduty bound at all levels to protect the persons and\nproperty   from    the    criminals    and    criminal activity.\nPrevention of organised crime is an obligation on the part\nof the State.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Right to Privacy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">32. Fundamental rights and civil liberties exist and can\nonly flourish in an orderly society. Civil liberties and\nfundamental rights are intimately connected with the\nnature and dynamics of the Society. It is the duty of the\nPolice to deal with crime and criminals expeditiously and\neffectively while at the same time holding to the values\nand   concepts     of    the   fundamental     rights    and   the\nConstitution. Both the competing interests are to be\nreconciled.     This    much    is    clear   so   far   as    our\nConstitutional system is concerned that intrusion into\npersonal liberty without an authority of law is forbidden.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">Surveillance and watching of movements of a citizen by\nthe Police is not a matter of course. Such rights can be\nexercised by the Police only in accordance with law which\npermits such surveillance. The action in this regard\nwhich is in accordance with law may result in violation of\nthe fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India. Every citizen has fundamental\nright and entitled to indulge in harmless activities\nwithout observation or interference. It is a right to be left\nalone. The guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 8</a> of the European\nConvention of Human Rights that &quot;Everyone has the\nright to respect for his private and family life, his home\nand has correspondence&quot; reflects both the individual&#x27;s\npsychological need to preserve an intrusion-free zone of\npersonality and family, and the anguish and stress which\ncan be suffered when that zone is violated. The saying\nthat &#x27;an Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&#x27; would be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                             6</span>\n\n\n\n          equally applicable to Indian situation and it can be said\n          that an &#x27;Indian citizen&#x27;s home is his castle.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">          33. Therefore, I have no hesitation whatsoever to\n          reject the plea that mere surveillance and watch by\n          the Police itself would not infringe the fundamental\n          rights of a citizen. Such surveillance and watch\n          which        is   not    authorised       by      law      may     be\n          unconstitutional. Such surveillance and watch even\n          if it is authorised by law but if it is not in\n          accordance        with    that    law     would         equally    be\n          unconstitutional.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">                                                   (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n7.2.   In Sunkara Satyanarayana, it is held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          &quot;23. Surveillance by the police makes very serious\n          inroads into the life of a person. It even grossly violates\n          the right of persons to privacy. Obtrusive surveillance\n          does not leave a citizen alone. With the subtle methods of\n          telephone tapping, telescope watching, remote controlled\n          audio and video recording gadgets, a citizen subjected to\n          surveillance can never have mental peace and thus his\n          life and liberty at every movement would be restricted. A\n          person with lot of restrictions cannot be expected to lead\n          a dignified life and exercise his right to liberty and other\n          freedoms. A citizen&#x27;s life would become miserable. Such a\n          situation is worse than animal existence, For these\n          reasons can it be said that there is a &#x27;right&#x27; against\n          surveillance?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                 .....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                 ....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                 30............Before          examining      the     case     law   as\n          decided by this Court, it is apposite to note the intention\n          and objectives behind such provisions dealing with\n          surveillance. There cannot be two opinions that police\n          should vigorously enforce the law. It does not however\n          mean     that     they    should       rigorously       violate    the\n          constitutional      values       and    constitutional        rights.\n          In enforcing the law they shall not violate the\n          Supreme law of the Nation. The police are charged\n          with responsibility of controlling crime. Control of\n          crime necessarily involve prevention of crime. To\n          prevent crime it is permissible that police should\n          keep a person known to be habitual offender or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                7</span>\n\n\n\n           known to be &#x27;trouble maker&#x27; under a watch. What is\n           most objectionable to civilized mind is the use of\n           extra legal methods by the police for prevention of\n           crimes. Surveillance of a person in an arbitrary and\n           unreasonable manner and contrary to the provisions\n           of law, is one such extra legal method which cannot\n           be countenanced by the Constitutional Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           31. Illegal surveillance makes arbitrary and obtrusive\n           intrusions into one&#x27;s right to privacy and violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article\n           21</a> of Constitution of India. But keeping a person under\n           unobtrusive watch to prevent crime and to maintain\n           law and order, as authorised by law, is reasonable\n           restriction permissible under the Constitution.\n           ....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           ....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">           53. Therefore the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the\n           Constitution is a Human right essential for human\n           dignity without which social justice cannot be achieved.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n7.3.    In paragraph 49 of Sunkara Satyanarayana, learned single\n\nJudge    culled       out      principles      on    police   surveillance      against\n\nhistory/rowdy sheeters. It reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">           &quot;49. Therefore, in the context of police surveillance\n           against        history   sheeters   and   rowdy    sheeters,   the\n           following principles vis-a-vis right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article\n           21</a> of the Constitution would emerge:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             (i)     If the surveillance is not obtrusive, the same does\n           not violate the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the\n           Constitution of India. The same does not either in\n           material or palpable form affect the right of the suspect\n           to move freely nor can it be held to deprive the history\n           sheeter / rowdy sheeter of his personal liberty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">             (ii)         In testing whether fundamental right of free\n           movement or personal liberty is infringed or not, it is to\n           be remembered that infringement should be direct as\n           well      as    tangible.   If   surveillance   hurts   personal\n           sensitivities, the same is not a violation, for the\n           constitution makers never intended to protect mere\n           personal sensitiveness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             (iii)        If police surveillance is in accordance with\n           executive/departmental guidelines and not authorised by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                  8</span>\n\n\n\nstatute or rules having statutory force, it is for the State\nto prove that surveillance does not in anyway infringe the\nfundamental right of the person and that the authorities\nhave followed the guidelines scrupulously in ordering\nsurveillance,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">  (iv)     If the action of the police is found to infringe the\nfreedoms guaranteed to the history sheeter / rowdy\nsheeter and violates his right to privacy, in that, the\nsurveillance is excessively obtrusive and intrusive, it may\nseriously encroach on the privacy of a citizen as to\ninfringe the fundamental right to privacy and personal\nliberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> as well as the freedom of\nmovement guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the\nConstitution of India and the same is impermissible,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">  (v)       Even where there is statutory sanction for\nsurveillance       against   history   sheeter/rowdy   sheeter\nprinciple (iv) is equally applicable, if the surveillance is\nobtrusive.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">  (vi)      In either case-whether police regulations are\nstatutory or where they have no statutory force-there\nshould be sufficient material to induce the opinion that\nthe      history     sheeters/rowdy      sheeters     show   a\ndetermination to lead a life of crime which involves public\npeace or security only. Mere convictions in criminal cases\nwhere nothing imperils the safety of the society cannot be\nregarded as warrange surveillance under the relevant\nregulations, however broadly and in whatever language\nthe regulation might have been couched,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">  (vii) In either case-whether the regulation is statutory\nor non-statutory-domiciliary visits and picketing by the\npolice should be reduced to the clearest cases of danger\nto community security, and there can be no routine\nfollow-up at the end of a conviction or release from prison\nin every case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">  (viii)     The above principles that emerge from\nvarious      binding     precedents      are   only    general\nprinciples.

Reliance is also placed on\n\nClause D of PSO 601, which deals with persons who habitually\n\ntease women and girls and pass indecent remarks.                     Therefore,\n\nrespondent - police justify opening of rowdy sheet against\n\npetitioner and keeping him under surveillance.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">12.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"890637\" id=\"span_13\">In the light of the facts, noted above, it is appropriate to note\n\nthe observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_24\">Vijay Narain\n\nSingh v. State of Bihar3</a>. It was a case of preventive detention,\n\nbut the Court considered what constitutes &#x27;habitual offender&#x27; and\n\nthe role of the Court vis-a-viz the responsibility of the police for\n\nmaintenance of public order.

In my view, it is not required that\n         the nature or character of the anti-social acts\n         should be the same or similar.            There maybe\n         commission or attempt to commit or abetment of\n         diverse nature of acts constituting offences under\n         Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">Indian Penal\n         Code</a>.

In W.P.No.19194 of 2012, learned single Judge of this Court\n\nin the judgment rendered on 24.08.2015 reviewed the entire case\n\nlaw on the subject. The learned single Judge set aside the decision\n\nof opening of rowdy sheet on the ground that petitioner therein was\n\nnot involved in more than two crimes, whereas the requirement to\n\nopen a rowdy sheet was, a person must involve in more than two\n\ncrimes and therefore declared the opening of rowdy sheet as\n\ntainted in law from the inception. The facts of that case are not\n\nsame as in this case. In the case on hand, petitioner was involved\n\nin more than 17 crimes, was convicted in one case, was bound\n\nover in seven cases and was facing trial on charges of violating\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_29\">Arms Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"890637\" id=\"span_15\">14.   Guided by the law <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_30\">laid down in</a> the precedent decisions, on a\n\nclose scrutiny of the facts in the case on hand and having regard to\n\nthe history of involvement of the petitioner in several crimes,\n\nit cannot be said that opening of rowdy sheet was made in excess\n\nof the power and authority available to the police and that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                    12</span>\n\n\n\nsurveillance on the petitioner is not valid.

However, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in\n\nthe guise of opening and continuing rowdy sheet against the\n\npetitioner, petitioner is harassed and humiliated by the police.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">According to respondent - police, as part of surveillance, often\n\nrestrict the movements of petitioner, call him to the police station\n\nat all times, resort to detention on the guise of information on\n\nlikely disturbance in the locality and is not allowed to move freely.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">According to learned counsel, these restrictions are unreasonable\n\nand not valid. Compelling public interest may require intrusion\n\ninto privacy of a person, but while doing so, police are bound to\n\napply great care and caution and should not unnecessarily intrude\n\ninto the privacy of the petitioner.      Surveillance should not be\n\nobtrusive.   He should not be called to police station unless\n\nrequired for investigation into crime reported against him. Subject\n\nto above observations, the Writ Petition is dismissed. There shall\n\nbe no order as to costs. Miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand\n\nclosed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                                                _____________________\n                                                 P.
