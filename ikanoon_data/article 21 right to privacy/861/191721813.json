Under the Adword\n\nProgram distribution agreement, the agreement was entered into between GIPL and\n\nGoogle Ireland Ltd., (hereinafter called as &quot;GIL).

The GIPL was asked to furnish details of sums paid or payable for the\n\nfinancial year 2012-13, relevant to the impugned assessment year and the deduction of tax\n\nat source thereon. In response thereto, the assessee has filed the submissions where from\n\nit was noticed by the AO that during the impugned assessment year, GIPL had credited a\n\nsum of Rs.111,491,99,289/- to the account of GIL towards marketing and distribution\n\nrights of Adword Program without deduction of tax at source.

The intention of the Legislature is primarily to be gathered from\nthe language used, which means that attention should be paid to what has been said as also to what\nhas not been said. As a consequence a construction which requires for its support addition or\nsubstitution of words or which results in rejection of words as meaningless has to be avoided.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"752722\" id=\"span_14\"><a href=\"/doc/752722/\" id=\"a_15\">Director General, Telecommunication v.

Where the word is plain and\nunambiguous, it is not for judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse for failing to give\neffect to its plain meaning because they themselves consider that the consequences of doing so\nwould be inexpedient, or even unjust or immoral.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">The words of a statute are first understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and phrases\nand sentences are construed according to their grammatical meaning unless that leads to some\nabsurdity or unless there is something in the context, or in the object of the statute to suggest the\ncontrary.

As is evident from the extracts reproduced from the assessment order earlier, the AO on\nexamination of agreements came to the conclusion that the Google Ireland holds the intellectual\nproperty, knowhow, trademark and other brand features with respect to products and services offered\nby the Adwords_program. And vide the distribution agreement, the assessee company has been granted\nrights to market and distribute Adwords program in India In this process, Google Ireland has permitted\nthe assessee company to access all intellectual property and confidential information which is utilized\nby the 1TES division of the assessee. He also observed that the job of the assessee does not end with\nmarking and distribution of Adword program but also has to support existing customers by providing\ncustomer services to the advertisers in consonance with standards maintained by Google. It is also\nrequired to process customer queries related to advertisement issues and escalate the same to Google\nIreland. The AO has also noted that before the advertiser ca-run his campaign, the same has to\nbe cleared as per editorial and trademark guidelines, hence the assessee had to monitor advertiser\nactivity and gather other information about advertisers as specified. The distribution agreement\ncannot be read without the service agreement and on combined reading, it is clear that the\nassessee company has been granted the right to use valuable business assets of Google Ireland\nwhich includes intellectual property in the products and services offered by Google Ireland.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_55\">Therefore, the distribution rights granted are itself IP rights covered by &quot;similar property used\nin <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_54\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act&quot;. Thereafter, he concluded since IP of Google resides in search\nengine technology, associated software and other features, logically the income received by it\nincludes royalty for its IP from all its non-retail users viz., Advertisers and Intermediaries.\nTherefore, the assessee company being the intermediary has obtained the right to use the\nintellectualproperty, knowhow, trademark and other brand features owned by Google\nlreland.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">11.2. The AO after examining Clause-1.5 &amp; Clause-6 of the distribution agreement concluded\nthat the assessee company was permitted to use the trademarks of Google for the purposes of\nmarketing and distribution of Adwords program. Afterexamining Clause-3 of the agreement, he\nopined that Google Ireland is obliged toprovide advertising space through itsdistributor i.e. the\nassessee company and is also obliged to train the distributor, so that it can market and distribute\nthe Adwords program. The Adwords platform runs on servers located outside India and the assessee\n                                                    IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                          IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                   IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                               Page 21 of 331</span>\n\n\ncompany cannot perform its activities of marketing and distribution without training which amounts\nto transfer of knowhow. The training relates to internal tools and is provided to the staff of the\nassessee company only. Thus, he was of the view that technical knowhow was imparted to the\nassessee company for the purpose of marketing, sale of the Adword program as also\nmaintenance of Adword accounts,after sales, service, billing, etc. Hence, the sums remitted to\nRoyalty within the meaning of the Act.

It will not be appropriate to restrict\nthe scope of the definition, of royalty under the income-tax law only on the ground that since\ncomputer programme has been provided protection under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_61\">Copyright Act</a>, the provisions\nof other intellectual property rights laws will not be applicable.\nTherefore, <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_62\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> from the very inception included computer software for the\npurposes of royalty. If royalty income from the use or the right to use or transfer of all or\nany right (including the granting of the licence) in respect of copyright in computer\nprogramme was not taxable under <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_63\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act, Parliament would not have\nprescribed a special rate of income-tax in respect of royalty income in espect of any\ncomputer software under section 115A(1A).

The use of the\nexpressions &quot;in respect of copyright in any book to an Indian concern&quot; or &quot;in respect of any\ncomputer software to a person resident in India&quot; in section 115A(1 A) shows that for the\npurposes of krIcome-tax copyright &quot;computer software&quot; is different from copyright in any\n&quot;book&quot; though both are literary works under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_66\">Copyright Act, 1957</a>.\nTherefore, once the consideration is received by a non-resident for the transfer or all or any\nrights including the granting of a licence in respect of a patent, invention, model, design,\nsecret formula or process or similar property or any copy-right literary, artistic or scientific\nwork, the consideration received shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India and will be\ntaxable in India. Hence, by virtue of the amended Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_67\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> royalty\nincome will be taxable in India whether or not the non-resident has a residence or place of\nbusiness or business connection in India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41077886\" id=\"span_26\">11.9.

It is described as a\n&quot;software licence agreement&quot;, wherein it is averred that customer accepts an individual, non-\ntransferable and non-exclusive licence to use the licenced software program(s) on the terms and\nconditions enumerated in the agreement. It is further averred that the customer-Samsung Electronics-\nshall protect confidential information and shall not remove any copyright, confidentiality or other•\nproprietary rights provided by the nonresident. However, what is granted under the said licence is only\na licence to use the software for internal business without having any right for making any alteration\nor reverse engineering or creating sub-licences. What is. transferred under the said licence is the\nlicence to use the software and the copyright continue to be Jvith the non-resident as per the agreement.\nEven as per the agreement entered into with the other distributors as also the end-user licence\nagreement, it is clear that the distributor would get exclufive non-transferable licence within the\nterritory for• which he is appointed and he has got right to distribute via resellers the software, upon\npayment of the licences set forth in exhibit A to the agreement only to end users pursuant to a valid\nActuate shrinkwrap or other actuate licence agreement and except as expressly set forth in the said\nagreement, distributor may not rent, lease, loan, sell or• otherwise distribute the software the\ndocumentation or any derivative works based upon the software or documentation in whole or in part.\nDistributor shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive or modem the source\ncode for the software. The distributor shall have no rights to the software other than the rights expressly\nset forth in the agreement. The distributor shall not mods or• copy any part of the software or\ndocumentation. The distributor may not use subdistributors for firther distribution of the software and\ndocumentation without the prior consent of Actuate. What is charged is the licence fee to be paid by the\ndistributor of the software as enumerated in exhibit A to the agreement. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41077886\" id=\"span_28\">Further, clause 6.01 of the\nagreement dealing with title states that the distributor acknowledges that actuate and its suppliers\nretain all right, title and interest in and to the original, and any copies (by whomever produced), of\nthe software or documentation and ownership of all patent copyright, trade mark, trade secret and\nother intellectual property rights pertaining thereto, shall be and remain the sole property of\nActuate. The distributor shall not be an owner of any copies of, or any interest in, the software, but\nrather is licenced pursuant to the agreement to use and distribute such copies. Actuate represents\nthat it has the right to enter into the agreement and grant the licences provided therein and\nconfidentiality is protected. Therefore, on reading the contents of the respective agreement entered\ninto by the respondents with the non-resident, it is clear that under the agreement, what is transferred\nis only a licence to use the copyright belonging to the non-resident subject to the terms and\nconditions of the agreement, as <a href=\"/doc/41077886/\" id=\"a_70\">referred to above</a>, and the nonresident supplier continues to be the\nowner of the copyright and all other intellectual property rights. It is well settled that copyright is a\nnegative right. It is an umbrella of many rights and licence is granted for making use of the copyright\nin respect of shrink wrapped software/off-the-shelf software under the respective agreement, which\nauthorizes the end user, i.e., the customer to make use of the copyright software contained in the\nsaid software, which is purchased off the shelf or imported as shrink wrapped software and the same\nwould amount to transfer of part of the copyright and transfer of right to use the copyright for\ninternal business as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. Therefore, the contention of the\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the respondents that there is no transfer of copyright or any\npart thereof under the agreements entered into by the respondent with the nonresident supplier of\nsoftware cannot be accepted ............</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">                                                    IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                          IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                   IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                               Page 26 of 331</span>\n\nIt is well settled that in the absence of any definition of &quot;copyright&quot; in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_71\">Income-tax Act</a> or the DTAA\nwith the respective countries, in view of <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_72\">article 3</a> of the DTAA, reference is to be made to the respective\nlaw regarding the definition of &quot;copyright&quot;, namely, <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_73\">Copyright Act, 1957</a>, in India, wherein it is clearly\nstated that &quot;literary work&quot; includes computer programmes, tables and compilations including computer\n(databases). <a href=\"/doc/1454107/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 16</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, states that no personshall be entitled to copyright\nor any similar right in any work, whether published or unpublished, otherwise than under and in\naccordance with the provisions of the said Act or of any other law for the time being in force, but nothing\nin this section shall be construed as abrogating any right or jurisdiction to restrain a breach of trust or\nconfidence. <a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 14</a> of the said Act dealing with the, meaning of &quot;copyright&quot; reads as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">             &quot;14.

Accordingly, we hold that right to make a copy of the software and use it for internal business\nby making copy of the same and storing the same in the hard disk of the designated computer and taking\nback up copy would itself amount to copyright work under <a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_82\">section 14(1)</a> of the Act and licence is granted\nto use the software by making copies, which work, but for the licence granted would have constituted\ninfringement of copyright and the licencee is in possession of the legal copy of the software under the\nlicence. Therefore, the contention of the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents that there\nis no transfer of any part of copyright or copyright and transaction only involves sale of copy of the\ncopyright software cannot be accepted It is also to be noted that what is supplied is the copy of the\nsoftware of which the respondent-supplier continues to be the owner of the copyright and what is granted\nunder the licence is only right to copy the software as per the terms of the agreement, which, but for the\nlicence would amount to infringement of copyright and in view of the licence granted the same would\nnot amount to infringement under <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_83\">section 52</a> of the Copyright Act as <a href=\"/doc/100867385/\" id=\"a_84\">referred to above</a>. Therefore, the\namount paid to the non-resident supplier towards supply of shrink-wrapped software, or oche shelf\nsoftware is not the price of the C. D. alone nor software alone nor the price of licence granted. This is\na combination of all and in substance, unless licence is granted permitting the end user to copy and\ndownload the software, the dumb C. D. containing the software would not in any way be helpful to the end\nuser as software would become operative only if it is downloaded to the hardware of the designated\ncomputer as per the terms and conditions of the agreement and that makes the difference between the\ncomputer software and copyright in respect of books or prerecorded music software as book and\nprerecorded music C D. can be used once they are purchased, but so far as software stored in dumb C D.\nis concerned, the transfer of dumb C D. by itself would not confer any right upon the end user and the\npurpose of the C. D. is only to enable the end user to take a copy of the software and to store it in\nthe hard disk of the designated computer if licence is granted in that behalf and in the absence of\nlicence, the same would amount to infringement of copyright, which is exclusively owned by non-\nresident suppliers, who would continue to be the proprietor of copyright. Therefore, there is no\nsimilarity between the transaction of purchase of the book or prerecorded music C. D. or the C. D.\ncontaining software and in view of the same, the Legislature in its wisdom, has treated the literary work\nlike books and other articles separately from &quot;computer&quot; software within the meaning of the\n&quot;copyright&quot; as <a href=\"/doc/100867385/\" id=\"a_85\">referred to above</a> under <a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_86\">section 14</a> of the Copyright Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">                                                     IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                      IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                           IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                    IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                Page 30 of 331</span>\n\n\n\nIt is also clear from the abovesaid analysis of the DTAA, the Income-tax Act, the Copyright Act that\nthe payment would constitute &quot;royalty&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_87\">article 12(3)</a> of the DTAA and even as\nper the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_88\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act as the definition of &quot;royalty&quot; under clause 9(1)(vi) of\nthe Act is broader than the definition of &quot;royalty&quot; under the DTAA as the right that is transferred in\nthe present case is the transfer of copyright; including the right to Make copy of software for internal\nbusiness, and payment made in that regard would constitute &quot;royalty&quot; for imparting of any\ninformation concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific knowledge, experience or skill\nas per clause (iv) of Explanation 2 to section - 9(1)(vi) of the Act. In any view of the matter, in view\nof the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_89\">section 90</a> of the Act, agreements with foreign countries DTAA would override\nthe provisions of the Act. Once it is held that payment made by the respondents to the non-resident\ncompanies would amount to &quot;royalty&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_90\">article 12</a> of the DTAA with the\nrespective country, it is clear that the payment made by the respondents to the non-resident supplier\nwould amount to royalty. In view of the said finding, it is clear that there is obligation on the part of the\nrespondents to deduct tax at source under <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_91\">section 195</a> of the Act and consequences would follow as held\nby the hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court while remanding these appeals to this court. Accordingly, we answer the\nsubstantial question of law in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee by holding that on the facts\nand in the circumstances of the case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal was not justified in holding that\nthe amount(s) paid by the respondent(s) to the foreign software suppliers was not &quot;royalty&quot; and that the\nsame did not give rise to any &quot;income&quot; taxable in India and wherefore, the respondent(s) were not liable\nto deduct any tax at source and pass the following order:&quot;\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1562427\" id=\"span_36\">11.10.

In Millennium IT Software Ltd., In re (338 ITR 391) (AAR), the Authoth ruled on the facts of\nthe case that :-\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">&quot;The applicant entered into a software licence and maintenance agreement (agreement) with\nIndian Commodity and Exchange Limited (ICEL) on March 27, 2009. Under the agreement the\napplicant allowed ICEL to use the software product (the licenced programme) owned by it. The&#x27;\nlicenced programme was to be installed into the computer machines designated by ICEL. The\napplicant was to deploy its&#x27; personnel to the designated site to train the employees of ICEL. The\napplicant was required to provide at its own cost, maintenance and support services. For\ninstallation and implementation of the licenced programme, the applicant was to be paid Rs. 4\ncrore. The software became live on August 20, 2009. The licence to use the licenced programme\nwas for four years and thereafter its renewal was left to the discretion of ICEL. The agreement\nprovided for payment of licensing and maintenance fee from January 1, 2010 till December 31,\n2014. The mode of the payment was a fixed amount of Rs. 50 lakhs per quarter plus an additional\nfee based on the utilization of the licenced programme by ICEL, so that the total amount payable\nwould not exceed Rs. 150 lakhs per quarter. The licenced programme was developed by the\napplicant at its development centre in Sri Lanka. The rights granted&#x27; under the agreement were\nnon-excluSive, non-transferable, non-assignable, indivisible. The applicant had granted &#x27;GEL the\nright to make copies of the licenced programme to be installed on equipment only at designated\nsites of ICEL. Each copy was to carry copyright, trade mark and other notices relating to\nproprietary rights of the applicant. ICEL could not sell, distribute or disclose the licenced\nprogramme or associated documents to any third party., Use of the source code and reverse\nengineering of the licenced programme was strictly prohibited.

K Shridhar (Member).-(i) Under Indian copyright law, computer programmes are considered\nto be literary works and accordingly entitled to copyright protection under <a href=\"/doc/1129646/\" id=\"a_104\">section 14</a> of the Copyright\nAct, 1957. The definition of computer programme has been worded in liberal language. It defines\ncomputer programme as a set of instructions expressed in words, codes, schemes or in any other form.\nThe use of this language signifies the legislative intent to award copyright protection to both the source\ncode and the object code of the computer programme. During the process of registration of a copyright\nin ti computer programme, the author also files the object code of the software with the Registrar of\nCopyrights. Thus authorship of both the source code and the object code are protected by the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_105\">Copyright\nAct</a> as literary work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">  (ii) <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 52</a> of the Copyright Act specifies the acts which do not constitute infringement of\n  copyright. <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 52(aa)</a> uses the term &quot;lawfill possessor&quot;. It thus, carves out an exception for\n  lawful possessors of a computer programme as far as copies or adaptation for personal use is\n  concerned. The purchase of software from a reseller is payment for use of intellectual property and\n  not for the purchase of goods, unless the payment falls under the exception provided by the\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                          Page 33 of 331</span>\n\n\nsecond proviso to sec 9(1)(vi) of the 1961 Act. What had been licenced squarely fell within\nthe definition of computer programme under <a href=\"/doc/124202294/\" id=\"a_108\">section 2(ffc)</a> of the Copyright Act and was\ncopyrightable subject mailer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">(iii) The scope of the agreement extended beyond installation and implementation 07 -the\nlicenced programme. The maintenance service in respect of the licenced programme was an\nintegral part of agreement. In bifurcating the payments before and after installation and\nimplementation, the nature of the payments remained royally for the use of the licenced\nprogramme and would not change from royalty to business income. If it was to be in the\nnature of business income the agree/hent would have been for sale and service of licenced\nprogramme and the fee paid would have been taxable as business income under <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_109\">article 7</a> of\nthe DTAA, depending on whether or not the applicant had a permanent establishment in India\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_110\">article 5</a> of the DTAA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">(iv) Therefore since without the agreement being in place, any usage of the computer programme\nby the customers would have amounted to copyright infringement, the payment made under the\nagreement was for Obtaining the right to use the&#x27;copyright lit the software and was taxable as\nroyalty under the DTAA and the 1961 Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">         Per P. K. Balasubramanyan (Chairman).-(0 In terms of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_111\">InCome-tax Act, 1961</a>\n         royalty means consideration for the transfer of all or any right, including the granting\n         of a licence, in respect of any copyright or literary work. What the applicant had\n         granted to ICIEL, was a licence to use the computer programme developed by it and\n         owned by it and over which it had a copyright. This was done fora- consideration. This\n         was a licence recognized by the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_112\">Copyright Act</a> and was &#x27;a known mode of exploitation\n         of a copyright. The applicant had not parted with its title over the copyright in the\n         software. It had conveyed to another a right to use the software over which it had a\n         copyright. The right of user of software, thus given, involved the right to use the\n         copyright. The user of a software created, over which a copyright is acquired cannot\n         be divorced from the use of the copyright itself. The right granted for use of a\n         copyrighted article for a consideration, would also be royalty. It was, therefore, not\n         possible to accept the argument that what was involved was the mere permitting of the\n         right to use a copyrighted article. Indian law does not diStinguish between copyrighted\n         article and the copyright.

The software is a literary work and the copyright of\nthe creator over the software is an important and commercially valuable right.

Ground Nos. 10 &amp; 11 relate to the action of AO in taxing&#x27; the distribution fee as &quot;Royalty&quot;\nunder <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 12</a> of the tax treaty. <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 12</a> of the DIM between India and Ireland is reproduced as\nunder:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">           &quot;The term &quot;Royalties&quot; as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a\n          consideration for the use of or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific\n          work including cinematograph films or films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting,\n                                                   IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                    IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                         IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                  IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                              Page 40 of 331</span>\n\n\n         any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process or for the use of or\n         the right to use industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, other than an aircraft, or for\n         information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\"> 11.16. There is no benefit available to the assessee from the provisions of the treaty, although\n treaty provisions will override the Act, as the mischief is covered by the provisions of the treaty.\n It covers right to use copyright of literary work which includes the computer program, trade\n mark and process. For reasons stated above, I have held that the right to use trade mark has\n been transferred as also the right to use copyrighted computer program and process. Therefore,\n the action of the AO in holding that the distribution fee is actually consideration received for\n the right to use / licence to use a computer program / process viz., Adwords program, is upheld.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_116\"> 11.17. The assessee&#x27;s representative strongly relied on two decisions of the Mumbai Bench of\n the Hon&#x27;ble Tribunal viz., (i) Pinstorm Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No. 4332/Mum/2009) &amp; (ii)\n Yahoo India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT (140 TTJ 195). I have carefully gone through both the orders.\n <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"89798900\" id=\"span_47\">The former blindly follows its decision in <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_138\">Yahoo India</a> case. The facts of this case are that the\n Department of the Tourism, Government of India, hired the services of the assessee company\n to approach the foreign principal to provide uploading and display services for hosting the\n banner advertisement at Yahoo Hongkong portal. The assessee company hired the services of\n the principal for the same and made a payment without deducting tax at source. The Bench\n observed that banner advertisement hosting services did not involve use or right to use any\n industrial, commercial or scientific equipment and no such use was actually granted by the\n principal to the assessee company. Therefore, such payments did not amount Royalty. The\n facts and the issues in the case are completely different from the instant case. At no stage\n did the Mumbai Bench consider what exactly is the Adword program, nor did it have\n occasion to examine\n\nthe right to use trade mark and other intellectual property rights. Hence, the decision rendered <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_139\">in that\ncase</a> is peculiar to the facts of its own and is not applicable in instant case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">                                                  IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                        IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                 IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                             Page 41 of 331</span>\n\n\nThat the fee payable was for imparting_ information concerning technics! industrial, commercial\nor scientific knowledge and experience &amp; That the fee payable was on account of &quot;right to use\nindustrial, commercial &amp; scientific equipment&quot; :-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">11.18. The AO held that the Adwords platform is similar to a portal running on service and Adwords\nplatform is based on the search engine technology of Google. Henc4 Adword program in one way\nis also a commercial-scientific equipment and without having access to servers running the Adwords\nplatform. Without the use of the programme, the assessee company cannot perform its function as\nper distribution agreement. Hence, the distribution right also includes the right to use industrial,\ncommercial &amp; scientific equipments which are the servers.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">11.19. I have already held that the Adwords program is a complex computer program and a process\nwithin the meaning of the provisions of the Act. The Adwords Program was developed by Google\nIreland and no information concerning the technical, industrial, commercial or scientific aspects\nhave been found to have been passed on to the assessee company. The assessee company simply\nhas the right to use the Adwords program and thereafter, is involved in collection of advertisement\nrevenue. It retains part of the collection on cost plus profit basis and the balance is remitted\nto Google Ireland. Hence, there is no question of any exchange of information nor was any\nequipment utilised by the assessee company. It cannot be said that the assessee&#x27; company gained\nthe right to use any kind of industrial, scientific equipment on the facts of the instant case. There\nhas been the instance, that, Google Ireland has provided training to the staff of the assessee\ncompany, but such training is restricted to use of the Adwords program and not on how to develop\nthe Adwords program. This is clear from the following observations of the AO:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\"> Google Ireland provides training to the sales team of Google India on the following:\n  Training on the AdWords program and how the AdWords program may benefit the\n     advertisers in India\n  Training on the functionality of the tools available to optimize and follow an ad\n     campaign on the AdWords system;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">                                                 IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                       IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                            Page 42 of 331</span>\n\n\n  The new features/ additions made to the AdWords program and the implications\n     for advertisers, etc.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">11.20.

Therefore, a server is nothing but\ncomputer software backed by necessary hardware. Thus, it cannot be said that the assessee\ngained right to use any scientific equipment. Since, Google Ireland has not parted with the\ncopyright it holds, in the Adwords program, it cannot be said that any kind of technical knowhow\nhas been transferred to the assessee company. Hence, without prejudice to my view in holding\nthat the remitted amount is Royalty on different grounds, I am not in an agreement with the AO\non these issues.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_119\"> The Google Ireland rendered services to enable the assessee company to market and\n distribute the Adwords program :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\"> 11.21.

Functionality of tools available on software and new\n        features made to the Adwords program have also been covered in the training process.

Before the CIT(A), the appellant has also challenged the AO&#x27;s finding that\n\nassessee is not a beneficial owner of sum paid/payable by the GIPL. The CIT(A) has\n\nextracted the observation of the AO on this issue and made a reference of certain judicial\n\npronouncements in his order and concluded that the GIL is the beneficial owner of the\n                                                     IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                      IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                           IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                    IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                Page 44 of 331</span>\n\nsum paid/payable by the GIPL, having relied upon the certificate of the Revenue\n\nauthorities of Ireland.

In the instant case, the following facts are quite clear :-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">(i)      The Google AdWords Programme distribution agreement is between GIL &amp; GIBL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">(ii)     The assessee Distributor has made payments for acquisition of distribution rights to GIL alone.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">(iii)    The assessee has filed a notarized certificate of incorporation of GIL from the Irish Authorities to\nestablish that the entity is incorporated in the Company Acts of Ireland.

Now, in this light, it will be relevant to analyze the AO&#x27;s attempt to distinguish the judgement\nof the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Mumbai read with the decision of the Mumbai Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble\nTribunal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">         Firstly, in the absence of agreement, it could not be ascertained whether the Dutch.\n          company acted or did not act as an &#x27;agent&#x27; or &#x27;nominee&#x27; of other group companies or was\n          a &#x27;conduit&#x27; between one of the group companies and the Indian company.

It is very clear\nthat the amounts in question have reached the financial statements of GIL and the same is subject to\ntax under Irish Revenue Loss. Absence of agreements was not held to be crucial in the case analysed\nabove, The Apex Court in McDowell and Co. Ltd. v. CTO (154 ITR 148) was clearly of the view that\nTax planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of the law. Colourable devices\ncannot be part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage or entertain the belief that it is\n                                                    IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                          IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                   IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                               Page 45 of 331</span>\n\n\nhonourable to avoid the payment of tax by dubious methods. It is the obligation of every citizen to\npay the taxes honestly without resorting to subterfuges.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">There is behind taxation laws as much moral sanction as is behind any other welfare legislation and it\nis a pretence to say that avoidance of taxation is not unethical and that it stands on no less a moral plane\nthan honest payment of taxation. The proper way to construe a taxing statute, while considering a device\nto avoid tax, is not to ask whether the provisions should be construed literally or liberally nor whether\nthe transaction is not unreal and not prohibited by the statute, but whether the transaction is a device\nto avoid tax and whether the transaction is such that the judicial process may accord its approval to\nit. It is neither fair nor desirable to expect the Legislature to intervene and take care of every device\nand scheme to avoid taxation. It is up to the court to take stock to determine the nature of the new and\nsophisticated legal devices to avoid tax and to expose the devices for what they really are and to refuse\nto give judicial benediction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_129\">By the Court: &quot;The evil consequences of tax avoidance are manifold. First, there is substantial loss of\nmuch needed public revenue, particularly in a welfare State like ours. Next, there is the serious\ndisturbance caused to the economy of the country by the piling up of mountains of black money, directly\ncausing inflation. Then there is &#x27;the large hidden loss&#x27; to the community by some of the best brains in the\ncountry being involved in the perpetual war waged between the tax avoider and his expert team of\nadvisers, lawyers and accountants on one side and the tax gatherer and his, perhaps not so skilful,\nadvisers, on the other side. Then again there is the &#x27;sense of injustice and inequality which tax avoidance\narouses in the breasts of those who are unwilling or unable to profit by it&#x27;. Last, but not the least, is the\nethics of transferring the burden of tax liability to the shoulders of the guideless, good citizens from\nthose of the &#x27;artful dodgers&#x27;.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_130\">    In the instant case, the AO has failed to demonstrate whether the transaction constituted a\n    colourable device so as to avoid tax. Hence, I cannot concur with him on this point at all.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\"> Secondly, the certificate of beneficial ownership furnished by the taxpayer is the interpretation\n    arrived at by the Netherlands authorities.

Being aggrieved with the order of the CIT(A), assessee as well as the Revenue are\n\nin appeal before the Tribunal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_139\">17.    The learned Counsel for the assessee Shri. Percy Pardiwala, Sr. Advocate has\n\ninvited our attention to certain facts explained by the assessee through affidavit filed by\n\nits Director Mr. Hari Raju with the submission that assessee company was incorporated\n\non 16.12.2003 under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_141\">Companies Act</a> and in 2004, assessee company set up its first\n\noffice at Bangalore to provide Information Technology (IT) Services to Google Inc., USA\n\n(hereinafter called as &quot;Google Inc&quot;). Vide agreement dated 01.04.2004 entered into\n\nbetween the appellant company and GIL, the appellant company was to provide IT enabled\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                      Page 47 of 331</span>\n\nservices (ITES) to GIL. Pursuant to the same, the appellant company set up an ITES\n\ndivision in Hyderabad for provision of ITES services. The primary activity being carried\n\nout by the ITES division of the appellant company involves rendering of support services\n\nin administering the Google editorial and Government&#x27;s guidelines in relation to global\n\nadvertisements (&quot;Ad review&quot;) manually before the advertisements can be placed on\n\nGoogle Web properties. Thereafter, the appellant company entered into Google AdWords\n\nProgram Distribution Agreement dated 12.12.2005 with GIL pursuant to which the\n\nappellant company was appointed as a non-exclusive, authorized distributor of online\n\nadvertisement space to advertisers in India under Google AdWords Program.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_140\">18.   Subsequently, the appellant company entered into a Google Reseller Agreement on\n\n01.07.2012 with GIL, pursuant to which the earlier agreement dated 12.12.2005 was\n\nterminated and the appellant company was appointed as non-exclusive, authorized reseller\n\nof online advertising space to advertisers in India under the Google AdWords Program.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_141\">19.   The learned Counsel for the assessee further contended that the entire case of the\n\nRevenue is that the payment made by the appellant company to GIL amounts of\n\nconsideration for the right to use copyright/trade mark/process/software. The case of the\n\nRevenue is also that the payment made by the Appellant Company to GIL amounts to\n\nconsideration for the grant of distribution rights of Google AdWords Program and since\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                        Page 48 of 331</span>\n\nthe same is covered within the meaning of &quot;similar property&quot;, payments thereof is\n\n&#x27;Royalty&#x27;. It was further contended that the assumption on which the AO has proceeded\n\non to conclude that the payments made by the Appellant partake the character of royalty,\n\nare unfounded and needless to state, were drawn owing to lack of proper enquiry and\n\ninvestigation by the AO. It was further submitted that the function of the appellant is that\n\nof mere distributor having no access to the alleged intellectual properties as alleged by the\n\nAO and any such access to such intellectual property is only the incidental to the\n\ndistribution function, for which no separate payment is made.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_142\">20.   The learned Counsel for the assessee further placed a reliance upon the affidavit\n\ndated 13.03.2018 filed by Mr. Hari Raju (Director of the Appellant Company) in which it\n\nis clarified that the activities performed by the Appellant Company, pursuant to agreement\n\ndated 01.04.2004, entered into with GIL are for the rendering of ITES services\n\nindependently of the activities pursuant to agreement dated 12.12.2005 (superseded\n\npursuant to agreement dated 12.12.2005) for distribution/reselling of online advertisement\n\nspace to Indian advertisers and vice-versa. It has also been clarified through this affidavit\n\nthat the Appellant Company does not have access to personal information of the user of\n\nany Google services offered on the internet and therefore is no capacity to provide access\n\nto anyone regarding such information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_143\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                       Page 49 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_144\">21.   The learned Counsel for the assessee Mr. Pardiwala further invited our attention to\n\nthe fact that at different points of time, various law enforcement agencies in India\n\napproached the Appellant Company with a request for personal information about various\n\nusers of Google services offered on the internet, to which the Appellant Company has no\n\nother option but to decline such request. In order to justify these facts, the assessee has\n\nfiled the copies of communications exchanged between them and the law enforcement\n\nagencies. It was further contended that from these evidences, it is clear that the appellant\n\ncompany has no access to the personal information of users of Google services except\n\ninformation about advertisers using Google AdWord Programs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">22.   It was further explained in the affidavit that approximately 94% of global\n\nadvertisements i.e., advertisements to be published for advertisers across globe, are\n\nreviewed by an automated system based onservers/infrastructure located outside India and\n\napproximately 6% of the advertisements are routed by the automated system for manual\n\nreview by ITES teams based globally out of which ITES division of the Appellant in India\n\nis one of such centre. Online advertisements flagged for manual review from around the\n\nworld are sent to any of such divisions located around the world based on language used\n\nin the advertisement and operative time of each such ITES centre around the world. The\n\nrouting of advertisement for review is a purely system driven automated process with no\n\nhuman intervention. It was further contended that while performing the manual Ad review\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                        Page 50 of 331</span>\n\nvia its ITES division as specifically identified, has no control over choosing\n\nadvertisements/advertisers for manual review, uploaded by a specific advertiser from a\n\nspecific country. For providing these services, GIL pays a service fee to the Appellant in\n\nterms of the agreement dated 01.04.2004.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_146\">23.   The learned Counsel for the assessee further invited our attention to certain facts\n\nwith the submission that in order to carry out its distribution function under the distribution\n\nagreement, the appellant has a separate sales and marketing team working from its\n\nGurgaon and Mumbai Office and its team operates independently of the ITES and other\n\ndivisions of the Appellalnt and is dedicated purely to the distribution segment of the\n\nAppellant. The functions of this team are to ensure promotion of Google AdWord\n\nservices, billing and collection of payments and other day to day business operations\n\nrelating to the distribution segment of the Appellant&#x27;s business. It was further clarified\n\nthat as per terms of agreement, GIL has also supplied online advertisement space to the\n\nappellant for online sales to the advertisers in India. The distribution team as part of its\n\nsales and marketing function, under Distribution Agreement, provides necessary support,\n\nclarifications and assistance to its customers in India (advertisers who have chosen to pay\n\nin INR) and in the course of providing aforesaid assistance, the team has access to the\n\nAdWords account created by that advertiser. In any case, the distribution team of the\n\nAppellant has no access to data/personal information pertaining to end user of any of the\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                       Page 51 of 331</span>\n\nGoogle properties such as the Google Search Engine etc; like his name, age, gender, etc.\n\nThe Appellant Company also does not even have access to the Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;)\n\naddress of users of any Google service and therefore is not in a position to share that with\n\nanyone/advertisers (including Government and law enforcement agencies).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">24.   It was further contended that the Appellant does not operate any platform or\n\ngateway or is not the proprietary/licencee of any technology/tools/features that are part of\n\nthe Google AdWords Program and therefore does not have access to or control over the\n\ninfrastructure or processes that are involved in running the Google AdWords Program. It\n\nwas further clarified that while performing the distribution activities, the Appellant does\n\nnot have access or capacity to control the display of advertisements online. Even in other\n\nproducts of Google for example, GMAIL (email services) a person accessing his GMAIL\n\naccount may be exposed to certain advertisements, which an advertiser might have chosen\n\nto be displayed on GMAIL, however, the Appellant has no role to play in such display of\n\nadvertisements on GMAIL. Only an advertiser using Google AdWords Program, in his\n\nsole discretion, can choose which web property to have his advertisement displayed and\n\nin what manner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_148\">25.   It was further contended that Google AdWord Program is a &quot;self-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">serve&quot;onlineadvertising    service   provided      by    Google       (Google      Inc./GIL)       for\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                        Page 52 of 331</span>\n\nbusinesseswanting to display advertisement in relation to their websites and products on\n\nGoogle online property or a third party online property. The advertisers are required to\n\nupload his/her billing information, without which he/she will not be able to conclude the\n\naccount of creation process and his/her advertisement would not be displayed. Once the\n\nadvertiser chooses India as his/her location and INR as his billing currency, he gets into a\n\ncontract with the appellant, subject to him agreeing terms and conditions. The advertisers\n\nthat use Google AdWords Program for advertising on Google Search Engine can create\n\nrelevant advertisement by selecting anappropriate title and text to describe its business and\n\nthe forms of text of the advertisement. The advertiser also selects keywords or phrases\n\nthat may match with a &quot;search query&quot; (relevant to the business of such advertiser) that\n\npeople input while using Google Search Engine. The keywords are used to trigger an\n\nadvertisement that is relevant to the search query of the user. Multiple advertisers can\n\nchoose the same Keyword. The keywords or phrases are neithersold or allowed to be used\n\nexclusively by anyone advertiser.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_150\">26.   It was further explained that the advertisement on the google search engine is\n\ndisplayed as &quot;sponsored link&quot; with a tab marked as &quot;AD&quot;. It may be displayed at the top\n\nof the organic search results that are linked to various websites that are relevant to the\n\n&quot;search query&quot; and user of the Google Search Engine has a input. The organic search\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                       Page 53 of 331</span>\n\nresults are ranked and displayed algorithmically on the basis of certain objectivecriteria\n\namongst them being relevance. Clicking on a website link that is part of the organic search\n\nresult does not result in any revenue for the appellant. The Google AdWords Program\n\nuses cost per click pricing methodology which means, for example that advertiser pays\n\nonly when his/her advertisement in the form of &quot;sponsored link&quot;getsclicked by a user of\n\nthe Google Search Engine. The price per click is determined by the advertiser in his/her\n\nsole discretion and the Appellant has no role in negotiating such price. The advertiser\n\ndoes not pay the appellant for the display of the advertisement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_151\">27.   It was further contended that the advertiser sets a daily budget, as per his own\n\ndiscretion, using the web interface of Google AdWords program, which, when achieved\n\nthe advertisement of the advertiser stops displaying. The appellant has no role in\n\nnegotiating such budget except for providing customer support services to the advertiser\n\nin order to familiarize the advertiser of various features of the Google AdWord Program.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">The Google AdWord Program is an independent product offered online to any one who\n\nwants to advertise its business. The pre-conditions for the proper use of Google AdWords\n\nProgram are the requirement of having an e-mail account, a website for one&#x27;s business,\n\nwho wishes to advertise and billing details. There are no other conditions for an advertiser\n\nto be able to use Google AdWords Program. Once the advertisement is created by the\n\nadvertiser using the web interface of Google AdWords Program, the same is uploaded and\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                        Page 54 of 331</span>\n\nstored on data servers outside India and advertisement uploaded by an Indian advertiser\n\nlocated in India or elsewhere may be reviewed by the ITES division of the Appellant, if\n\nrouted to such division of the Appellant by the automated system, and the Appellant&#x27;s\n\nITES division has no control over which advertisements are routed to it for review. The\n\nreview process is only for ensuring that the advertisement does not violate editorial\n\nguidelines of Google and local Government regulations of the jurisdiction where\n\nadvertisement needs to be displayed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"35917315\" id=\"span_62\">28.   Mr. Pardiwala further contended that the fundamental submissions of the assessee\n\nwhich has been completely missed by the AO is that the revenue arising from the\n\ndistribution agreement dated 12.12.2005 and superceded by the reseller agreement dated\n\n01.07.2012 whereby the distributor or reseller&#x27;s rights were granted to the assessee owing\n\nto the nature of the business income in the hands of the non-resident and in the absence of\n\nthe permanent establishment such non-resident in India no portion of such income could\n\nhave been brought to tax. It was further submitted that the resort to <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_142\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the\n\nAct is contrary to the legal position since 9(1)(vi) is applicable only to taxation of passive\n\nincome. Thus in the absence of any permanent establishment, the income of non-resident\n\nwas not chargeable to tax in India and consequently there arose no occasion for the\n\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_143\">section 195</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_144\">201</a> of the Act.

The learned Counsel for the assessee further invited our attention to the assessment\n\norder for the assessment year 2008-09 where the appellant was constituted a dependent\n\nagency PE of GIL i.e., non-resident. In that case, there was no whisper by the AO that\n\nreceipt in the hands of non-resident par-took the character of royalty income. The\n\nabsurdity of the whole situation further gets highlighted by the AO not even adverting the\n\nposition of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_150\">article 12</a> of the treaty where the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_151\">article 12(4)</a> specifically\n\nexcludes the application of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_152\">article 12</a> where there is a permanent establishment of non-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_159\">resident in the house country. The learned Counsel for the assessee further contended that\n\ndepartment needs to make up its mind whether the non-resident has a permanent\n\nestablishment or not. It is only when certain determination is concluded, the <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_153\">article 12</a> can\n\nbe applied to determine whether receipts are in the nature of royalty income.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_160\">31.   The learned Counsel Mr. Pardiwala further invited our attention that from July\n\n2016, the legislature in its wisdom has introduced the equalization levy. The whole\n\npurpose of bringing this levy was to avoid protected litigation on the existence of\n\npermanent establishment and to capture the income of non-resident who on account of\n\nabsence of permanent establishment as per the existing provisions under treaty, escaped\n\nthe net of taxation in India. It was further contended that in assessment year 2017-18,\n\n2018-19, the department has taken a position that equalization levy is applicable on\n\npayment made by the advertiser to non-resident for the purchase of online advertisement\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                        Page 57 of 331</span>\n\nspace. These oscillating views taken by the department reflects the confusion behind\n\ndepartment&#x27;s logic to bring to tax receipts under dispute tax in India and are thus devoid\n\nof any merit.    Therefore, the order CIT(A) treating the remittance to GIL as royalty,\n\ndeserves to be set aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_161\">32.   The learned Counsel for the assessee further invited our attention to provisions of\n\nFinance Bill, 2016 with the submission that the legislature has introduced the equalization\n\nlevy at 6% of the amount of consideration for specific service received/receivable by non-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">resident not having permanent establishment (PE) in India, from the resident in India who\n\ncarries out business or profession or from a non-resident having permanent establishment\n\nin India with certain safe guards.      Keeping in view the object of introduction of\n\nequalization levy on specific payments to non-AE, the payment made by the assessee to\n\nits AE under Distributor AdWord Agreement should be considered as business profit in\n\nthe hands of non-resident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_163\">33.   The learned Counsel for the assessee has also invited our attention to provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_154\">article 12</a> of DTAA with Ireland with the submission that the term royalty used in this\n\narticle means the payment of any kind received as consideration for the use of or the right\n\nto use, any copyright of literary, artistic, scientific work including cinematography, films,\n\netc. As per the definition of word royalty as per DTAA, royalty can only be taxed on\n\nreceipt basis in the hands of the recipient i.e., non-resident.

It was further\n\ncontended that as per clause 2.6 of the AdWord Program Distribution Agreement, the\n\ndistributor (GIPL) will provide after sales services to advertisers in accordance with broad\n\ninstructions, training and standards of Google. Clause 3.1 of the AdWord agreement\n\nfurther provides for Google Ireland (GIL) to provide advertising space through the\n\nAdWord Programme for distribution by the distributor i.e., GIPL/Appellant to advertisers\n\nas set forth therein.

It was further contended that as per clause 6.1 of Service\n\nAgreement, the GIL will disclose certain confidential information to Google India solely\n\nto permit Google India to perform its obligations under the agreement. It was also\n\nstipulated in the Service Agreement that the Appellant agrees that such confidential\n\ninformation shall be kept secret by the Appellant during the term of the Agreement and as\n\nper clause 12.5, on termination of the Service Agreement, Google India shall discontinue\n\nusing of confidential information, documentation, intellectual property and the software\n\ntechnology and shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

The learned Standing Counsel further contended that from the reading of all clauses\n\nof the service agreement in conjunction with Google AdWord Program Distribution\n\nAgreement, it is clear beyond doubt that Google India has been provided with thelicence\n\nto use IP for which Google India has agreed to make certain payments to Google Ireland\n\nand same is in the nature of royalty, as per provisions of <a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_161\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act read\n\nwith DTAA. It was further contended that Google Ireland is allowing Google India to\n\naccess all intellectual properties and confidential information and the same is being used\n\nby the Appellant (Google India) for the activities related to distribution agreement. The\n\nobligation/distribution of the services agreement would make it clear that both the\n\ndocuments cannot be separated from each other and are to be read together.

It is an admitted position that the appellant has an\n\nobligation to the advertiser to provide pre-sales and post-sales services and the pre-sale\n\nand post-sale services can only be provided through ITES division of the appellant with\n\naccess to the database and the confidential information owned by Google Ireland and\n\nlicenced to Google India, the appellant. In view of the agreement being entered by\n\nGoogle India with Google Ireland either on 12.12.2005 or on 01.04.2004 for the same\n\npurpose, the division of services by Google India by different divisions does not take\n\naway the impact of reading of both the agreements together, therefore both the\n\nagreements are inseparable. By reading of the obligations of Google India in both the\n\nagreements, it makes it clear that both the agreements has to be read together and cannot\n\nbe acted upon independent of each other. Hence the contention of the assessee that both\n\nthe agreements are different is an after-thought and liable to rejected.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\">42.

It was further contended that licence to sell presupposes licence being granted to\n\nthe distributor (Google India) and licence to sell enables Google India to transaction the\n\nlicence/right to use the Adword program. Therefore the consideration paid is for the\n\nlicence to enable Google India to resell the licence/right to use to the advertisers would\n\namount to payment of a royalty, because without licence if sale of advertisement space\n\nto the advertiser by the appellant in the search engine of Google, which is an IP would\n\namount to infringement of the rights being enjoyed by Google Ireland.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_180\">45.   The ld.

The entire\n\nsearch engine technology on which licence has been granted to Google India for selling\n\nadvertisement space to the advertisers is a &quot;process&quot; and the search engine technology\n\nis an IP.

In view of clause 3.1 of the distribution agreement, the appellant was granted\n\ntransfer of know-how and has also been provided access to internal tools for performing\n\nthe obligations under the Adword agreement. The statements recorded from the persons\n\nconcerned of the Google India which is reproduced by the AO in his order, would make\n\nit clear that marketing, distribution and maintenance of the Adword program is a\n\nresponsibility of Google India involving knowledge of tools and training on its usage,\n\nknowledge of trademark policy, add content policy, access to database and access to\n\nconfidential information. Such knowledge has been imparted through extensive training\n\nby Google Ireland to the appellant which would amount to transfer of know-how and\n\nliable for tax<a href=\"/doc/874582/\" id=\"a_168\"> u/s. 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act as royalty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_182\">47.

He further placed\n\nreliance upon the judgment of the AAR in the case of Cargo Community Network Ltd.,\n\n159 Taxman 243 in which it has been held that portal and server together constitute\n\nintegrated commercial and scientific equipment and for obtaining internet access to\n\nairlines, the use of portal without server is unthinkable.

In so far as the reference made by the assessee to High Power Committee dated\n\n16.12.1999 and Tax Treaty dated 01.02.2001, it was contended that payment by the\n\nadvertiser directly to the owner of the search engine could not amount to royalty and\n\nthere is no dispute on these facts, but the facts of the impugned cases are entirely\n\ndifferent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_195\">58.   With regard to taxability of royalty as per DTAA, the ld.

It is held by the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of GE India reported at (2010) 193 Taxman 234 (SC) and Ellie Lilly reported at\n\n(2009)178 Taxman 505 (SC) that provisions of section 195 has to be read along with\n\ncharging provisions i.e., <a href=\"/doc/42009/\" id=\"a_175\">section 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/648260/\" id=\"a_176\">5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/229141/\" id=\"a_177\">9</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_178\">90</a> of the Act. On conjoint reading of the above\n\nprovisions, it is clear that the amounts paid by the assessee to Google Ireland are\n\nchargeable under the Act on accrual basis. Hence contention of assessee that amount is\n\nchargeable in the hands of Google Ireland on receipt basis is misplaced.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">59.   It was further contended that if the language of definition of royalty under DTAA\n\nwith Ireland under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_179\">article 12(3)(a)</a> is read, the wordings of the term &quot;royalties&quot; as used\n\nin this article means payment of any kind received as consideration for the use .....&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">would clearly and unambiguously makes it clear that payment received as consideration\n\nfor the use would alone be considered as royalty. The words &quot;payments of any kind\n\nreceived as a consideration for the use of&quot; has to be read together and it would only mean\n\nthe classification of the income and not the method of accounting. Hence the contention\n\nof the assessee is misplaced.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_198\">60.   The ld. Standing counsel further invited our attention to the fact that the assessee\n\nhas provided IT services IT enabled services to Google Ireland in addition to marketing\n\nand distribution services for the adverts program. The assessee will be receiving\n\namounts for IT services and IT enabled services from Google Ireland according to\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                       Page 74 of 331</span>\n\nservices agreement and assessee will be paying Google Ireland in view of the marketing\n\nand distribution services for Adword program. It is an undisputed fact that the assessee\n\nis wholly owned subsidiary of Google. In view of the close connection between Google\n\nIndia and Google Ireland, the payments to be received by the assessee for IT services\n\nand IT enabled services from GIL can be adjusted towards payment made to GIL towards\n\nmarketing and distribution services for Adword program.The fact that the assessee has\n\nnot reflected the amounts paid to Google Ireland in the P&amp;L account would further\n\njustify the above aspect.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">61.   In the above context if the language employed in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_180\">article 12(3)(a)</a> of the DTAA\n\nspecifically with the words &quot;means payment of any kind received&quot; would mean the\n\nreceipt of amount by virtue of adjustment/set off in the books of account of the assessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">Further &quot;payment of any kind received&quot; has to be read as any mode of payment either\n\nby book adjustment/credit or actual payment. Any other meaning would read the\n\nlanguage redundant in view of the provisons of <a href=\"/doc/42009/\" id=\"a_181\">section 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/648260/\" id=\"a_182\">5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/229141/\" id=\"a_183\">9</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_184\">90</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_185\">195</a> of the Act. The\n\nDTAA does not determine the method of accounting and the year of taxability in respect\n\nof parties to the agreement. What the DTAA provides for is the extent of taxability of\n\nincome and the percentage of the tax on the income liable for tax and the distribution of\n\ntax among the countries party to the DTAA. Hence the language employed in defining\n\nthe meaning of royalty cannot be read to mean the method of accounting.

The section does not empower the payer to examine the\n\napplicability of the DTAA to the payee. The language of <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_187\">section 90(2)</a> of the Act makes\n\nit very clear beyond any doubt that option to exercise the benefit of either the Act or the\n\nDTAA is conferred on the non-resident. Hence at the stage of payment without there\n\nbeing any indication by the recipient, the payer cannot step into the shoes of recipient to\n\nexercise the option provided u/s. 90(2) and claim the benefit of DTAA. Therefore the\n\ncontention of the assessee that receipt in the hands of Google Ireland is liable to be taxed\n\non cash basis is completely baseless, also for the reason that Google Ireland itself has\n\nfiled return of income for the AY 2007-08 and 2008-09 and has declared its method\n\nfollowed for accounting as mercantile system of accounting. It was further contended\n\nthat in the case of Vodafone South Ltd., the Tribunal has categorically held that\n\napplicability of DTAA is not automatic and what is to be considered at the time of\n\npayment by the assessee is only regarding the chargeability of income under the Act and\n\nthe assessee cannot be permitted to take shelter under the DTAA as the benefit of DTAA\n\nis conferred only on the non-resident recipient.

He further placed heavy reliance upon the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings BV, 341\n\nITR 1 (SC) at para 67 &amp; 68 with the submission that in order to examine the real\n\ntransaction, the corporate veil is required to be lifted.

In view of the above aspects, if the corporate veil is\n\nlifted and transactions are examined, it is clear that the contention of the assessee that\n\nliability to deduct tax at source would arise in the year of payment is contrary to the\n\nscheme of the Act and also to the agreements entered into by Google India with Google\n\nIreland. In view of the above, the non-payment to Google Ireland by Google India\n\nutmost would be deferment of payment in view of the close relationship and will not\n\nhave any bearing on the taxability in the year of accrual.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_204\">64.   With regard to incidental use of trademark, the ld.

The Parliament has proposed\n\nthe equalization levy on the amount to be paid to the non-resident on digital advertising\n\nspace and the same has to be considered as business income.                    First of all, the\n\namendments are not applicable for the AY 2013-14 as the same are prospective.

Therefore, it cannot be said that appellant was under a bonafide belief\n\nthat he was not liable to deduct the TDS on such payment to GIL as it is a business profit\n\nin his hands.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_210\">70.   In rebuttal, the ld. Counsel for the assessee, Mr. Percy Pardiwalla, has contended\n\nthat the contentions of the revenue rather substantiate the averments of the appellant that\n\nnature of receipts are in the hands of non-resident was business income and in the\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                      Page 80 of 331</span>\n\nabsence of any determination of Permanent Establishment of the non-resident in India\n\nin the order of the AO, there was no question of applicability of section 195 and\n\nconsequently <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_196\">section 201</a> of the Act. For the AYs 2017-18 and 2018-19, the department\n\nhas taken a position that equalization levy is applicable on payments made by the\n\nappellant to non-resident for the purchase of online advertising space. All these views\n\nundertaken by the department reflect the confusion with the department&#x27;s logic to bring\n\nto tax receipts under dispute to tax in India and are thus devoid of any merit. It was\n\nfurther contended that Adword is a registered trademark in the name of Google Inc., the\n\nAdword program is an auction based advertising program that lets advertisers deliver\n\nrelevant advertisement targeting to such queries on web content across Google site and\n\nthrough the Google network. To clarify, Google Adword programmit was contended\n\nthat there are following 5 parties involved as far as transaction involving Indian\n\nadvertisers are concerned:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">      1. Google Inc. USA - The program owner of the Adword and legal owner of\n         Google web properties like Google search eninge.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">      2. GIL has got licence to exploit rates in Google web properties and\n         commercially exploit Google Adword program globally, except America&#x27;s\n         region.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">      3.

The Indian advertiser who enters into contract with the appellant has to pay the\n\nappellant an amount fixed by the advertiser for every click the viewer makes on its\n\nadvertisement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_212\">72.   With regard to the judgments of the jurisdictional High Court referred to by the\n\nrevenue, the ld. Sr. Consel, Mr. Pardiwalla has contended that use of software necessarily\n\nresults in payment of royalty is distinguishable because in all those cases, what was being\n\nexamined by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court was taxability of the payment made by\n\n*shrinkwrap software and has no relevance or bearing on the issue at hand. Thus\n\nreliance placed on the decision does not support the case of the revenue. Nowhere the\n\nappellant has been granted licence to use the software. The ld. Counsel reiterated his\n\ncontentions that ITES segment was set up in the year 2004 for providing back office\n\nsupport services which include ad review and review of the advertisement process is\n\nautomatic process and the systems itself directs any flagged advertisement for manual\n\nreview. There is no human intervention in the selection process as to where ad will get\n\nreviewed since, there are multiple locations providing this review. These ad review\n\nservices are provided to GIL not to the advertisers. The ld. Counsel further contended\n\nthat the argument of the revenue that right to modify the ads is not possible without the\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                       Page 82 of 331</span>\n\nlicence to use IPR is clearly baseless because the whole process of the advertising is that\n\nthe advertiser chooses the keywords, form of advertisements, advertising contents that\n\nis reflective of the business to be advertised.

With regard to the contention of the department that Google India has right to use\n\nGoogle brand features and therefore the payment made by the appellant is in the nature\n\nof royalty, the ld. Counsel for the assessee has submitted that the argument of the\n\ndepartment is contrary to the precedent set by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in the\n\ncase of Formula One World Championship (2016) 76 taxmann.com 6 (Del) and DIT Vs.\n\nSheraton International Inc. 313 ITR 267 wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court has held\n\nthat use of intellectual property that is incidental to the main purpose of agreement does\n\nnot enable the payment made thereof to qualify under the definition of royalty under the\n\nAct or DTAA. It was further contended that use of Google brand feature is probably\n\nthe only intellectual property granted to the appellant under distribution agreement,\n\nhowever, the same has been granted to the appellant for the purpose of appellant\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                       Page 83 of 331</span>\n\nachieving its obligation under the said agreement. Therefore, use of Google brand\n\nfeature under distribution agreement would not render payment of royalty under the Act\n\nor under India-Ireland DTAA in the light of judgments of Formula One World\n\nChampionship (supra) and Sheraton International Inc. (supra).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_214\">74.   With regard to contentions of the revenue that GIPL has access to database of\n\nGIL, the ld. Counsel has submitted that the appellant has no access to database of Google\n\nand in support thereof, he placed some documents to demonstrate that wherever\n\ninvestigating agencies have sought information regarding user of such products, the\n\nappellant has maintained a position of not being able to comply with such requests as it\n\ndoes not have such access. It is only GIL or Google Inc. USA which can comply with\n\nsuch requests. Therefore, the averment of the revenue is completely unsupported and\n\nfactually incorrect.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_215\">75.   The ld. Counsel for the assessee has also placed reliance upon the commentaries\n\nof The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UN\n\nmodel as a guide for interpretation of treaty with the submission that this OECD\n\ncommentary has been relied upon on by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and the various\n\nHigh Courts while deciding a number of cases. The OECD has set up a Technical\n\nAdvisory Group (TAG) to examine the issue arising in characterization of e-commerce\n\npayment. TAG has categorizede-commerce transaction into 28 types including internet\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                       Page 84 of 331</span>\n\nadvertising. TAG has concluded that payment arising from the advertisement would\n\nconstitute business profits falling under <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 7</a> rather than royalties. He also further\n\nplaced reliance upon the High Power Committee report on &#x27;Electronics, Commerce and\n\nTaxation&#x27; constituted by CBDT vide order dated 16.12.1999, wherein and the\n\nCommittee has also held that payment arising from the advertisement would constitute\n\nprofits and gains from the business or profession.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">76.   It was further contended that prior to introduction of equalization levy, the\n\namounts receivable by non-residents was considered to be business income and not\n\ntaxable in India in the absence of Permanent Establishment in India. Considering the\n\ngrowth of the online advertisement industry and in line with OECD&#x27;s Action Plan-1 of\n\nthe base erosion and proper shifting, the Govt. introduced equalization levy to tax the\n\nreceipt which was not subject to tax in India in the absence of Permanent\n\nEstablishment. The Memorandum of Finance Bill, 2016 proposed to insert a new\n\nchapter titled &#x27;Equalisation Levy&#x27; in the Finance Bill. 2016 to provide for equalization\n\nlevy of 6% of the amount of consideration for specified services received or receivable\n\nby the non-resident not having Permanent Establishment in India from a resident in India\n\nwho carries out business or profession or form non-resident having Permanent\n\nEstablishment in India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_217\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                       Page 85 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_218\">77.   The ld. Counsel for the assessee further contended that grant of distribution right\n\nin Adword program does not involve transfer of right in copyright. The appellant is a\n\nmere non-exclusive distributor or reseller of ad space through the Adword programe in\n\nIndia. The appellant merely purchases the advertisement space under the Adword\n\nprogram from GIL and distribute the same to advertisers in India. He quoted an example\n\nby saying that for advertisements in other mediums like newspaper magazine, the\n\ncustomer approaches an advertisement agency to have the advertisement public in one\n\nor more newspaper. The advertisement agency in turn approaches the respective\n\nnewspaper entity or an entity that has bought media space for publishing of the\n\nadvertisement of their customers.       The consideration paid by the customer to\n\nadvertisement agencies is in the nature of advertisement fees and the consideration paid\n\nby the advertisement agencies to the respective newspaper entity is also in the nature of\n\nadvertisement fees, inspite of the fact that the advertisement may be displayed by\n\nconsiderable use of technology.      Similarly, in the instant case, the consideration\n\nreceived by the appellant from the advertisers in India is in the nature of advertisement\n\nfees and consideration paid by the appellant to Google Ireland for purchase of\n\nadvertisement space is also in the nature of advertisement fees, even though the\n\nadvertisement would be displayed as a consequence of use of technology.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_219\">                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                        Page 86 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">78.    It was further contended that Adword program is not a computer program, but a\n\ntitle givento the facility/services provided by Google to the advertisers to advertise their\n\nproducts/services by displaying links/contents on the Google search engine. In fact\n\nAdword is a trademark registered by Google Inc. and not a copyright patent. The AO\n\nhas placed reliance on the description of Adword program in Wikipedia and other articles\n\nappearing in worldwide web to hold Adword is complex computer program. The\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in various cases has observed that the information on Wikipedia\n\ncan be entered by any person, as such it may not be authority and accordingly should not\n\nbe relied upon for judicial decisions. Therefore the information available on Wikipedia\n\nshould not be taken into account. The present non-exclusive right to distribute the ad\n\nspace is a commercial space and not an intellectual property right, therefore the\n\nprovisions of IT Enabled Services by the appellant is independent of the\n\ndistribution/reseller of advertisement space under the Adword program by the appellant\n\nto advertisers in India. ITES division of the appellant is a separate outsourcing business\n\nsegment for which it earns revenue under a separate outsourcing service agreement with\n\nGIL.   The appellant was providing ITES services prior to the commencement of the\n\ndistribution or resale activities.   Further the amount receivable under the service\n\nagreement is not set off against the amount payable by the company under the\n\ndistribution/resale agreement. Role of distribution/reseller function is limited to\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                       Page 87 of 331</span>\n\ndistribution/resale activities, whereas ITES performed functions inter alia are to ensure\n\nthe advertisement placed by advertiser globally in conformity with the Google editorial\n\nguidelines/local Government regulations of the country, from where ad is to be\n\ndisplayed. These ad review services are not provided to the advertisers since the\n\nresponsibility is of the appellantthat ads do not violate Government regulation in the web\n\nplatform operator i.e., Google Ireland. There is no professional interaction between the\n\ndistribution team and the ITES team since these are separate functions performed\n\nindependent of each other. In fact they operate from separate location. ITES division\n\noperates out of units situated at Hyderabad and Gurgaon, whilstthe distribution division\n\noperates out of Mumbai and Gurgaon. It was further contended that even under ITES\n\nagreement, only limited rights to use intellectual property of Google Ireland is granted\n\nto the appellant i.e., to carry out only specific services under the said agreement. Under\n\nthe ITES agreement, there are no rights that are granted to Google India for commercial\n\nexploitation of such intellectual property. Under the ITES segment, providing such\n\nlimited right to use intellectual property to Google Ireland is entered in April 1, 2004\n\nwhich is much before the agreement for Adword program on 12.12.2005.

Having carefully examined the orders of lower authorities in the light of rival\n\nsubmissions and the material available on record, we find that in these appeals, the sole\n\ncontroversy revolves around an issue as to what is the nature of payment made by the\n\nappellant to Google Ireland Ltd. under the Google Adworddistribution/reseller\n\nagreement. The AO has examined the distribution/ reseller agreement along with the\n\nservice agreement executed between the appellant and GIL in order to arrive at a\n\nconclusion with regard to the nature of payment made by the appellant to GIL. Therefore\n\nit has become necessary for us to adjudicate as to whether the distribution/ reseller\n\nagreement and service agreements are two independent and separable agreements or they\n\nare interconnected and interdependent agreements, without which the obligation under\n\nthe distributor agreement cannot be discharged.

In distributor agreement the\n\nappellant was called as a &#x27;distributor&#x27;, and in reseller agreement the appellant was called\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                       Page 96 of 331</span>\n\na &#x27;reseller&#x27;. Besides change of nomenclature, the obligation upon the appellant remained\n\nthe same. Therefore we discuss the clauses of distribution agreement in order to\n\nunderstand the Google Adword program and duties and obligations cast upon the\n\nappellant in discharge of its functions. In this distribution agreement, a reference was\n\nmade that the GIL and distributor desire to terminate the prior agreement and further\n\ndesired that this agreement supersedes and replace the prior agreement in its entirety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_258\">But before us, a copy of the prior agreement which was superseded by this agreement\n\nhas not been filed. But this fact is clear that before this agreement, there was some other\n\nagreement under which the appellant was performing certain functions. Through this\n\nagreement, the appellant was appointed as non-exclusive authorized distributor of\n\nGoogle Adword program to advertisers in accordance with the terms &amp; conditions set\n\nforth in this agreement. It has been clarified that distributor shall conduct its business\n\nfor its own account, in its own name, and not as an agent, employee, partner or franchisee\n\nof Google i.e., Google Ireland. It was also made clear that distributor may not solicit\n\nbusiness from and shall not distribute Adword program to (even if unsolicited) any entity\n\nthat does not have a principal place of business within the territory, meaning thereby the\n\nappellant was appointed as distributor of Google Adword program to conduct its\n\nbusiness relating to the said Google Adword program within the territory of India within\n\nthe broad guidelines provided by Google with its reasonable commercial expertise, sale\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                       Page 97 of 331</span>\n\nforce and customer service infrastructure. Distributor shall perform its obligation\n\nhereunder in a professional and workman-like manner consistent with reasonably\n\napplicable industry standards and in accordance with this agreement. Distributor will\n\ndistribute Adword program in accordance with the training provided by Google (GIL).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_259\">Further, as per clause 2.3 under the head &#x27;Adword program Sign up process&#x27;, distributor\n\nshall be responsible for uploading of advertisers information that is required by Google\n\nfor participation in the Adword program. Under clause 2.5 distributor or the appellant\n\nshall conduct the business in a manner that reflects favourably at all times on the Adword\n\nprogram and on Google&#x27;s goodwill and reputation and agrees to adhere to minimum\n\nlevels of service as specified in Exhibit-C and breach of this section will constitute\n\nmaterial breach of this agreement. Under clause 2.6, distributor will provide after sales\n\nservice to advertisers in accordance with the broad instructions, training and standards\n\nof Google.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_260\">86.

To adjudicate on the issue in appeal, we will have to first understand the\n      nature of services rendered by the Google and Yahoo. Both these companies\n      own popular search engine websites, namely Google and Yahoo, and the\n      advertising is done in the results generated by the search results against\n      agreed keywords or by placing the advertising banners on websites. Yahoo\n      and Google, as internet search engines, have brought about an information\n      revolution and the entire conventional business model of businesses\n      reaching out to the potential customers has undergone paradigm shift.\n      Nicholas Negroponte, in his classic book &#x27;Being Digital&#x27; published in\n      January 1995, had said that &quot;Information about information is more\n      important than information&quot; and illustrated this with an example, which\n                                     IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                      IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                           IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                    IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                Page 121 of 331</span>\n\nlooks too simplistic today, that &quot;the fact that TV Guide makes more money\nthan all the four major networks combined&quot;. It was around this time that the\nsearch engines &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s Guide to the World Wide Web&quot; and\n&quot;backrub&quot;, former avatars of Yahoo and Google respectively, made the\nbusiness of information about information, which is what these search\nengines are really involved in- with sophisticated technology and process of\ngreat value proposition, a reality. The services offered by Yahoo and Google\nare of the same nature, but, for the sake of convenience, we will take up\n<a href=\"/doc/586984/\" id=\"a_212\">Google</a>&#x27;s case as an illustration for the nature of services. Google is a web\nsearch engine. The way it works is this. A web search engine is basically\nsoftware code that is designed to search for information on the World Wide\nWeb. When an internet user needs information about, inter alia, a product\nor service, he visits the website of the search engine and keys in the search\nwords. The software and database embedded in the search engine than\nproduces a large number of results, such as addresses of the related websites\nso that internet user can then visit those website for further information on\nthat product or service. This query need not be about a service or product\nonly, it may relate to virtually anything under the sun. These search engine\nresults are sometimes in thousands, are generally presented in a web pages,\nimages, information and other types of files. While producing these results,\nthere are sponsored search results also, which is de facto advertising, and\nthese sponsored search results help those advertisers visibility of their\nrespective websites. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by\nhuman editors, search engines also maintain realtime information by\nrunning an algorithm on a web crawler, and, therefore, the advertising\nservices offered by these search engines are practically without any human\ntouch and entirely automated. When we use these search engines, the search\nresults are produced which are termed as &#x27;search engine result pages&#x27;, and,\nas we have seen a little while ago, these SERPs also include sponsored\nsearch results or online advertising. The online advertising on SERPs is a\npart of the business of search engines like Google. To an advertiser, it is\ngenerally a three step process - advertiser creates advertisement and\nchooses keywords, which are words or phrases relating to his business.\nWhen people search on Google using one of the assigned keywords, the\nadvertisement may appear next to the search results. The advertisements are\nthen before an audience which is already interested in the related product or\nservice. People can simply click on these advertisements and they will reach\nthe related website so as to make a purchase or learn more about the product\n                                      IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                       IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                     IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                                 Page 122 of 331</span>\n\nor service. The functioning of this form of online advertising can indeed be\nexplained in such simple terms, but actual rendering of this service is a\nhighly technical process. To search engines, providing this online\nadvertising service, is a complex technical activity and rendering of a highly\ntechnical service which works with the use of software code that is designed\nto search for information on the World Wide Web, and generate, alongwith\nthe search results, sponsored search results - the service which is paid for\nby the sponsors of those results, like this assessee before us. On one hand, a\nweb search engine like Google, as we have noted earlier also, maintains\nreal-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler, and, on the\nother hand, produces, in the search results to the internet users,\nadvertisement sponsored. It is primarily for this service that the Google is\npaid for. An online advertising could also be by way of a web banner or\nbanner advertisement is a form of advertising on the World Wide Web\ndelivered by an adserver, an expression which refers to technology and\nservice that places advertisements on web sites. The content of the adserver\nis constantly updated so that the website or webpage on which the ads are\ndisplayed contains new advertisements, when the site or page is visited or\nrefreshed by a user. The purpose of ad serving is to deliver targeted ads that\nmatch the website visitor&#x27;s interest. This form of online advertising entails\nembedding an advertisement into a web page. It is intended to attract traffic\nto a website by linking to the website of the advertiser. An ad server, which\nis at the core of this form of online advertising, is a computer server,\nspecifically a web server, that stores advertisements used in online\nmarketing and delivers them to website visitors. Whichever be the form of\nadvertising service, whether by sponsored results or by web banner or by\nany other similar mode, there can hardly be any dispute on the proposition\nthat these search engines or ad servers, which are patented and provide\nvaluable services, which are essentially technical in nature. It is this kind of\nadvertising service for which the payments were made by the assessee. Let\nus, for example, take the case of a florist in Shillong who intends to use these\nservices. His potential customer is a person looking for a florist in Shillong.\nWhen such a person actually uses the search words &#x27;florist&#x27; and &#x27;Shillong&#x27;\nin Google, the search engine result page could be like this:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">                                          IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                           IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                         IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                     Page 123 of 331</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">99.

Now in the light of material available on the record in the form of literature,\n\nsubmissions and orders of the authorities below we will try to understand as to how the\n\nAdword program works. The Google AdWord Program is a complex program and has\n\nvarious benefits viz., a) relevant ads of people b) target of select audience c) it causes\n\nminimum advertisisng expenses d) it is only payable when people are engaged. It gives\n\nadvertiser the access to the tools of the AdWord Program which can be accessed through\n\nthe gateway of Google India/Appellant through the use of patent technology. AdWord\n\nProgram gives the advertiser to choose the preferred time, season of the year when the\n\nads are to be shown. Once advertiser accepts the terms, the appellant gives access to the\n\nvarious tools of AdWords Program. The time zone and display time of the advertisement\n\nis identified and allocated by the appellant to the advertiser with the help of Google\n\nAdWord Program. AdWord Program is more focused and targeted in advertisement\n\ncampaign which results into more attention, engagement, delivery and conversion which\n\nis only possible on the Google network with the access of tools of search engine and\n\ngoogle analytics.

The keyword\n\nplanner also suggests the suitability of the keywords which are useful in the particular\n\nmonth of the year. The advertiser is able to plan its campaign for optimization or for the\n\npurpose of getting more information and conversion based on keyword planners. Based\n\non this information and forecast, the advertiser is able to build on the keywords.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_192\">103. The display of the advertisement based on the keywords, is dependent upon the\n\nauction price paid by the advertiser. The keywords bid at the highest rate by the\n\nadvertiser would be shown at the top of search result and therefore, is likely to fetch\n\nmore visibility and attention. With the help of tools of Google, the advertiser as well as\n\nthe appellant have an access to the impact of change of keywords on the likely\n\nimpressions of the advertisement.      With the help of keywords matching, various\n\napproaches are being adopted by the Google AdWord Program i.e., broad match, phrase\n\nmatch and exact match. The exact match for example allows the advertiser to focus on\n\nthe optimization phrase on the individual keywords and it yields the best results possible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_193\">                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                      Page 129 of 331</span>\n\nWhereas, the phrase match is more processing than broad match and the broad match\n\nprovides the greatest possibility of coverage of the advertisement.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_194\">104. The appellant facilitates the advertisers to start the campaign of advertising\n\ninitially with the help of broad match thereafter with the phrase match and thereafter\n\nwith the exact match. With the help of keyword management, the Google AdWord\n\nProgram takes care of misspelling, singular, plural, abbreviation, achronynms,\n\nstemming, etc. For example, if the advertisement shows the formal shoes, then the\n\nkeywords are the formal plus shoes. If it is broad match keywords then the advertisement\n\nwill show formal shoes, sports shoes, black shoes, party shoes, etc. However, if the\n\nadvertiser had only opted for exact word match, then search result will show only a\n\nformal shoe.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">105. The appellant helps the advertiser with the help of tools of AdWord Program to\n\ninclude or delete various variation of keywords in the realm of advertisement compaign\n\nand similarly the advertiser may with the help of Google tool can avoid the unnecessary\n\ntraffic on its website. For example, if an advertiser does not want the visit of a surfer\n\nwho is searching the service apartment on rent basis and only wants the person surfing\n\nto buy the apartment, then the Appellant can help him by putting negative words of rent\n\nin the keyword search. Therefore, the only person who is searching for service apartment\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                        Page 130 of 331</span>\n\nwould be lending on the advertisers website and the person who is searching for rented\n\nservice apartment, would not be visiting the website of the advertiser i.e., advertisement\n\nwould not be displayed to him in the searched result. Likewise, if the advertiser is selling\n\nleather cover for iPhone, then the advertiser may not like that the person who is looking\n\nfor leather cover for another brand or item may visit the website of the advertiser. For\n\nthat, negative words can be used to avoid to improve the CTR (clicked through rate) with\n\nthe help of tools of Google. By using these tools, the Appellant has been giving various\n\nsuggestions to the advertisers to improve various keywords.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">106. The Google AdWord Program is also having Google Analytics which is connected\n\nwith the Google AdWord Program and which is a potential patented tool to target the\n\nkeywords and the negative keywords. This is the USP of the Google AdWord Program,\n\nwhich is maintaining thousands of different keywords used by people to search the\n\nwebsite and based on this user behaviour, the Google Analytics suggests the appropriate\n\nkeywords to be used by the advertiser for encouraging the traffic on the website.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">Similarly, the Google Analytics also uses the same data to filter out the negative\n\nkeywords on the basis of which an unattended or unwarranted person have landed on the\n\nwebsite of the advertiser. The Appellant is using all these tools in conjucture with the\n\nadvertisers at the time of granting the backhand services to advertisers, as the Appellant\n\nis having access to all these data, information, etc.\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                       Page 131 of 331</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">107. On the basis of the above, we are of the view that the agreement between the\n\nassessee and GIL is not only in the nature of providing the space for advertisement and\n\ndisplay the advertisement to the consumers. If we look into the advertisement module\n\nof the AdWord Program, we will come to an irrestitable conclusion that it is not merely\n\nan agreement to provide advertisement space but it is an agreement for facilitating the\n\ndisplay and publishing of an advertisement to the targeted customers.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">108. We have also examined the obligations cast upon the appellant under the\n\nagreements and found the obligation cast upon the appellant under the Google Adword\n\ndistribution agreement can only be discharged with the help of the ITES\n\ndivision. Therefore, the Google Adword distributor agreement and the service\n\nagreement are to be read together as they are interconnected with the navel cord and\n\nwithout resorting to the service agreement the terms and conditions under the Google\n\nAdWord Distribution Agreement cannot be complied with. Therefore, in order to\n\nunderstand the function of Google Adword program, we have to read both the\n\nagreements together.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">109. Now the question comes as to whether the payment made by the appellant to\n\nGoogle Ireland is in the nature of payment of royalty or a business profit in the hands of\n\nGoogle Ireland. In this regard, our attention was invited to the fact that Google Ireland\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                       Page 132 of 331</span>\n\nis a non-resident and does not have any Permanent Establishment in India, therefore the\n\npayment made to Google Ireland is in the form of business profit and not taxable in\n\nIndia. But the revenue has treated the payment made by the appellant to Google Ireland\n\nafter retaining a particular percentage of advertisement receipts as a payment of royalty\n\nand is chargeable to tax u/.s 9(1)(vi) of the Act. Since the appellant has not deducted tax\n\nat source on such payments<a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_214\"> u/s. 195</a> of the Act, the AO had treated the assessee to be in\n\ndefault and raised the demand under <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_215\">section 201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_216\">201A</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">110. The AO has also held that the GIL is not the beneficial owner of the sum\n\npaid/payable by GIPL and therefore the rate of tax as provided under India-Ireland\n\nDTAA @ 10% cannot be applied. He further held that GIL which is claimed to be the\n\nbeneficial owner of the sum paid/payable by GIPL is controlled and managed from\n\nBermuda with whom India has not entered into DTAA. Therefore, rate of tax on royalty\n\npaid/payable by GIPL under the Act will have to applied. Accordingly, royalty was\n\ntaxed @ 10.556% under <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_217\">section 115A</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">111. During the course of hearing, the learned Counsel for the assessee has invited our\n\nattention to various judicial pronouncements with the submissions that similar type of\n\npayments made by the advertisers to the non-residents, who owns the search engine was\n\nconsidered to be the business profit of the non-resident and in the absence of their\n                                              IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                               IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                    IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                             IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                         Page 133 of 331</span>\n\npermanent establishment in India, the business profit was not liable to be taxed in India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">Therefore, we prefer to examine the judgments referred to by the assessee in support of\n\nhis contention as to whether the judgments apply to the present facts of the case or not.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">Heavy reliance was placed upon the order of the Tribunal in the case of ITO Vs. Right\n\nFlorist (supra) in which the Tribunal has held that the payments made by the advertiser\n\nto Google and Yahoo is a business profit in the hands of the recipient and in the absence\n\nof the permanent establishment of the non-resident, the business income cannot be taxed\n\nin India. In that case, the facts culled out by the Tribunal are that the assessee is a florist\n\nwho uses such advertising with search engine through Google and Yahoo to generate\n\nbusiness. Whenever, anyone does a web search on a respective search engine in looking\n\nfor a particular website and uses certain keywords, the advertisement of the assessee is\n\nshown along with the search results. The assessee has made certain payments in respect\n\nof online advertising to US based entities viz., Google Ireland Ltd., and overture service\n\nInc., USA (Yahoo USA). No taxes were withheld from these payments and during the\n\ncourse of assessment proceedings, the AO required the assessee to show cause as to why\n\nthese payments are not to be disallowed as deduction in computation of its income under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/686617/\" id=\"a_218\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> of the Act. The stand of the assessee was that these payments are made\n\nto foreign entities who did not have any permanent establishment in India. Therefore,\n\nthe same were not taxable in India. The AO rejected the claim of the assessee.

Assessee carried the matter\n\nbefore the CIT(A) but did not find favour with him and finally the matter travelled to the\n\nTribunal.

It is only elementary that when recipient of an\nincome does not have the primary tax liability in respect of an income, the payer cannot\nhave vicarious tax withholding liability either. This position is independent of the payer\nhaving moved an application under section 195 or not, or on the payer or the payee\nhaving obtained an advance ruling in their favour or not. The law is now very well settled\nin this regard by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/30875803/\" id=\"a_226\">GE India Technology\nCentre Pvt Ltd Vs CIT</a> (327 ITR 456) wherein Their Lordships have categorically held\nthat, &quot;where a person responsible for deduction is fairly certain, then he can make his\nown determination as to whether the tax was deductible at source and, if so, what should\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                      Page 136 of 331</span>\n\nbe the amount thereof&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1594163\" id=\"span_166\">In the said case, Their Lordships have, rejecting revenue&#x27;s\nreliance on Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1594163/\" id=\"a_227\">Transmission</a>&#x27;s case (supra) - which\nhas also been referred to by the Assessing Officer, observed as follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1594163\" id=\"span_167\">......<a href=\"/doc/1594163/\" id=\"a_228\">.In Transmission Corporation</a> case (supra) a non-resident had entered into\n     a composite contract with the resident party making the payments. The said\n     composite contract not only comprised supply of plant, machinery and\n     equipment in India, but also comprised the installation and commissioning of\n     the same in India. It was admitted that the erection and commissioning of plant\n     and machinery in India gave rise to income taxable in India. It was, therefore,\n     clear even to the payer that payments required to be made by him to the non-\n     resident included an element of income which was exigilble to tax in India.

It was held that if the payer wanted to deduct TDS not on the gross\n     amount but on the lesser amount, on the footing that only a portion of the\n     payment made represented &quot;income chargeable to tax in India&quot;, then it was\n     necessary for him to make an application under <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 195(2)</a> of the Act to the\n     ITO(TDS) and obtain his permission for deducting TDS at lesser amount. Thus,\n     it was held by this Court that if the payer had a doubt as to the amount to be\n     deducted as TDS he could approach the ITO(TDS) to compute the amount\n     which was liable to be deducted at source. In our view, Section 195(2) is based\n     on the &quot;principle of proportionality&quot;. The said sub-Section gets attracted only\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                                        Page 137 of 331</span>\n\n      in cases where the payment made is a composite payment in which a certain\n      proportion of payment has an element of &quot;income&quot; chargeable to tax in India.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">      It is in this context that the Supreme Court stated, &quot;If no such application is\n      filed, income-tax on such sum is to be deducted and it is the statutory obligation\n      of the person responsible for paying such &#x27;sum&#x27; to deduct tax thereon before\n      making payment.

If one reads the\n      observation of the Supreme Court, the words &quot;such sum&quot; clearly indicate that\n      the observation refers to a case of composite payment where the payer has a\n      doubt regarding the inclusion of an amount in such payment which is exigible\n      to tax in India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1594163\" id=\"span_170\">In our view, the above observations of this Court in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1594163/\" id=\"a_232\">Transmission Corporation</a> case (supra) which is put in italics has been\n      completely, with respect, misunderstood by the Karnataka High Court to mean\n      that it is not open for the payer to contend that if the amount paid by him to the\n      non-resident is not at all &quot;chargeable to tax in India&quot;, then no TDS is required\n      to be deducted from such payment. This interpretation of the High Court\n      completely loses sight of the plain words of Section 195(1) which in clear terms\n      lays down that tax at source is deductible only from &quot;sums chargeable&quot; under\n      the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_233\">I.T.

Ltd., the facts culled out by the AO are\nthat the assessee company was engaged in the business of digital advertising and internet\nmarketing. It utilizes the internet search engine such as Google and Yahoo, etc., to buy\nspace in advertising on the internet on behalf of its client. The search engine carries out\nits own programme whereby the assessee books certain words called &quot;keywords&quot;.\nWhenever any person searches through the net of specific keywords, the advertisement\nof the assessee or its client is displayed. The price charged for such bookings depends\non type of its phrase, its popularity, usage, etc. The search engine renders the services\nworld wide basis and thus is not relatable to any specific country. The entire transaction\ntakes place through the internet and even the invoice is raised and payment is made\nthrough internet. During the year under consideration, the assessee company had made\na payment of Rs.1,09,35,108/- to Google Ireland Limited and the said payment was\nclaimed as advertisement expenses. While making the said payment, no tax at source\nwas deducted by the assessee on the ground that amount paid to Google Ireland Limited\nconstituted business profit of the said company and since the said company did not have\na permanent establishment (PE) in India, the amount payable was not taxable in India.\nAccording to AO, the services rendered by the Ireland company to the assessee was in\nthe nature of technical services and hence the assessee company was liable to deduct tax\nat source from the payment made against the said services. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89798900\" id=\"span_173\">Since no such tax at source\nwas deducted by the assessee, the deduction claimed by the assessee on account of\n                                              IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                               IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                    IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                             IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                         Page 139 of 331</span>\n\nexpenditure incurred on payment of advertisement charges to M/s. Google Ireland was\ndisallowed by the AO by invoking the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_240\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> of the Act. The\ndisallowance was challenged before the CIT(A) and the CIT(A), while confirming the\ndisallowance has held that payment made by the assessee to Google Ireland for the\nservices rendered was in the nature of royalty, chargeable to tax in India and assessee is\ntherefore liable to deduct tax at source from the said payment. The matter went to the\nTribunal and the Tribunal, relying upon the order of the Tribunal in the case of <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_241\">Yahoo\nIndia Pvt. Ltd.</a>, (supra) has held that the amount payable by the assessee to Google\nIreland for the services rendered for uploading and display of banner of advertisement\non its portal was in the nature of business on which no tax was deductible at source since\nthe same was not chargeable in India in the absence of any permanent establishment\n(PE) of Google Ireland Ltd., in India.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_335\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89798900\" id=\"span_175\">114. Since this case was adjudicated by the Tribunal in the light of order of the Tribunal\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_242\">Yahoo India Pvt. Ltd.</a>, (supra) therefore, it has become necessary for us to\nexamine the facts in the case of Yahoo India Pvt. Ltd. In the case of Yahoo India Pvt.\nLtd., the facts culled by the Tribunal in its order are that the assessee company is fully\nowned subsidiary of Yahoo Inc., USA which is engaged in the business of providing\nconsumer services such as search engine content and information on wide spectrum of\ntopics, email, chat, etc. During the course of assessment proceedings, it was noticed by\nthe AO that assessee has made a payment of Rs.34,86,947 to Yahoo Holdings (Hong\nKong) Ltd., being cost of services/research material/ advertisement media. Yahoo\nHolding (Hong Kong) Ltd., is engaged in the business of providing internet services,\ntechnological tools, marketing solutions for business to customers in Hong Kong. It\nprovides banner advertisement and Microsoft hosting services on Yahoo Hong Kong\nportal. The banner advertisement is also known as web banner which is a form of\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                       Page 140 of 331</span>\n\nadvertisement on the world wide web page. During the year under consideration, the\nDepartment of Tourism of India, through an advertisement agency media turf world wide\nintended to display a banner advertisement during the period from 18.02.2004 to\n15.03.2004 on the portal owned by Yahoo Holding (Hong Kong) Ltd. For this purpose,\nit hired the services of assessee company to approach Yahoo Holding (Hong Kong) Ltd.,\nto provide uploading and display services for hosting the banner advertisements at\nYahoo Hong Kong portal. Accordingly, the assessee company entered into the contract\nin the form of media insertion order for display of impressions with the Department of\nTourism. The total consideration for the same was agreed for Rs.65,11,500/- out of\nwhich assessee company agreed for granting agency discount to media turf of 25%. The\nassessee company in turn hired the services of Yahoo Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd., for\nuploading and display of banner advertisement on its portal and the consideration for the\nsaid services was agreed at US$75,464, equivalent to Indian Rs.34,86,947/-. The said\npayment to M/s. Yahoo Holding (Hong Kong) Ltd., was made by the assessee during\nthe year under consideration without deducting tax at source. The stand of the assessee,\nas taken before the AO was that since the services/operation performed by the Yahoo\nHoldings (Hong Kong) Ltd., was entirely outside India and since Yahoo Holdings (Hong\nKong) Ltd., had no presence in India, the amount paid by them for the services rendered\noutside India was not taxable in India and no tax therefore was required to be deducted\nat source from the payment of the said amount. According to the AO, the income\nattributable to the services claimed to be rendered outside India has accrued in India as\nper provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1369261/\" id=\"a_243\">section 9</a> and the same is being taxable in India. Therefore, the assessee\nis required to deduct the tax at source before remitting the said amount to Yahoo\nHoldings (Hong Kong) Ltd. Since no tax was deducted by assessee company from the\npayment remitted to Yahoo Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd., deduction claimed by the\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                       Page 141 of 331</span>\n\nassessee on account of the said payment was disallowed by the AO by invoking the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_244\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> of the Act.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_336\">115. Aggrieved, the assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT(A) but did not find\nany favour with him and ultimately the matter reached the Tribunal and the Tribunal\nheld that since the banner advertisements hosting service did not involve use or right to\nuse by the assessee of any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment and no such\nuse was actually granted by Yahoo Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd., limited to the assessee\ncompany and uploading and display of the banner advertisement on its portal was\nentirely the responsibility of the Yahoo Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd., the assessee\ncompany was only required to provide the banner advertisement to Yahoo Holdings\n(Hong Kong) Ltd., for uploading the same on its portal. Thus the assessee had no right\nto access the portal of Yahoo Holdings and there is nothing to show any positive act of\nutilization or employment of the portal of the Yahoo Holdings by the assessee company.\nIn the light of these facts, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that payments made by\nthe assessee to Yahoo Holding (Hong Kong) Ltd., for the services rendered for uploading\nand display of banner advertisement to the Department of Tourism on its portal was not\nin the nature of royalty and the same was in the nature of business profit and in the\nabsence of any permanent establishment (PE) of Yahoo Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd., in\nIndia, it was not chargeable to tax in India. Therefore, the assessee was not required to\ndeduct TDS from the payment made to Yahoo Holdings (Hong Kong) Ltd., for services\nrendered. Therefore, the payment so made cannot be disallowed by invoking the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_245\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> for non-deduction of TDS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_337\">116. In all these cases, the assessee was either an advertiser or act on behalf of some\nother advertiser and has purchased space from the owner of search engine to display its\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                       Page 142 of 331</span>\n\nadvertisements online. Therefore, the payment made by the assessee to the owner of the\nsearch engine was considered to be business receipt / business profit in the hands of the\nowner of search engine who is non-resident and in the absence of permanent\nestablishment (PE) in India, the business profits / business receipts received by them\nwere not chargeable to tax in India. But in the instant case, appellant has not purchased\nthe advertisement space for putting its advertisement online from the GIL. The assessee\nhas been duly appointed a distributor under the Google Adword Distribution Agreement\nto distribute and sell the advertisement space obtained from the GIL under the\nDistribution Agreement.      Under the distribution agreement, appellant was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">obligation to provide pre-sale and after sale services with the help of ITES division.\nWhile providing after sales services / technical services, the assessee had access to the\nintellectual property rights and tools and informatives, derivative works owned by the\nGIL. In the instant case, assessee is not a simpliciter buyer of AdWord Space for putting\nthe advertisement either for himself or for others which was the position in the aforesaid\ncases referred to by the assessee. Therefore, we are of the view that the facts of the case\nreferred to by the assessee i.e., Pinstorm Technologies Ltd., Right Florist and Yahoo\nIndia Ltd., are different than the facts of the instant case. Thus the <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_246\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_247\">laid down in</a></a>\nthose cases would not be applicable to the present facts of the case.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_338\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89798900\" id=\"span_179\">117. The learned Counsel for the assessee has also emphatically argued that the issue\ninvolved in these appeals is squarely covered by the aforesaid judgments in the case of\nRight Florist, Pinstorm Technologies Ltd., Yahoo India Ltd., Therefore, issue may be\ndecided following the <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_248\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/89798900/\" id=\"a_249\">laid down in</a></a> the aforesaid cases. If the Tribunal takes a view\ncontrary to the view taken in the aforesaid cases, the matter may be referred to larger\nbench. In this regard, we have carefully perused the facts of the aforesaid cases and we\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                       Page 143 of 331</span>\n\nfind the facts of those cases are different and therefore the ratio laid down therein cannot\nbe followed in the instant case. Hence we do not find any merit in the contention of the\nassessee for making a reference to larger bench if contrary view is required to be taken.\nWe therefore reject these contentions of the assessee.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_339\">118. A reference was also made upon the order of the Tribunal in the case of Taj TV\nLtd., (Supra), and on its perusal, we find in para 3, the Tribunal has recorded the facts of\nthe case according to which Taj TV Ltd., has appointed Taj India as distributor vide\nagreement dated 01.03.2002 to distribute an encrypted advertiser and/or subscription\nsupportive television programme services known as Ten Sports for cable systemsolely\nfor exhibitions to subscribers in India. As per the said agreement, the distribution\nrevenue collected by Taj India will be split in the ratio of 60:40 between Taj TV and Taj\nIndia. The amount payable by Taj India to Taj TV shall be net of Indian Income Tax.\nTaj TV is registered in Mauritius and also does not have any branch office in India.\nFurther telecasting is being done from outside India. It was contended in that case that\nTaj TV does not have permanent establishment in India and the transaction entered into\nby Taj TV are on principal to principal basis at arm&#x27;s length price. Taj India does not\nhave any authority to enter into any contract on behalf of Taj TV and all the\nadvertisements, sale contracts are entered into between the advertisers and the Taj TV.\nThe commission of 10% in respect of advertisement revenue is fair and consistent with\nthe industry practice. The Tribunal examined the Revenue&#x27;s contention for treating the\npayment to be royalty and came to the conclusion that the assessee only makes available\nthe content to the cable operator which are transmitted by them to the ultimate\ncustomer/viewer and under the Distribution Agreement, assessee has not been granted\nany licence to use any copyright to the distributor or to the cable operator. The rights\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                        Page 144 of 331</span>\n\nover the content at all times lies with the assessee company and are never made available\nwith the distributor or cable operator. Therefore, impugned income will not constitute\nroyalty. The relevant observation of the Tribunal in this regard is extracted hereunder\nfor the sake of reference:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\"> &quot;So far as ground No.3 is concerned, that the distribution of income should\n be taxable as &#x27;royalty&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_250\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> up to 12th July, 2002, we are\n unable to concur with the divergent stand taken by the AO that for three\n months e payment will constitute &#x27;royalty&#x27; and for balance nine months, the payment\n will constitute &#x27;business income&#x27;. It has also been brought to our knowledge\n that in the subsequent years the AO has treated &#x27;distribution income&#x27; as\n business income and not as royalty. Thus, prior to period 12th July, 2002,\n also when assessee was not registered under the Laws of Mauritius then also it will\n not affect the nature of income. In any case, as stated earlier, under the distribution\n agreement, the assessee company has not granted any license to use any\n copyright to the distributor or to the cabreoperators. The assessee only\n makes available the content to the cable operators. operators which are transmitted\n by them to the ultimate customer/viewers. Further, rights over the content at all times\n lies with the Assessee Company and are never made available with the distributors\n or cable operators. Thus, the finding of the CIT(A) on this score is also confirmed\n that even for the first period 01.04.2002 to 12th July, 2002 the said income will not\n constitute `royalty&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_340\">119. Whereas in the instant case, assesse was appointed as distributor under the\nAdWord Distributor Agreement with the condition that assesse would provide on sale\nand after sale service which required the involvement of technical know-how, IPRs,\nderivative workss, etc. In the case of Taj TV, the Taj TV has simply appointed the\ndistributor and no licence was given to the distributor to use the technology developed\nby Taj TV. The distributor was simply allowed to further transmit the programs to the\nviewers/customers. Therefore, facts of Taj TV Ltd., and the facts of the assesse are\nentirely different and the ratio laid down in this case cannot be applied to the facts of the\npresent case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_341\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">                                       Page 145 of 331</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_342\">120. A reference was also made in the case of DDIT Vs. Set India Pvt. Ltd., (supra)\nand on its perusal, we find that a consideration was paid by the assesse to Set Satellite\nSingapore Pte. Ltd., for acquiring non-exclusive right to distribute set and set max\nchannels. The Revenue has treated it to be in the nature of royalty taxable at 15% on the\ngross basis under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_251\">article 12</a> of India-Signapore DTAA whereas the assesse treated it to\nbe the business profit. The facts of the case are that Set Satellite Singapore Pte. Ltd., is\na company registered in Singapore and the said non-resident company operates\ntelevision channels viz., Set and Setmax in India. The said non-resident company also\nconverts ad air times for the said channels and also entered into agreement for\ndistribution of TV channels in India. As per the agreement, 70% distribution revenue is\nreceived by non-resident company and 30% of distribution revenue is taken by assesse\ncompany as consideration for the distribution of non-resident TV channels in India. The\nsaid non-resident company does not have any permanent establishment in India and as\nper <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_252\">article 5</a> DTAA its business profit is not taxable in India. While adjudicating the\nissue, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that non-resident company has granted\nnon-exclusive distribution agreement rights to the channels to the assessee or has not\ngiven any right to use or exploit any copyright. The assessee no way concerned whether\nprograms broadcast by the non-resident are copyrighted or not. The Tribunal further\nobserved that said distribution is purely a commercial right which is distinct from the\nright to use copyright. The Tribunal has placed the reliance upon the clause 6.3 of\ndistribution agreement entered between the assessee company and non-resident which\nstates as right granted to the assessee under the agreement is not at all and shall not be\nconstrued to grant of any licence or transfer of any right or any copyright. The Tribunal\nfurther observed that cable operator only re-transmits the TV signals transmitted to it by\nbroadcaster without any editing delays additions and therefore payment made by the\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                                       Page 146 of 331</span>\n\nassessee to the non-resident company is not for use of any copyright and cannot be\ncharacterized as royalty. But in the instant case, assesseee was not appointed as a\ndistributor simpliciter. The obligation was also cast upon the appllant under the\ndistribution agreement to provide onsale and after sale services and these services could\nnot be provided without resorting to technical support of the ITES division including the\naccess to technical know-how, IPRs, copyright, derivative works etc. Therefore, facts\nof the case of Set India Pvt.Ltd., and facts of the instant case are not similar. Thus, the\nratio laid down in that case will not apply to the present case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_343\">121.

The EULA between the assessee and\nthe Indian customers has elaborate and restrictive clause, primarily with the object of\nprotecting the owner&#x27;s right in the product, documentation and IP in the software. The\nreading of the agreement shows that Indian customers had purchased the licenced\nproduct i.e., electronic design automation (EDA), tools /software from the assessee for\nits use as a tool on application software. The EDA tool support the design and production\nof integrated circuit (ICs).As fabrication process is an extensive process, IC\nmanufactures meticulously follow the design flow process before fabrication of the I.C\nis taken up.

Aggrieved, assessee preferred an appeal before the Tribunal with the contention\nthat it is goods and not by way of licence agreement, the software only was allowed to\nuse. In other words a copyrighted article was transferred and no transfer was made in\nrespect of copyright. Being not convinced with the contention of the assessee, the\nTribunal held that fees received by the assessee could not be treated as royalty as defined\nunder <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_268\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act. Revenue preferred an appeal before the Hon&#x27;ble High\nCourt and before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court the following question was raised:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">1. Whether consideration paid by Indian customers or end users, to the assessee for\ntransfer of right to use the software/computer programme is in respect of the copyright\nand falls within the mischief of royalty as defined under sub-clause (v) to explanation 2\nto clause (vi) of <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_269\">section 9(1)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_347\">125. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court extensively dealt with the issue in the light of various\njudicial pronouncements. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court has observed that the licence is a\npermission to do something that would otherwise be unlawful and the question arise\ntherefore as to what legal permission is granted by the software licence. For transfer of\nsuch right, if consideration is paid, it is not a consideration for transfer of copyright but\nfor use of IP embedded in the copyright and therefore it is for the transfer of one of those\nrights of the owner of the copyright. It is not a copyright but it is in respect of a copyright.\nWhen copyrighted article is sold and the end user gets the right to use the intellectual\nproperty embedded therein, it is not a right in the copyright as such.

The relevant observation of the\nHon&#x27;ble High Court in this regard is extracted hereunder for the sake of reference:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">&quot;43. A licence is a permission to do something that would otherwise be unlawful. The\nquestion arises, therefore, as to what legal permission is granted by a software licence.\nThe answer is, briefly, that in some cases the licence will be a permission to use\nconfidential information, and in virtually in all cases it will be a permission to copy a\ncopyright work. If the software has been kept secret by the producer, or only supplied\non conditions of confidentiality and has not been published too widely, then the software\nlicence will be akin to a licence of confidential information or know-how. The owner or\nlicensor of a copyright, has a right to t permission to use the software or a computer\nprogramme, in respect of which they have a copyright, without transferring the right in\ncopyright. It is one of the right of a copyright. owner or licensor. Without such right\nbeing transferred, the end-user has no right to use the software or computer programme.\nIf he uses it, it amounts to infringement of copyright. For transfer of such right if\nconsideration is paid, it is not a consideration for transfer of a copyright but for use of\nintellectual property embedded in the copyright, and therefore it is for transfer of one of\nthose rights of the owner of the copyright. It is not a right in copyright but it is in respect\nof a copyright. When a copyrighted article is sold also, the end-user gets the right to use\ntile intellectual property embedded in the copyright and not a right in the copyright as\nsuch. Therefore the mode adopted or the. terminology given is not decisive to decide the\nnature of transfer. Ultimately, it is the substance which has to be looked into.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\">44. Therefore, it is necessary to look into the terms of the agreement entered into between\nthe parties, as it would be purely question of fact to be decided on the basis of the\nintention of the parties as could be gathered from the written words used in the\nagreement.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_348\">126. Having examined the contents and substance of end user software licence\n\nagreement executed between Synopsys International Ltd., and Athena Semiconductor\n\nPvt.

Their Lordship further held that even if it is not transfer\n\nof exclusive right of copyright, the right to use the confidential information embedded\n\nin the software in terms of aforesaid licence makes it abundantly clear that there is\n\ntransfer of certain rights which the owner of a copyright possess in the said computer\n\nsoftware programme in respect of copyright owned. In terms of the DTAA, the\n\nconsideration paid for the use or the right to use the said confidential information in the\n\nform of computer programme software itself constitutes royalty and attract taxes. The\n\nrelevant observation of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court is extracted hereunder for the sake of\n\nreference:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">&quot;As is clear from the description of the agreement it is an end-user software licence agreement.\nClause 2.1 deals with grant of rights. It provides, Software License Synopsys hereby grants\nlicencee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without right of sub-licence of use the\nlicensed software and design techniques onlyin the quantity authorized by a licensee in\naccordance with the documentation in the use area. Licensee may make a reasonable\nnumber of copies of the licensed software for backup and/or archival purposes only. Merely\nbecause the words non-exclusive and non-transferable is used in the said licence it does not\ntake away the software out of the definition of the copyright. The word licenced software\nhas been defined. Similarly, the words design, design technique is also defined. The word\ndocumentation is also defined and it is not in dispute what is granted is a license. Even if it is\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                          Page 152 of 331</span>\n\nnot transfer of exclusive right in the copyright, the right to use the confidential information\nembedded in the software in terms of the aforesaid licence makes itabundantly clear that there\nis transfer of certain rights which the owner of copyright possess in the said\ncomputer sotware /programme in respect of the copyright owned. In terms of the DTAA the\nconsideration paid for the use or right to use the said confidential information in the form of\ncomputer programme software itself constitutes royalty and attracts tax. It is not necessary that\nthere should be a transfer of exclusive right in the copyright as contended by the assessee. The\nconsideration paid is for rights in respect of the copyright and for the user of the confidential\ninformation embedded in the software/computer programme. Therefore, it falls within the\nmischief of Explanation (2) of clause (vi) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1369261/\" id=\"a_270\">section 9</a> of the Act and there is\na liability to pay the tax.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">46.

A perusal of the said explanation makes it clear that as there was a doubt\nearlier, they want to remove the doubts by introducing this explanation.

In the instant case, under the AdWord Distribution Agreement, certain obligations\nwere cast upon assessee in order to provide efficient on sale and after sale services which\nare only possible with the aid of ITES division. Under this AdWord Agreement and the\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                       Page 153 of 331</span>\n\nService Agreement, the assessee was given licence to use the confidential information,\ntechnical know-how, trade mark, brand features, derivative works, etc. Though the\nownership of these intangibles remains with the GIL or the Google Inc., but the assessee\nwas given the licence to use it in order to provide better service. Therefore, the facts of\nthis case are similar to that case of Synopsys International Ltd. Hence the ratio <a href=\"/doc/39708190/\" id=\"a_274\">laid\ndown by</a> the jurisdictional High Court <a href=\"/doc/39708190/\" id=\"a_275\">in that case</a> apply to the present case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_350\">128. It was emphatically argued by the learned Counsel for the assessee that the\npayments made by the assessee under the AdWord Distributor Agreement was in fact a\nbusiness profit in the hands of the GIL as it was paid on account of purchase of AdWord\nspace,though the AdWord Advertisement space was further sold to different advertisers.\nThe nature of payment remains the same i.e., the payment for purchase of AdWord\nspace. Thus it should be the business profit in the hands of the GIL. It was further\nargued that there was no transfer of technical know how or trade mark, intellectual\nproperty rights or any process in favour of the appellant under the AdWord Distribution\nAgreement. Therefore, the payment made under AdWord Distribution Agreement\ncannot be termed to be payment of royalty and is chargeable to tax under <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_276\">section 9(1)(vi)</a>\nof the Act as deemed income accrued in India. Whereas, according to Revenue, it was\nnot a payment simpliciter towards the purchase of AdWord space for its resale to\nadvertisers. The payment was made after deducting a particular percentage form the\nadvertisement receipts,received from the advertisers, though as per services agreement,\nthe assessee has rendered certain technical services but that too for the AdWord\nPrograms only, for which assessee has to receive certain payments as per terms of service\nagreement from GIL. But the entire aspect is to be looked into in the light of both the\ndistribution agreement and service agreement and the obligations cast upon the appellant\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                        Page 154 of 331</span>\n\nunder Adword distribution agreement.According to Revenue, the after sales services and\nthe Ad review are not possible without the aid of ITES division. Therefore, the payment\nmade to GIL by the assessee was on account of usage of their trade mark, intellectual\nproperty rights, process, derivative workss, etc., and thus nature of payment is royalty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_351\">129. In order to adjudicate the nature of payment, we are required to examine the\nAdWord Distributor Agreement and the Service Agreement. In foregoing paras, we\nhave already concluded that the AdWord Distributor Program and Services Agreement\nare interconnected with the navel cord and they cannot be segregated or separated.\nWithout resorting to service agreement, the obligation cast upon the assessee under the\nAdWord Distribution Agreement cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, we have to examine the\nrelevant clauses of the AdWord Distributor Agreement and the Service Agreement.\nUnder the AdWord Distributor Agreement, the appellant was responsible for uploading\nall advertisers&#x27; information that is required by Google for participation in the AdWord\nProgram. As per clause 2.3, the distributor shall provide after sales service to the\nadvertisers in accordance with the broad instructions, training and standards of Google.\nThe appellant&#x27;s employees were also required to be technically trained by the Google.\nAs per clause 9.4, upon the termination or the expiry of the agreement, all rights and\nlicences granted by one party to other including but not limited to use the other parties\nbrand features shall seize immediately and each party shall promptly return to the other\nparty or destroy and certify the destruction of all confidential information as defined in\nthe non-disclosure agreement and <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_277\">section 7</a> of this agreement on the other party. The\nbrand features and the confidential information has been defined in this agreement and\nthe same were also extracted in the foregoing paras of this order according to which the\nbrand features includes the title, interest and intellectual property right relating to brand\nfeatures and the confidential information means the confidential information shared by\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                                          Page 155 of 331</span>\n\none party to other as per this agreement meaning thereby under the AdWord Distributor\nAgreement, the appellant has access to the confidential information, intellectual property\nrights and the brand features of the GIL in order to provide effective services under the\nAdWord Distributor Agreement.

We have already reproduced relevant clauses of the service agreement in the\nforegoing paras for reference. Therefore, we do no prefer to extract the same again here\nwhile dealing with the issue. Under this service agreement, ownership of intellectual\nproperty, confidential information, software technologies, documentation shall remain\nthe exclusive property of the Google Ireland but the Google India, the appellant, was\nallowed under the licence to use it in order to fulfil the obligations cast upon it under the\nAdWord Distributor Agreement. Upon termination, either of the parties are required to\neither destroy all copies of information, information, documentations and other software\nembodiments in its possession or control and not to use the same after the expiration or\nthe termination of the agreement.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_353\">131. From the careful perusal of this AdWord Distribution Agreement and the Service\nAgreement, we find that appellant has not only purchased the advertisement space from\nthe GIL and resold it to the advertisers against certain advertisement charges but the\nappellant was required to provide on sale and post sale technical services to the advertiser\nand the GIL, which are not possible without resorting the service agreement. In fact, the\nassessee obtained the advertisement space under the AdWord Distribution Agreement\nand resell it to different advertisers along with on sale and after sale services. With the\naid of ITES division, the appellant is required to execute the programs and also provide\nall technical support to the advertisers and GIL. As per the agreement with the\nadvertisers, the advertisers are required to approach only the appellant and not the GIL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_354\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                                       Page 157 of 331</span>\n\nAppellant is in fact required to sort out all glitches to be faced by the advertisers while\nputting the ads on the AdWord Program.

As a fortiorari, it follows that <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_297\">Section 40(a)(ia)</a>\ncovers not only those cases where the amount is payable but also when it is paid. In this behalf,\none has to keep in mind the purpose with which <a href=\"/doc/1486104/\" id=\"a_298\">Section 40</a> was enacted and that has already\nbeen noted above. We have also to keep in mind the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1195538/\" id=\"a_299\">Sections 194C</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609896/\" id=\"a_300\">200</a>. Once\nit is found that the aforesaid Sections mandate a person to deduct tax at source not only on the\namounts payable but also when the sums are actually paid to the contractor, any person who\ndoes not adhere to this statutory obligation has to suffer the consequences which are stipulated\nin the Act itself. Certain consequences of failure to deduct tax at source from the payments\nmade, where tax was to be deducted at source or failure to pay the same to the credit of the\nCentral Government, are stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/726238/\" id=\"a_301\">Section 201</a> of the Act. This Section provides that in that\ncontingency, such a person would be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of such tax.\nWhile stipulating this consequence, <a href=\"/doc/726238/\" id=\"a_302\">Section 201</a> categorically states that the aforesaid Sections\nwould be without prejudice to any other consequences which that defaulter may incur. Other\nconsequences are provided under <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 40(a)(ia)</a> of the Act, namely, payments made by such\na person to a contractor shall not be treated as deductible expenditure. When read in this\ncontext, it is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_304\">Section 40(a)(ia)</a> deals with the nature of default and the consequences\nthereof. Default is relatable to Chapter XVIIB (in the instant case <a href=\"/doc/1195538/\" id=\"a_305\">Sections 194C</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609896/\" id=\"a_306\">200</a>, which\nprovisions are in the aforesaid Chapter). When the entire scheme of obligation to deduct the\ntax at source and paying it over to the Central Government is read holistically, it cannot be\nheld that the word &#x27;payable&#x27; occurring in <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_307\">Section 40(a)(ia)</a> refers to only those cases where the\namount is yet to be paid and does not cover the cases where the amount is actually paid. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49006086\" id=\"span_206\">If the\nprovision is interpreted in the manner suggested by the appellant herein, then even when it is\nfound that a person, like the appellant, has violated the provisions of Chapter XVIIB (or\nspecifically <a href=\"/doc/1195538/\" id=\"a_308\">Sections 194C</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609896/\" id=\"a_309\">200</a> in the instant case), he would still go scot free, without\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                                         Page 164 of 331</span>\n\nsuffering the consequences of such monetary default in spite of specific provisions laying down\nthese consequences.

Further, the mere incurring of a liability does not require an assessee to deduct\n      the tax at source even if such payments, if made, would require an assessee to deduct\n      the tax at source.

In other words, the liability\n      to deduct tax at source arises not on account of the assessee being liable to the payee\n      but only upon the liability being discharged in the case of an assessee following the\n      cash system and upon credit being given by an assessee following the mercantile\n      system. This is clear from every section in Chapter XVII.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">      27. Take for instance, the case of an assessee, who follows the cash system of\n      accounting and where the assessee who though liable to pay the contractor, fails to do\n      so for any reason. The assessee is not then liable to deduct tax at source. Take also the\n      case of an assessee, who follows the mercantile system. Such an assessee may have\n      incurred the liability to pay amounts to a party. Such an assessee is also not bound to\n      deduct tax at source unless he credits such sums to the account of the party/payee, such\n      as, a contractor. This is clear from <a href=\"/doc/1195538/\" id=\"a_312\">Section 194C</a> set out earlier. The liability to deduct\n      tax at source, in the case of an assessee following the cash system, arises only when\n      the payment is made and in the case of an assessee following the mercantile system,\n      when he credits such sum to the account of the party entitled to receive the payment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">      28. The government has nothing to do with the dispute between the assessee and the\n      payee such as a contractor. The provisions of the Act including <a href=\"/doc/1486104/\" id=\"a_313\">Section 40</a> and the\n      provisions of Chapter XVII do not entitle the tax authorities to adjudicate the liability of\n      an assessee to make payment to the payee/other contracting party. The appellant&#x27;s\n      submission, if accepted, would require an adjudication by the tax authorities as to the\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">                                          Page 165 of 331</span>\n\n       liability of the assessee to make payment. They would then be required to investigate all\n       the records of an assessee to ascertain its liability to third parties.

In order to adjudicate an issue of chargeability of tax on royalty we have examined\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_320\">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act according to which, it shall be deemed to\naccrue or arise in India when it has become payable by a person who is resident of India.\nWhereas as per <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_321\">article 12</a> of DTAA, the royalty means payment of any kind received as\nconsideration for the use of or the right to use any copyright of literary, artistic scientific\nwork including cinematograph films etc. It was emphatically argued by Sr. Advocate\nMr. Percy Pardiwala that wherever there is a conflict between the domestic law and\nDTAA, the provisions of DTAA will only prevail. Therefore, royalty only means when\nit is received as consideration for the use of or the right to use any copyright of literary,\nartistic, etc. We have also examined the judgment referred to by the parties on this issue\nand we find that it has to be taxed on receipt basis but in the instant case, the nature of\nAdWord Agreement and the Service Agreement is quite complexed. Under the Service\nAgreement, assessee would be paid by the GIL whereas under AdWord Agreement, the\nappellant is required to make payment of advertisement charges after deducting a\nparticular percentage to the GIL. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39708190\" id=\"span_215\">Though the assessee has contended that ITES division\nis exclusively involved in providing technical services to GIL as per the Services\nAgreement and its marketing division is involved in providing services as per AdWord\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                                       Page 167 of 331</span>\n\nProgram but in order the examine the actual services rendered by the appellant under the\nAdWord Program, one has to read both the agreements together. In the foregoing paras,\nwe have already adjudicated and concluded that both these agreements are connected\nwith the navel cord and they cannot be segregated. Therefore, both the agreements are\nto be read together in order to find out the actual functioning of the appellant, as held by\njurisdictional High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/39708190/\" id=\"a_322\">Synopsys International Ltd.</a>, (supra) that it is\nnecessary to look into the terms of the agreement entered into between the parties as it\nwould be purely question of fact to be decided on the basis of the intention of the parties\nas could be gathered from the written words used in the agreement. During the course\nof hearing, our attention was also invited to return filed by the GIL for the assessment\nyear 2009-10 in which the GIL has shown its method of accounting as mercantile system\nof accounting. Once the GIL has itself has declared the method of accounting as\nmercantile system it cannot claim that for the purpose of royalty, system of accounting\nshould be on cash/reciept basis. Moreover, the adjustment entries are to made in the\nbooks of accounts of the appellant as well as GIL with regard to the payment under\nService Agreement and AdWord Program Agreement. It is also an admitted fact that in\nview of clause 6.1 of EXHIBIT-A attached to Distributor agreement, payments are to be\nmade during the year on short intervals and the final trued-up payment on the basis of\naudited accounts of GIL. The appellant could not demonstrate that the royalty was not\npaid to or received by the GIL and it was simply credited to its accounts in the books of\naccounts of the appellant.     Under these situations, we do not find any merit in the\ncontentions of the assessee that royalty cannot be taxed in the impugned assessment year\nas it was not received by the GIL and therefore is not chargeable to tax in India as a\ndeemed income accrued. Since the payment made under the distribution agreement to\nGIL by the appellant is held to be the payment of royalty, appellant is required to deduct\nthe TDS on such payment.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_373\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                       Page 168 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_374\">139. On the point of equalization levy, we find that by the <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_323\">Finance Act, 2016</a>,\nequalization levy was introduced and as per its definition, equalization levy means tax\nleviable on consideration received or receivable for any services specified under the\nprovisions of the chapter. They have also defined specified service which means online\nadvertisement, any provision for digital advertisement space or any other facility of\nservice for the purpose of online advertisement and includes any other services as may\nbe notified by the Central Government in this behalf. It was further clarified that from\nthe date of the commencement there shall be charge on equalization levy @ 6% on the\namount of consideration for any specified services received or receivable by a person\nbeing a non-resident from a person resident in India carried on business or profession or\nnon-resident having a permanent establishment in India.                Meaning thereby, the\nLegislature has introduced the equalization levy to tax the considerations paid by\nresident to a non-resident who is not having a permanent establishment in India. No\ndoubt, it may be business profit in the hands of the recipient and the Legislature intend\nto tax the business profit as it has arisen out of the activities performed in India. But it\ndoes not effect other kind of services in which technology,the know-how, copyrights or\nIPRs are involved. From this argument, the learned Counsel for the assessee intend to\ndemonstrate that since the intention of the Legislature to treat the payment by the\nadvertisers to the non-resident is a business profit in the hands of the recipient the same\nshould be treated in other cases also where the payments are made by the residents to\nnon-residents for a consideration of use of technical know-how, IPRs, copyrights,\nderivative workss and other intangibles. But we do not find any merit in this argument\nas the equilization levy is to charged only on consideration for specified services and not\nothers where there is use of IPR, copyright and other intangibles. In the instant case,\nunder AdWord Distribution and Service Agreement, the appellant has acquired licence\nto use IPRs, copyright and other intangibles to provide better services either to GIL or\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                       Page 169 of 331</span>\n\nto advertisers. Therefore, the introduction of equilisation levy would not convert the\nnature of payment made by the appellant to GIL.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_375\">140. With regard to another limb of argument of the learned Counsel for the assessee\nthat in providing a space on Google AdWord Program to the advertisers, the trade mark\nor the GIL was not involved therefore consideration paid by the appellant to GIL is not\nroyalty, we find that the AdWord was registered with the Registrar of Trade Marks,\nMumbai in the name Google Inc., but the programme is known as Google AdWord\nProgram owned by the Google Inc., under which GIL has provided space to appellant\nfor its sale to the various advertisers. The learned Counsel for the assessee in this regard\nhas contended that if the trade mark is used as incidental to the main activity, it cannot\nbe called that there was a transfer of trade mark or licence to use the trade mark. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"163959178\" id=\"span_219\">In\nsupport of his contention, he has invited our attention to the judgment of Delhi High\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/163959178/\" id=\"a_324\">Director of Income Tax Vs.

The scope of services envisaged in the\nagreement was publicity, advertisement and sales including reservation services. In\nconsideration of the services which the assessee was required to render, ITC Ltd., agreed\nto pay a fee @ 3% of the room sales to the assessee. According to Revenue what the\nassessee was making available to the ITC hotels was technical and consultancy service;\nprovision of training to its employees&#x27; the use of its trade mark (even though they were\nfree of cost, these were services according to him linked to the trade mark), making\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                      Page 170 of 331</span>\n\navailable the technical know-how, documentation and manuals for which while the\nassessee was not charging a lumpsum fees the consideration received by the assessee\nwas relatable to the business concluded by its client-hotels and the reservation network.\nBased on these observations, the AO has concluded that assessee had a business\nconnection with India and hence fees received on account of services rendered by the\nassessee were deemed to accrue or arise in India and therefore assessee&#x27;s case was\ncovered under <a href=\"/doc/1369261/\" id=\"a_325\">section 9</a> of the Act. While adjudicating the issue CIT(A) has classified\nservices rendered by the assessee into three categories.

The matter was carried to the Tribunal and the Tribunal examined the arguments\nand the related nature of services and came to the conclusion that the main service\nrendered by the assessee to its client was advertisement, publicity and sales\npromotion,keeping in mind the mutual interest and in that context, the use of trade mark,\ntrade name or the stylized &#x27;S&#x27; or other illuminated sereivces referred in the agreement\nwith the assessee were incidental to the main service.

The FOWC and Jaypee Sports both approached the AAR on issue whether the\npayment of consideration receivable by FOWC outside India in terms of RPC from\nJaypee was or was not royalty as defined in <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_332\">article 13</a> India-UK DTAA. The AAR\nhaving examined the contents of the agreement in the light of rival submissions have\nconcluded that firstly the amount paid was royalty secondly FOWC had no fixed place\nof business nor was doing any business activity in India and had not authorized any\norganization or entity to conclude contracts on their behalf and therefore had no PE in\nIndia. The assessee moved to the High Court against both the observations of the AAR\nand with regard to question whether the payment made by Jaypee to FOWC is in the\nnature of royalty under DTAA for the use of later&#x27;s trade mark. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court\nhas examined the facts of the case and have come to the conclusion that from the tenure\nof the agreement, the main purpose of the RPC is not for grant of trade mark rights or\nprivilege or licence to use, and the payment made to it under RPC are not the royalty\neither in the Act or the DTAA, they most certainly are not for the use of the trade mark\nor the IP rights, but rather for the grant of privilege of staging, hosting and promoting\nthe event at the promoters racing circuit in Noida.

FOWC and Jaypee argue that the rights given to the latter under the RPC was the grant\nof a bundle of rights the basic objective of which were to enable it, as the promoter to stage a\nmotor racing event in India at its circuit, the Buddh International Circuit, that would be an\nofficial round of the FIA Formula One World Championship, in which all participant teams\nand drivers in that Championship would therefore compete. The permission to use the F1 marks\nfor purposes limited to advertising the Event was incidental to the grant of that principal right\nto enable hosting of the event. They also argue that under the terms of the RPC and the ALA\nJaypee had no independent right of commercial exploitation of the marks. Therefore, the two\nindependent contracting parties agreed that no consideration was payable to FOWC in relation\nto the use of the marks. Though the right included the right to name the event specifically, it\nwas predominantly in the nature of a pure commercial right. It was argued that the payment to\nFOWC was the dominant purpose of securing the right to &quot;put on&quot; (i.e. host, stage and promote)\nat its circuit and as its own commercial venture, an official round of a globally popular\ninternational sporting series. The consideration was not paid for the use of any copyright,\ntrademark or other intellectual property mentioned in the definition of &#x27;royalty&#x27;, whether\nW.P.(C) 10307/2016, W.P.(C) 9509/2016 &amp; W.P.(C) 10145/2016 Page 56 under second\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_333\">Section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act or <a href=\"/doc/654960/\" id=\"a_334\">Article 13(3)</a> of the India-UK DTAA. The ALA was\nincidental to and a mere consequence of the RPC. Its purpose was to ensure that the use of Fl\nand related marks would be strictly controlled and limited to the sole purpose of promoting the\nevent(s), and that Jaypee and other third parties would not be permitted to use the marks in\nconnection with any other unauthorized activity or commercial venture that could damage or\ndilute the reputation and prestige of the Championship. FOWC and Jaypee therefore urge that\nthe AAR‟s finding that the payment amounted to &quot;royalty&quot; is contrary to law. They argue that\nthe AAR also erred in distinguishing and not following Sheraton(supra). The revenue on the\nother hand, supports the AAR‟s conclusions and findings; it urges that the terms of the ALA\nand the RPC clearly show that the payment of US$ 40 million was to enable Jaypee the use of\nthe F1 trademark and logo; they point out that these marks figured prominently in the trackside\nadvertisements and the tickets that were printed. The use of the logo, to promote the event,\n                                                IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                      IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                               IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                                          Page 174 of 331</span>\n\ntherefore meant use of the F1 marks. The nomenclature or terms of an agreement are not\nalways determinative of the true nature of the transaction; in this case, it clearly was to permit\nthe use of the F1 mark. The character of the event would have been different had the F1 marks\nnot been used by Jaypee. It was held that the popularity of the event is a result only of the use\nof the Marks, and that without those marks it would not enjoy its popularity otherwise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">66. Under trademark law, particularly in India, trademark use even for advertisement purposes\nis to be preceded by prior consent of the proprietor and any unauthorized use of the trademark\nwithout such prior permission of the proprietor could lead to an infringement of the trademark\n(in India, under <a href=\"/doc/84096/\" id=\"a_335\">section 29</a> of the Trade Marks Act,1999). To secure registration for the marks\nin India from the Trademark Registry, FOWC and Jaypee entered into the ALA. The function\nof the ALA was (a) to provide for a strictly limited usage of the marks i.e. only for advertisement\nand promotion of the Indian Grand Prix Event; (b) to provide for restrictions on usage of such\nmarks, i.e. not for any commercial purposes such as use on merchandise, etc.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">67. The grant of a right, in the form of license to use the trademark is primarily to be utilized\nin the licensee‟s product. In a typical case of licensing, the trademark proprietor W.P.(C)\n10307/2016, W.P.(C) 9509/2016 &amp; W.P.(C) 10145/2016 Page 57 does not wish to mark its\nproducts in an area; it licenses the mark, to be used by the licensee‟s products, subject to\nlimitations. The licensee has no right to initiate legal proceedings, in the event of infringement,\nunless specifically authorized; the property in the mark always vests with the owner. Even the\nuse of the mark by the licensee inures to the owner, as the latter‟s continuous use, in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/641855/\" id=\"a_336\">Section 48</a> of the Trademarks Act. Typically, therefore when a trade vendor or establishment\nsells branded goods, it is incorrect to state that the income earned by the vendor is generated\nfrom the brand or mark, associated with the product, rather than from sale of the product itself.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_380\">It would be incorrect therefore, to conclude that income earned is not from the sale of the\nproduct, but from marketing intangibles connected with the reputation of the mark, though that\nreputation guarantees a high demand for the product, from which the seller benefits. Likewise,\nin the case of distribution, a distribution agent is under an agreement with the manufacturer to\nsell its good; it also possesses the right to advertise the goods and brands of the manufacturer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_381\">                                                IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                      IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                               IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">                                           Page 175 of 331</span>\n\nThis implies a license of the manufacturer‟s trademark.

It is relevant here to consider the conditions in the RPC and the ALA, which FOWC entered\ninto with Jaypee. Under recital B to the RPC, FOWC clearly has the exclusive right to exploit\nthe commercial rights in the championship and to award Jaypee the right to host, stage and\npromote F1 Grand Prix events. Clause 17, states that FOWC would through reasonable\nendeavors ensure that at least sixteen cars participate in the Event. Clause 18 forbids Jaypee\nfrom making any audio or visual image of the event;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_384\">W.P.(C) 10307/2016, W.P.(C) 9509/2016 &amp; W.P.(C) 10145/2016 Page 58 likewise there are\nrestrictions in clause 19 of the RPC. Clause 23.2 permits FOWC to make incidental use of I.P.\nrights solely for the limited purpose of facilitating Jaypee to promote the event. Under the RPC\nJaypee remains liable to pay the full contractual amount in the year of termination and in the\nsubsequent year, the right to use trademarks, logos and IP Rights ceases instantly, the moment\ntermination takes place. This is a strong pointer to the fact that the amounts payable by Jaypee\nto FOWC under the RPC are really for the privilege of hosting and staging the championship\nrace and not for the IP rights, which in any event, could be utilized by it only to promote the\nrace and for no other purpose.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_385\">70.

The judgment in <a href=\"/doc/95221080/\" id=\"a_339\">Director of Income Tax v. Ericsson A.B.</a> [2012] 343 ITR 470 (Del), held\nthat a lump-sum payment which is not based on or connected with the extent of the user of the\nIP rights would not constitute &quot;royalties&quot; within the meaning of the DTAA. In the present case,\nthe payments made under the RPC were separate lump-sum amounts in respect of the three\nseparate race events held in each of the three (3) years 2011 to 2013. It is not a payment, which\nis based on either the number of tickets sold or the total amount of revenue earned by Jaypee\nin each of the said years or indeed on any other measure. In the present case, the lump sum\npayable to FOWC by Jaypee would likewise, not constitute royalties. Importantly, recital (B)\nof the ALA specifically stated that FOWC wished to grant a license to Jaypee permitting only\nthe incidental use of certain IP rights and artwork &quot;solely for the limited purpose of facilitating\nthe hosting, staging and promotion of the event&quot;. The definition of &quot;permitted use&quot; in clause\n1.1 of the ALA states that it means only the incidental use of the licensed marks and materials\n&quot;for the purpose of hosting, staging or promoting the event, but for the avoidance of doubt, not\nto include use for any merchandising or other products or services whatsoever, whether\ndistributed free of charge or for sale&quot;. Clauses 2.2 and 6.2 of the ALA provide that the ALA will\ncontinue only until the RPC terminates or expires; Clause 2.3 of the ALA W.P.(C) 10307/2016,\nW.P.(C) 9509/2016 &amp; W.P.(C) 10145/2016 Page 59 prohibits Jaypee from using any of the\nlicensed marks, or as part of the name of the circuit, any corporate name, any domain name,\nwebsite address or other URL identification or equivalent used in association with Jaypee.\nJaypee thus has no IP rights whatsoever independently of the staging and hosting of the event.\nThe undertakings given by Jaypee, set out in Clauses 3.1(e) and 3.6 of the ALA too reinforce\nthis conclusion. These are strong indications that the parties did not intend, through the RPC\nand the ALA, to license the trademark. Thus, it does not amount to royalty under the DTAA.\nThe court is in agreement with FOWC‟s position on the definition of &quot;royalty&quot; as set out in the\nsecond Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act; it is significantly broader than the definition\nof &quot;royalties&quot; set out in <a href=\"/doc/654960/\" id=\"a_341\">Article 13(3)</a> of the India-UK DTAA.

The impugned order neither contains any discussion nor finding whatsoever on this crucial\nissue even though it goes to the root of the entire case. The entire tenor of the agreement- even\nthe main purpose of the RPC, is not for the grant of trademark rights or privilege or license to\nuse. The payments made to it under the RPC are not &quot;royalty&quot; either under the Act or the DTAA,\nthey most certainly are not for the use of trademarks or IP rights, but rather for the grant of\nthe privilege of staging, hosting and promoting the Event at the promoter&#x27;s racing circuit in\nNoida(NCR). FOWC under the RPC, made available to Jaypee all of the elements which\nconstitute the event. In particular, this includes nominating (to FIA) the promoter&#x27;s event for\ninclusion in the official F1 racing calendar; after such inclusion the F1 racing teams with their\nF1 cars and drivers were bound to participate in Jaypee&#x27;s event held at the Promoter&#x27;s racing\ncircuit, strictly in conformity with the requirements of the F1 Sporting and Technical\nRegulations and the FIA Sporting Code. Therefore, the grant of F1 rights by the FOWC to\nJaypee is merely incidental to the hosting and staging of the event by it, and this is clear from\nthe fact that the use of rights by Jaypee has been strictly confined and limited to use only for\nthe promotion of the event, and for no other purpose and in no other manner whatsoever. &quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"95221080\" id=\"span_230\">145.

In other succeeding years i.e. AYs 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16, the assessment order\n\ndenying the benefit of beneficial ownership to GIL was approved by the CIT(Appeals)\n\nand the assessee is in appeal before us in ITA no 949&amp; 958 /Bang/17 against the\n\nconfirmation of the order of the AO. Therefore, we have to adjudicate the issue in the\n\nlight of evidence placed before the lower authorities and also before us.                    While\n\ndisallowing the claim of assessee, the AO has examined the concept of beneficial\n\nownership and the surrounding circumstances and also in the light of tax residency\n\ncertificate issued by the revenue authorities to GIL. The AO has examined the concept\n\nof beneficial ownership in the light of UK Trust of Laws and UN Model of Convention\n\nand was of the view that the object of this concept is to identify the true owner of income\n\nor asset with ultimate rights of enjoyment. There is no definition available either under\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">                                      Page 183 of 331</span>\n\nUN Model of Convention or under domestic tax laws of India. The AO further observed\n\nthat the concept of beneficial ownership was introduced in the tax treaties as a counter\n\nmeasure against the treaty shopping to confine bargain only to the contracting states\n\nwhich were intended to benefit from the treaty. The concept of beneficial ownership is\n\na tool to protect the bargain between the two contracting states. None of the country\n\nwould intend to relinquish its tax base without getting something back for it. The\n\nbeneficial owner is used to confine the bargain to the parties who were intended to\n\nbenefit from it.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_394\">153. The AO further noticed in India-Ireland treaty that the treaty does not use the\n\ngeneral term &#x27;owner&#x27;, but uses specific term &#x27;beneficial owner&#x27;. Therefore treaty intends\n\nto give benefit of withholding tax at the reduced rates only to the person who can be\n\nloosely described as a &#x27;final&#x27; owner of income. The concept of final owner of income\n\ncan be elaborated with the help of attributes of ownership of income. The AO further\n\nobserved that income ownership has several attributes such as right to possess, use or\n\nmanage income, power to alienate and ability to consume waste or destroy, the risk of\n\ndepreciation and hope of appreciation. It is possible to split these attributes among\n\ndifferent persons by entering into a legal or contractual arrangement to avail benefit of\n\nthe favourable treaty without losing ownership of income. Therefore, beneficial owner\n\nis the one who has more attributes of ownership of income than others. He further placed\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">                                       Page 184 of 331</span>\n\nreliance upon the explanation by Charles Du Toit describing that beneficial owner is the\n\nperson whose ownership attributes outweighs those of any other person. Besides he has\n\nalso placed a reliance on the Bulletin for International Taxation, Vol. 64 (2010) no.10,\n\npages 500 - 509.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_395\">154. During the course of assessment proceedings, the AO has asked the assessee to\n\nfurnish evidence in support of its claim that GIL is the beneficial owner of the royalties\n\npayable by GIPL. In response thereto, the assessee has filed a Tax Residency\n\nCertification (TRC) issued by the revenue authorities of Ireland and the financial\n\nstatements of GIL for the year ending 31.12.2012. Reliance was also placed upon the\n\nstatement of Finance Minister on 01.03.2013 in which it was clarified that TRC produced\n\nby the resident of the contracting state will be accepted as evidence that the person is a\n\nresident of that contracting state and the income-tax authorities will not go behind the\n\nTRC to question the resident status of that person. The AO was not convinced with the\n\nexplanation furnished by the assessee and he observed that TRC of GIL has never been\n\nquestioned. The GIPL was asked to prove whether GIPL is the beneficial owner of\n\namounts payable by GIPL under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_361\">Article 12</a> of the treaty. The AO further observed that\n\nTRC is essential to prove that person is a resident of a contracting state in order to claim\n\nthe treaty benefits. He has also examined the statement of Hon&#x27;ble Finance Minister on\n\nthe proposed insertion of <a href=\"/doc/110992633/\" id=\"a_362\">section 90A(5)</a> and noted that TRC certifies that you are a\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">                                      Page 185 of 331</span>\n\nresident, but it does not certify you are a beneficial owner. The AO has also examined\n\nthe different layers of holdings involved in these transactions. The legal owner of\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) in the Adword program is Google Inc. USA , which has in turn\n\ngiven the rights to use the IP in the Adwords program to the group entity Google Ireland\n\nHoldings (GIH). GIH in turn by license agreement given the rights to use the Adwords\n\nprogram to Google Netherlands Holding, BV (GNHBV), a Netherlands based\n\nsubsidiary, for which GNHBV pays royalty to GIH. GNHBV in turn by license\n\nagreement has given the rights to use the Adwords program to GIL for which GIL pays\n\nroyalty to GNHBV. The AO has depicted the relationship diagram in his order and for\n\nthe sake of reference, we extract the same hereunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\">                                   Google In.

The AO accordingly asked the assessee to furnish (1) the agreement between\n\nGNHBV and GIL, (2) the agreement between GIH and GNHBV, and (3) the agreement\n\nbetween Google Inc. and GIH; but the assessee did not furnish the copies of agreement\n\nbefore the AO and the AO observed that it would be difficult to accept the claim that\n\nGIL is the beneficial owner of royalties payable by GIPL to GIL as the terms and\n\nconditions under which GIL was given the licensing rights over Adwords program is not\n\nknown. He further observed that GIL is an operational company, but this fact alone is\n\nnot sufficient to state that GIL is the beneficial owner of the amounts paid/payable by\n\nGIPL.

Google explained in its responses that it minimised tax within the letter of\n   the law and that low tax areas or tax havens influenced where it located its\n   group companies. The vast majority of Google&#x27;s non-USA sales are billed in\n   Ireland. Goodie makes money from business to business advertising, adverts\n   which can be targeted to the UK website and to UK Google users. In the UK,\n   Google Ltd recorded revenues of £396 million in 2011, from Google Ireland,\n   but paid corporation tax of only £6 million. Google Ireland paid for the\n   services provided by the 1,300 staff in the UK. Google had approximately 700\n   staff who undertake marketing work in the UK as part of their activities, but\n   only 200 of Google&#x27;s Irish staff of 3,000 were involved in marketing Google\n   in the UK.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_256\">   11. Google accepted that profits should be taxed in the jurisdictions where\n   the economic activity generating those profits occurred but it asserted that its\n   underlying economic activity arose from the innovative software technology\n   underlying its Google search engine generated by the US company. Goodie\n   also confirmed that it had an entity based in          Bermuda to protect its\n   intellectual property. We consider that the company undermined its own\n   argument since it remits its non-USA profits (including from the UK) not to\n   the USA but to Bermuda and therefore may be depriving the USA of legitimate\n   tax revenue as well as the UK. Subsequently, Google told us that there were\n   no outstanding issues with HMRC about Google UK&#x27;s accounts.

The tax you save on that\n      deprives the US taxpayer of significant sums. The significance to us in the UK\n      is that the tax you save on those non-US profits is then used for a competitive\n      distortion to allow you, in essence, to compete against UK companies,\n      because you have a huge amount of profit on which you are not paying tax.\n      Matt Brittin: No, I don&#x27;t think that is right. The money that goes to Bermuda\n      can be used for funding our growth outside the US, so that money can be used\n      for R and D expenses, acquisitions and investment in data centres or\n      buildings. In fact, since we met last time, we have committed £1 billion to\n      investment in King&#x27;s Cross to increase our presence in the UK, and we could\n      fund that from Bermuda. Thousands of companies, including many British\n      companies, use arrangements such as ours in Bermuda, which allow us to\n      invest in the growth of our business outside the US. Large sums are spent on\n      R and D, acquisitions, investments in buildings and, as I have mentioned, we\n      have just committed to King&#x27;s Cross.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_271\">6.2      It is evident from the Report of the Public Accounts Committee of the House\nof Commons that the profits derived by GIL are transferred to the entity GIH which\n                                          IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                           IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                         IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                                     Page 192 of 331</span>\n\nis controlled and managed in Bermuda, a tax haven.

A US\n      corporation has the ability to own &#x27;non-US&#x27; intellectual property, in an Irish\n      company which is not an Irish tax resident. As the company is incorporated\n      in Ireland, it&#x27;s seen as Irish from a US point view, but from Irish Revenue&#x27;s\n      perspective it is a foreign company and therefore not subject to withholding\n      tax. This conveniently ignores the fact that the non-resident Irish company is\n      in a tax haven like the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. It then enters into a\n      licensing agreement with an Irish incorporated and Irish tax-resident\n      company (the second holding company), which from Irish revenue&#x27;s point of\n      view is subject to corporation tax. This second holding company acts as the\n      EMEA hub where, nominally,pass through. However, for the money to flow\n      to the Cayman Islands or Bermuda it requires the use of the Netherlands.

Therefore the submissions of the\nfinancial statements of GIL the year ending December 2012 only shows that GIL is\nan operational company but it does not say anything with respect to the ownership\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">                                       Page 202 of 331</span>\n\n      and control over the sums paid/payable by GIPL.

The AO has also examined the information available in public domain in this\n\nregard and finally concluded that GIL is not the beneficial owner of the royalty received\n\nfrom GIPL and accordingly taxed the royalty at 10.556%.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_438\">157. Aggrieved, the assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT(Appeals) and the\n\nCIT(A) being convinced with the contentions of the assessee, accepted the claim of\n\nassessee and held that GIL is the beneficial owner of the royalty received.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_439\">158. Now the revenue is before us and during the course of hearing, the ld. Standing\n\nCounsel has invited our attention to the Report of House of Commons, Committee of\n\nPublic Accounts, who have recorded the statement of Mr. Mett Brittin, VP of Google\n\nSales &amp; Operations, Northern &amp; Central Europe. The ld. Standing Counsel has also\n\ncontended that assessee was asked to furnish the agreements executed between GNHBV\n\n&amp; GIL, GIH &amp; GNHBV and Google Inc. and GIH, in order to understand that how much\n\nright was conferred upon the other companies through license agreement. Undisputedly,\n\nGoogle Adwords program is owned by Google Inc. USA. It was licensed by Google\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_260\">                                       Page 203 of 331</span>\n\nInc. to Google Ireland Holdings (GIH) which in turn was further licensed to Google\n\nNetherlands Holding BV (GNHBV) and in turn GNHBV licensed it to Google Ireland\n\nLtd. (GIL). Since there are four layers of holdings of this Adwords program, it is not\n\nclear how much right in license were conferred to different holdings and how the revenue\n\ncollected on Adwords program is to be distributed amongst the above holdings. The\n\nassessee has claimed that GIL is the beneficial owner of the payment of royalty, therefore\n\nonus is upon it to place evidence on record that out of the total revenue collected on\n\naccount of Adwords program, major share goes to GIL. But the assessee did not\n\ndischarge its obligation and raised a vague argument.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_440\">159. The ld. Standing Counsel further <a href=\"/doc/368282/\" id=\"a_370\">placed reliance upon</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Finance\n\nMinister&#x27;s clarification on Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) dated 01.03.2013 on which\n\nthe assessee has placed heavy reliance with the submission that through this clarification\n\nit has been made clear that TRC produced by a resident of contracting state will be\n\naccepted as evidence that he is a resident of that contracting state and income-tax\n\nauthorities in India will not go behind the TRC and question the resident status. He also\n\ninvited our attention to the clarification regarding the taxation of income from dividends\n\nand capital gain under Indo-Mauritius Double Tax Avoidance Convention (DTAC) with\n\nthe submission that the clarification was issued with regard to taxation from dividends\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_261\">                                       Page 204 of 331</span>\n\nand capital gains under Indo-Mauritius DTAC. Though it has been clarified that\n\nwherever certificate of residence is issued by Mauritius authorities, such certificate will\n\nconstitute sufficient evidence for accepting the status of residence as well as beneficial\n\nownership for applying the DTAC accordingly. Therefore the clarification issued would\n\nnot apply to the income received in the form of royalty. Moreover, the AO has made\n\nout a case that different layers of holdings were involved in the Adwords program and\n\nthe revenue has to be shared amongst them, therefore it cannot be presumed only on the\n\nbasis of TRC that GIL is the beneficial owner. Therefore, the CIT(Appeals) has wrongly\n\nconcluded that GIL is the beneficial owner under the facts and circumstances. In\n\nsucceeding year, the CIT(A) has concurred with the view of the AO. The ld. Standing\n\nCounsel further placed a reliance upon the judgment of High Court of Australia in the\n\ncase of Google Inc. v. Australian Competition and Consumers Commission[2013]\n\nHCA 1 249 CLR 435 in which it was held that Google is the owner of the search engine\n\nand the Adwords programs which were later on given to license to other holdings.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_441\">160. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, Mr. Percy Pardiwalla, Sr. Advocate, has placed\n\nheavy reliance upon the clarifications given with regard to Indo-Mauritius DTAC with\n\nthe submission that the Circular No.789 dated 13.04.2000 in this regard continued to be\n\nin force at the time when the press release was issued on 01.03.2013 by Finance Ministry\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_262\">                                       Page 205 of 331</span>\n\nwith regard to clarification on tax residency certificates. Therefore, in the light of this\n\nclarification, the TRC in respect of GIL submitted by the assessee is sufficient to hold\n\nthat GIL is the beneficial owner of the royalty received. Therefore, it should be charged\n\nto tax only @ 10%.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_442\">161. The learned Counsel for the assessee further contended that the GIL was\n\ncontrolling the AdWord Program and has given a distributor right to the Appellant under\n\nthe Google AdWord Program. Whatever revenue is generated under this Google\n\nAdWord Program it was remitted to GIL by the Appellant after deducting its share as\n\nper the Distribution Agreement. It was further contended that it has been repeatedly held\n\nthat the residency certificate is a beneficial ownership certificate and on its filing the\n\nRevenue will not make any further enquiry with regard to the residential status of the\n\nnon-resident. In support of his contention, he has placed reliance upon the following\n\njudgments:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_286\">         ADIT Vs.

GNHBV is a\n\nsubsidiary of Google Ireland Holdings and Google Ireland Holdings is a subsidiary of\n\nGoogle Inc. USA.

The Authority of Advanced Ruling in P.13 of 1995 (supra) has observed while\n\ndealing with the issue of beneficial ownership that &quot;the agreements require ABC to\n\nutilize all the expertise at its disposal - whether its own or acquired from others - in the\n\nexecution of the contract and for these services it receives payments which are in the\n\nnature of royalties or fee for technical services. The circumstances that, for discharging\n\nits functionsunder the contracts, the ABC in turn may have to seek similar help from\n\nothers and pay for it cannot detract from the beneficial ownership of the ABC over the\n\nroyalties and technical fees it receives from XY. On the other hand, it is because the\n\nABC has such beneficial ownership that it is able to utilize the payments received from\n\nXY for making payments to its suppliers if not already made. In fact, ABC may or may\n\nnot be passing on to its suppliers the same amounts which it receives from XY. Nor may\n\nit be passing on the expertise acquired by it from the various suppliers in the same form\n\nto XY as it has to modify, synthesise and integrate them so as to suit the needs of the\n\nmanufacturing plant and industrial complex and supply the technologies to XY as a\n\nsingle source. Hence, unless the processes and expertise referred to are supplied directly\n\nto XY by the affiliates and third parties - which is not envisaged under the agreements\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">                                       Page 215 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_469\">- royalties and technical fees paid by XY to the ABC will belong to the latter and be in\n\nits beneficial ownership.

Undisputedly, the search engine and Adwords program\n\nbelong to GIL as is clear from the judgment of High Court of Australia in which it has\n\nbeen held that Google Inc. operates the well known internet search engine &quot;Google&quot;. In\n\nthat judgment, they have also described how the Google engine functions and how the\n\nsearch results are obtained. In that judgment, it was also held that Adwords Program is\n\na program which allows advertiser to create, change and monitor the performance of\n\nsponsored links. Google provides advertisers with access to the Adwords program\n\nthrough Adwords accounts. Worldwide, hundreds or thousands of advertisers use the\n\nAdwords program. It was also observed that Google derives most of its revenue from\n\nits online advertising business, which involves publishing or displaying advertisements\n\nas sponsored links on its search results pages. It was also made clear in that judgment\n\nthat participation in the Adwords program is subject to Google&#x27;s Terms of Service, the\n\nAdwords Program Terms and applicable Google policies, etc. From the reading of the\n\njudgment, it is clear that Google Inc. is the ultimate body which controls the Google\n\nAdwords program and they also share some part of revenue collected on account of\n\nAdwords program. It is also undisputed fact that Google Inc. has licensed the Adwords\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">                                       Page 218 of 331</span>\n\nprogram and other intangibles to Google Ireland Holdings (GIH), who in turn licensed\n\nto Google Netherlands Holdings B.V. (GNHBV) and in turn GNHBV further licensed\n\nthe Adwords program and intangibles to Google Ireland Ltd. (GIL), who finally has\n\ngiven the distributor rights of the assessee for selling the Adwords space to advertisers,\n\nmeaning thereby, whatever revenue is generated on account of sale of Adwords space to\n\ndifferent advertisers, the revenue is to be distributed amongst all the holdings as they\n\nhave some beneficial interests therein. But before us, the assessee has not filed license\n\nagreements executed between Google Inc. USA and Google Ireland Holdings (GIH),\n\nGIH and GNHBV. Only one license agreement between GNHBV and GIL was filed\n\nand from its careful perusal, we find that out of the rights acquired in the Adwords\n\nprogram and intangibles, GNHBV has sub-licensed certain rights to GIL for Adwords\n\nprogram. On the basis of that license, GIL executed Adwords Distributor agreement\n\nwith the appellant for selling the Adwords space to advertisers. Since other parent\n\nholdings of GIL were involved in the Adwords programs directly or indirectly, they have\n\na right to share the revenue generated under the Adwords Distributor Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_475\">Though the onus is cast upon the appellant to place the relevant evidence in order to\n\nestablish that GIL is the beneficial owner of the royalty received, but it could not place\n\nany evidence on record in this regard, except the oral submissions. Whereas, the AO\n\nhas made out a case that so many holdings are involved in this Adwords program,\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                                       Page 219 of 331</span>\n\ntherefore the revenue collected on account of royalty payment is to be shared amongst\n\nthe other holdings. The assessee rather could not place the agreements executed between\n\nGoogle Inc. &amp; GIH and GIH &amp; GNHBV and GNHBV and GIL before the AO despite\n\nhis repeated requests. He has simply filed the operating license agreement executed\n\nbetween GNHBV and GIL berore us and for the remaining he has contended that he has\n\nno access to it. This contention of the assessee cannot be accepted inasmuch as all\n\nGoogle companies are inter-related and subsidiary of others. From a reading of this\n\nagreement, it is not clear as to how much revenue is shared by different holdings. In the\n\nabsence of the relevant evidence either in the form of agreement executed between the\n\nvarious holding companies or otherwise, it is not clear as to whether the GIL has full\n\ncontrol over the receipt received under Google AdWord Program or the GIL was acting\n\nas a conduit of its parent holdings. We therefore are of the view that this aspect requires\n\na fresh look by the AO in the light of all the relevant evidences. We accordingly restore\n\nthe matter to the AO after setting aside the order of the CIT(A) in this regard in all these\n\nappeals to readjudicate the issue of beneficial ownership in the light of the license\n\nagreements executed between the parent holdings of the GIL. We accordingly direct the\n\nappellant to extend all sort of cooperation by producing the agreement executed between\n\nthe various parent holdings of the GIL. Thus the matter is restored to the file of the AO\n\nto readjudicate the issue of beneficial ownership in terms indicated above.

The brief facts on the impugned issues are that the AO has rejected the books of\naccounts as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/488246/\" id=\"a_386\">section 145</a> of the Act and calculated the disallowance\nof certain payments made to GIL by the appellant on account of business profit under\n<a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_387\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> of the Act on non-deduction of TDS. The assessee has challenged the\nrejection of books of accounts and also the disallowance made under <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_388\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> of\nthe Act before the CIT(A) but did not find favour with him. Now the assessee is before\nus and his leanred Counsel Mr. Percy Pardiwala has invited our attention to provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/488246/\" id=\"a_389\">section 145</a> r.w.s. 144 of the Act with the submission that once the books of accounts\nare rejected, the AO has to estimate the assessee&#x27;s income and no disallowance can be\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                       Page 225 of 331</span>\n\nmade under different heads. The assessee had prepared its financial statements for the\nyear in accordance with law and the prescribed accounting standards issued by ICAI and\ncomplete and consistent disclosures including the notes to accounts have been made in\nthe financial statements. There had been no change in the financial policy followed by\nthe assessee during the year under consideration from the earlier years and the financial\nstatements of the assessee had been duly audited by an independent statutory auditor.\nThe AO has rejected the books of accounts having observed that the form of reporting\nof the advertisement revenues in the profit and loss account is not proper. There has\nbeen no finding of the AO that books of accounts were unreliable or that entire revenue\nwas not credited in the books of accounts and it was not possible to compute the actual\nprofit on the basis of the books of accounts. The learned Counsel for the assessee further\ninvited our attention that after rejecting the books of accounts, the AO recasted the profit\nand loss account without making any change in the revenue.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_518\">      The learned Standing Counsel for the Revenue has placed a reliance upon the\norder of the CIT(A).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_519\">176. Having carefully examined the orders of lower authorities on this issue, we find\nthat AO has not pointed out the specific defect in maintenance of books of accounts.\nMoreover, after recasting the profit and loss account, there was no change in the profit\noriginally reported by the assessee in its financial statements. It is also noticed that\nassessee has been following the same method of accounting in earlier years but it was\nnever rejected by the AO. We also find force in the contention of the learned Counsel\nfor the assessee that the lower authorities have not identified the accounting standards\nthat has to be followed by the assessees. In the light of these facts, we are of the\nconsidered opinion that rejection of the books of accounts by the AO is not proper. We\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">                                      Page 226 of 331</span>\n\ntherefore set aside his order and direct the AO to accept the books of accounts prepared\nby the assessee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_520\">177. So far as the disallowance on payments made by the assessee to GIL on account\nof business profit under <a href=\"/doc/1918609/\" id=\"a_390\">section 40(a)(ia)</a> on non-deduction of TDS is concerned, we find\nthat during the impugned assessment year i.e., 2008-09, the Tribunal has adjudicated the\nissue of the characterization of payments made by the appellant and held it to be\npayment of royalty. Though the Hon&#x27;ble High Court directed the Tribunal to adjudicate\nthe issue of characterization of the payments made by GIPL the appellant, to GIL, in\nother appeals of different assessement years, but in the impugned assessment year i.e.,\n2008-09 the Tribunal has taken a particular view with regard to characterization of\npayment under the AdWord Distribution Agreement, we cannot ignore these facts.\nMoreover, in foregoing appeals, we have re-examined the issue of characterization of\nsuch payment to GIL and held it to be royalty. The claim of bonafide for non-deduction\nof TDS on such pyment has already been examined by us in the foregoing paras while\nadjudicating an issue as to wheather the asseessee is to be held in default on non\ndeduction of TDS and we did not find any merit in the contention of the appellant that\nunder a bonafide belief it did not deduct the TDS on such payment. Therefore, we do\nnot find any justification to readjudicate the same issue again in this appeal. Hence, we\ndo not any infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) and we accordingly confirm the same.\nAccordingly ground Nos. 5 to 16 in the assessee&#x27;s appeal and ground\nNos. 5 to 13 in the Revenue&#x27;s appeal are disposed off.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_521\">178.

The additional grounds raised\nare extracted as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_299\">     1. The assessee is appointed as non-exclusive authorised distributor of adword\n       program to the advertisers in India by Google Ireland. Under the Google Adword\n       Program Distribution Agreement dated 12/12/2005, the assessee has been granted\n       marketing and distribution rights of adword program to the advertisers in India.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_524\">       Clause 3.4 of the distribution agreement provides for minimum level of service as\n       specified in Exhibit - C. Exhibit -C to the adword agreement refers to service level\n       agreement and imposes responsibility for providing services to the customers\n       (advertisers). All advertisers are instructed to contact the assessee directly for\n       support. In view of the specific obligation to provide presale and Post sale support\n       by the assessee to the advertisers, the assessee is providing the same as per\n       service agreement dated 1/4/2004.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_525\">                                              IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                               IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                    IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                             IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                                         Page 228 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_526\">     2.

The assessee in the written submissions has accepted that it is providing services\n        through ITES division in connection with the distribution of advertisement by way of\n        review with respect to the compliance of the local laws. It is further admitted that the\n        assessee performs ad review services under ITES agreement with Google Ireland for\n        which assessee is separately compensated. It is the specific contention of the revenue\n        that this amount received by the assessee from Google Ireland for rendering services\n        the in India to the advertisers is claimed as export under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_395\">section 10A</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_528\">     2.

As held by the Apex Court, additional ground which is question of law can be raised\n       and entertained at any stage. The application of <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_397\">section 10A</a> of the Act without there\n       being any export of article or thing or computer software is question of law.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_530\">180. In support of request for admission of the additional grounds, the learned Standing\nCounsel further contended that it was admitted by the assessee that it performs ad review\nservices under ITES division with Google Ireland for which the assessee was separately\ncompensated. Therefore in the light of specific contentions that the amount received by\nthe assessee from Google Ireland for rendering services in India to the advertisers cannot\nbe claimed as exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_398\">section 10A</a> of the Act. Since this aspect was not\nexamined by the AO, the additional grounds now may be admitted and matter be restored\nto the AO for its adjudication in accordance with law.             The learned Counsel for the\nassessee strongly objected the application for the admission of the additional grounds\nwith the submissions that this ground was never raised either before the CIT(A) or before\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                                       Page 229 of 331</span>\n\nthe Tribunal at the time of filing of the appeal. Moreover, this ground was also not raised\nbefore the Tribunal at the time of hearing of the appeal by different bench. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"125770855\" id=\"span_291\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91542\" id=\"span_292\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1617513\" id=\"span_293\">Now this\nground has been raised at the advanced stage of the hearing of the appeal. The learned\nCounsel Mr. Percy Pardiwala further contended that AO has not raised the dispute in\nthis regard during the course of assessment proceedings. Therefore, these grounds\ncannot be raised at this stage. He further placed reliance upon the judgments in the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/1617513/\" id=\"a_399\">Hukumchand Mills Ltd., Vs.

ACIT</a> 62 taxmann.com\n239 (Karnataka High Court) in support of his contention that Tribunal has no power to\nenhance the income of the assessee. If the additional grounds are admitted and matter is\nrestored to the AO, the AO will recompute the deduction under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_402\">section 10A</a> resulting\ninto enhancement of the Income. Therefore, the additional grounds cannot be admitted.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_531\">181. Having carefully examined the order of authorities below in this regard, we find\nthat AO has accepted the claim of deduction under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_403\">section 10A</a> of the Act and he has\nnot raised any dispute with regard to amount received by the assessee from Google\nIreland for rendering services in India to the advertisers which was claimed as export\nproceeds under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_404\">section 10A</a> of the Act. It is also a settled position of law that at the\nsecond appellate stage, the Revenue cannot improve upon the case made out by the AO.\nThere are various provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_405\">Income Tax Act</a> where the Revenue can rectify\nits mistakes but before the Tribunal no additional grounds can be raised which was not\na subject matter of appeal or dispute before the lower authorities. The Tribunal, being a\nsecond appellate authority, is supposed to adjudicate those issues which were raised\nbefore it and also was of subject matter of dispute before the lower authorities. The\nRevenue cannot improve upon its case. Therefore, we are of the view that additional\ngrounds raised by the Revenue are not admissible and we accordingly reject the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_532\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">                                       Page 230 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_533\">182.

With regard to validity of the reopening of the assessment, the learned Counsel\n\nfor the assessee has contended that AO has initiated the proceedings for the assessment\n\nyear 2007-08 under <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_431\">section 147</a> of the Income Tax Act (hereinafter called as an &quot;Act&quot;),\n\nand issued a notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_432\">section 148</a> dated 29.03.2014. In compliance thereof, the\n\nappellant, Google Ireland Ltd., furnished the return of income and objected the reasons\n\nfurnished by the AO. Although appellant was not served with the notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_433\">section\n\n143(2)</a> of the Act, but the objection in this regard has been raised before the AO and\n\nthereafter transfer pricing proceedings was initiated by the TPO. The learned Counsel\n\nfor the assessee has further submitted that the reassessment proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_434\">section\n\n147</a> was initiated by the AO without having any jurisdiction. The learned Counsel for\n\nthe assesse further contended that as per judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1801435/\" id=\"a_435\">GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. Vs. ITO</a> 259 ITR 19 the AO has to dispose off\n\nthe objections filed against the reasons for reopening the assessment by passing a\n\nspeaking order before proceeding with the assessment. It was further contended that\n\nbefore disposing of the objections filed by the assessee, the AO cannot proceed with the\n\nassessment. Therefore notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_436\">section 143(2)</a> cannot be issued before disposing of\n\nthe objections against the reasons for reopening filed by the assessee. In the present\n\ncase, notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_437\">section 143(2)</a> is stated to have been issued prior to providing the\n\nreasons for reassessment and for this reason alone the reassessment proceeding should\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">                                      Page 240 of 331</span>\n\nbe held invalid. The learned Counsel for the assessee further contended that notice under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_438\">section 143(2)</a> was issued on 16.02.2016 along with notice under <a href=\"/doc/1650322/\" id=\"a_439\">section 142(1)</a> of the\n\nAct. Thus the notice is time barred as it was issued beyond the prescribed period.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_583\">Therefore, assessment framed consequent thereto deserves to be quashed. It was further\n\ncontended that while exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_440\">section 147</a> of the Act, the AO should\n\nhave reason to believe that income has escaped assessment and secondly appropriate\n\nsanction in terms of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_441\">section 151of</a> the Act must be obtained. It was further contended\n\nthat the notice was issued by ACIT without having a proper approval from the JCIT.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_584\">Therefore, the assumption of jurisdiction is not proper.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_585\">187. The learned Standing Counsel, on the other hand, has contended that the assessee,\n\nGoogle Ireland is a non-resident and has not filed any return of income in India. The\n\nAO on the basis of the assessment framed in the case of the payer i.e., GIPL, formed a\n\nbelief that income chargeable to tax in the hands of the appellant has escaped\n\nassessment.The learned Standing Counsel further contended that AO is not required to\n\nwait for filing of the objections against the reasons recorded for reopening of the\n\nassessment, for issuing a notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_442\">section 143(2)</a> of the Act. Once the returns are\n\nfiled in response to notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_443\">section 148</a> of the Act, the AO is at liberty to issue a\n\nnotice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_444\">section 143(2)</a> of the Act within the prescribed period. The learned\n\nStanding Counsel further contended that due approval was obtained by the JCIT and the\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                                       Page 241 of 331</span>\n\ncopy of the approval is also placed on record by the learned Standing Counsel. He has\n\nalso invited our attention to the order sheets with the submission that assessee has filed\n\nthe return of income on 20.08.2014 in response to notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_445\">section 148</a> of the Act\n\nand on the same day the AO issued a notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_446\">section 143(2)</a> of the Act. In support\n\nof his contention he has filed the copy of the order sheets. The learned Standing Counsel\n\nfor the Revenue further contended that order sheet recorded by the AO in the course of\n\ndischarge of official duty is presumed to be correct unless contrary is proved. In the\n\norder sheet, it is clearly mentioned that notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_447\">section 143(2)</a> was issued on\n\n28.08.2014, therefore contention of the assessee cannot be accepted that notice was not\n\nissued in time. The learned Standing Counsel has placed the reliance on the judgment of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of Rajesh Javeri Stock Broker 291 ITR 500 in support of his\n\ncontention that the prima facie belief is required to be formed by the AO to reopen the\n\nassessment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_586\">188. Having carefully examined the orders of authorities below, in the light of rival\n\nsubmission in this regard, we find that the assessee has disputed the reopening of the\n\nassessment mainly on two aspects, one is that the AO has reopened the assessment\n\nwithout forming a belief that income chargeable to tax has escaped the assessment and\n\nsecondly the notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_448\">section 143(2)</a> was not issued within the prescribed period.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_587\">                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">                                       Page 242 of 331</span>\n\nBefore proceeding to deal with the issues on merit, we want to record certain facts\n\nhereunder:\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_588\">189. Notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_449\">section 148</a> was issued on 16.04.2014 according to the assessee. The\n\nassessee has filed the return of income on 14.08.2014 in response to notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_450\">section\n\n148</a> of the Act. On 20.08.2014, the AO has taken a note that assessee has filed the return\n\nof income in response to notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_451\">section 148</a> of the Act and the case was selected\n\nfor scrutiny.He accordingly issued notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_452\">section 143(2)</a> of the Act. Thereafter\n\nthe proceedings were commenced on 24.07.2015 and reasons for reopening the\n\nassessment was communicated to the assessee on 24.07.2015 and on 16.09.2015,\n\nassessee filed the objections. The objections filed by the assessee were disposed off by\n\nthe AO and thereafter again a notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_453\">section 143(2)</a> was issued to the assessee\n\nalong with questionnaire under <a href=\"/doc/1650322/\" id=\"a_454\">section 142(1)</a> of the Act. While issuing second time\n\nnotice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_455\">section 143(2)</a>, the AO has categorically recorded in the order sheet that\n\nfresh notice under <a href=\"/doc/511102/\" id=\"a_456\">section 142</a> is issued to the assessee; meaning thereby that earlier\n\nnotice was also issued on 28.08.2004. Nothing has been placed on record on behalf of\n\nthe assessee to dispute the minutes of the proceedings recorded by the AO during the\n\ncourse of assessment except the oral contentions. Copy of the proceedings recordedby\n\nthe AO are placed on record. We, therefore, find no merit in the oral submissions with\n\nregard to the non-issuance of the notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_457\">section 143(2)</a> within the prescribed period\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                                       Page 243 of 331</span>\n\nas it is a settled position of law that the minutes or the order sheet recorded in discharge\n\nof official duty are correct unless and until contrary is proved in view of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_458\">section 114</a> of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Therefore, we are of the view that notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_459\">section\n\n143(2)</a> was issued in time. Moreover, we do not find any procedure either in the Act or\n\nin Income Tax Rules wherein it has been laid down that after issuance of notice under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_460\">section 148</a>, the returns are to be filed and thereafter assessee has to seek the reasons\n\nrecorded for reopening of the assessment and thereafter file the objection thereto. After\n\ndisposal of the objections the AO can only issue the notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_461\">section 143(2)</a> of the\n\nAct. For completing the assessment under <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_462\">section 147</a> of the Act, the procedure laid\n\ndown under <a href=\"/doc/164072874/\" id=\"a_463\">section 143</a> of the Act is to be followed. Nowhere it has been mentioned\n\neither under <a href=\"/doc/164072874/\" id=\"a_464\">section 143</a> or under <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_465\">section 147</a> of the Act that the notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_466\">section\n\n143(2)</a> cannot be issued before disposing of the objections filed by the assessee against\n\nthe reasons recorded for reopening the assessment. Accordingly, we find no merit in the\n\ncontention of the assessee that the notice under <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_467\">section 143(2)</a> is bad in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_589\">With regard to other arguments of the asseessee that AO has not formed a proper belief\n\nthat income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment, we find that the asseessee has not\n\nfiled any return of income and in the hands of payer, the AO treated the payments made\n\nto the payee ie. the asseessee to be royality though the payer claimed it to be business\n\nprofit in the hands of the asseessee. In view of the judgement of the Apex court in the\n                                           IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                            IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                 IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                          IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_314\">                                      Page 244 of 331</span>\n\ncase of Rajesh Javeri Stock Brokers(Pvt) Ltd (supra) the AO is required to form a prima\n\nfacie belief that income chargeable to tax has escaped asseesseement and not to make\n\nout a full proof case. From a carefull reading of the reasons recorded for reopening the\n\nasseesseement we are of the view that the AO has formed a primafacie belief that income\n\nchargeable to tax has escaped asseesseement. and we therefore hold that reopening is\n\nvalid.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_590\">190. So far as assessment on merit is concerned, we find that Revenue has assessed the\n\nappellant on business profit received by it after treating the GIPL as its Permanent\n\nEstablishment in India. The issue of characterization of the payment made by the GIPL\n\nto GIL has already been adjudicated by us in the appeals filed by GIPL and we have\n\ntaken a view that the payments made by GIPL to GIL under the Google AdWord\n\nDistribution Agreement is payment of royalty, therefore the receipts in the hands of GIL\n\ncannot be treated to be business profit in the hands of the GIL. The GIL and GIPL were\n\ndealing on principal to principal basis. Therefore, GIPL cannot be called to be the\n\nPermanent Establishment of the GIL. In the light of these facts, we are of the view that\n\nRevenue has wrongly assessed the GIL for business profit received by it under AdWord\n\nDistribution Agreement. Moreover, during the course of hearing, the learned Standing\n\nCounsel has candidly admitted that now the Revenue&#x27;s stand is very clear that the\n\npayment made by the GIPL to GIL is in the nature of royalty and not the business profit\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_315\">                                       Page 245 of 331</span>\n\nreceived by the GIL. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that assessment of\n\nbusiness profit in the hands of GIL after treating the GIPL as Permanent Establishment\n\nof the GIL is not proper. Even if the royalty is to be paid by the GIPL to GIL the tax is\n\nto deducted on its payment and benefit of the same will be given to GIL while completing\n\nthe assessment in its hands. Therefore, we set aside the order of CIT(A) and restore the\n\nmatter to the AO with a direction to reframe the assessment in the light of the\n\nobservations of the Tribunal in the foregoing paras and also in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_591\">Accordingly, this appeal is partly allowed for statistical purposes.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_592\">191.

Google Inc is the\n       legal owner of AdWords Software product, Brand Names, and all other related\n       Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). Google Inc. has given rights to use intangible\n       assets to Google Ireland Holdings which is an Ireland based subsidiary of Google\n       Inc. Google Ireland Holdings in turn has by license agreement given rights to use\n       the same intangible assets to Google Netherlands Holdings BV; a Netherlands based\n       subsidiary. Google Netherlands Holdings pays royalty to Google Ireland Holdings\n       for the same. Google Netherlands Holdings again in turn by license agreement has\n       given the rights to use these intangible assets to Google Ireland Limited; an Ireland\n       based subsidiary. Google Ireland Limited pays royalty to Google Netherlands\n       Holdings BV. Google Ireland Limited has entered into an agreement with Google\n       India Limited on December 12, 2005 for distribution of AdWords program. In the TP\n       Report the assessee has mentioned on page 13 that as per the agreement Google\n       India has to market and distribute Ad Words Program to advertisers in the\n       designated Territory, within the broad guidelines provided by Google Ireland\n       Limited. It is mentioned on page 14 of the TP Report that Ad Words is an automated\n       system under which advertisers purchase enhanced visibility in the Google website\n       and manage their own accounts. Advertisers independently develop a set of\n       Keywords that are related to their business and bid on a <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_488\">CPC</a> basis. Advertisers\n       submit bids for the dollar amount they are willing to pay to display their\n       advertisement when those key words are queried by an internet user.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_605\">195.     The AO observed that in the TP study made by the assessee-company, an attempt\nhas been made to show that it is only a low-end service provider and it had been suitably\ncompensated by its AE. But the TPO had contradicted this characterisation and observed\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_324\">                                         Page 254 of 331</span>\n\nthat the assessee should have furnished the FAR analysis of each service rendered to its\nAE, instead of FAR analysis of the whole group and observed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_315\">     &quot;3.0 TPO&#x27;s finding: In depth study of transfer Pricing Study submitted by the\n     assessee, salient features of which have been mentioned above, has convinced the\n     undersigned that in the TP Study the attempt has been made to declare Google India\n     as low end service provider and that it has been suitably compensated by the\n     Associated Enterprises (AEs). But the facts brought on record in the TP study do not\n     support this conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion that Google India is a low end\n     service provider is in utter contradiction to what I have gathered on analysis of facts\n     given in the TP Study. In this connection, please refer to the 3CEB Report dated 30th\n     September 2009, which the assessee has filed in the Office of Additional\n     Commissioner of Income Tax 30&#x27; September2009. In the report, I find that in respect\n     to each international transaction name and address of associated enterprise with\n     whom the international transaction has been entered into has been mentioned. The\n     assessee has rendered to or taken from specific associated enterprise the specific\n     service. Accordingly, as mentioned in the 3CEB report, Information Technology\n     Services have been rendered by the assessee to Google Inc USA and the assessee\n     has determined arm&#x27;s length price (in short ALP) of the services at Rs 2,483,571,117.\n     Likewise, Information Technology Services have been rendered by the assessee to\n     Google Ireland Limited and ALP of the services has been determined at Rs\n     2,892,019,907. Payment of fees for distribution rights have been made by the\n     assessee to Google Ireland Limited and the ALP has been determined by the\n     assessee at Rs 1,681,852,823. This being the factual position in respect to services\n     rendered or taken by the assessee, the assessee should have furnished for each\n     service the FAR analysis of the assessee and the Associated Enterprise concerned\n     to whom the services have been rendered. As against it, in the TP Study FAR\n     analysis has been given of assessee on one hand and the &#x27;whole group&#x27; on the\n     other hand. FAR analysis furnished by the assessee in the TP study, therefore, is\n     not considered proper. How can the functions performed, assets used and the risks\n     incurred by the whole group can be taken in to consideration with the functions\n     performed, assets used and the risks incurred by the assessee in respect to specific\n     international transactions undertaken by the assessee with specific Associated\n     Enterprise. To be precise Google India has under taken the international\n     transactions of rendering IT and ITES with Google Inc USA and Google Ireland\n     Limited respectively, then the FAR analysis should be made of Google India and\n     Google Inc for IT services, and Google India and Google Ireland Limited for\n     ITES. Similarly in respect to distribution rights in AdWords product the FAR\n     analysis should be between Google India and Google Ireland Limited. If in FAR\n     analysis of Google India on one hand and the whole group on the other hand is\n                                       IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                        IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                      IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">                                  Page 255 of 331</span>\n\nmade, Google India will always be found inferior in terms of functions performed,\nassets used and the risks incurred, as one enterprise or the other in the whole\ngroup would be performing one function or the other, using asset and incurring\ndifferent risks and thus in unison group companies as a whole would be presenting\nvery impressive picture as compared to Google India. On page 48 of TP study in\nrespect to Marketing &amp; Distribution of AdWords Program while comparative\nstudy of functions, in respect to &#x27;Product Intangible&#x27; it has been mentioned that\nfunctions related to Development of research Program, Conduct of research,\nConduct of research for improving the existing products, testing of products, and\ndevelopment of product have been performed by AE and Google India has not\nperformed these functions. It is wrong analysis. Ad Words product related rights\nhave been given to Google India by Google Ireland Limited. Google Ireland is\nnot the legal owner of AdWords Software Product. All IP rights in it belong to\nGoogle Inc.USA. Google Ireland Limited, as discussed in para 2.2 through an\narrangement which involves four layers of license agreements amongst group\ncompanies, has given distribution rights in the Ad Words Software related\ndistribution rights to Google India. These four layers at the expense of\nrepetition are shown below-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_316\">         Therefore, in this relationship Google India and Google Ireland\nLimited are relevant and between the two Google India has performed functions\nrelated to intangible product. Rather, Google India has performed significant\nfunctions whereas Google Ireland Limited has not performed any function at\nall in this regard. I find that Google India has performed IT services to\nGoolgeInc USA almost every year. Position of IT services rendered by Google\nIndia to Google Inc USA in this year and in two preceding years is as follows-\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_7\">         Financial IT         services IT services Amount\n         Year      rendered by         rendered to\n          2006-07 Google India         Google Inc 1,181,826,53\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">                                       USA          9</span>\n         2007-08 Google India          Google Inc 1,981,054,354\n                                       USA\n          2008-09 Google India         Google Inc   2,483,571,117\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_317\">Likewise Business strategy and conceptualization function has not been performed\nby Google Ireland Limited. Some group company must have performed this\nfunction but in respect to relevant international transactions in this case Google\nIndia and Google Ireland Limited are relevant Companies and their functions\nshould be performed. Therefore, it cannot be said that Google Ireland Limited has\nperformed this function and Google India has not performed this function. Market\n                                              IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                               IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                    IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                             IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">                                         Page 256 of 331</span>\n\n       Research activity Google India has performed but nothing can be said about\n       Google Ireland Limited as in the study on page 48 comparisons has been made\n       with the `Whole Group&#x27; which vitiates the comparison and makes it unreliable.\n       Likewise Development of Global Marketing Strategy cannot be considered on the\n       basis of TP Study as the function of Google Ireland Limited as the study is not\n       reliable due to comparison with the whole group and not with Google India Limited\n       alone. In respect to assets, once again intangible assets on page 51 of TP study\n       have been shown as belonging to AE. But in this connection I repeat that\n       Intangibles are legally owned by Google Inc USA, whereas in respect to\n       transactions related to distribution of AdWords Program only Goolge Ireland\n       Limited is relevant and I find that these assets do not belong to Ireland Google\n       Limited. Service level Quality risk mentioned on page 52 may be incurred by either\n       the Google India which is providing services to the customers and who has direct\n       interaction with the customers or by Google Inc USA which legally owns the\n       intangible assets. As google Ireland Limited has taken the rights to distribute the\n       software based services under licensed agreement from Google Netherlands\n       HoldingsBV the risk is incurred by Google India and not by Google Ireland\n       Limited because Google Ireland Limited will shift the risk to Google Netherlands\n       Holdings BV. Likewise, ultimate deliverable quality risk lies with Google Inc USA\n       and not with Google Ireland Limited. I also hold that Software Technology risk is\n       not incurred by Google Ireland Limited as software product is legally owned by\n       Google Inc; USA. On the basis of FAR analysis dissected by me, I find that\n       characterization of Google India as a low risk service provider , who assumes very\n       less risk, performs very limited functions and does not own any capital asset or\n       valuable intangible assets as concluded on page 53 in TP study is wrong\n       conclusion and cannot be relied upon. Rather when I compare Google India with\n       Google Ireland Limited I find in terms of functions performed, assets used and\n       risks assumed, Google India is a far more active participant compared to Google\n       Ireland Limited and therefore cannot be called as low end and low risk service\n       provider.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_606\">196.      The TPO, after perusal of the agreement of Google AdWords programme\ndt.12.12.2005 entered into by the assessee-company and Google Ireland, had concluded\nthat the assessee-company is not marketing/distribution agent for Google Ireland, but\ndoing the business on its own account as it employed all the assets and assumed the risks\nassociated with the business. The TPO further observed that Google Ireland is not a\nlegal owner of AdWords Software programme and the same were acquired by it through\n                                            IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                             IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                  IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                           IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">                                       Page 257 of 331</span>\n\nan arrangement among the group companies and therefore in order to find out the\neconomic substance of the transaction, the TPO also analysed the functions performed\nby different units of the assessee-company and finally concluded that the ITeS business\nis closely connected with the AdWords programme as they are not separable from each\nother. The relevant finding of the TPO as given in para 3.2 of TPO&#x27;s order is reproduced\nherein below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_318\">         &quot;3.2 In para 2.1 above brief description has been made of the kind of\n     work which has been done by different units of Google India. The\n     description is based on the discussion given in the TP study submitted by\n     the assessee. A part of it related to ITES Services and AdWords services\n     are repeated here. STPI Units at Hyderabad and Gurgaon also perform\n     (apart from IT Services) certain IT enabled services, which involve approving\n     and administering of the advertisement. Hyderabad and Gurgaon Units are\n     involved in performing back office functions for the Adwords Business such\n     as approval of advertisements for the purpose of running the same on the\n     google website. On page 13 it is mentioned that Google India has entered into\n     an agreement with Google Ireland Ltd, Ireland for distribution of Adwords\n     Program with its reasonable commercial expertise, own sales force and\n     customer service infrastructure. The Delhi and Mumbai offices consist of\n     direct sales teams (approximately 250 people in totality) which approach\n     corporate and midsized advertisers in order to sell as apace for the Ad Words\n     business. Therefore, ITES and AdWords business are not separable from each\n     other. Further, in so far Intangibles are concerned it is not the use of\n     AdWords Software Program that has contributed in earning of supernormal\n     profit but also it is assessee&#x27;s ITES efforts, dedicated sales team of 250 people\n     in Delhi and Mumbai Offices, commercial expertise of employees of Google\n     India, Customer service infrastructure established by Google India and the\n     customer base which have committed to use Google Software to give their\n     advertisements that has made equally salutary contribution in earning super\n     profit. Google India&#x27;s STPI Units at Bangalore and Hyderabad act as R&amp;D\n     Centers wherein certain Information Technology Services are performed. In\n     Bangalore contracted R&amp;D services in the nature of Google&#x27;s Product\n     development, product upgrades, product support, testing of products and\n     product improvement are performed. In Bangalore Unit search results\n     appearing on Google&#x27;s website are reviewed; it enables Google to improve\n                                             IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                              IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                            IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">                                        Page 258 of 331</span>\n\n       the quality of search results for end users across the world. (Please refer to\n       search quality evaluation on page 11&amp;12). Hyderabad facility also performs\n       certain software development tasks in relations development of web-based\n       language translator. Evaluation of Google Services and tools for efficiency,\n       bugs, performance, failure and other aspects is also done in Bangalore. The\n       Software is tested by the Hyderabad unit of Google India before it is ready\n       for release. (please refer to QA Engineering on page 12). These IT services\n       rendered by Google India to Google Inc. USA have also its bearing on\n       total revenue earned by Google India. These Services cannot be called as\n       low end routine services. These services do contribute towards the success\n       of AdWords Software Program, which is legally owned by Google Inc\n       USA. Therefore, in AdWords Marketing and distribution business the\n       contribution of Google India is not routine or low end. Google India has\n       apart from rendering IT and ITES Services to Google Inc USA and Google\n       Ireland Limited respectively has contributed Intangible assets in earning\n       super profits in Adwords Business. Therefore, I find the Cost Plus Mark\n       up method used to evaluate the IT, ITES and AdWords Business efforts of\n       Google India is absolutely improper. It is not considered as acceptable.\n       This method ignores the extraordinary contribution made by Google India\n       in providing IT, ITES Services, doing Marketing and distribution business\n       and contributing Intangible assets to earn super profit. Therefore, I\n       propose to also determine the Arm&#x27;s Length Price of Intangible Assets\n       contributed by Google India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_607\">197.     Finally the TPO concluded that the entire transactions of the assessee-company\nwith its AEs cannot be considered in isolation since the assessee also contributed towards\nthe development of intangibles, namely, market intangibles to Google Ireland Ltd., and\nTechnology intangibles to Google Inc and gives the possession of this valuable non-\nroutine intangibles. All the transactions are inter-related and inter-linked therefore, the\nTPO proposed to adopt residual profit split method as the most appropriate method.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_608\">198.      In response to the show-cause notice issued by the TPO on the above lines, the\nassessee-company made submissions vide its letter dt.04.12.2012.

Another\nshow-cause notice dt.18.01.2013 was issued directing the assessee-company to furnish\nthe FAR analysis of the company performed by the assessee in respect of international\ntransactions disclosed in form 3 CEB report. On account of failure of the assessee-\ncompany to furnish the FAR analysis of the functions performed by the assessee-\ncompany in respect of international transactions with the AE, the TPO proposed to reject\nthe TP study submitted by the assessee-company. The TPO also proposed to apply the\nresidual profit split method, as the transactions between the Google India and Google\nIreland cannot be considered in isolation because it deployed all routine valuable\nintangibles i.e. marketing intangibles by Google India and Technology Intangible by\nGoogle Ireland Ltd., In TPO&#x27;s view, because of presence of this valuable non-routine\nintangibles and transactions being inter-related and inter-linked, had proceeded to apply\nresidual profit-split method after referring to the Guidelines of OECD on this method.\nAccordingly the TPO had proceeded to arrive at arm&#x27;s length price based on the residual\nprofit split method as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">     &quot;6.2 Profit Split Method\n         6.2.1 the OECD Guidelines provide ,for two different profit .split methods\n     to determine taxable income associated with intercompany transactions: the\n     &#x27;comparable&#x27; profit split method and the &#x27;residual&#x27; profit split method.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">               Under the comparable profit split method the split used in comparable\n     uncontrolled transaction is applied to the controlled transactions. The\n     comparable profit split compares the division of operating profit among the\n     controlled taxpayers to the division of operating profit among the uncontrolled\n     taxpayers engaged in similar activities under similar circumstances. Because of\n     the difficulty I obtaining the uncontrolled profit split information, including the\n     iulbrmation needed for consisting accounting treatment, it as likely that the\n     comparable profit split method will seldom be a viable approach.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_321\">                                         IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                          IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                               IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                        IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_331\">                                    Page 260 of 331</span>\n\n    The residual profit split method allocates operating profit or losses from\ncontrolled transactions in proportion to the relative contributions made by each\nparty in creating the combined profits or losses. Relative contributions may be\ndetermined by functions peiforined, risks assumed, resources employed, costs\nincurred and value drivers contributed to the overall business.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_322\">     According to paragraph 3.5 of the 1995 OECD report, &quot; the profit split\nmethod .first identifies the profit to be split for the associated enterprises from?,\nthe controlled transactions in which the associated enterprises are engaged. It\nthen splits those profits between the associated enterprises on an economically\nvalid basis that approximates the division of profits that would have been\nanticipated and reflected in an agreement made at arm&#x27;s length&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_609\">     The Method is generally used where multiple entities, operating in an integrated\nmanner, contribute to a large extent, to the creation of valuable business drivers that\nadd to future growth prospects of the company as a whole. Applying the profit split\nwould mean splitting any (residual) profit between the entities on all sides of\ntransaction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_610\">     Paragraph 3.5 and 3.7 of the OECD guidelines mention that where transactions\nare very interrelated, it might be that they cannot be evaluated on a separate basis.\nIndependent companies might under similar circumstances, decide to set up a\npartnership&#x27; and agree to a form of profit split. The strength of the profit split\nmethod is that it is less likely that either party to the controlled transaction will be\nleft with an extreme and improbable profit result since all the parties to the\ntransaction are evaluated. This multi-sided approach may also be used to achieve a\ndivision of profits from economies of scale or other joint efficiencies that satisfied\nboth the taxpayer and tax administration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_611\">     Paragraph 3.11 of the OECD guidelines stresses that if the profit split method\nwere to be used by the associated enterprises to establish transfer pricing in controlled\ntransactions, ten each associated enterprise would seek to achieve the division of prof\nthat independently would have expected to realize in a joint relationship. Generally,\nconditions established in this manner would have to be based upon projected profits\nrather• than actual profits, because it is not possible for the taxpayer to know what the\nprofits of the business activity would be at time the conditions are established.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_612\">     6.2.2 in the instant case the international transactions between Google India\nand Google Ireland are the fees paid by Google India for import of distribution\nrights, Information Technology Enabled Services rendered by Google India to\nGoogle Ireland and Provision of sales and marketing services by Google India to\nGoogle Ireland.

Adjustment in respect to international\ntransactions with Google Ireland therefore is proposed for Rs 937,714,990.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_633\">  7.0 The Assessee Company has considered its markup in respect to ITES at arm&#x27;s length on\nthe basis of comparison of its profit margin (operating profit/operating cost) with the profit margin\nof uncontrolled comparables computed using TNMM as the most appropriate method. TPO finds\nthat the identification of uncontrolled comparables&#x27; profit margin is not proper. Therefore, the\nTPO rejects the ALP computed by the Assessee U/s 92 C (3) (c) of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_489\">Income Tax Act</a> 1961 and\nproceeds to compute the PLI of Uncontrolled Comparables identified by me (TPO). The detailed\ndiscussion thereon is given in annexure &#x27;A&#x27; to this show cause. It is computed at 25.04 percent.\nAccordingly, markup on ITES is computed by applying the mark up percentage of 25.04 percent\non cost-base computed by the Assessee at Rs 2,430,651,096\n\n  8.0 theAssessee Company has also entered into international transaction of IT Services. This\ninternational transaction has been entered by the Assessee with Google Inc USA. TheAssessee\nhas considered the markup of 21.25 % on cost base of Rs 2,048,315,417 as at arm&#x27;s length\nbycomparing the same with PLI of Uncontrolled Comparables using TNMM as the most appropriate\nmethod.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_634\">  8.1 In this connection on careful reading of TP Study it emerges that Google India&#x27;s STPI\nUnits at Bangalore and Hyderabad act as R&amp;D Centers wherein certain Information Technology\nServices are performed. In Bangalore contracted R&amp;D services in the nature of Google &#x27;s Product\ndevelopment, product upgrades, product support, testing of products and product improvement\nare performed. In Bangalore Unit search results appearing on Google &#x27;S website are reviewed; it\nenables Google to improve the quality of search results for end users across the world. (Please\nrefer to search quality evaluation on page 11&amp;12). Hyderabad facility also performs\ncertain software development task in relations development of web-based language translator.\nEvaluation of Google Services and tools for efficiency, bugs, performance, failure and other\naspects is also done in Bangalore. The Software is tested by the Hyderabad unit of Google India\nbefore it is ready for release. (please refer to QA Engineering on page 12). Therefore, TPO\nconsiders the IT services rendered by Google India to Google Inc. USA are R&amp;D services.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_635\">8.2 in this connection it is relevant to state that India&#x27;s IT industry can be divided into five main\ncomponents, viz. Software Products, IT services, Engineering and R&amp;D services, ITES/BPO (IT-\nenabled services/Business Process Outsourcing) and Hardware. Export revenues primarily on\nproject based IT Services continue to drive growth with IT Services accounting for 59% of total\n                                                  IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                   IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                        IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                                 IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">                                             Page 267 of 331</span>\n\nrevenues followed by BPO and Engineering services at 22% and Software Products at 19%.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_636\">       Increasing competition, pressure on billing rates and increasing commoditization of lower-\nend ADM services are among the key reasons forcing the Indian software industry to make afast\nmove up the software value chain by providing higher value-added services like consulting,\nproduct development, R&amp;D, mobile, cloud computing and end-to-end turnkey solutions. Thus R&amp;D\nishigher value added service. It cannot be considered as low end service. It is considered as\ncomparable to companies which are engaged in Knowledge Process Outsourcing Services.\nTherefore, the TPO considers that the data used to determine the ALP of IT Services is incorrect\nand not reliable. Therefore, it is rejected U/s 92 C (3)(c) of the Act and substituted by the study\nconducted by the TPO of KPOs. Please see Annexure &#x27;C&#x27; to this show cause. Accordingly the Arm&#x27;s\nLength Margin of the KPO &#x27;s 43.68 % per annexure is applied to the cost base of the Assessee to\ndetermine the Arm.&#x27;s length price of International Transactions, which the Assessee has entered\ninto with Google Inc USA.Accordingly, the Arms length price of the international transaction is as\nfollows-\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_13\">     Particulars                 IT Services to      IT Services to\n                                 Google Inc(as       Google(as per\n                                 per TPO             Assessee)\n     Cost Base (A)                   2,048,315,417           2,048,315,417\n     Markup percentage                     43.63%                   21.25%\n     Amount of Markup                  883,680,016\n     (B)                                                        435,255,700\n     Amount of Markup                2,931,995,433\n     (A+B)                                                     2,483,571,117\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_637\">     8.3 Therefore, the difference between the ALP as per theTPO and the Assessee Company\ncomputed at Rs 448,424,3&#x27;9 is proposed as an adjustment in respect to this transaction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_638\">     9.0 in this case based on the discussion made above following amounts are proposedfor\nadjustment-\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_14\">    Amount ofAdjustment                               AMOUNT (in Rupees\n\n    In respect to international transactions          835,087,934\n    entered into by Google India with Google\n    Ireland on aggregated basis\n\n    In respect to IT Services to Google Inc           448,424,329\n    USA\n\n                         Total                        1,28,512,263\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_639\">                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_339\">                                          Page 268 of 331</span>\n\n9.0 Calculation of arms length price and adjustment has been done on the basis of transaction\ndetails given in 3CEB Report and the TP Study filed by the Assessee Company.

In other words, it may be said that gross revenues, before the fees is\npaidforRs751,364,443, is Rs 4,033,439,503/. This is not the same figure which is given in TP Study\nand the 3CEB Report. Please certify the correct amount of Domestic Advertising Revenue, failing\nwhich amount Rs 3,282,075,060 will be taken intoconsideration.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_640\">In response to above show-cause notice, the assessee-company submitted a reply on\n28.01.2013 on three parts and the TPO&#x27;s observations are as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_327\">&quot;3.3 Assessee in reply dated 28th January also reiterated in most part of it that Assessee has\nperformed all value added services, assumed significant risks and used intangible assets in\nrespect to all the international transactions and Google India has only performed routine\nservices for which it has been suitably remunerated by Google India and Google Inc. I have\nalready discussed this aspect in detail in my both the show Cause reproduced in this order. I\nhave put up my stand on it. I have already discussed in the show cause that in FAR analysis the\ncontribution of Google India cannot be undermined by calling it a routine service. Google India\nhas in respect to all the international transactions rendered more valuable services as well as\ncontributed intangible assets than Google Ireland and Google Inc. In a third part scenario the\npayments which Google India deserve will be equal to what I have proposed in the show-\ncause notice dated 18.01.2013. I continue to reiterate that the Assessee has made efforts to\nshow itself inferior by giving in the FAR analysis the functions risks and the assets of Google\nIndia on one hand and comparing it corresponding functions risks and the assets of any other\ngroup entity belonging to Google group and therefore the analysis was between Google\nIndia on one hand and Go ogle Group on the other and therefore, Google India wasought to\nlook inferior. However, in one to one comparison for FAR analysis with that AE which\nentered into international transaction with Google India then one will find that the\ncontribution of Google India is far more superior as compared to what Google India has been\npained to be.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_328\">3.4 Assessee has submitted that Google India has entered into several agreements with its AEs\nfor rendering services and Google India has performed those services as per the agreements\nandaccordingly remunerated also. Assessee has therefore submits that agreements\ncannot be disregarded and due consideration should be given to such commercial\ntransactions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_329\">I have taken the agreements into consideration. On the basis of services performed by\ntheAssessee as described in the TP Study, which is also the document prepared by the Assessee\nand given to the TPO to understand the role played by related parties in respect to each\ninternational transaction and then decide the ALP of these transactions, I have concluded\n                                              IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                               IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                    IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                             IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_340\">                                         Page 269 of 331</span>\n\nthat being a related party transaction the Assessee is not being remunerated suitably and\ntherefore, in view of mandate conferred on the TPO by the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_490\">Income Tax Act</a> 1961 I have proposed\nto reject the price determined by the Assessee and to substitute the same with a price I have\ndetermined. Therefore, it cannot be described by the Assessee as non-consideration of\nAgreements by the TPO.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_330\">3.5 The Assessee has once again in reply dated 28.01.2013 given details of what the\nAssesseeand its AEs have done. In this connections it will be relevant to state that the TPO has\nalready made detailed study of functions risks and assets of three enterprises given in the TP\nStudy and subsequent replies filed by the Assessee. I find that the Assessee has given vivid\ndescription of everything Google Inc and Google Ireland have done. But in this regards I have\nalready discussed in the show cause that in respect to international transactions at hand\nonly we have to see as what is the contribution of Google India, Google Ireland and\nGoogle Inc. Painting a detailed picture of standalone entities is of not much avail. As against\nit I have made relevant study in terms of FAR of\nGoogle India, Google Ireland and Google Inc focusing on international transactions involved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_331\">3.6 I have discussed at length the contribution of Google India in show case notices and\nestablished that it will be wrong to call Google India a routine service provider. Assessee is\nready todeclare as wrong what it has been stated in the TP study. TPO has on careful study\nmentioned in the show cause that Delhi and Mumbai offices consist of direct sales team\n(approximately 250 people in totality) which approach corporate and mid-sized advertisers\nin order to sell ad space for the Ad Words business. Assessee has submitted in reply dated\n28.01.2013 in para 34 that Assessee hasalready submitted in foregoing paragraphs that size of\nthe employees in Delhi and Mumbai office consists of direct sales team of 25 employees (as\nagainst 250 employees which is advertently mentioned in your self&#x27;s notice. It shows that\nAssessee is not ready to accept even those facts which have been furnished by the Assessee in\nthe TP Study. One can refer to page 13 of the TP study filed by the Assessee. Assessee has very\nclearly given this fact that there are 250 employees in Delhi and Mumbai sales team. Then\nwhy wrong statement by the Assessee in reply dated 28.01.2013? I therefore continue to\nabide with each and every statement I have made in two show reproduce above. Perhaps,\nAssessee is required to read its own TP study carefully as TPO did. On careful study of FAR\ngiven by the Assessee I found that ITeS and Sales and Marketing activities performed by Google\nIndia cannot be viewed separately. They can be evaluated only on aggregate basis. My\nconclusion is based on proper analysis of TP Study. Assessee is finding its own submissions in\nTP Study as inconvenient and therefore making wrong statement in an effort to declare that\nITeS and Ad Words Business are two independent streams and there is no confluence of them\nat any point.That is why Assessee is supply new meaning to certain other terms as Assessee has\ndone in respect to &#x27;non-exclusive&#x27; in para 37 of reply dated 28.01.2013.1 continue to hold\nthat the Assessee has carried on the business of Ad Words as full-fledged business enterprise\nand not on behalf of Google Ireland. I have already made detailed discussion in the show-cause\n                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_341\">                                          Page 270 of 331</span>\n\non it and I donot consider it necessary to repeat the same here.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_332\">  3.7 The Assessee has raised certain objections on use of profit split method also. One such\n      objection is that ITes and AdWords are two separate transactions. But I have already\n      explained in the show- cause that they are intermixed and one is incomplete without the\n      other. They can only be evaluated on an aggregate basis.

The Assessee\nhas also raised the objection that for profit split global profit is an important prerequisite. In\nmy view it is not necessary. Only requirement for this purpose is total profit of contributing\nAEs and in this case they are Google Ireland and Google India. That is why TPO has been\nable to apply profit split method in this case. Assessee has not pointed out any mistake in the\nsame.

Thus, purpose of transfer pricing rules, is to verify whether the\n     prices at which an international transactions has been carried out is comparable with\n     the market value of the underlying asset or commodity or service. It may be true\n     that difficulties might arise in ascertaining the fair market value but such difficulties\n     should not be a reason for not adapting the rules and methods prescribed in t h i s\n     regard.

The three year&#x27;s average OP/TC of the\ncomparable companies was computed at 16.46% as compared to OP/TC of 21.25%\nearned by the assessee-company.

The TPO had rejected the FAR analysis conducted by the assessee-company in\nthe TP study and re-characterised the activities/functions and performance of the\nassessee-company as KPO service instead of IT services. The TPO observed that\nBengaluru and Hyderabad STP units of the assessee-company act as R&amp;D centres, which\nare in the nature of product development, product upgrades, product support, testing of\nproducts and product improvement.

Now before us, it is contended that the assessee-company provides IT services\nwhich involve evaluation of Google products and tools for efficiency, bugs,\nperformance, failures and other aspects, software development tasks in relation to\ndevelopment of web based language translator, etc. The TPO failed to understand that\nthe assessee-company performs IT services in the role of a contract developer wherein\nthe assessee-company is not exposed to any market risk or commercial risk for the\nproduct and accordingly, remunerated as assured return on a cost plus mark-up basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_697\">216. It was further submitted that the functions of KPO fall under category of ITeS. It\nis further submitted that the modules worked upon by the assessee-company form very\ninsignificant part of Google products and major significant functions are done by Google\nIreland, USA for development of end product and there was no-end product developed\nin India and Google patent search engine was developed much before setting up of the\nassessee-company in India. It was further         submitted that in the earlier years i.e.\nassessment years 2005-06 to 2008-09, these activities have been characterised by the\nTribunal as IT services and the same was confirmed by this Tribunal and there was no\nchange in the functional profile of the assessee-company during the previous year\nrelevant to assessment year under consideration from earlier assessment year. Thus it\nwas contended that the TPO was not justified in re-characterising the functions of the\nassessee-company as KPO services. Further, learned AR of the assessee-company also\ndrawn our attention to the definition of the term &#x27;KPO&#x27; and &#x27;software development&#x27; as\ndefined under rule 10T(a)(g) of the Safe Harbour Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_698\">217.

It was further contended that even the profit split method was not\napplied in accordance with the provisions of       10-B(1)(d) of the IT Rules 1962, as the\nTPO had failed to apply the correct contribution made by the AE in earning the revenue,\nin accordance with the FAR analysis of the transaction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_716\">232. It is submitted that the whole basis applying residual profit split method is the\nallegation that the assessee-company has human intangibles and customer-base. While\nmaking such allegation, the lower authorities had completely ignored the fact that the\ntechnology plays a vital role and a value-driver and the technology is owned by Google\nInc and licensed to Google Ireland Ltd.       Learned AR further submitted that without\nprejudice to the argument that the assessee-company had not created any marketing\nintangibles, it is argued that marketing intangibles are not relevant or material in the\nbusiness of AdWords distribution.       It was further contended that, the mandatory\nconditions for application of profit split method, are not satisfied in the present case as\nthere is no transfer of unique intangibles is involved, and multiple international\ntransactions which are so inter-related that they cannot be evaluated separately for the\npurpose of determining the ALP of any one transaction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_717\">233.

It was further submitted that the assessee company had submitted the &#x27;note&#x27;\non the nature of activities carried out by the assessee-company in IT segment under the\nsearch quality evaluation and QA engineering. It is further pointed out that search\nquality evaluation involves review of search results appearing on Google website and\nbased on that review, Google Inc, the assessee company ultimately takes the decision to\nimprove the quality of search results. This review work cannot, by itself, be termed as\nsoftware development services. It is more of an activity of data analytics which fall\nwithin the category of KPO services. As regards the activities under the category of QA\nengineering, the learned CIT(DR) submitted that it involves evaluation of Google tools\nfor efficient bug removal, performance, evaluation and other aspects.

ITeS :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_376\">      The learned CIT(DR) submitted that the services rendered in ITeS were concerned\nwith AdWords Distribution Programme and therefore the activities of ITeS services and\nAdWords Distribution Programme are inter-linked, inter-related and in-separable.\nTherefore, it was argued that the Hon&#x27;ble DRP was not justified in directing the AO/TPO\nto bench mark the activities under the ITeS segment and AdWords Distribution\nProgramme. It was further submitted that there was inconsistency in the approach of\nHon&#x27;ble DRP while directing the TPO to aggregate the international transactions relating\nto the distribution of AdWords programme and ITeS. However, the Hon&#x27;ble DRP took\na contrary stand by holding that ITeS and AdWords segment are to be bench marked\nseparately. In this connection, learned CIT(DR) had invited our attention to clauses 2.3,\n2.5, 2.6 and 3.4 of the Agreement entered into by the assessee-company with Google\nIreland in respect of AdWords Distribution Programme, dt.12.12.2005 to demonstrate\nthat the activities of ITES are closely inter-linked with the activity of AdWords\nDistribution Programme. It is submitted that the assessee-company set up STP units at\nGurgaon and Hyderabad which involved services like administration, advertisement and\nother back-office functions such as after sales support for AdWords business. The ITeS\nperformed at STPI units at Bengaluru and Hyderabad added value addition to Google\nInc. Through its operations the assessee company had contributed intangible assets of\ncustomer base, marketing team to Google Inc and Google Ireland. Google Ireland has\nonly contributed to AdWords business is not correct. It has generated intangibles i.e.,\nAdWords programme, which was in fact, not owned by it, but was only a sub-licensee.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_721\">Based on this analysis of functions performed by the assessee-company the TPO had\narrived at the conclusion that the assessee-company was not compensated adequately for\nits contribution to marketing intangibles.

It was further submitted by the learned CIT(DR) that the Hon&#x27;ble DRP also has\nconfirmed this method. However, the Hon&#x27;ble DRP directed the TPO to apply the profit\nsplit method of residual profit split method. He argued that having regard to the FAR\nanalysis all the functions performed by the assessee, it is clear that the assessee company\nalso contributed towards the advertisement of marketing intangibles which, in turn,\ncontributed to the development of AdWords business profits and the methodology\nadopted to compensate the assessee company on cost-plus basis, is not proper. In such\ncircumstances, profit split method is the most appropriate method for determining the\nALP of the distribution fees. He further submitted that the profit split method is one of\nthe recognised methods for determination of ALP where the assessee generates revenue\nout of the operations that are highly integrated and where there is a transfer of technology\nintangibles. Reliance was also placed on the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/194564509/\" id=\"a_517\">Global One India P. Ltd v. ACIT</a> (44 taxmann.com 100).

Only in those cases the transactions are aggregated.\nTherefore, the TPO was justified in rejecting the TP study submitted by the assessee-\ncompany. However, from perusal of TPO order it is clear that the TPO made TP analysis\nwithout referring to any evidence or actual conduct of the parties. Thus, in our\nconsidered opinion neither the assessee-company nor the TPO had approached the issue\nin proper perspective and therefore in the absence of proper TP analysis in proper\nperspective, the comparability of international transaction cannot be judged. Therefore,\nin fitness of things, we remand the entire TP issues to the file of the TPO/AO for\nundertaking the exercise of TP analysis afresh after affording opportunity to the\nassessee-company to furnish TP study report covering the entire functions performed,\nassets employed and risks undertaken transaction-wise in respect of international\ntransaction with AE.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_724\">238.

It is pertinent to state that the AO/TPO\nshall have regard to the guidelines issued by the CBDT vide circular No.6 of 2013 dated\n29th June 2013 in deciding the functional profile of the assessee-company. In respect of\ntransactions independent of AdWords distribution programme, the characterisation of\nthe functions performed shall be based on the actual conduct of the parties and actual\nactivities performed. The comparability of all these independent transactions shall be\njudged with reference to uncontrolled similar transaction by adopting most appropriate\nmethod and comparability factors. In respect of transactions aggregated with AdWords\nbusiness transaction, the TPO shall bench-mark the transaction by adopting Profit Split\nMethod as most appropriate method, as the transaction of business of AdWords\nprogramme requires deployment of assets and functions of different entities located in\ndifferent geographical locations in order to ultimately deliver services as the combined\neffort generate revenues. It is also settled proposition of law that Profit Slip Method\n(PSM) can be adopted as most appropriate method in cases involving multiple inter-\nrelated international transactions which cannot be evaluated separately.

The similar nature of controversy, akin this case, arose before the\n    Karnataka High Court in <a href=\"/doc/26146277/\" id=\"a_559\">CIT v. Tata Elxsi Ltd.</a> [2012] 204 Taxman 321/17.\n    The issue before the Karnataka High Court was whether the Tribunal was\n    correct in holding that while computing relief under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_560\">Section10A</a> of the IT Act,\n    the amount of communication expenses should be excluded from the total\n    turnover if the same are reduced from the export turnover? While giving the\n    answer to the issue, the High Court, inter-alia, held that when a particular\n    word is not defined by the legislature and an ordinary meaning is to be\n    attributed to it, the said ordinary meaning is to be in conformity with the\n    context in which it is used. Hence, what is excluded from &#x27;export turnover&#x27;\n    must also be excluded from &#x27;total turnover&#x27;, since one of the components of\n    &#x27;total turnover&#x27; is export turnover. Any other interpretation would run counter\n    to the legislative intent and would be impermissible.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_387\">    18. Accordingly, the formula for computation of the deduction under <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_561\">Section\n    10A</a> of the Act would be as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_388\">                             Export turnover as defined in Explanation 2 (IV) of\nExport Profit = total        <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_562\">Section 10A</a> of IT Act\n                           ×\nProfit of the Business        Export turnover as defined in Explanation 2(IV) of\n                              <a href=\"/doc/1904729/\" id=\"a_563\">Section 10A</a> of the IT Act + domestic sale proceeds\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_389\">    19.

Even in common parlance, when the object of the formula is to arrive at\n    the profit from export business, expenses excluded from export turnover have\n    to be excluded from total turnover also. Otherwise, any other interpretation\n    makes the formula unworkable and absurd. Hence, we are satisfied that such\n    deduction shall be allowed from the total turnover in same proportion as well.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_775\">                                               IT(IT)ANos.1190, 1295/Bang/2014, 2845, 949, 950/Bang/2017,\n                                                IT(TP)A Nos.374, 466/Bang/2013, 68, 205, 1299/Bang/2015,\n                                                     IT(TP)A Nos. 69, 191/Bang/2014, 559, 881/Bang/2016,\n                                                                              IT(TP)A No.387/Bang/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_394\">                                          Page 305 of 331</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_776\">      21.
