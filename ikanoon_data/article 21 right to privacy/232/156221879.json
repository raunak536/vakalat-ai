The pith of the ratio in these judgements primarily emphasizes that\n\n      the decision to history-sheet a convict or a suspect should not be arbitrarily resorted to. The\n\n      principles they have laid down are informative study material for guiding and educating the\n\n      police in their approach to history-sheeting. Contextually, are not the pronouncements of\n\n      this Court adequate enough to sensitize the police officials on the manner of exercise of their\n\n      power to history-sheet an individual? The experience however, has been disappointing, as\n\n      the attitude of the police official to history-sheeting is seen varying from plain ignorance to\n\n      abject indifference in following the principles laid down.\n\n\n\n      1.2 Litigation-avoidance is critical for eliminating the clogs that chokes the Court system,\n\n      and its thematic significance and contemporary relevance to our legal system cannot be\n\n      ignored. One of the contributory factors that diminishes the efficacy of the Courts to render\n\n      justice in time is attributable to diverting the scarce judicial time to address identical or\n\n      similar causes repeatedly. Does it not reflect that Courts are used with an inadequate sense\n\n      of responsibility?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">\n\n      1.3 Any discourse on speedy justice invariably focuses on the exit points to the legal system,\n\n      on the disposal of cases, and there has been inadequate discussion on the nature of cases that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">      4/67</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                    WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n      enter the system at its entry points. Here lies the scope for litigation-avoidance. The\n\n      importance of avoiding a litigation that can be avoided cannot be over emphasized since it\n\n      clogs and obstructs the free outflow of cases, and contributes to what has come to described\n\n      as &#x27;docket explosion&#x27;. Nothing explodes where there is a responsibility to avoid it. A serious\n\n      attempt is therefore made to ensure that the police officials are sensitized in order the inflow\n\n      of a particular category of cases is reduced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\"> 2.

History Sheeting is a permitted means of achieving crime-prevention and in this State under\n\n     the provisions of the Police Standing Orders (henceforth the PSO) While there was a general\n\n     agreement among the counsel for the petitioners on the general utility of surveillance-\n\n     policing, there was an equal unanimity among them in describing surveillance\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">      20/67</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                  WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n      through history-sheeting as a crude and primitive policing tool, developed during the days of\n\n      colonial control, antiquated both in terms of time and technology. Mr. Henry Tiphagne, the\n\n      counsel for the petitioner in W.P(MD)7546/2019, also added that the PSO freely uses\n\n      expressions like &#x27;Known Depredators&#x27; of law (KD), or &#x27;Rowdies&#x27;, when no penal law has\n\n      prescribed powers for any branding-exercise. Either one is convicted of committing an\n\n      offence, or not convicted. Still, if looked through the lens that the provisions of the PSO,\n\n      they seem alike to the policemen. It was outlined that history-sheeting through the PSO,\n\n      conceals an issue of constitutionality that has managed to outmaneuver during forensic\n\n      scrutiny undertaken earlier. Though the constitutionality of the PSO itself was not pointedly\n\n      raised, still this court was alerted to examine it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"> 5. It was argued that if the history-sheeting through PSO is considered as a procedure\n\n     established within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, at the operational level the\n\n     PSO leaves enormous space for its arbitrary exercise, which the police officials exploit\n\n     unfailingly. The only provision in the PSO in which both the criterion for history sheeting\n\n     and the duration for which it would be in operation has been spelt with a degree of\n\n     definiteness is PSO 747. In terms of PSO 747, when once a person is convicted and\n\n     sentenced to imprisonment for the commission of certain specific offences, a history sheet\n\n     would be opened automatically against him, and it will be in force during the term of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">      21/67</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                        WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n      sentence plus two years thereafter. This clarity and certainty is unavailable in providing the\n\n      criterion either for retaining a history sheeter as such as in PSO 748, or in opening a history\n\n      sheet for suspects and rowdies as in PSO 749. It was further argued:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1411102\" id=\"span_43\">●     It could be gathered from PSO 748(2), a history sheet once opened can be in force\n\n                 only for two years, and beyond that it can be annually extended on the orders of a\n\n                 police official of a specified rank, on an objective appraisal of the materials gathered\n\n                 against a history-sheeter. Notwithstanding the insistence of this Court that the police\n\n                 officials shall be objective in their approach, and its condemnation that they shall not\n\n                 arbitrarily deal with the fundamental rights of the citizens in several of its judgements,\n\n                 most of which are catalogued and relied on in Sabari alias Sabarigiri Vs. The\n\n                 Assistant Commissioner of Police, Annanagar (L &amp; O), Madurai City [2018-2 LW\n\n                 (Crl) 817], with primary thrust on the Order of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1411102/\" id=\"a_52\">Ganesan Vs.

And being a suspect, it can be opened at any time of the\n\n                 policemen&#x27;s choice.

This is\n\n                 paradoxical since it produces the same consequence which results from a conviction.\n\n                 The judgements hither to delivered by this Court do not deal with the situations where\n\n                 both convicts and non-convicts are treated alike. This goes against the justification\n\n                 for history sheeting a person, and consequently violates the equality doctrine under\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\n           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1411102\" id=\"span_45\">●     History sheets are regularly opened even where cases are registered in connection\n\n                 with political demonstration. Right to express a dissent, right to protest and right to\n\n                 be part of any demonstration are integral to the democratic rights of the citizens, and\n\n                 resorting to history-sheeting therefore, is an indignation to our Constitutionalism,\n\n                 since history sheeting can be justified only for prevention of a crime and not for\n\n                 throttling the fundamental rights of the citizens to voice their protest.\n\n\n           ●     In <a href=\"/doc/1411102/\" id=\"a_55\">Ganesan Vs. The District Superintendent of Police &amp; Others</a> [2010(6)CTC 507],\n\n                 this Court has held that an isolated act of commission of crime cannot be\n\n                 characterized as a habitual act or commission involving breach of peace or law and\n\n                 order.

To appreciate it, a distinction is required to be\n\n      drawn between an individual&#x27;s right to dignified life, and the society&#x27;s right to peaceful\n\n      existence. It shall not be ignored that at all times societal peace walks under the shadow of\n\n      its opposite forces that threaten to defeat it. Policing is all about securing the right to\n\n      peaceful existence from these opposing forces. This battle has been continuous in every\n\n      society, since the possibility of a perfect society cannot be considered either as a preferable\n\n      hypothesis, or as a theoretical possibility, and consequently, policing cannot rest in\n\n      presuming a certain ideal. Given the tools that the police force currently has for crime-\n\n      prevention through preventive policing, significance of history-sheeting cannot be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n      10.2 The voices that decry history-sheeting as a legacy of the imperialism and opposed to\n\n      Constitutionalism, presume an ideal and the universal innocence of all. But policing is not\n\n      about believing in an ideal, and is about presuming its opposite. It is intended to protect\n\n      those who seek security for their lives under the Constitution from those who make their\n\n      peaceful journey difficult. Crime is not a choice that law offers, but is one that an individual\n\n      makes, and hence preventive policing (that which intends to prevent crime) through history-\n\n      sheeting is not just commonsensical, but also is Constitutionally relevant.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">      28/67</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                  WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_53\">11.

On the basis of the accusation made against him, the police have opened\n\n      a &quot;history sheet&quot; against him. Therefore, he challenged the constitutional validity of Chapter\n\n      XX of the U. P. Police Regulations as violative of his right under Arts. 19(1)(d) and 21 of the\n\n      Constitution of India. The Constitution Bench struck down Regulation 236 (b) thereof on the\n\n      ground that these regulations (contained in Chapter XX therein) do not have statutory force,\n\n      and that they are not relatable to Sec. 12 of the Indian Police Act. It is noteworthy to mention\n\n      that the entire Regulation was struck down by His Lordship\n\n       K. Subba Rao J. In his dissent, Justice K.Subba Rao declared his view as below:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                    “It is true our Constitution does not expressly declare a right to privacy as a\n                    fundamental right, but the said right is an essential ingredient of personal liberty.\n                    Every democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to give him rest,\n                    physical happiness, peace of mind and security.

The pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter J., in\n                    Wolf v.

In connection with these duties it will be necessary\n                  to keep discreet surveillance over reputed bad characters, habitual offenders and\n                  other potential offenders. Organised crime cannot be successfully fought without\n                  close watch of suspects.

The Order of this Court in Ganesan&#x27;s case and few other\n\n            decisions, elaborate these provisions and the zone of their application, and they may be\n\n            beneficially referred to.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">18.

The effect it instantly produces is\n\n        that it renders the reformation theory (the relevance of which the <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_109\">Probation of Offenders Act,\n\n        1958</a>, read along with <a href=\"/doc/755395/\" id=\"a_110\">Sec.360</a> Cr.P.C. signify) which our criminal justice jurisprudence has not\n\n        abandoned, instantly meaningless.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">            43/67</span>\n      http://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                       WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">21.     Due to want of a definitional objectivity, PSO 749(1)(b) provides an unwitting opportunity to\n\n        the police official to believe that, &#x27;once an offender is always an offender&#x27;. There cannot be a\n\n        greater instance of arbitrary discrimination and insult to the Constitution than to prescribe a\n\n        presumption that a former convict is an eternal suspect. Preventive policing cannot extend to\n\n        the extent of treating the entire society as suspects, and hence it ought to filter those who are\n\n        prone to commit a crime from the rest on an objective criterion for a special-watch through\n\n        history-sheeting. If the need for involvement of a person in a crime after his initial conviction\n\n        is eliminated from the line of consideration, that is to mean, if a person is not convicted or\n\n        where not even a FIR is registered subsequent to his earlier conviction, it is difficult to\n\n        conceive how a person is known to commit a crime, or believes to have committed a crime, or\n\n        considered likely to commit a crime.

Here it is necessary to bring in PSO 746 which is the opening provision of the Chapter on\n\n        History-Sheeting. PSO 746 is more of a general provision, with PSO 747 to 749 addressing\n\n        specific aspects of History-sheeting.

What is significant here is not the qualifying or the adjectival expressions, but\n\n            the conduct involving commission of crime or its abetment. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1411102\" id=\"span_76\">In <a href=\"/doc/1411102/\" id=\"a_111\">Ganesan</a>&#x27;s case this Court\n\n            has held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                        “51.....Belief, in the case on hand, means a degree of conviction of the truth something\n                        especially based on a consideration or examination of evidence and authorities vested with\n                        the discretion of opening and retaining history sheets should prove that on the examination\n                        of the data that there is awareness on their part indicating their state of mind that by\n                        probable reasoning, they come to a conclusion or infer, about the conduct of person, for\n                        whom a history sheet is opened or retained..”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1411102\" id=\"span_77\">23.

This is done\n\n    on the basis of what the PSO refers to as &#x27;current doings&#x27;. What this term &#x27;current doings&#x27;\n\n    signifies is known from PSO 746(3).

In our criminal\n\n      jurisprudence, normally, where the statute has not stipulated otherwise, an accused is\n\n      presumed to be innocent even where a FIR is registered, how then to identify one as a bad\n\n      character for retaining him in the history sheet and support any such retention? Secondly,\n\n      what can be &#x27;of interest&#x27; to the policeman? Can it be anything except a conduct constituting a\n\n      crime? Interestingly under PSO 367 which provides for village beats and patrols, except for\n\n      habitual offenders, for other categories of bad characters there should not be any domiciliary\n\n      visits. This would imply that all habitual offenders are bad characters, but not all bad\n\n      characters are habitual offenders. What are the yardsticks to make that intelligent distinction\n\n      within the scheme of PSO? None.

Given the possibility that a person can be bad character\n\n      without a FIR, what is likely to happen, if it is not already happening, is to gather\n\n      information about the involvement of one in the commission of a cognizable offence, treat\n\n      him not as an accused (which during investigation is same as Suspect), but as a bad\n\n      character for the purpose of history sheeting.

As noted in an earlier paragraph, a person addicted to crime in PSO 749 (1)(b) is sought to be\n\n      differentiated from a habitual offender under PSO 749(2)(a). And, elsewhere in PSO 368 uses\n\n      a term, &#x27;known depredator&#x27;. How, a known depredator is different from one who is addicted to\n\n      crime, and how both are different from a habitual offender? In real terms, considering the\n\n      substance and the context in which they are randomly used, all shall mean the same. This is\n\n      critical in the context of the right of pre-hearing available under the <a href=\"/doc/53980582/\" id=\"a_124\">Habitual Offenders Act</a>.\n\n      This Court is at a loss to appreciate the multiple terms used in the PSO to understand the same\n\n      category of persons. Is the PSO, therefore a piece of deft drafting stratagem, a subterfuge, to\n\n      deflect the statutory definition in <a href=\"/doc/53980582/\" id=\"a_125\">Habitual Offenders Act</a>, of its operational course through the\n\n      usage of near synonymous phrases to avoid a pre- decisional hearing?\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">        52/67</span>\n  http://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                    WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n      28.1 The definitional inadequacy in identifying a Suspect under PSO 749(1)(b) or a Rowdy\n\n      (2)(a) is glaring. And, it throws the citizen to the mercy of the police power. This also has\n\n      relevance in situations where the Court has acquitted a history-sheeter, but still grants to the\n\n      SHO the luxury to be in a transcendental state to consider him as known or believed to, or\n\n      likely to commit a crime and to believe what is not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">\n\n\n      28.2 The free roaming space that the PSO has provided through its inaccurate and imprecise\n\n      drafting is an open ticket to arbitrary exercise of police power to history-sheet. The police\n\n      personnel is reminded that preventive-policing is not easy-policing. It is one thing to have a\n\n      general watch on the entire society for criminality, and it is entirely another thing to pick a\n\n      person for special branding as a suspect for surveillance.

There is a mechanism within the police, by\n\n      which the superior officials are required to inspect the Police Station. Failure to inspect\n\n      properly has also occasioned in arbitrary exercise of police power to retain a history sheet.\n\n      Then there are also instances of pure malafide exercise of power.\n\n\n\n\n      31.2 It is noticeable that the fine act of preventive policing through history-sheeting, has\n\n      been marred by a high percentage of subjectivity and unimaginable lack of application of\n\n      mind. They instantly demonstrate that the principles settled by this Court in the\n\n      judgements/Orders up till now delivered on the manner of history-sheeting a person, have\n\n      not even been given the scantiest respect that they deserve.

This is but an\n\n      amplification of what Justice Holmes tersely premised in his work, &#x27;The Common Law&#x27; that\n\n      “the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience”\n\n\n\n\n      33.2 Besides the need for surveillance and crime-prevention, this Court is given to\n\n      understand that history sheeting seemingly has a longer range to impact a citizen&#x27;s\n\n      fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> while seeking employment or for\n\n      pursuing a profession of his choice. Even, obtaining a passport is made difficult for the one\n\n      who is history-sheeted, this court was told. Without getting into the advisability                  of\n\n      extending the operational scope of a history-sheet for purposes beyond crime-prevention,\n\n      does it not signify the need for greater care when the power to history-sheet is exercised?\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1005538\" id=\"span_100\">34. Ideally where cases are registered against the citizens for participating in any\n\n      demonstrations, agitations or protest or the like, consistent with the freedom granted by the\n\n      Constitution, history-sheeting on that score can be resorted to only after an Order is passed\n\n      against the concerned person under <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_134\">Sec.107</a> Cr.P.C. or <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_135\">Sec.110</a> Cr.P.C. since it will enable to\n\n      balance the need to safeguard the citizens&#x27; right to protest without violence, and duty of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">      61/67</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                    WP(MD)No.21040 of 2018 &amp; etc. batch cases\n\n\n      police to maintain peace in the society. This balancing act can be well achieved when an\n\n      Executive magistrate, and not the police, takes a decision after hearing the party to be affected\n\n      by history-sheeting. This cannot be extended to non-citizens, as the rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 19</a>\n\n      are confined only to the citizens under the Constitution of India.

In all cases a person can be history-sheeted only for two years as provided in PSO\n\n                      748(1). Retaining a history sheeter beyond that period is an exception and it must\n\n                      have an objective basis. Accordingly, history sheet cannot be retained merely on\n\n                      the ground that (a) investigation agency has not filed any final report, or, (b) where\n\n                      the case is pending trial beyond two years time as provided.\n\n\n\n                 C.
