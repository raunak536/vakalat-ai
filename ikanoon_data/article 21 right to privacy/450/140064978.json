Though we are not inclined to grant stay to the\n    operation of <a href=\"/doc/139741415/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 5D</a>, we cannot forget that initially the\n                       \n    Act was passed in 1948. It was then amended in 1954 and\n    thereafter in 1976. Under the said Act, slaughtering of bulls\n    and bullocks, after compliance of certain conditions, was\n       \n\n\n    permitted. The said provision remained in force since then\n    \n\n\n\n    till the present Act was amended and a complete ban has\n    been imposed on slaughtering of bulls and bullocks by\n\n\n\n\n\n    various provisions under the Act.      Even after the present Act\n    was passed in 1995, the State did not obtain the assent of\n    the President for almost 20 years          and it is only after the\n    lapse of 20 years, the assent of the President was granted on\n\n\n\n\n\n    26/02/2015 and the said Act has been published in Official\n    Gazette on 04/03/2015.       What was legal therefore prior to\n    04/03/2015 for almost more than 30 years, has been\n    declared to be illegal inviting penal consequences even for\n    possession or import of beef.
