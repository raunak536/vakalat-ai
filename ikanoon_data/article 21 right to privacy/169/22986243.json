The petitioner, who served as the Electrical Inspector, Tirunelveli\n\n                District, is facing trial under <a href=\"/doc/83604231/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 7(a)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption\n\n                Act, 1988. It is alleged that the petitioner demanded and accepted illegal\n\n                gratification of Rs.8,000/- from PW-2, an Electrical Contractor, for issuing a\n\n                safety certificate for a 20 KVA generator. The petitioner was arrested on\n\n                23.11.2018 pursuant to a trap laid by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption\n\n                Wing. The trial is presently at the stage of examination of defence\n\n                witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                2/15</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis             ( Uploaded on: 09/07/2025 07:58:23 pm )\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                                      Crl.RC.(MD)No.475 of 2025</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">                          3. Learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that Ex-D6, a pen\n\n                drive marked during defence evidence, contains three voice recordings of\n\n                conversations between the petitioner and PW-2, including a crucial one on\n\n                the date of the trap. According to the petitioner, the tone and context of the\n\n                conversations negate the prosecution&#x27;s narrative and support the defence\n\n                version. It was submitted that the veracity and integrity of these recordings\n\n                need to be verified through scientific examination by an expert under\n\n                <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 45A</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, for which the voice sample of PW-2\n\n                is essential.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">                          4. Additionally, the petitioner relied on a video recording, allegedly\n\n                capturing a conversation between the wife of LW-7 and the petitioner,\n\n                wherein reference is made to the removal of CCTV footage by the\n\n                investigating agency. The petitioner asserted that this recording is directly\n\n                relevant to the defence plea of suppression of crucial evidence by the\n\n                prosecution. It was argued that the trial Court erred in summarily\n\n                dismissing the application by relying solely on the cross-examination of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                3/15</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis             ( Uploaded on: 09/07/2025 07:58:23 pm )\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                                      Crl.RC.(MD)No.475 of 2025</span>\n\n\n                DW-1, who had merely stated that the recordings were transferred from the\n\n                petitioner’s phone and that alteration using mobile software was\n\n                theoretically possible. The mere possibility of tampering cannot displace\n\n                the need for an expert’s opinion, which is precisely meant to determine\n\n                such questions. The denial of such an opportunity undermines the\n\n                petitioner’s right to present an effective defence and runs counter to the\n\n                principles of fair trial. Therefore, he prayed for appropriate orders.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">                          5. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) submitted\n\n                that the application was misconceived and intended only to protract the\n\n                proceedings. It was pointed out that the video recording relied upon by the\n\n                petitioner was allegedly created four years after the incident and the\n\n                persons shown therein were not examined as witnesses during the trial. It\n\n                was further argued that the alleged CCTV footage never formed part of the\n\n                prosecution case and its supposed removal was a false narrative developed\n\n                by the petitioner belatedly, in the absence of any protest or complaint.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                4/15</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis             ( Uploaded on: 09/07/2025 07:58:23 pm )\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                                     Crl.RC.(MD)No.475 of 2025</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">                          6. As regards Ex-D6, the learned Government Advocate drew\n\n                attention to the deposition of DW-1, who admitted in cross-examination\n\n                that the contents of the pen drive were downloaded from a mobile phone\n\n                and that editing using available mobile applications was feasible. On this\n\n                basis, it was contended that the recordings lacked reliability and\n\n                authenticity. He further submitted that the voice sample of PW-2, who is\n\n                not an accused but a witness, cannot be compelled without infringing upon\n\n                his personal liberty and right to privacy. It was asserted that compelling\n\n                such a sample from a private citizen would open the floodgates to misuse\n\n                and overreach, particularly in corruption cases where traps are conducted\n\n                in a lawful manner. According to him, the trial court had exercised its\n\n                discretion judiciously and that no case for interference under the revisional\n\n                jurisdiction had been made out. Therefore, he prayed for dismissal.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">                          7.

The impugned order of the trial Court reveals that the application\n\n                was dismissed on three principal grounds:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                  (a) the video recording was made four years after\n                        registration of the FIR;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                  (b) the persons appearing in the recording were not\n                        examined; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                  (c) the possibility of tampering, as suggested by DW-1,\n                        rendered the recordings suspect.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">                          9. This Court is unable to accept the reasoning of the trial Court in its\n\n                entirety. The fact that the video was recorded at a later point in time does\n\n                not, by itself, render it inadmissible or irrelevant. The conversation\n\n                captured therein, if authentic, may lend credence to the allegation of\n\n                suppression of CCTV footage, which is a matter with potential bearing on\n\n                the integrity of the trap proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">                          10. As regards the voice recordings in Ex-D6, their proximity to the\n\n                alleged incident, including a conversation on the very day of the trap,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                6/15</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis               ( Uploaded on: 09/07/2025 07:58:23 pm )\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                                          Crl.RC.(MD)No.475 of 2025</span>\n\n\n                makes them intrinsically relevant. Whether these recordings support or\n\n                rebut the allegations is a matter for trial, but they cannot be excluded from\n\n                scientific scrutiny merely on speculative grounds.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">                          11. The apprehension that the contents may have been altered is not a\n\n                justification for refusing forensic examination. On the contrary, such\n\n                concerns reinforce the need for expert analysis. A determination as to\n\n                whether the files were edited or manipulated can only be reached by a\n\n                competent forensic authority, not through assumptions or oral statements\n\n                by lay witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63865477\" id=\"span_11\">12.
