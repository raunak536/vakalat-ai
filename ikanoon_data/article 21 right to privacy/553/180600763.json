Saikia,\n                                                                           Page No.# 2/7\n\nlearned Amicus Curiae, representing respondent No.2. Also heard learned\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Mr. B. Sarma.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.    By filing this petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., the petitioner has prayed for\nquashing and setting aside the order dated 04.12.2023 passed in Special POCSO\nCase No. 09/2023, by the learned Additional Sessions Judge cum Special Judge,\nPOCSO, Barpeta.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that the respondent No.2 lodged an\nFIR before the O/C Barpeta PS stating inter alia that her minor daughter used to\nvisit the jewellery shop of the accused petitioner and the accused petitioner was\nenticing her daughter that he would marry her. Thereafter, the accused petitioner\nstarted to have sexual relationship with the victim by paying money for one year as\na result of which she became pregnant and ultimately she gave birth to a child. On\nreceipt of the complaint, a case was registered vide Barpeta PS Case No.\n1184/2022 under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 376</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 4</a> of POCSO Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the case is now at the\nstage of defence witness. After completion of evidence of the prosecution witness,\nthe statement of the accused petitioner was recorded under Section 313 Cr.P. C.\nand in the said statement the accused had categorically stated that false case has\nbeen lodged against him. He is innocent and he is not the father of the victim&#x27;s\nchild and the petitioner also stated that a DNA test if conducted would prove his\ninnocence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.    It is further submitted that since the victim had categorically stated that she\nhad become pregnant owing to keeping of such physical relationship with the\npetitioner and thereby committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 4</a> of POCSO Act but the\naccused petitioner denied the same and there is no other option to prove his\ninnocence except holding of DNA test. With that view the accused petitioner filed\n                                                                              Page No.# 3/7\n\nan application before the trial court for conducting DNA test but learned Special\nJudge after hearing both the parties rejected the prayer of the petitioner for\nconducting DNA test on the ground that identity of the father has no relevancy in\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 376</a> IPC or <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_6\">POCSO Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">7.    It is also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that in case\nof rape or sexual offence usually there is no eye witness to the incident as a result\nof which the court has to rely on the evidence of the victim and medical evidence\nbut the statement of the victim is not the gospel truth of the fact. Therefore, under\nthe facts and circumstances of the case the DNA test is required to be conducted\nto prove the fact in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"156872511\" id=\"span_1\">8.    It is also contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the learned\nSpecial Judge misconstrued and misunderstood the law laid down in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/156872511/\" id=\"a_7\">Sunil vs State of MP</a> reported in (2017) 4 SCC 393. Under the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case, the law laid down therein has more relevant in\ncase of the petitioner and as such the order passed by the learned Special Judge is\nnot tenable in the eye of law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      In support of his submission the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied\non the following case laws:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68886715\" id=\"span_2\">(i)                 (2011) 7 SCC 130 (Krishan Kr. Malaik vs state of\n\n             Hariyana).\n\n      (ii)              (2020) 3 SCC 443 (<a href=\"/doc/68886715/\" id=\"a_8\">Santosh Prasad @ Santosh Kumar\n\n             vs State of Bihar</a>).</span>\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1150003\" id=\"span_3\">9.    In response to the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the\nlearned Amicus Curiae representing the respondent No.2 has supported the order\nof the trial court for rejecting the prayer for DNA test. By referring the judgment of\n                                                                             Page No.# 4/7\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1150003/\" id=\"a_9\">Sisu Bhaban vs Joy Yohannan</a> (2008) 4 KLT 550 , the leaner Amicus Curiae has\npointed out that the question regarding the necessity of DNA test in a rape trial\nwas considered in the said case. The court held that the cardinal issue to be\naddressed in a rape trial is whether there was sexual intercourse against the will\nand without the consent of the victim. If the sexual intercourse was with the\nconsent of the victim, the question is whether the consent was obtained under\ncircumstance falling under clauses thirdly, fourthly and fifthly of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 375</a> IPC.\nThe court observed that merely because there was an allegation by the prosecution\nthat pursuant to the sexual intercourse which the accused had with the victim her\nchild was born, the question of paternity of the child which has absolutely no nexus\nwith the alleged offence of rape, cannot arise. Whether the accused is proved to be\nthe biological father or not was wholly irrelevant about the fact in issue in the trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39150229\" id=\"span_4\">10.   The learned Amicus Curiae has also referred two other case laws i.e. <a href=\"/doc/39150229/\" id=\"a_11\">Afan\nAnsari vs State of Jharkhand</a> (2022) SCC online JHAR 1649 and Dilesh Nishad vs\nState of Chhatishgarh (Manu/CG/1664/2023).In both the cases, it was held that for\ndeciding the case under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 376</a> IPC, paternity of the child is not relevant and\ntherefore, there is no need to held DNA test to prove the charge.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">11.   Learned Additional Public Prosecutor has also opposed in allowing the prayer\nof the petitioner in conducting DNA test at this stage. It is further submitted that\nthe case is at the fag end of the trial as such there is no need to conduct DNA test\nat this stage as because there is every possibility of manipulation in the coming\nreport.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">12.   Having heard the learned counsel for both the parties and under the facts\nand circumstances of the case, it is apt to rely on some decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">13.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_13\">Bhabani Prasad Jena v. Orissa State Commission</a> for Women [(2010) 8\n                                                                           Page No.# 5/7\n\nSCC 633] the Supreme Court enunciated the test of the &quot;eminent need&quot; while\nconsidering a prayer for DNA test of the child. It was a case where in a family\ndispute, the paternity of a child was disputed. The State Commission for Women,\nOrissa issued orders directing DNA test of a child. The matter reached the High\nCourt in a writ petition. The High Court also issued an order directing that the DNA\ntest of the child shall be conducted. The Supreme Court considered the question\nwhether the High Court and the State Commission for Women were justified in\nordering a DNA test of the child. The Supreme Court, after appreciating the rights\nentitled to the child, especially the right to privacy, held thus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;21. In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before the court,\n      the use of DNA test is an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. One view\n      is that when modern science gives the means of ascertaining the paternity of\n      a child, there should not be any hesitation to use those means whenever the\n      occasion requires. The other view is that the court must be reluctant in the\n      use of such scientific advances and tools which result in invasion of right to\n      privacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to the rights of the\n      parties but may have devastating effect on the child. Sometimes the result of\n      such scientific test may bastardise an innocent child even though his mother\n      and her spouse were living together during the time of conception.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             22. In our view, when there is apparent conflict between the right to\n      privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly to medical examination and\n      duty of the court to reach the truth, the court must exercise its discretion\n      only after balancing the interests of the parties and on due consideration\n      whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is eminently needed. DNA\n      test in a matter relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by the\n      court as a matter of course or in a routine manner, whenever such a request\n      is made. The court has to consider diverse aspects including presumption\n      under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the\n      test of &quot;eminent need&quot; whether it is not possible for the court to reach the\n      truth without use of such test.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">14.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_15\">K.S.
