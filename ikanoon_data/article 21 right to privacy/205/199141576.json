[for himself, R.M. Lodha, C.J., and      S.A. Bobde, J.]\n\n      A democratic polity, as understood in its  quintessential  purity,  is\nconceptually abhorrent to corruption  and,  especially  corruption  at  high\nplaces, and repulsive to the idea  of  criminalization  of  politics  as  it\ncorrodes the legitimacy of the collective ethos, frustrates  the  hopes  and\naspirations of the citizens and has the potentiality  to  obstruct,  if  not\nderail, the rule of law.  Democracy, which has  been  best  defined  as  the\nGovernment of the  People,  by  the  People  and  for  the  People,  expects\nprevalence of genuine orderliness, positive propriety, dedicated  discipline\nand sanguine sanctity by  constant  affirmance  of  constitutional  morality\nwhich is the pillar stone  of  good  governance.   While  dealing  with  the\nconcept of democracy, the majority in <a href=\"/doc/936707/\" id=\"a_1\">Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj  Narain</a>[1],\nstated that ‘democracy’ as an  essential  feature  of  the  Constitution  is\nunassailable.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1890680\" id=\"span_2\">The said principle was reiterated  in  <a href=\"/doc/1890680/\" id=\"a_2\">T.N.  Seshan,  CEC  of\nIndia v. Union of India</a> and ors.[2].</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1903935\" id=\"span_3\">and <a href=\"/doc/1903935/\" id=\"a_3\">Kuldip Nayar v. Union  of  India  &amp;\nOrs.</a>[3]  It was pronounced with asseveration that  democracy  is  the  basic\nand fundamental structure of the Constitution.  There is no shadow of  doubt\nthat democracy in India is a product of the  rule  of  law  and  aspires  to\nestablish  an  egalitarian  social  order.   It  is  not  only  a  political\nphilosophy  but  also  an  embodiment  of  constitutional  philosophy.</span>    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15059075\" id=\"span_4\">In\nPeople’s Union for <a href=\"/doc/15059075/\" id=\"a_4\">Civil  Liberties  and  another  v.  Union  of  India  and\nanother</a>[4], while holding the voters’ rights not to  vote  for  any  of  the\ncandidates, the Court observed that democracy and free elections are a  part\nof the basic structure of the Constitution  and,  thereafter,  proceeded  to\nlay down that democracy being the basic feature of our  constitutional  set-\nup, there can be no two opinions that free and fair  elections  would  alone\nguarantee [pic]the growth of a healthy democracy in the  country.  The  term\n“fair” denotes equal opportunity to all  people.  Universal  adult  suffrage\nconferred on the citizens of India by the Constitution has made it  possible\nfor millions of individual voters to participate in the  governance  of  our\ncountry.  For  democracy  to  survive,  it  is  fundamental  that  the  best\navailable men should be chosen  as  the  people’s  representatives  for  the\nproper governance of the country and the same can be best  achieved  through\nmen of high moral and ethical values who win the  elections  on  a  positive\nvote.  Emphasizing on a vibrant  democracy,  the  Court  observed  that  the\nvoter must be given an opportunity  to  choose  none  of  the  above  (NOTA)\nbutton, which will indeed compel the political parties to nominate  a  sound\ncandidate.  Accordingly, the principle of the dire need of  negative  voting\nwas emphasised.   The  significance  of  free  and  fair  election  and  the\nnecessity of the electorate to have candidates of  high  moral  and  ethical\nvalues was re-asserted.  In this regard, it may be stated  that  the  health\nof democracy,  a  cherished  constitutional  value,  has  to  be  protected,\npreserved and sustained, and for that purpose, instilment of  certain  norms\nin the marrows of the collective is absolutely necessitous.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">THE REFERENCE\n\nWe have commenced our judgment with the aforesaid prologue  as  the  present\nwrit petition under  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_5\">Article  32</a>  of  the  Constitution  was  filed  by  the\npetitioner as pro bono publico assailing the  appointment  of  some  of  the\noriginal respondents as Ministers to the Council of Ministers  of  Union  of\nIndia  despite  their  involvement  in  serious  and  heinous  crimes.    On\n24.3.2006, when the matter was listed  before  the  Bench  presided  by  the\nlearned Chief Justice, the following order came to be passed: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      “A point of great public importance has been raised in this  petition.\n Broadly, the point is about  the  legality  of  the  person  with  criminal\nbackground and/or charged with  offences  involving  moral  turpitude  being\nappointed as ministers in Central and State Governments.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      We have heard in brief Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel  who\nwas appointed as amicus curiae to assist the  Court,  as  also  the  learned\nSolicitor  General,  appearing  for  the  Union  of  India,  and  Mr.  Gopal\nSubramaniam, learned Additional Solicitor General  appearing  on  behalf  of\nthe Attorney General for India.  Having  regard  to  the  magnitude  of  the\nproblem and its vital importance, it is but  proper  that  the  petition  is\nheard by a Bench of five Judges.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      We issue notice to Union of India.  Formal notice need not  be  issued\nsince the Union of India is represented by learned Solicitor General.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      Notices shall also be issued to  the  Advocates  General  of  all  the\nStates.

It is not  necessary  to  implead\nindividual ministers and/or Prime Minister for deciding the question  above-\nnamed.  Accordingly, respondent Nos. 2 to 7 are deleted from  the  array  of\nparties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      List the case after the Court reopens after the  summer  vacation  for\ndirections as to fixing a date for its being placed before the  Constitution\nBench.”\n\n      In view of the aforesaid order and the subsequent orders,  the  matter\nhas been placed before us.   Considering  the  controversy  raised,  we  are\nrequired to interpret the scope and purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1324537/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 75</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_7\">164</a>  of  the\nConstitution, regard being had to the text, context, scheme  and  spirit  of\nthe Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1831036\" id=\"span_5\">THE PURITY OF ELECTION\n\nIn the beginning, we have emphasized on the concept of  democracy  which  is\nthe corner stone of the Constitution.  There are  certain  features  absence\nof which can erode the  fundamental values of democracy.   One  of  them  is\nholding of free and fair election by adult franchise in a periodical  manner\nas has been held in <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_8\">Mohinder  Singh  Gill  and  another  v.  Chief  Election\nCommissioner, New Delhi and others</a>[5], for it is the heart and soul  of  the\nparliamentary system.  In the  said  case,  Krishna  Iyer,  J.  quoted  with\napproval the statement of Sir Winston Churchill which is as follows: -</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"556135\" id=\"span_6\">“At the bottom of all tributes paid to democracy is the little man,  walking\ninto a little booth, with a little  pencil,  making  a  little  cross  on  a\nlittle bit of paper – no amount of rhetoric  or  voluminous  discussion  can\npossibly diminish the overwhelming importance of the point.”\n\nIn <a href=\"/doc/556135/\" id=\"a_9\">Raghbir Singh Gill v. S. Gurcharan Singh Tohra</a>[6],  the  learned  Judges,\nafter referring to Mohinder Singh  Gill’s  case,  stated  that  nothing  can\ndiminish the overwhelming importance of the cross  or  preference  indicated\nby the dumb sealed lip voter.  That is his right and the  trust  reposed  by\nthe Constitution in him is  that  he  will  act  as  a  responsible  citizen\nchoosing his masters for governing the country.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"182927551\" id=\"span_7\">This Court has laid emphasis on the purity of elections in  <a href=\"/doc/182927551/\" id=\"a_10\">Union  of  India\nv. Association</a> for Democratic Reforms and another[7] and, in  that  context,\nhas observed that elections in this country are  fought  with  the  help  of\nmoney power which is gathered from black sources and once elected to  power,\nit becomes easy to collect tons of black money which is used  for  retaining\npower and for re-election.   The  Court  further  observed  that  if  on  an\naffidavit a candidate is required to disclose the assets held by him at  the\ntime of election, the voter can decide  whether  he  should  be  re-elected.\nThereafter, as regards the purity of election, the Court  observed  that  to\nmaintain purity of elections and, in particular, to  bring  transparency  in\nthe process of election, the Commission can ask  the  candidates  about  the\nexpenditure incurred by the political parties, and  the  voters  would  have\nbasic elementary right to know full particulars of a  candidate  who  is  to\nrepresent them in Parliament where laws to bind their liberty  and  property\nmay be enacted because the right  to  get  information  in  a  democracy  is\nrecognised all throughout and  it  is  a  natural  right  flowing  from  the\nconcept of democracy.  Elaborating further, the Court opined  that  a  voter\nhas a right to know the antecedents  including  the  criminal  past  of  his\ncandidate contesting election for MP or MLA as it is fundamental  and  basic\nfor the  survival of democracy, for he may  think  over  before  making  his\nchoice of electing  law-breakers  as  law-makers.   Eventually,   the  Court\ndirected the Election Commission to exercise its power under <a href=\"/doc/950881/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 324</a>  of\nthe Constitution requiring the candidate to furnish  information  pertaining\nto the fact whether the candidate has been  convicted/  acquitted/discharged\nof any criminal offence in the  past,  if  any,  and  whether  he  has  been\npunished with imprisonment or fine; whether the candidate is accused in  any\npending case of any offence punishable with imprisonment for  two  years  or\nmore, and in which charge is framed or cognizance is taken by the  court  of\nlaw; and certain other information.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">From  the  aforesaid  authorities,  it  is  perceivable  that  while  giving\nemphasis on the sanctity of election, the Court has  expressed  its  concern\nwith regard to various facets of the candidates  who  contest  the  election\nand seek votes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"716836\" id=\"span_8\">CRIMINALISATION OF POLITICS\n\nCriminalisation of politics is an anathema to the sacredness  of  democracy.\n Commenting on criminalization of politics, the Court,  in  <a href=\"/doc/716836/\" id=\"a_12\">Dinesh  Trivedi,\nM.P. and others v. Union of India and others</a>[8],  lamented  the  faults  and\nimperfections which have impeded the country in  reaching  the  expectations\nwhich heralded  its  conception.   While  identifying  one  of  the  primary\ncauses, the Court referred to the report of N.N. Vohra  Committee  that  was\nsubmitted on 5.10.1993.  The Court noted  that  the  growth  and  spread  of\ncrime syndicates in Indian society  has  been  pervasive  and  the  criminal\nelements have developed an extensive network of contacts at many  a  sphere.\nThe Court, further referring to the report, found that  the  Report  reveals\nseveral alarming [pic]and deeply disturbing trends  that  are  prevalent  in\nour present society.  The Court  further  noticed  that  the  nexus  between\npoliticians, bureaucrats and criminal elements in our society  has  been  on\nthe rise, the adverse effects  of  which  are  increasingly  being  felt  on\nvarious aspects of social life in India. Indeed, the situation has  worsened\nto such an extent that the President of  our  country  felt  constrained  to\nmake references to the phenomenon in his addresses to the Nation on the  eve\nof the Republic Day in 1996 as well as in 1997 and hence, it required to  be\nhandled with extreme care and circumspection.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">In Anukul Chandra Pradhan, Advocate Supreme Court  v.  Union  of  India  and\nothers[9], the Court, in the context of the provisions made in the  election\nlaw, observed that they have been made  to  exclude  persons  with  criminal\nbackground of  the  kind  specified  therein  from  the  election  scene  as\ncandidates  and  voters  with  the  object  to  prevent  criminalization  of\npolitics and maintain propriety in elections.  Thereafter,  the  three-Judge\nBench opined that any provision enacted with a  view  to  promote  the  said\nobject  must  be  welcomed  and  upheld  as  subserving  the  constitutional\npurpose.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195348497\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/195348497/\" id=\"a_13\">K. Prabhakaran v. P. Jayarajan</a>[10], in the context of  enacting\ndisqualification under <a href=\"/doc/1858044/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(3)</a> of  the  Representation  of  the  People\nAct, 1951 (for brevity “the 1951 Act”), it has been reiterated that  persons\nwith criminal background pollute the process of election  as  they  have  no\nreservation from indulging in criminality to gain success at an election.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">It is worth saying that systemic corruption  and  sponsored  criminalization\ncan corrode the fundamental core of elective  democracy  and,  consequently,\nthe constitutional governance.   The  agonized  concern  expressed  by  this\nCourt on being moved by the conscious citizens, as is perceptible  from  the\nauthorities  referred  to  hereinabove,  clearly  shows  that  a  democratic\nrepublic polity hopes and aspires to be governed by a  Government  which  is\nrun by the elected representatives  who  do  not  have  any  involvement  in\nserious criminal offences or  offences  relating  to  corruption,  casteism,\nsocietal problems, affecting the sovereignty of the nation  and  many  other\noffences.   There  are  recommendations  given   by   different   committees\nconstituted by various Governments  for  electoral  reforms.   Some  of  the\nreports that have been highlighted at the bar are (i) Goswami  Committee  on\nElectoral  Reforms  (1990),  (ii)  Vohra  Committee  Report  (1993),   (iii)\nIndrajit Gupta Committee on State Funding  of  Elections  (1998),  (iv)  Law\nCommission Report on Reforms of the  Electoral  Laws  (1999),  (v)  National\nCommission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2001),  (vi)  Election\nCommission of India – Proposed Electoral Reforms (2004),  (vii)  The  Second\nAdministrative  Reforms  Commission  (2008),  (vii)   Justice   J.S.   Verma\nCommittee Report  on  Amendments  to  Criminal  Law  (2013),  and  (ix)  Law\nCommission Report (2014).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">Vohra Committee Report and other Reports have been taken note of on  various\noccasions by this Court.  Justice J.S. Verma Committee Report on  Amendments\nto Criminal Law has proposed insertion  of   Schedule  1  to  the  1951  Act\nenumerating  offences  under  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a>  befitting  the  category   of   ‘heinous’\noffences.  It recommended that <a href=\"/doc/1130867/\" id=\"a_16\">Section  8(1)</a>  of  the  1951  Act  should  be\namended to cover, inter alia, the offences listed in the  proposed  Schedule\n1 and a provision should be engrafted that a  person  in  respect  of  whose\nacts or omissions a court of competent  jurisdiction  has  taken  cognizance\nunder Section 190(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_17\">Code  of  Criminal  Procedure</a>  or\nwho has been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect  to\nthe offences specified in the  proposed  expanded  list  of  offences  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1130867/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)</a> shall be disqualified from the date  of  taking  cognizance  or\nconviction, as the case may be.  It further proposed  that  disqualification\nin case of conviction shall continue for a further period of six years  from\nthe  date  of  release  upon  conviction  and  in  case  of  acquittal,  the\ndisqualification shall operate from the date of taking cognizance  till  the\ndate of acquittal.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">The Law Commission, in its 244th Report, 2014, has  suggested  amendment  to\nthe 1951 Act by insertion of Section  8B  after  <a href=\"/doc/40920484/\" id=\"a_19\">Section  8A</a>,  after  having\nnumerous consultations and discussions, with the avowed purpose  to  prevent\ncriminalization of politics.  It proposes to provide for electoral  reforms.\n Though it is a recommendation by the Law Commission, yet to understand  the\nexisting scenario in which the criminalization of politics  has  the  effect\npotentiality to create  a  concavity  in  the  highly  treasured  values  of\ndemocracy, we think it apt to reproduce the relevant part  of  the  proposed\namendment.  It reads as follows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">“8B. Disqualification on framing of charge for certain  offences.  -  (1)  A\nperson against whom a charge has been framed by a  competent  court  for  an\noffence  punishable  by  at  least  five   years   imprisonment   shall   be\ndisqualified from the date of framing the charge for a period of six  years,\nor till the date of quashing of charge or acquittal, whichever  is  earlier.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, nothing  in  sub-section\n(1) shall apply to a person:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(i)   Who  holds  office  as  a  Member  of  Parliament,  State  Legislative\nAssembly or Legislative Council at the date of enactment of this  provision,\nor\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(ii)  Against whom a charge has been framed for an offence punishable by  at\nleast five years imprisonment;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(a)   Less than one year before the date of scrutiny of nominations  for  an\nelection under <a href=\"/doc/168639435/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 36</a>, in relation to that election;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(b)         At a  time  when  such  person  holds  office  as  a  Member  of\nParliament, State Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council, and has  been\nelected to such office after the enactment of these provisions;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(3) For Members of Parliament, State  Legislative  Assembly  or  Legislative\nCouncil  covered  by  clause  (ii)  of  sub-section  (2),  they   shall   be\ndisqualified at the expiry of one year from the date of  framing  of  charge\nor date of election, whichever is later, unless they have been acquitted  in\nthe said period or the relevant charge against them has been quashed.”\n\n\nThe  aforesaid  vividly  exposits  concern  at  all   quarters   about   the\ncriminalisation of politics.  Criminalisation of politics, it  can  be  said\nwith certitude, creates a dent in the marrows of the nation.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">CORRUPTION IN THE PRESENT SCENARIO\n\nCriminality and corruption go hand in hand.  From the date the  Constitution\nwas adopted, i.e., 26th January, 1950, a Red Letter Day in  the  history  of\nIndia, the nation stood as a silent witness to corruption  at  high  places.\nCorruption erodes the fundamental tenets of the rule of  law.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15111331\" id=\"span_10\">In  <a href=\"/doc/15111331/\" id=\"a_21\">Niranjan\nHemchandra Sashittal and another v.

It is worth noting that immoral acquisition of  wealth  destroys\nthe energy of the people believing in  honesty,  and  history  records  with\nagony how they have suffered. The only redeeming  fact  is  that  collective\nsensibility respects  such  suffering  as  it  is  in  consonance  with  the\nconstitutional morality.”\n\nRecently,  in  <a href=\"/doc/183165917/\" id=\"a_22\">Dr.  Subramanian  Swamy  v.

Surely  not,  because  irrespective  of  their  status   or\nposition, corrupt public servants  are  corrupters  of  public  power.   The\ncorrupt public servants, whether high or low, are birds of the same  feather\nand must be  confronted  with  the  process  of  investigation  and  inquiry\nequally.  Based on the position or status in service, no distinction can  be\nmade between public servants against whom there  are  allegations  amounting\nto an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_26\">PC Act, 1988</a>.”\n\nAnd thereafter, the larger Bench further said:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">“Corruption is an enemy of the  nation  and  tracking  down  corrupt  public\nservants and punishing such persons is a necessary mandate of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_27\">PC  Act,\n1988</a>.  It is difficult to justify the classification which has been made  in\nSection 6-A because the goal  of  law  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_28\">PC  Act,  1988</a>  is  to  meet\ncorruption cases with a very strong hand and all public servants are  warned\nthrough such a legislative measure that  corrupt  public  servants  have  to\nface very serious consequences.”\n\nAnd again:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">“70. Office of public power cannot be the workshop of  personal  gain.   The\nprobity in public life is of great importance.

Criminal  activities  that  result  in  disqualification  are\nrelated to various spheres pertaining to the interest of the nation,  common\ncitizenry interest, communal harmony, and  prevalence  of  good  governance.\nIt is clear that the 1951 Act lays  down  that  the  commission  of  serious\ncriminal offences renders a person ineligible to  contest  in  elections  or\ncontinue as a  representative  of  the  people.   Such  a  restriction  does\nprovide the salutary deterrent necessary to prevent criminal  elements  from\nholding public office  thereby  preserving  the  probity  of  representative\ngovernment.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">SUBMISSIONS OF THE COUNSEL\n\nIn this backdrop, the proponements put forth by Mr. Dwivedi, learned  senior\ncounsel,  who  was  appointed  as  amicus  curiae,  are  to  be  noted   and\nconsidered.  It is his submission that under the constitutional  scheme,  it\nis the right of a citizen to be governed by  a  Government  which  does  not\nhave Ministers in  the  Council  of  Ministers  with  criminal  antecedents.\nThough qualifications and disqualifications for the  Members  of  Parliament\nand Members of the State  Legislative  Assembly  or  the  State  Legislative\nCouncil are provided under the Constitution, and they  basically  relate  to\nthe  election  process  and  continuance  in  the  House  and  the   further\ndisqualifications which have been enumerated under the 1951  Act  have  been\nlegislated by the Parliament being empowered under the  specific  provisions\nof the Constitution, yet when the Ministers  are  appointed  who  constitute\nthe spectrum of collective responsibility to run the Government, a  stronger\ncriteria has to be provided for.  A Minister is appointed by  the  President\non  the  advice  of  the  Prime  Minister  as  per  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_64\">Article  75(1)</a>  of   the\nConstitution and a Minister enters  upon  his  Office  after  the  President\nadministers him oath of office and secrecy according to  the  form  set  out\nfor the said purpose in the  Third  Schedule  and,  therefore,  submits  Mr.\nDwivedi, it is the constitutional  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  Prime\nMinister not to recommend any person to be appointed as a  Minister  of  the\nCouncil of Ministers who has criminal antecedents or at least who is  facing\na criminal charge in respect of heinous or  serious  offences.   The  choice\nmade by the Prime Minister has to have its base  on  constitutional  choice,\ntradition and constitutional convention which must  reflect  the  conscience\nof the Constitution.  It is propounded by him that the same would serve  the\nspirit and core values of the Constitution, the values of  constitutionalism\nand the legitimate expectations of the citizens of this country.  The  power\nconferred on any constitutional authority under any of the Articles  of  the\nConstitution may not be circumscribed by express or obvious prohibition  but\nit cannot be said that in the absence of use of any express  phraseology  in\nthat regard, it would confer an unfettered and absolute power  or  unlimited\ndiscretion on the said constitutional  authority.   Learned  senior  counsel\nwould contend that the doctrine of implied limitation has been  accepted  as\na principle of interpretation of our  organic  and  living  Constitution  to\nmeet the requirements of the contemporaneous societal metamorphosis  and  if\nit is not applied to the language of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 75(1)</a>, the élan  vital  of  the\nConstitution would stand extinguished.  It is urged by him  that  judiciary,\nas the final arbiter  of  the  Constitution,  is  under  the  constitutional\nobligation to inject life to the words of the Constitution so that  they  do\nnot become stagnate or sterile.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_15\">In this context, Mr. Dwivedi has  commended\nus to the views of the learned Judges in <a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_66\">His  Holiness  Kesavananda  Bharati\nSripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala and  another</a>[14]  to  highlight  that  the\napplicability of the doctrine of implied limitation  has  been  accepted  by\nthis Court.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1897504\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"103003427\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"165621647\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"753943\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1792264\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"310431\" id=\"span_21\">Relying on the said principle, it is contended by him that the same  has  to\nbe read into the language of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 75(1)</a>  of  the  Constitution  to  state\nthat  the  Prime  Minister,  while  giving  advice  to  the  President   for\nappointment of a person as Minister, is not  constitutionally  permitted  to\nsuggest the name of a person who is facing a criminal  trial  and  in  whose\ncase charge/charges have been framed.  Learned senior  counsel  has  further\nsubmitted that high constitutional offices have  to  possess  “institutional\nintegrity” so that the faith of the people at large is not shaken.   He  has\nemphasised on the office of the President,  the  Governors,  Judges  of  the\nHigh Courts and of the Supreme Court of the country and the Comptroller  and\nAuditor General of India.  Such offices, as contended, are offices  of  high\npublic trust and,  therefore,  it  is  a  natural  necessity  that  in  such\nappointments, the incumbent should be of impeccable integrity and  character\nand it cannot be conceived that such a person would be involved in any  kind\nof criminal offence.  Mr. Dwivedi has made a distinction with regard to  the\neligibility of a person for becoming a  Member  of  Parliament  as  that  is\ncontrolled by  qualifications  and  disqualifications  and  the  absence  of\ndisqualifications, but to be a Minister in the Council  of  Ministers  which\nis done solely on the advice of the  Prime  Minister,  absence  of  criminal\nantecedents has to be a condition precedent.  It is canvassed  by  him  that\nwhen parliamentary democracy is a basic feature of the Constitution and  the\nCouncil  of  Ministers  exercise  all  the  powers  as  per  the  democratic\nconventions,  it  has  to  be  treated  as   an   important   constitutional\ninstitution of governance  of  the  nation  and,  therefore,  it  cannot  be\nallowed to be held by persons involved in criminal offences.  He has  <a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_68\">placed\nreliance upon</a> the authorities in Centre for <a href=\"/doc/310431/\" id=\"a_69\">PIL  and  another  v.

The\nadvice given by the Prime Minister  to  the  President  in  the  context  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_75\">Article  75(1)</a>  has  to  be  a  considered,  deliberate  and  informed  one,\nespecially taking note of the absence of criminal antecedents  and  lack  of\nintegrity.  A Minister, though holds the office during the pleasure  of  the\nPresident, yet as per the law <a href=\"/doc/1897504/\" id=\"a_76\">laid down by</a> this Court  and  the  convention,\nthe advice  of  the  Prime  Minister  binds  the  President.   However,  the\nPresident, being the Executive Head of the State, can refuse to  follow  the\nadvice,  if  there   is   constitutional   prohibition   or   constitutional\nimpropriety or real exceptional  situation  that  requires  him  to  act  to\nsustain the very base of the Constitution.   Learned  senior  counsel  would\nsubmit that the President, in exercise of  his  constitutional  prerogative,\nmay refuse to accept the advice of the Prime Minister, if he finds that  the\nname of a Member of Parliament is suggested to  become  a  Minister  who  is\nfacing a criminal charge in respect of serious offences.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"58980482\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"27274070\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"58980482\" id=\"span_25\">To  buttress  the\nsaid submission, he has drawn inspiration  from  the  decisions  in  <a href=\"/doc/58980482/\" id=\"a_77\">Samsher\nSingh v.

State of M.P. and others</a>[23] wherein  the  Governor  in  an\nexceptional  circumstance  differed  with  the  advice  of  the  Council  of\nMinisters and granted sanction for prosecution.  Emphasising on the  concept\nof constitutional trust in the Prime  Minister  which  is  inherent  in  the\nConstitution and which was a part of the Constituent Assembly  Debates,  Mr.\nDwivedi has referred to the Debates in  the  Constituent  Assembly.   It  is\nargued that a constitutional convention has to be read  into  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_82\">Article  75(1)</a>\nwhich would convey that a person  charged  with  serious  crimes  cannot  be\nappointed as a Minister, for the individual responsibility  of  the  Cabinet\nis always comprehended as a facet of  collective  responsibility.   For  the\naforesaid purpose, he has found the stimulus from  “Constitutional  Law”  by\nLoveland, “Constitutional and Administrative Law”  by  David  Polland,  Neil\nParpworth David Hughs, “Constitutional and Administrative  Law”  by  Hilaire\nBarnett (5th Edn.) and “Constitutional Practice”.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"102852\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112850760\" id=\"span_29\">Mr. Anil Kumar Jha, learned counsel who has preferred the writ  petition  on\nbehalf of the  petitioner,  supplementing  the  arguments  of  Mr.  Dwivedi,\ncontended that though the choice of the Prime Minister relating to a  person\nbeing appointed as a Minister is his constitutional  prerogative,  yet  such\nchoice cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner  being  oblivious  of  the\nhonesty, integrity and the criminal antecedents of a person who is  involved\nin serious criminal offences.  The Prime Minister, while  giving  advice  to\nthe President for appointment of a person as a Minister, is required  to  be\nguided by certain principles which  may  not  be  expressly  stated  in  the\nConstitution but he is bound by the unwritten code  pertaining  to  morality\nand philosophy encapsulated in the Preamble of  the  Constitution.   Learned\ncounsel has emphasised on the purposive interpretation of  the  Constitution\nwhich can preserve, protect and defend the Constitution  regardless  of  the\npolitical  impact.   It  is  contended  by  him  that  if  a  constitutional\nprovision is silent on a particular  subject,  this  Court  can  necessarily\nissue directions or orders by interpretative process to fill up  the  vacuum\nor void till the law  is  suitably  enacted.   The  broad  purpose  and  the\ngeneral  scheme  of  every  provision  of  the  Constitution   has   to   be\ninterpreted, regard being had to the history, objects and  result  which  it\nseeks to achieve.  Learned counsel has placed  reliance  on  <a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_83\">S.P.  Gupta  v.\nUnion of India and another</a>[24] and <a href=\"/doc/102852/\" id=\"a_84\">M. Nagaraj and others v.

It is his submission  that  <a href=\"/doc/568164/\" id=\"a_87\">Article\n84</a> specifies certain qualifications for filling up the seats of  Parliament,\nbut it does not state anything as to the character and  qualification  of  a\nperson   qualified   to   sit   in   the   Parliament.    Apart   from   the\ndisqualifications prescribed under  <a href=\"/doc/390434/\" id=\"a_88\">Article  102(i)(e)</a>  and  the  provisions\nunder the 1951 Act, there is no  other  disqualification  for  a  Member  of\nParliament to  hold  the  post  of  a  Minister.   Therefore,  the  criminal\nantecedents or any disqualification that is going to be thought of  to  hold\nthe post of a Minister after the charge  is  framed,  as  contended  by  the\npetitioner, may be in the realm of propriety but that cannot  be  read  into\nthe constitutional framework.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">Mr. Andhyarujina  has  further  submitted  that  Section  44(4)(ii)  of  the\nAustralian Constitution puts a limitation on the member of the  House  which\ntravels beyond conviction  in  a  criminal  case,  for  the  said  provision\nprovides that any person who has been convicted and is  under  sentence,  or\nsubject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under  the  law  of  the\nCommonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer, would  be\nincapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator  or  a  member  of  the\nHouse of Representatives.   Learned  counsel  has  commended  us  to  Lane’s\nCommentary on the Australian Constitution, 1986 to highlight  that  this  is\nan exceptional provision in a Constitution which disqualifies a person  from\nbeing a Member of Parliament even if he is not convicted but  likely  to  be\nsubject to a sentence for the prescribed offence,  but  in  the  absence  of\nsuch a provision in our Constitution or in law made by the  Parliament,  the\nCourt cannot introduce such an aspect on the bedrock of propriety.   Learned\ncounsel has also referred to the U.K. Representation of  Peoples  Act,  1981\nwhich provides that a person who is sentenced or ordered  to  be  imprisoned\nor detained indefinitely or for more than one year is disqualified  and  his\nelection is rendered void and the seat of such a  member  is  vacated.   Mr.\nAndhyarujina has also referred to the House  of  Commons  Library  paper  on\ndisqualification  for  membership  of  the  House  of  Commons  wherein  the\npractice is that the existence of a criminal record  may  not  disqualify  a\nperson from ministerial  office,  but  convictions  for  offences  involving\ncorruption, dishonesty, serious violence or serious sexual misconduct  would\njeopardize a person’s prospect of  a  ministerial  career.   Learned  senior\ncounsel has also drawn our attention to a publication  by  Professor  Rodney\nBrazier “Is it a Constitutional issue: Fitness for  ministerial  office”  in\nPublic Law 1994 wherein it has been stated that whether  a  criminal  record\nshould disqualify  a  person  from  membership  of  Government  is  unclear,\nhowever,  conviction  for  serious  offences  could  impede  a   ministerial\nappointment.  He has also referred to  a  passage  from  Constitutional  and\nAdministrative Law by Hilaire Barnett 4th Ed. P. 354, to  show  that  by  an\nunwritten rule of constitutional propriety, in United Kingdom, a  person  is\nunlikely to be made a Minister  if  he  has  been  convicted  of  a  serious\noffence or  even  if  he  is  facing  prosecution  for  a  serious  offence.\nSubmission of learned amicus curiae is that there is no implied  prohibition\nin our Constitution on appointment of  a  Minister  in  case  of  a  pending\nprosecution of a serious  offence  except  conviction  and,  therefore,  the\nprinciple of implied prohibition that a person who is not convicted  but  is\nbeing prosecuted or charge sheeted for a criminal offence is to be  debarred\nfrom being a Member of the Legislature and, consequently, a  Minister  would\nnot  be  attracted.   Learned  senior  counsel  would   contend   that   the\njurisprudence is based on innocence  of  the  accused  until  he  is  proved\nguilty which is in tune with <a href=\"/doc/1091639/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 14(2)</a> of the International Covenant  on\nCivil and Political Rights and it cannot be brushed aside.   Learned  amicus\ncuriae contended that in respect of certain  constitutional  officials  like\nPresident of India, Judges of courts  including  superior  courts,  Attorney\nGeneral of India, Comptroller and Auditor General of India and  Governor  of\na State, implied prohibition is implicit.  It is  urged  by  him  that  this\nCourt, while interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 75(1)</a>, cannot  introduce  the  concept  of\nrule of law to attract the principle of implied prohibition as rule  of  law\nis an elusive doctrine and it cannot form the basis of a prohibition on  the\nappointment of a Minister.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">Mr.  Andhyarujina,  while  submitting  about  the  absence  of  an   express\nconstitutional prohibition or a statutory bar founded on the  basis  of  the\n1951 Act  prescribing  conviction,  has  also  submitted  that  despite  the\nabsence of a legal  prohibition,  there  are  non-legal  requirements  of  a\nconstitutional behavior implicit in the character  of  an  appointment.   He\nhas referred to a passage from Constitutional and Administrative Law by  ECS\nWade and AW Bradley as well as the Constitutional Debates and urged  that  a\nconvention should be  developed  that  persons  facing  charge  for  serious\ncriminal offences should not be considered for appointment  as  a  Minister,\nbut the Court cannot form a legal basis for adding a prohibition for  making\nsuch an appointment justiciable in the  court  of  law  unless  there  is  a\nconstitutional prohibition or a statutory bar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">Mr. K. Parasaran, learned senior counsel, who was also requested  to  render\nassistance, has submitted that the area of election in a  democratic  set-up\nis governed by the 1951 Act and the  rules  framed  thereunder  and  in  the\npresent  mosaic  of  democracy  such  a  controversy,  in  the  absence   of\nconstitutional impediment or statutory prohibition, would  not  come  within\nthe parameters of judicial review.  It is his  proponement  that  the  Prime\nMinister, in certain  circumstances,  regard  being  had  to  the  political\nsituations, may have certain political compulsions to appoint a Minister  so\nthat the frequent elections are avoided.  It  is  his  submission  that  any\nkind of additional prohibition  under  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_91\">Article  75(1)</a>  by  way  of  judicial\ninterpretation  is  impermissible  as  the  Prime  Minister  is   the   sole\nrepository of power under the Constitution to advise  the  President  as  to\nwho should become a Minister if he is  otherwise  constitutionally  eligible\nand there is no statutory impediment.  Learned senior counsel would  contend\nthat the 1951 Act includes certain offences and specifies the  stage,  i.e.,\nconviction and, therefore, if anything is added to  it  in  respect  of  the\nstage, it would be travelling beyond the text which  would  be  contrary  to\nthe principles of statutory interpretation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">Mr. Parasaran, learned amicus curiae, has drawn a  distinction  between  the\ntwo concepts, namely, constitutional morality and  constitutional  propriety\non one hand and ethical acceptability on the other and, in that  regard,  he\nhas submitted that the advice of the Prime Minister, as has been  stated  by\nthe  framers  of  the  Constitution,  to  the  Head  of  the  Executive  for\nappointment of a Minister should conform to the standards of  constitutional\nmorality, regard being had to the constitutional  norms,  democratic  polity\nand the sanctity of democracy.  In essence, the submission of Mr.  Parasaran\nis that the framers of the Constitution have bestowed immense trust  on  the\nPrime Minister as would  be  seen  from  the  Constitutional  Debates,  and,\ntherefore, this Court  should  reiterate  the  principle  of  constitutional\ntrust and that would be a suggestive one in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_92\">Article  75(1)</a>  of  the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_30\">Mr. Paras Kuhad, learned Additional Solicitor  General,  in  his  turn,  has\ncontended that the doctrine of implied limitation has not been  accepted  in\n<a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_93\">Kesavananda Bharati</a> case by the  majority  of  Judges  and,  therefore,  the\ninterpretation put forth  by  the  learned  friend  of  the  Court  for  the\npetitioner is impermissible.  It is urged by  him  that  while  interpreting\n<a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 75(1)</a> of the  Constitution,  the  principle  of  implied  limitation\ncannot be read into it  to  curtail  the  power  of  a  high  constitutional\nfunctionary like the Prime Minister.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"494666\" id=\"span_31\">It is his further  submission  that  in  the  absence  of  a  constitutional\nprohibition  or  restriction,  nothing  should  be  engrafted  into  it   or\nimplanted.  It is put forth by him that the  submission  of  learned  amicus\ncuriae to the effect that the President can exercise his discretion  by  not\naccepting the recommendations of the Prime Minister or by not acting on  the\nadvice of the Prime Minister is contrary to  the  constitutional  norms  and\nthe parliamentary system prevalent in our country  under  the  Constitution.\nFor the aforesaid purpose, he has placed reliance on the decision in  <a href=\"/doc/494666/\" id=\"a_95\">U.N.R.\nRao v.

(1) The Chief Minister shall be appointed  by  the  Governor  and  the\nother Ministers shall be appointed by the Governor  on  the  advice  of  the\nChief Minister, and the Ministers shall hold office during the  pleasure  of\nthe Governor:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">xxx              xxx              xxx\n\n(2) The Council of  Ministers  shall  be  collectively  responsible  to  the\nLegislative Assembly of the State.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(3) Before a Minister enters upon his office, the Governor shall  administer\nto him the oaths of office and of secrecy according to  the  forms  set  out\nfor the purpose in the Third Schedule.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(4) A Minister who for any period of six consecutive months is not a  member\nof the Legislature of the State shall  at  the  expiration  of  that  period\ncease to be a Minister.”\n\nAt this juncture, it is apt to refer to the nature of oath  which  is  meant\nfor the office of a Minister.  The Third  Schedule  provides  the  forms  of\nOaths or Affirmations of the Constitution: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">“Form of oath of office for a Minister for the Union: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      “I, A.B., do swear in the name of God/ solemnly  affirm  that  I  will\nbear true faith and allegiance to  the  Constitution  of  India  as  by  law\nestablished, that I will uphold the  sovereignty  and  integrity  of  India,\nthat I  will  faithfully  and  conscientiously  discharge  my  duties  as  a\nMinister for the Union and that I will do right to all manner of  people  in\naccordance with the Constitution  and  the  law,  without  fear  or  favour,\naffection or ill-will.”\n\nThe Form of Oath for office of a Minister of State is as follows: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      “I, A.B., do swear in the name of God/ solemnly  affirm  that  I  will\nbear true faith and allegiance to  the  Constitution  of  India  as  by  law\nestablished, that I will uphold the  sovereignty  and  integrity  of  India,\nthat I  will  faithfully  and  conscientiously  discharge  my  duties  as  a\nMinister for the State of ....... and that I will do right to all manner  of\npeople in accordance with the Constitution  and  the  law  without  fear  or\nfavour, affection or ill-will.”\n\nThe form of oath of secrecy for a Minister for the Union is as follows: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">“I, A.B., do swear in the name  of  God/solemnly  affirm  that  I  will  not\ndirectly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person  or  persons  any\nmatter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall  become  known\nto me as a Minister for the Union except as may  be  required  for  the  due\ndischarge of my duties as such Minister.”\n\n      Similar is the oath of secrecy for a Minister for a  State.   We  have\nreproduced the forms pertaining to oath  as  Mr.  Dwivedi  stressed  on  the\nconcept  of  sanctity  of  oath  that  pertains   to   allegiance   to   the\nConstitution, performing of duties without fear or  favour  and  maintenance\nof secrecy.  It is urged by him that  a  person  with  criminal  antecedents\ntaking such an oath would violate the fundamental values  enshrined  in  the\nConstitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">DOCTRINE OF IMPLIED LIMITATION\n\nIt has been highlighted before us by Mr. Dwivedi,  as  noted  earlier,  that\nregard being had to the nature of office a Minister holds  in  a  democratic\nset-up under the Constitution, persons with criminal antecedents  especially\ncharged for heinous and serious offences cannot  and  should  not  hold  the\nsaid  office.   He  has  emphatically  put  forth  that   apart   from   the\nprohibitions contained in <a href=\"/doc/390434/\" id=\"a_108\">Articles 102</a> and <a href=\"/doc/139447/\" id=\"a_109\">179</a> of the Constitution  and  the\nconviction under the 1951 Act, the relevant  stage  in  trial  needs  to  be\nintroduced to the phraseology of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 75(1)</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 164(1)</a>  so\nthat the Prime Minister’s authority to give advice has to be  restricted  to\nthe extent not to advise a person with  criminal  antecedents  to  become  a\nMinister.  To substantiate the said view, he has taken aid of  the  doctrine\nof “implied limitation”.  In Kesavananda Bharati’s case,  Sikri,  CJ,  while\nexpressing his view on the doctrine  of  implied  limitation,  has  observed\nthat in a written  Constitution,  it  is  rarely  that  everything  is  said\nexpressly.  Powers and limitations are implied from necessity or the  scheme\nof the Constitution.  He has further held: -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">“282. It seems to me that reading the Preamble  the  fundamental  importance\nof the freedom  of  the  individual,  indeed  its  inalienability,  and  the\nimportance of the economic, social and political justice  mentioned  in  the\nPreamble, the importance  of  directive  principles,  the  non-inclusion  in\n<a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 368</a> of provisions like <a href=\"/doc/1205651/\" id=\"a_113\">Articles 52</a><a href=\"/doc/1597349/\" id=\"a_114\">, 53</a> and various other  provisions\nto [pic]which reference has already been  made  an  irresistible  conclusion\nemerges that it was not the intention to use the  word  “amendment”  in  the\nwidest sense.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">283. It was the common understanding that fundamental  rights  would  remain\nin substance as they are and they would not be amended out of existence.  It\nseems also  to  have  been  a  common  understanding  that  the  fundamental\nfeatures of the Constitution, namely, secularism, democracy and the  freedom\nof the individual would always subsist in the welfare state.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">284. In view of the above  reasons,  a  necessary  implication  arises  that\nthere  are  implied  limitations  on  the  power  of  Parliament  that   the\nexpression “amendment of  this  Constitution”  has  consequently  a  limited\nmeaning  in  our  Constitution  and  not  the  meaning  suggested   by   the\nrespondents.”\n\nShelat  and  Grover,  JJ.,  in  their  opinion,  while  speaking  about  the\nexecutive power of the President, have observed that although the  executive\npower of the President  is  apparently  expressed  in  unlimited  terms,  an\nimplied limitation has been placed on his power on the ground that he  is  a\nformal or constitutional head of the executive and that the  real  executive\npower vests in the Council of Ministers.  The learned Judges arrived at  the\nsaid conclusion on the basis of the implications of the  Cabinet  System  of\nGovernment so as to constitute an implied limitation on  the  power  of  the\nPresident and the Governors.  Proceeding further  as  regards  the  amending\npower  of  the  Constitution,  as  engrafted  under  <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_115\">Article  368</a>   of   the\nConstitution, said the learned Judges: -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">“583. The entire discussion from the point of view of  the  meaning  of  the\nexpression “amendment” as employed in <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 368</a> and the limitations  which\narise by implications leads to the result  that  the  amending  power  under\n<a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 368</a> is neither narrow nor unlimited. On  the  footing  on  which  we\nhave proceeded the validity of  the  24th  Amendment  can  be  sustained  if\n<a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 368</a>, as it originally stood and after the amendment, is read in  the\nway we have read it. The insertion of <a href=\"/doc/430906/\" id=\"a_119\">Articles  13(4)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/145429/\" id=\"a_120\">368(3)</a>  and  the\nother amendments made will not affect the result, namely, that the power  in\n<a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 368</a> is wide enough to permit amendment of each and every article  of\nthe Constitution by way of addition, variation or  repeal  so  long  as  its\nbasic elements are not abrogated or denuded of their identity.”\n\nHegde and  Mukherjea,  JJ.,  while  discussing  about  implied  limitations,\nopined thus: -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">“655.  Implied  limitations  on  the  powers  conferred  under   a   statute\nconstitute a general  feature  of  all  statutes.  The  position  cannot  be\ndifferent in the case of powers conferred under a Constitution.

These limitations were spelled out from  the  nature  of\nthe power conferred and from the scheme of the  Constitution.

Learned counsel for the petitioners has addressed us at  some  length\non the point that even if there are no express limitations on the  power  of\namendment, the same is subject to implied  limitations,  also  described  as\ninherent limitations. So far  as  the  concept  of  implied  limitations  is\nconcerned, it has two facets. Under the first facet,  they  are  limitations\nwhich  flow  by  necessary  implications  from  express  provisions  of  the\nConstitution. The second facet postulates limitations which must be read  in\nthe Constitution irrespective of the fact whether  they  flow  from  express\nprovisions or not because they are stated to be based  upon  certain  higher\nvalues which are very dear to the human heart and are  generally  considered\nessential traits of civilized  existence.  It  is  also  stated  that  those\nhigher  values  constitute  the  spirit  and  provide  the  scheme  of   the\nConstitution.  This  aspect  of  implied  limitations  is  linked  with  the\nexistence of natural rights and it is  stated  that  such  rights  being  of\nparamount character, no  amendment  of  Constitution  can  result  in  their\nerosion.”\n\n      Dealing with the same, the learned Judge ruled: -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">“1446. So far as the first facet is concerned regarding a  limitation  which\nflows  by  necessary  implication  from  an   express   provision   of   the\nConstitution, the concept derives its force and is founded upon a  principle\nof interpretation of statutes. In the absence of any  compelling  reason  it\nmay be  said  that  a  constitutional  provision  is  not  exempt  from  the\noperation of such a principle. I have applied this principle to <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_124\">Article  368</a>\nand despite that, I have not been able to discern in the  language  of  that\narticle or other relevant articles any implied limitation on  the  power  to\nmake amendment contained in the said article.”\n\nBe it clarified, in subsequent paragraphs, the learned Judge  expressed  the\nview that though the Parliament has been conferred the  power  of  amendment\nunder <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 368</a> of  the  Constitution,  yet  it  cannot  be  permitted  to\nincorporate  an  amendment  which  would  destroy  the  basic  structure  or\nessential feature of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1939993\" id=\"span_40\">In <a href=\"/doc/1939993/\" id=\"a_126\">Minerva Mills Ltd.

According  to  the  learned  Judge,  although   it   was\npermissible to the Parliament, in exercise of its amending power, to  effect\nchanges so as to meet the requirements of changing conditions,  it  was  not\npermissible to touch the foundation or  to  alter  the  basic  institutional\npattern. Therefore, the words “amendment of the Constitution”, in  spite  of\nthe width of their sweep and in spite of their  amplitude,  could  not  have\nthe effect of empowering the Parliament to destroy  or  abrogate  the  basic\nstructure or framework of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">12.

Coelho (Dead) by Lrs. v. State of Tamil  Nadu[39],   the  Nine-Judge\nBench, while dealing with the doctrine of implied limitation,  ruled  thus:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">“96.....In  the  four   different   opinions   six   learned   Judges   came\nsubstantially  to  the  same  conclusion.  These  Judges  read  an   implied\nlimitation on the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. Khanna,  J.\nalso opined that there was implied limitation in  the  shape  of  the  basic\nstructure doctrine  that  limits  the  power  of  Parliament  to  amend  the\nConstitution but the learned Judge upheld the 29th  Amendment  and  did  not\nsay, like the remaining six Judges, that  the  Twenty-ninth  Amendment  will\nhave to be examined by a smaller Constitution Bench to find out whether  the\nsaid amendment violated the basic structure theory or not.  This  gave  rise\nto the argument that  fundamental  rights  chapter  is  not  part  of  basic\nstructure. Khanna, J. however,  does  not  so  say  in  Kesavananda  Bharati\ncase.”\n\nFrom the aforesaid authorities, it is  luminescent  that  the  principle  of\nimplied  limitation  is  attracted   to   the   sphere   of   constitutional\ninterpretation.  The question that is required to be posed here  is  whether\ntaking recourse to this principle of interpretation, this Court can  read  a\ncategorical prohibition to the words  contained  in  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_133\">Article  75(1)</a>  of  the\nConstitution so that the Prime Minister is  constitutionally  prohibited  to\ngive advice to the President in respect of a person for becoming a  Minister\nof the Council of Ministers who is facing a criminal  trial  for  a  heinous\nand serious offence and charges have been framed against him  by  the  trial\nJudge.   Reading  such  an  implied  limitation  as  a   prohibition   would\ntantamount to adding a disqualification at a particular stage of  the  trial\nin relation of a person.  This is neither expressly stated nor is  impliedly\ndiscernible from the provision.  The  doctrine  of  implied  limitation  was\napplied to the amending power of the Constitution by the Parliament  on  the\nfundamental foundation that the identity of the original Constitution  could\nnot be amended by taking recourse to the plenary power  of  amendment  under\n<a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 368</a> of  the  Constitution.   The  essential  feature  or  the  basic\nstructure of the doctrine  was  read  into  <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_135\">Article  368</a>  to  say  that  the\nidentity or the framework of  the  Constitution  cannot  be  destroyed.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1939993\" id=\"span_45\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1939993/\" id=\"a_136\">Minerva Mills</a> case, giving example, the Court held that  by  amendment,  the\nParliament cannot damage the democratic republican  character  as  has  been\nconceived in the Constitution.  Though in <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 368</a>  of  the  Constitution\nthere was no express prohibition to  amend  the  constitutional  provisions,\nyet the Court in the aforesaid two cases ruled that certain  features  which\nare basic to the Constitution cannot be changed by way  of  amendment.   The\ninterpretative process pertained to the word  “amendment”.   Therefore,  the\nconcept of implied  limitation  was  read  into  <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_138\">Article  368</a>  to  save  the\nconstitutional  integrity  and  identity.   In  B.R.   Kapur’s   case,   the\nConstitution Bench ruled that a non-legislator can be made a Chief  Minister\nor  Minister  under  <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_139\">Article  164(1)</a>  only  if  he  has  qualifications  for\nmembership of the Legislature  prescribed  under  <a href=\"/doc/614870/\" id=\"a_140\">Article  173</a>  and  is  not\ndisqualified from the membership thereof by reason of the  disqualifications\nset out in <a href=\"/doc/1735861/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 191.</a>  Bharucha, J.

In  the  said\ncase, she was sworn in as the Chief Minister by the  Governor.   This  Court\nwas moved in by a writ of quo warranto that she was  not  eligible  to  hold\nthe post of the Chief Minister.  A submission was advanced that it  was  not\nopen to the Court to read anything into <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 164</a>,  for  a  non-legislator\ncould be sworn in as the Chief Minister, regardless  of  the  qualifications\nor disqualifications.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1939993\" id=\"span_46\">The Court placed reliance  on  Kesavananda  Bharati’s\ncase and <a href=\"/doc/1939993/\" id=\"a_149\">Minerva Mills’</a> case and opined that if a non-legislator is  made  a\nChief Minister under <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 164</a>, then he  must  satisfy  the  qualification\nfor membership of a legislator as prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/614870/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 173.</a>  A  specific\nquery was made by the Court that even when the person recommended,  was,  to\nthe  Governor’s  knowledge,  a  non-citizen  or  under-age  or  lunatic   or\ndischarged insolvent, could he be appointed as a  Chief  Minister.   It  was\nurged that he/she could only be removed by the vote of no-confidence in  the\nLegislature or at the next election.  Discarding the same, the Court  opined\nthat acceptance of such a  submission  would  invite  disaster.   The  Court\nfurther ruled that when a person is not qualified  to  become  a  Member  in\nview of <a href=\"/doc/614870/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 173</a>, he cannot  be  appointed  as  a  Chief  Minister  under\n<a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_153\">Article  164(1).</a>   Be  it  noted,  there   was   disqualification   in   the\nConstitution and under the  1951  Act  to  become  a  Member  of  the  State\nLegislature, and hence, the Court, appreciating the text and  context,  read\nthe disqualification into <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 164(1)</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">On a studied scrutiny of the ratio of the aforesaid  decisions,  we  are  of\nthe convinced opinion that when there is no disqualification  for  a  person\nagainst whom charges have been framed  in  respect  of  heinous  or  serious\noffences or offences relating to corruption  to  contest  the  election,  by\ninterpretative process,  it  is  difficult  to  read  the  prohibition  into\n<a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 75(1)</a> or, for that matter, into <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 164(1)</a> to the powers of  the\nPrime Minister or the Chief Minister in such  a  manner.   That  would  come\nwithin the criterion of eligibility  and  would  amount  to  prescribing  an\neligibility qualification and adding a disqualification which has  not  been\nstipulated in the  Constitution.   In  the  absence  of  any  constitutional\nprohibition or statutory embargo, such disqualification, in  our  considered\nopinion, cannot be  read  into  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_157\">Article  75(1)</a>  or  <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_158\">Article  164(1)</a>  of  the\nConstitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"551554\" id=\"span_48\">PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SILENCE OR ABEYANCE\n\nThe next principle that can be  thought  of  is  constitutional  silence  or\nsilence of the Constitution or constitutional abeyance.

Apart from the aforesaid  reasons,  the  arguments  by  the  appellants\ncannot be accepted in view of a  very  well-known  constitutional  doctrine,\nnamely, the  constitutional  doctrine  of  silence.  Michael  Foley  in  his\ntreatise on The Silence of Constitutions (Routledge, London  and  New  York)\nhas argued that in a Constitution “abeyances are  valuable,  therefore,  not\nin spite of their obscurity but because of it.

The learned author elaborated this concept further by  saying,  “Despite\nthe absence of any documentary or material form, these  abeyances  are  real\nand are an integral part of any Constitution.  What  remains  unwritten  and\nindeterminate can be just as much responsible for the operational  character\nand restraining quality of a Constitution as its more tangible and  codified\ncomponents.” (P. 82)”\n\nThe question that is to be posed here is whether  taking  recourse  to  this\ndoctrine for the purpose of advancing constitutional culture,  can  a  court\nread a disqualification to the already expressed disqualifications  provided\nunder the Constitution and the 1951 Act.   The  answer  has  to  be  in  the\ninevitable  negative,  for  there  are  express   provisions   stating   the\ndisqualifications  and  second,  it  would  tantamount   to   crossing   the\nboundaries of judicial review.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe  next  principle  that  we  intend  to  discuss  is  the  principle   of\nconstitutional implication.

The State of Madras</a>[46],  has  observed  that  freedom  of\nspeech and expression includes freedom of propagation of ideas.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">There is no speck of doubt that  the  Court  has  applied  the  doctrine  of\nimplication to expand the constitutional concepts, but the context in  which\nthe horizon has been expanded has to be borne in mind.   What  is  suggested\nby Mr. Dwivedi is that by taking recourse to the said principle,  the  words\nemployed in <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 75(1)</a> are to be  interpreted  to  add  a  stage  in  the\ndisqualification, i.e., framing of charges in serious and  heinous  criminal\noffences or offences relating  to  corruption.   At  this  juncture,  it  is\nseemly to state that the principle of implication is  fundamentally  founded\non rational inference of an idea from the  words  used  in  the  text.   The\nconcept  of  legitimate  deduction  is  always  recognised.   In   Melbourne\nCorporation  v  Commonwealth[47],  Dixon,  J  opined   that   constitutional\nimplication should be based on considerations which are compelling.   Mason,\nCJ,  in  Political  Advertising  Case[48],  has  ruled  that  there  can  be\nstructural implications which are ‘logically or  practically  necessary  for\nthe preservation of the integrity  of  that  structure’.    Any  proposition\nthat is arrived at taking  this  route  of  interpretation  must  find  some\nresting pillar or strength on the basis of certain words in the text or  the\nscheme of the text.  In the absence of that, it may not be  permissible  for\na Court to deduce any proposition as that would  defeat  the  legitimacy  of\nreasoning.  A proposition can be established by reading number  of  articles\ncohesively, for that will be in the domain of substantive legitimacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">Dixon, J, in Australian National Airways Pty Ltd. v Commonwealth[49],  said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">‘I do not see why we should be  fearful  about  making  implications’.   The\nsaid principle has been approved in Lamshed v Lake[50], and  thereafter,  in\nPayroll Tax Case[51].  Thus, the said principle can be taken aid of for  the\npurpose of interpreting constitutional provision  in  an  expansive  manner.\nBut, it has its own limitations.  The interpretation has to have a  base  in\nthe Constitution.  The Court cannot  re-write  a  constitutional  provision.\nIn this context, we may fruitfully refer to Kuldip Nayar’s case wherein  the\nCourt repelled the contention that a right to  vote  invariably  carries  an\nimplied term, i.e., the right to vote in secrecy.  The Court  observed  that\nwhere the Constitution thought it fit to do so, it has itself  provided  for\nelections by secret ballot e.g., in the case of election  of  the  President\nof India and the Vice-President of India.  Thereafter,  the  Court  referred\nto <a href=\"/doc/1512215/\" id=\"a_184\">Articles 55(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1519009/\" id=\"a_185\">66(1)</a> of the Constitution which provide for  elections\nof the President and the Vice-President respectively,  referring  to  voting\nby electoral colleges, consisting of  elected  Members   of  Parliament  and\nLegislative Assembly of each State for the purposes  of  the  former  office\nand Members of both Houses of Parliament for the latter office and  in  both\ncases, it was felt necessary by the framers of the Constitution  to  provide\nthat the voting  at  such  elections  shall  be  by  secret  ballot  through\ninclusion of the words “and the voting at such election shall be  by  secret\nballot”.  If the right to vote by itself implies  or  postulates  voting  in\nsecrecy,  then  <a href=\"/doc/1512215/\" id=\"a_186\">Articles  55(3)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1519009/\" id=\"a_187\">66(1)</a>  would  not  have  required  the\ninclusion of such words.  The necessity for including the said condition  in\nthe said articles shows that “secret ballot” is not always implied.   It  is\nnot  incorporated  in  the  concept  of  voting  by  necessary  implication.\nThereafter, the Court opined: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">“421. It follows that for “secret  ballot”  to  be  the  norm,  it  must  be\nexpressly so provided.  To read into <a href=\"/doc/622840/\" id=\"a_188\">Article  80(4)</a>  the  requirement  of  a\nsecret ballot would be to read the words “and the voting  at  such  election\nshall be by secret ballot” into the provision.  To do so  would  be  against\nevery principle of constitutional and statutory construction.”\n\nThus analysed, it is not possible to accept the submission  of  Mr.  Dwivedi\nthat while interpreting the words “advice of  the  Prime  Minister”  it  can\nlegitimately be inferred that there is a prohibition to think  of  a  person\nas a Minister if charges have been framed against him in respect of  heinous\nand serious offences including corruption cases under the criminal law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">OTHER RELEVANT  CONSTITUTIONAL  CONCEPTS  –  CONSTITUTIONAL  MORALITY,  GOOD\nGOVERNANCE AND CONSTITUTIONAL TRUST\n\nThough we have not accepted the inspired arguments of Mr. Dwivedi to  add  a\ndisqualification  pertaining  to  the  stage  into  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_189\">Article  75(1)</a>  of   the\nConstitution, yet we cannot be oblivious  of  the  three  concepts,  namely,\nconstitutional morality, good governance and constitutional trust.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">The Constitution of India  is  a  living  instrument  with  capabilities  of\nenormous dynamism.  It is a Constitution made  for  a  progressive  society.\nWorking of such a Constitution depends upon  the  prevalent  atmosphere  and\nconditions.   Dr.  Ambedkar  had,  throughout  the  Debate,  felt  that  the\nConstitution can live and grow on the bedrock  of  constitutional  morality.\nSpeaking on the same, he said: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">“Constitutional  morality  is  not  a  natural  sentiment.   It  has  to  be\ncultivated.   We  must  realize  that  our  people  are  yet  to  learn  it.\nDemocracy in India is only a  top-dressing  on  an  Indian  soil,  which  is\nessentially undemocratic.[52]”\n\n\n\nThe principle of constitutional morality basically means to bow down to  the\nnorms of the Constitution and not to act in  a  manner  which  would  become\nviolative of the rule of law  or  reflectible  of  action  in  an  arbitrary\nmanner. It actually works at the fulcrum and  guides  as  a  laser  beam  in\ninstitution building.  The  traditions  and  conventions  have  to  grow  to\nsustain the value of such a morality.  The  democratic  values  survive  and\nbecome successful where the people at large  and  the  persons-in-charge  of\nthe  institution  are  strictly  guided  by  the  constitutional  parameters\nwithout paving the path of deviancy and reflecting  in  action  the  primary\nconcern   to   maintain   institutional   integrity   and   the    requisite\nconstitutional restraints.  Commitment to the Constitution  is  a  facet  of\nconstitutional morality.  In this context, the following  passage  would  be\napt to be reproduced: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">“If men were angels, no government would be necessary.  If  angels  were  to\ngovern men, neither external nor internal controls on  government  would  be\nnecessary.  In framing a government which is to be administered by men  over\nmen,  the  great  difficulty  lies  in  this:  you  must  first  enable  the\ngovernment to control the governed; and in  the  next  place  oblige  it  to\ncontrol itself.  A dependence on  the  people  is,  no  doubt,  the  primary\ncontrol on the government; but experience has taught mankind  the  necessity\nof auxiliary precautions.[53]”\n\n\nRegard being had to the aforesaid concept, it would not be out of  place  to\nstate that institutional respectability and adoption of precautions for  the\nsustenance  of  constitutional  values  would  include  reverence  for   the\nconstitutional structure.  It is always profitable to  remember  the  famous\nline of Laurence H. Tribe that a Constitution is “written in  blood,  rather\nthan ink”[54].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">GOOD GOVERNANCE\n\nHaving stated about the aspect  of  constitutional  morality,  we  presently\nproceed to deal with the doctrine of good governance.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1499181\" id=\"span_53\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1499181/\" id=\"a_190\">A.

The maxim Salus Populi Suprema Lex, has not only to be  kept  in\nview but also has to be revered.  The faith of the  people  is  embedded  in\nthe root of the idea of good governance which means reverence for  citizenry\nrights,  respect  for  Fundamental  Rights  and  statutory  rights  in   any\ngovernmental  action,  deference  for   unwritten   constitutional   values,\nveneration for institutional integrity, and  inculcation  of  accountability\nto the collective at large.  It also conveys that the  decisions  are  taken\nby the decision making authority with  solemn  sincerity  and  policies  are\nframed keeping in view the welfare of the people, and  including  all  in  a\nhomogeneous compartment.  The concept of good governance is not  an  Utopian\nconception or an  abstraction.   It  has  been  the  demand  of  the  polity\nwherever democracy is nourished.  The growth of democracy is dependant  upon\ngood governance in reality and the aspiration of  the  people  basically  is\nthat the administration is carried out by people  with  responsibility  with\nservice orientation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">CONSTITUTIONAL TRUST\n\nHaving stated about good governance, we  shall  proceed  to  deal  with  the\ndoctrine of “constitutional  trust”.   The  issue  of  constitutional  trust\narises in the context of the debate in the  Constituent  Assembly  that  had\ntaken place pertaining to the recommendation for appointment of  a  Minister\nto the Council of Ministers.  Responding to the proposal for  the  amendment\nsuggested  by  Prof.  K.T.  Shah  with  regard  to  the  introduction  of  a\ndisqualification of  a  convicted  person  becoming  a  Minister,  Dr.  B.R.\nAmbedkar had replied: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">“His last proposition is that no person who is convicted may be appointed  a\nMinister of the State.  Well, so far as his intention is  concerned,  it  is\nno doubt very laudable and I do not think any Member  of  this  House  would\nlike to differ from him on that proposition.   But  the  whole  question  is\nthis  whether   we   should   introduce   all   these   qualifications   and\ndisqualifications in the Constitution itself.  Is it not  desirable,  is  it\nnot sufficient that we should trust the Prime Minister, the Legislature  and\nthe public at large watching the actions of the Ministers  and  the  actions\nof the Legislature to see that no such infamous thing is done by  either  of\nthem?  I think this is a case which may eminently be left to the  good-sense\nof the Prime Minister and to the good sense  of  the  Legislature  with  the\ngeneral public holding a watching brief upon them.   I  therefore  say  that\nthese amendments are unnecessary.”\n\n                                                         [Emphasis supplied]\n\nThe trust reposed in the Prime  Minister  is  based  on  his  constitutional\nstatus.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1318432\" id=\"span_58\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1318432/\" id=\"a_195\">Rai  Sahib  Ram  Jawaya  Kapur  and  others  v.

THE INIDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY OF MINISTERS\n\nThe individual responsibility of  ministers  illustrates  further  Professor\nMunro’s  continuum  theory.   Ministers  are  individually  accountable  for\ntheir own private conduct, the general  running  of  their  departments  and\nacts done, or omitted to be done, by their  civil  servants;  responsibility\nin the first two cases is clearer than in others.  A  minister  involved  in\nsexual or financial scandals  particularly  those  having  implications  for\nnational security, is likely to have to resign because his  activities  will\nso attract the attention of the press that he will  be  no  longer  able  to\ncarry out departmental duties.”\n\nIn Constitutional &amp; Administrative Law[64], Hilaire Barnett,  while  dealing\nwith the conduct of Ministers, referred to the  Nolan  Committee[65]   which\nhad endorsed the view that:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">“public is  entitled  to  expect  very  high  standards  of  behaviour  from\nministers, as they have profound influence over the daily lives of us all”\n\nIn Constitutional Practice[66], Rodney Brazier  has opined:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">“...a higher standard of private conduct is required of  Ministers  than  of\nothers in public life, a major reason for this today being that the  popular\npress and the investigative journalism of its more serious rivals will  make\na wayward Minister’s continuance in office impossible.”\n\n\nCenturies back what Edmund Burke had said needs to be recapitulated: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">“All persons possessing a  position  of  power  ought  to  be  strongly  and\nawfully impressed with an idea that they act in trust  and  are  to  account\nfor their conduct in that trust to the one great Master, Author and  Founder\nof Society.”\n\n\nThis Court, in re <a href=\"/doc/210155/\" id=\"a_201\">Art.  143</a>,  Constitution  of  India  and  Delhi  Laws  Act\n(1912)[67], opined that the doctrine  of constitutional trust is  applicable\nto  our  Constitution  since  it  lays  the  foundation  of   representative\ndemocracy.  The  Court  further  ruled  that  accordingly,  the  Legislature\ncannot be permitted to abdicate its primary duty,  viz.  to  determine  what\nthe law shall be.  Though it was  stated  in  the  context  of  exercise  of\nlegislative power, yet the same has signification in  the  present  context,\nfor in a representative democracy, the doctrine of constitutional trust  has\nto be envisaged in every high constitutional functionary.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">ANALYSIS OF THE TERM “ADVICE’ UNDER <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_202\">ARTICLE 75 (1)</a>\n\nHaving  dealt  with  the  concepts  of  “constitutional   morality”,   “good\ngovernance”, “constitutional trust” and the special status  enjoyed  by  the\nPrime Minister under the scheme of the  Constitution,  we  are  required  to\nappreciate and interpret the words “on the advice of the Prime Minister”  in\nthe backdrop of the aforestated concepts.  As per  the  New  Shorter  Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, one of the meanings of the word “advice” is “the way  in\nwhich a matter is looked  at;  opinion;  judgment”.   As  per  P.  Ramanatha\nAiyer’s Law Lexicon, 2nd Edition, one of the  meanings  given  to  the  word\n“advice” is “counsel given or an opinion  expressed  as  to  the  wisdom  of\nfuture conduct” (Abbot L.  Dict.).   In  Webster  Comprehensive  Dictionary,\nInternational Edition, one of the meanings given to  the  word  “advice”  is\n“encouragement  or  dissuasion;  counsel;  suggestion”.   Thus,   the   word\n“advice” conveys formation of an opinion. The said formation of  an  opinion\nby the Prime Minister in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 75(1)</a> is  expressed  by  the\nuse of the said word because of the trust  reposed  in  the  Prime  Minister\nunder the Constitution.  To put it  differently,  it  is  a  “constitutional\nadvice”.  The repose of faith in the Prime Minister  by  the  entire  nation\nunder the Constitution has expectations of good governance which is  carried\non by Ministers of his choice.  It is also expected  that  the  persons  who\nare chosen as Ministers do not have criminal antecedents, especially  facing\ntrial in respect  of  serious  or  heinous  criminal  offences  or  offences\npertaining to corruption.  There can be  no  dispute  over  the  proposition\nthat unless a person is convicted, he is presumed to  be  innocent  but  the\npresumption of innocence in criminal jurisprudence is  something  altogether\ndifferent, and not to be considered for being chosen as a  Minister  to  the\nCouncil of Ministers because  framing  of  charge  in  a  criminal  case  is\ntotally  another  thing.   Framing  of  charge  in  a  trial  has  its   own\nsignificance and consequence.  Setting  the  criminal  law  into  motion  by\nlodging of an FIR or charge sheet being filed by  the  investigating  agency\nis in the sphere of investigation.  Framing of charge is a judicial  act  by\nan experienced judicial mind.  As the Debates in  the  Constituent  Assembly\nwould show, after due deliberation, they thought it appropriate to leave  it\nto the wisdom of the Prime Minister because of the intrinsic  faith  in  the\nPrime Minister.  At the time of framing  of  the  Constitution,  the  debate\npertained to conviction. With the change of time, the entire  complexion  in\nthe political arena as well as in other areas has changed.  This  Court,  on\nnumber of occasions, as pointed out hereinbefore,  has  taken  note  of  the\nprevalence and continuous growth of  criminalization  in  politics  and  the\nentrenchment of corruption at many a level.   In  a  democracy,  the  people\nnever intend to be governed by persons who have criminal antecedents.   This\nis not merely a hope and aspiration  of  citizenry  but  the  idea  is  also\nengrained in apposite executive governance.  It would be  apt  to  say  that\nwhen a country is governed by  a  Constitution,  apart  from  constitutional\nprovisions,  and  principles  constitutional  morality  and  trust,  certain\nconventions are adopted and grown.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"753224\" id=\"span_61\">In  Supreme  Court  <a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_204\">Advocates-on-Record\nAssociation</a> (supra), the Court reproduced a passage from K.C.

To put  this  in\nslightly different words, it may be  said  that  conventions  are  non-legal\nrules regulating the way in which legal rules shall be applied.”\n\nI. Jennings, in The Law and the Constitution[68], stated that  a  convention\nexists not only due to its non-enforceability but also because  there  is  a\nreason for the rule.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">I. Lovehead, in Constitutional Law – A Critical Introduction[69],  has  said\nthat the conventions provide a moral framework within which  the  government\nministers or the monarch should exercise non-justiciable  legal  powers  and\nregulate  relations  between  the  government   and   other   constitutional\nauthorities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">In the Constituent Assembly Debates, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, in his  speech  as\nPresident of the Constituent Assembly, while moving for the adoption of  the\nConstitution of India, had observed: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">“Many things  which  cannot  be  written  in  a  Constitution  are  done  by\nconventions.  Let me hope that we shall show those  capacities  and  develop\nthose conventions.”\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFrom the aforesaid, it becomes graphically vivid  that  the  Prime  Minister\nhas been regarded as the repository of constitutional  trust.   The  use  of\nthe words “on the advice  of  the  Prime  Minister”  cannot  be  allowed  to\noperate in a vacuum to lose their significance.  There can be  no  scintilla\nof doubt that the Prime Minister’s advice is binding on  the  President  for\nthe appointment of a person as  a  Minister  to  the  Council  of  Ministers\nunless the said person is disqualified under  the  Constitution  to  contest\nthe election or under the 1951 Act, as has been held in B.R.  Kapur’s  case.\nThat is in the realm of disqualification.  But, a pregnant  one,  the  trust\nreposed in a high constitutional functionary like the Prime  Minister  under\nthe Constitution does not end there.   That  the  Prime  Minister  would  be\ngiving apposite advice to  the  President  is  a  legitimate  constitutional\nexpectation, for it is a paramount constitutional concern.  In a  controlled\nConstitution  like  ours,  the  Prime  Minister  is  expected  to  act  with\nconstitutional responsibility  as  a  consequence  of  which  the  cherished\nvalues of democracy and established norms of good governance  get  condignly\nfructified.  The framers of the Constitution left many a thing unwritten  by\nreposing  immense  trust  in  the  Prime  Minister.   The  scheme   of   the\nConstitution suggests that there has to be an  emergence  of  constitutional\ngovernance which  would  gradually  grow  to  give  rise  to  constitutional\nrenaissance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">87.   It is worthy to note that the Council of Ministers has the  collective\nresponsibility to sustain the integrity and  purity  of  the  constitutional\nstructure.  That is why the Prime  Minister  enjoys  a  great  magnitude  of\nconstitutional power.  Therefore, the responsibility is more,  regard  being\nhad to the  instillation  of  trust,  a  constitutional  one.   It  is  also\nexpected that the Prime Minster should act in the interest of  the  national\npolity of the nation-state.   He  has  to  bear  in  mind  that  unwarranted\nelements or persons who are facing charge in certain  category  of  offences\nmay thwart or hinder the canons of constitutional morality or principles  of\ngood governance and eventually diminish the constitutional trust.   We  have\nalready held that prohibition cannot be brought in within  the  province  of\n‘advice’  but  indubitably,  the  concepts,  especially  the  constitutional\ntrust, can be allowed to be perceived in the act of such advice.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">Thus,  while  interpreting  <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_205\">Article  75(1)</a>,  definitely  a  disqualification\ncannot be added.  However, it can always be  legitimately  expected,  regard\nbeing had to the role of a Minister in the Council of Ministers and  keeping\nin view the sanctity of oath he takes, the Prime Minister, while  living  up\nto the trust reposed in him, would  consider  not  choosing  a  person  with\ncriminal antecedents against whom charges have been framed  for  heinous  or\nserious criminal offences or charges of corruption to become a  Minister  of\nthe Council of Ministers.  This is what the Constitution suggests  and  that\nis the constitutional expectation from the Prime Minister.  Rest has  to  be\nleft to the wisdom of the Prime Minister.   We  say  nothing  more,  nothing\nless.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">At this stage, we must hasten to  add  what  we  have  said  for  the  Prime\nMinister is wholly applicable to the Chief Minister,  regard  being  had  to\nthe language employed in <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_206\">Article 164(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">Before  parting  with  the  case,  we  must  express  our   unreserved   and\nuninhibited appreciation for the assistance rendered by Mr. Rakesh  Dwivedi,\nMr. Andhyarjina and Mr. Parasaran, learned senior counsel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">The writ petition is disposed of accordingly without any order as to costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                              ........................................C.J.I.\n                                                                [R.M.

While I agree with the draft judgment of my  learned  brother  Justice\nDipak Misra, I find it necessary to express my view on the issues raised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">2.    The question in the amended writ petition filed under  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_207\">Article  32</a>  of\nthe Constitution is rather narrow, but the  submissions  were  quite  broad-\nbased.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">3.    Two substantive reliefs have been claimed in the  writ  petition.  The\nfirst relief is for a declaration that the appointment of Respondent Nos.  3\nto 7 as Ministers in the Government of India is  unconstitutional.  This  is\nbased, inter alia, on the averment that  these  respondents  have  ‘criminal\nantecedents’. Subsequently by an order passed  on  24th  March,  2006  these\nrespondents (along with respondent No. 2) were deleted  from  the  array  of\nparties since the broad question before this Court was “about  the  legality\nof the  persons  with  criminal  background  and/or  charged  with  offences\ninvolving moral turpitude being appointed as ministers in Central and  State\nGovernments.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">4.    As far as the first substantive relief is concerned,  the  expressions\n‘criminal  background’  and  ‘criminal  antecedents’  are  extremely  vague.\nNevertheless the  legal  position  on  the  appointment  of  a  Minister  is\ndiscussed hereafter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">5.     The  second  substantive  relief  is  for  the  framing  of  possible\nguidelines for the appointment  of  a  Minister  in  the  Central  or  State\nGovernment. It is not  clear  who  should  frame  the  possible  guidelines,\nperhaps this court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">6.    As far as this substantive relief is concerned,  it  is  entirely  for\nthe appropriate Legislature to decide whether guidelines are  necessary,  as\nprayed for, and the frame of such guidelines. No direction  is  required  to\nbe given on this subject.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">7.    For the sake of convenience, reference is made only  to  the  relevant\nArticles of the Constitution and the law relating  to  the  appointment  and\ncontinuance of a Minister in the  Central  Government.  The  discussion,  of\ncourse, would relate to both  a  Minister  in  the  Central  Government  and\nmutatis mutandis in the State Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">Qualifications and disqualifications for being a legislator\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">8.    <a href=\"/doc/568164/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 84</a> of the Constitution negatively provides  the  qualification\nfor membership of Parliament. This Article is  quite  simple  and  reads  as\nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">“84. Qualification for membership of Parliament. - A  person  shall  not  be\nqualified to be chosen to fill a seat in Parliament unless he –\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">(a) is a citizen of India, and  makes  and  subscribes  before  some  person\nauthorized in that behalf by the Election Commission an oath or  affirmation\naccording to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">(b) is, in the case of a seat in  the  Council  of  States,  not  less  than\nthirty years of age and, in the case of a seat in the House of  the  People,\nnot less than twenty-five years of age; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">(c) possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that  behalf\nby or under any law made by Parliament.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">9.    The qualifications postulated by clause (c) of  <a href=\"/doc/568164/\" id=\"a_209\">Article  84</a>  have  not\nyet been prescribed by law by Parliament.   In this  context,  it  is  worth\nquoting the President of the Constituent Assembly Dr. Rajendra  Prasad,  who\nsaid on 26th November, 1949, before formally putting  the  motion  moved  by\nDr. Ambedkar to vote, as follows:[70]\n“There are only two regrets which I must share with the honourable  Members.\nI would have liked to have some qualifications laid down for members of  the\nLegislatures.  It  is  anomalous   that   we   should   insist   upon   high\nqualifications for those who administer or help  in  administering  the  law\nbut none for those who made it except that they are  elected.  A  law  giver\nrequires intellectual equipment but even more than that capacity to  take  a\nbalanced view of things to act independently and above all  to  be  true  to\nthose fundamental things of life – in one word – to  have  character  (Hear,\nhear). It is not possible to devise any yardstick for  measuring  the  moral\nqualities of a man and so long as that is  not  possible,  our  Constitution\nwill remain defective. The other regret is that we have  not  been  able  to\ndraw up our first Constitution of a free Bharat in an Indian  language.  The\ndifficulties in both cases were practical  and  proved  insurmountable.  But\nthat does not make the regret any the less poignant.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">10.   Hopefully, Parliament may take action on the views  expressed  by  Dr.\nRajendra Prasad, the first President of our Republic.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">11.   <a href=\"/doc/390434/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 102</a> provides the disqualifications for  membership  of  either\nHouse of Parliament. This Article too is quite  simple  and  straightforward\nand reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">“102.  Disqualifications  for  membership.  -  (1)   A   person   shall   be\ndisqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member  of  either  House\nof Parliament—\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">(a) if he holds any office of profit under the Government of  India  or  the\nGovernment of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by  law\nnot to disqualify its holder;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">(b) if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">(c) if he is an undischarged insolvent;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">(d) if he is not a  citizen  of  India,  or  has  voluntarily  acquired  the\ncitizenship  of  a  foreign  State,  or  is  under  any  acknowledgement  of\nallegiance or adherence to a foreign State;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">(e) if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">Explanation. - For the purposes of this clause a person shall not be  deemed\nto hold an office of profit under the Government of India or the  Government\nof any State by reason only that he is a Minister either for  the  Union  or\nfor such State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">(2) A person shall be disqualified for being a member  of  either  House  of\nParliament if he is so disqualified under the Tenth Schedule.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">12.   In S.R. Chaudhuri[71] the following question arose for  consideration:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">Can a non-member, who  fails  to  get  elected  during  the  period  of  six\nconsecutive months, after he is appointed as a Minister or while a  Minister\nhas ceased to be a legislator, be reappointed as a Minister,  without  being\nelected  to  the  Legislature  after  the  expiry  of  the  period  of   six\nconsecutive months? This question arose in the context  of  <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_211\">Article  164</a>  of\nthe Constitution[72] and is mentioned here since one of  the  issues  raised\nduring  submissions  related  to  the  permissibility  of  reading   implied\nlimitations in the Constitution. It was submitted that  implied  limitations\ncan be read into the Constitution and this is an appropriate case  in  which\nthis Court should read  an  implied  limitation  in  the  appointment  of  a\nMinister in the Government of India, the implied  limitation  being  that  a\nperson with criminal antecedents or a  criminal  background  should  not  be\nappointed a Minister.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">13.   In S.R. Chaudhuri this Court examined the law in England,  Canada  and\nAustralia and by reading an implied limitation,  answered  the  question  in\nthe negative. It was held that a non-elected person may be  appointed  as  a\nMinister, but only for a period  of  six  months.  During  that  period  the\nMinister would either have to get elected to the Legislature or quit his  or\nher position. That person cannot again be appointed  as  a  Minister  unless\nelected. It was said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">“32. Thus, we find from the positions prevailing in England,  Australia  and\nCanada that the essentials of a system of  representative  government,  like\nthe one we have in our  country,  are  that  invariably  all  Ministers  are\nchosen out of the members of the Legislature and only in rare cases, a  non-\nmember is appointed as a Minister, who must  get  himself  returned  to  the\nLegislature by direct or indirect election within a short period. He  cannot\nbe permitted to continue in office indefinitely unless he  gets  elected  in\nthe meanwhile.  The  scheme  of  <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_212\">Article  164</a>  of  the  Constitution  is  no\ndifferent, except that the period of grace during which the  non-member  may\nget elected has been fixed as “six consecutive months”,  from  the  date  of\nhis appointment. (In Canada he must get elected quickly  and  in  Australia,\nwithin three months.) The framers of  the  Constitution  did  not  visualise\nthat a non-legislator can be repeatedly appointed as a Minister for  a  term\nof six months each time, without  getting  elected  because  such  a  course\nstrikes at the very root of parliamentary democracy.  According  to  learned\ncounsel for the respondent, there is no bar to this course being adopted  on\nthe “plain language of the article”, which  does  not  “expressly”  prohibit\nreappointment of the  Minister,  without  being  elected,  even  repeatedly,\nduring the term  of  the  same  Legislative  Assembly.  We  cannot  persuade\nourselves to agree.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">“33.  Constitutional  provisions  are  required   to   be   understood   and\ninterpreted with an object-oriented approach. A  Constitution  must  not  be\nconstrued in a narrow and pedantic sense. The words used may be  general  in\nterms but, their full  import  and  true  meaning,  has  to  be  appreciated\nconsidering the true context in which the same  are  used  and  the  purpose\nwhich they seek to achieve. Debates in the Constituent Assembly referred  to\nin an earlier part of this judgment clearly  indicate  that  a  non-member’s\ninclusion in the Cabinet was considered to be  a  “privilege”  that  extends\nonly for six months, during  which  period  the  member  must  get  elected,\notherwise he would cease to be a Minister. It is  a  settled  position  that\ndebates in the Constituent  Assembly  may  be  relied  upon  as  an  aid  to\ninterpret a constitutional provision because  it  is  the  function  of  the\ncourt to find out the intention of the framers of the Constitution. We  must\nremember that a Constitution is not just a document in solemn  form,  but  a\nliving framework for the Government of the people  exhibiting  a  sufficient\ndegree of cohesion and its successful working depends  upon  the  democratic\nspirit underlying it being respected in letter and in  spirit.  The  debates\nclearly indicate the “privilege” to extend “only” for six months.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">14.   An implied limitation in the Constitution  was  also  read  in  B.  R.\nKapur.[73] In that case, the second respondent  was  not  even  eligible  to\nbecome a legislator (having earned a disqualification  under  <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_213\">Section  8</a>  of\nthe Representation of the People Act, 1951) and therefore  the  question  of\ngetting elected to  the  State  Legislature  did  not  arise.  Nevertheless,\nhaving been projected as the Chief  Ministerial  nominee  of  the  political\nparty that obtained a majority in the elections,  she  was  elected  as  its\nleader and appointed as the  Chief  Minister  of  the  State.  The  question\nbefore this Court was:  Whether  a  person  who  has  been  convicted  of  a\ncriminal offence and whose conviction has not been suspended pending  appeal\ncan be sworn in and can continue to function as  the  Chief  Minister  of  a\nState. Reliance was placed on the plain  language  of  <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_214\">Article  164</a>  of  the\nConstitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">15.   Answering the question in the negative, this Court held  in  paragraph\n30 of the Report:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">“We hold, therefore, that a non-legislator can be made a Chief  Minister  or\nMinister under <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 164</a> only if he has the qualifications for  membership\nof the Legislature prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/614870/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 173</a> and is  not  disqualified  from\nthe membership thereof  by  reason  of  the  disqualifications  set  out  in\nArticle 191.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">16.   This was reiterated by this Court in paragraph 45  of  the  Report  in\nthe following words:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">“Our conclusion, therefore,  is  that  on  the  date  on  which  the  second\nrespondent was sworn in as Chief Minister she was  disqualified,  by  reason\nof her convictions under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_217\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> and the  sentences\nof imprisonment of not less than two years, for becoming  a  member  of  the\nLegislature under <a href=\"/doc/33495506/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 8(3)</a> of the Representation of the People Act.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">17.   Finally, in paragraphs 50 and 51 of the Report, this Court held:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">“We are in no doubt at all that if the Governor is  asked  by  the  majority\nparty in the Legislature to appoint as the Chief Minister a  person  who  is\nnot qualified to be a member of the Legislature or who  is  disqualified  to\nbe such, the Governor must, having due regard to the  Constitution  and  the\nlaws, to which he is subject, decline, and the  exercise  of  discretion  by\nhim in this regard cannot be called in question.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">51. If perchance, for whatever reason, the Governor does  appoint  as  Chief\nMinister a person who is not qualified to be a member of the Legislature  or\nwho is  disqualified  to  be  such,  the  appointment  is  contrary  to  the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 164</a> of the Constitution, as we  have  interpreted  it,\nand  the  authority  of  the  appointee  to  hold  the  appointment  can  be\nchallenged in quo warranto proceedings.  That  the  Governor  has  made  the\nappointment does not give  the  appointee  any  higher  right  to  hold  the\nappointment. If the appointment is contrary to constitutional provisions  it\nwill be struck down. The submission to the contrary  -  unsupported  by  any\nauthority - must be rejected.”\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">18.   Therefore, two implied limitations were  read  into  the  Constitution\nwith regard to the  appointment  of  an  unelected  person  as  a  Minister.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">Firstly, the Minister cannot continue as a Minister beyond a period  of  six\nmonths without  getting  elected,  nor  can  such  a  person  be  repeatedly\nappointed as a Minister. Secondly,  the  person  should  not  be  under  any\ndisqualification for being  appointed  as  a  legislator.  If  a  person  is\ndisqualified from being a legislator, he or she cannot  be  appointed  as  a\nMinister.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">19.   Implied limitations  to  the  Constitution  were  also  read  in  B.P.\nSinghal.[74] In that case, an implied limitation was read into the  pleasure\ndoctrine concerning the removal of the Governor of a State by the  President\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/227057/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 156</a> of the Constitution. It was held that  the  pleasure\ndoctrine as originally envisaged in England gave  unfettered  power  to  the\nauthority at whose pleasure a person held  an  office.  However,  where  the\nrule of law prevails, the  “fundamentals  of  constitutionalism”  cannot  be\nignored, meaning thereby that the  pleasure  doctrine  does  not  enable  an\nunfettered discretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or  capriciously.  It\ndoes not dispense with the need for a cause for withdrawal of the  pleasure,\nwhich can only be for valid reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">20.   Similarly, in Salil Sabhlok[75] integrity and competence were read  as\nimplied in the appointment of the Chairperson of the  State  Public  Service\nCommission. It was held in paragraph 45 of the Report as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">“I have already held that it is for  the  Governor  who  is  the  appointing\nauthority under <a href=\"/doc/317644/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 316</a> of the Constitution to lay  down  the  procedure\nfor  appointment  of  the  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Public   Service\nCommission, but this is not to say that in  the  absence  of  any  procedure\n<a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_222\">laid down by</a> the Governor for appointment of Chairman  and  Members  of  the\nPublic Service Commission under <a href=\"/doc/317644/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 316</a> of the Constitution,  the  State\nGovernment would have absolute discretion in selecting  and  appointing  any\nperson as the Chairman of the State Public Service Commission. Even where  a\nprocedure has not  been  <a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_224\">laid  down  by</a>  the  Governor  for  appointment  of\nChairman and Members of the Public Service Commission, the State  Government\nhas to select only persons with integrity and competence for appointment  as\nChairman of the Public Service Commission, because the discretion vested  in\nthe State Government under <a href=\"/doc/317644/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 316</a>  of  the  Constitution  is  impliedly\nlimited by the purposes for which the discretion is vested and the  purposes\nare discernible  from  the  functions  of  the  Public  Service  Commissions\nenumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1723820/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 320</a> of the Constitution.

Thereafter in paragraph 99 of the Report, it was said:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">“While it is difficult to summarise the indicators <a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_229\">laid down by</a> this  Court,\nit is possible to say that the two  most  important  requirements  are  that\npersonally the Chairperson  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  should  be\nbeyond reproach and his or her appointment should inspire  confidence  among\nthe people in the  institution.  The  first  “quality”  can  be  ascertained\nthrough a meaningful deliberative process, while the  second  “quality”  can\nbe determined by taking into  account  the  constitutional,  functional  and\ninstitutional requirements necessary for the appointment.”\n\nConclusions on the first relief\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">22.   Therefore, the position as it stands today is this:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">To  become  a  Member  of  Parliament,   a   person   should   possess   the\nqualifications mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/568164/\" id=\"a_230\">Article 84</a> of the Constitution;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">To become a Member of Parliament, a person should  not  suffer  any  of  the\ndisqualifications mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/390434/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 102</a> of the Constitution;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">The Constitution does  not  provide  for  any  limitation  in  a  Member  of\nParliament becoming a Minister, but certain implied  limitations  have  been\nread into the Constitution by decisions rendered by this Court regarding  an\nunelected person becoming a Minister;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">One implied limitation read into the  Constitution  is  that  a  person  not\nelected to Parliament can nevertheless be appointed  as  a  Minister  for  a\nperiod of six months;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">Another implied limitation read into the  Constitution   is  that  though  a\nperson can be appointed as a Minister for a period of six months, he or  she\ncannot repeatedly be so appointed;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">Yet another implied limitation read into the Constitution is that  a  person\notherwise not  qualified  to  be  elected  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  or\ndisqualified from being so elected cannot be appointed as a Minister;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">In other words, any person, not subject  to  any  disqualification,  can  be\nappointed a Minister in the Central Government.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">Given this position in law, is  it  necessary  to  read  any  other  implied\nlimitation in the Constitution concerning the appointment of a person  as  a\nMinister in the Government of India, particularly any implied limitation  on\nthe appointment of a person with a criminal background  or  having  criminal\nantecedents?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">Issue of criminal antecedents\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">23.   The expression ‘criminal  antecedents’  or  ‘criminal  background’  is\nextremely vague and incapable of any precise definition. Does it refer to  a\nperson accused (but not charged or convicted) of  an  offence  or  a  person\ncharged (but not convicted) of an offence or only a person convicted  of  an\noffence? No clear answer was made available to this  question,  particularly\nin the context of the presumption  of  innocence  that  is  central  to  our\ncriminal jurisprudence. Therefore,  to  say  that  a  person  with  criminal\nantecedents or a  criminal  background  ought  not  to  be  elected  to  the\nLegislature or appointed a Minister in the Central Government is  really  to\nconvey an imprecise view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">24.   The law does not hold a person guilty or deem or brand a person  as  a\ncriminal only because an allegation is made against that  person  of  having\ncommitted a criminal offence  –  be  it  in  the  form  of  an  off-the-cuff\nallegation or an allegation in the form of a First Information Report  or  a\ncomplaint or an accusation in a  final  report  under  <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_232\">Section  173</a>  of  the\nCriminal Procedure Code or even on  charges  being  framed  by  a  competent\nCourt. The reason for this is fundamental  to  criminal  jurisprudence,  the\nrule of law  and  is  quite  simple,  although  it  is  often  forgotten  or\noverlooked – a person is innocent until proven guilty. This would  apply  to\na person accused of one or multiple offences. At law, he or  she  is  not  a\ncriminal – that person may stand ‘condemned’ in the  public  eye,  but  even\nthat does not entitle anyone to brand him or her a criminal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">25.   Consequently, merely because a  First  Information  Report  is  lodged\nagainst a person or a criminal complaint is filed  against  him  or  her  or\neven if charges are framed against that person, there  is  no  bar  to  that\nperson being elected as a Member of  Parliament  or  being  appointed  as  a\nMinister in the Central Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">26.   Parliament has, therefore, in its wisdom, made a  distinction  between\nan accused person and a convict. For the purposes of the  election  law,  an\naccused person is as much entitled to be elected to  the  Legislature  as  a\nperson not accused of any  offence.  But,  Parliament  has  taken  steps  to\nensure that at least some categories of convicted persons  are  disqualified\nfrom being elected to the Legislature. A statutory  disqualification  is  to\nbe found in <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 8</a> of the Representation of  the  People  Act,  1951.[76]\nThe adequacy of the restrictions placed by this provision is  arguable.  For\nexample, a disqualification under this Section  is  attracted  only  if  the\nsentence awarded to a convict  is  less  than  2  years  imprisonment.  This\nraises an issue: What if the offence is heinous (say an  attempt  to  murder\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_234\">Section 307</a> of the Indian Penal Code  (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_235\">IPC</a>)  or  kidnapping\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 363</a> of the IPC or any  other  serious  offence  not\nattracting a minimum punishment) and the sentence awarded by  the  Court  is\nless than 2 years imprisonment.  Can  such  a  convict  be  a  member  of  a\nLegislature? The answer is in the affirmative. Can this  Court  do  anything\nabout this, in the form of framing some guidelines?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">27.   In Municipal Committee, Patiala[77] this Court referred to  Parent  of\na student of Medical College[78] and held that legislation is in the  domain\nof the Legislature. It was said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">“It is so well settled and needs  no  restatement  at  our  hands  that  the\nlegislature is supreme in its own sphere under the Constitution  subject  to\nthe limitations provided for in the  Constitution  itself.  It  is  for  the\nlegislature to decide as to when and in what respect and  of  what  subject-\nmatter the laws are to be made. It is for the legislature to  decide  as  to\nthe nature of operation of the statutes.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">28.   More recently, V.K. Naswa[79] referred to a large number of  decisions\nof this Court and held  that  the  Court  cannot  legislate  or  direct  the\nLegislature to enact a law. It was said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">“Thus, it is crystal clear that the court has a very  limited  role  and  in\nexercise of that, it is not open to have judicial legislation.  Neither  the\ncourt can legislate, nor has it any competence to issue  directions  to  the\nlegislature to enact the law in a particular manner.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"> 29.  However, a discordant note was struck in Gainda Ram[80]  wherein  this\nCourt issued a direction to the Legislature to enact  legislation  before  a\nparticular date. It was so directed in paragraphs 70 and 78  of  the  Report\nin the following words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">“70. This Court, therefore, disposes of this writ petition and all  the  IAs\nfiled with a direction that the problem of hawking and  street  vending  may\nbe regulated by the present schemes framed by NDMC and MCD up to  30-6-2011.\nWithin that time, the appropriate Government is to legislate and  bring  out\nthe law to regulate hawking and hawkers’ fundamental right. Till  such  time\nthe grievances of the hawkers/vendors  may  be  redressed  by  the  internal\ndispute redressal mechanisms provided in the schemes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">“78. However, before 30-6-2011, the appropriate Government  is  to  enact  a\nlaw on the basis of the  Bill  mentioned  above  or  on  the  basis  of  any\namendment thereof so that the hawkers may precisely  know  the  contours  of\ntheir rights. This Court  is  giving  this  direction  in  exercise  of  its\njurisdiction to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens.”[81]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">30.   The law having been <a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_237\">laid down by</a> a larger Bench than in Gainda Ram  it\nis quite  clear  that  the  decision,  whether  or  not  <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_238\">Section  8</a>  of  the\nRepresentation of the People Act, 1951 is to be amended, rests  solely  with\nParliament.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">31.    Assuming  Parliament  does  decide  to  amend  <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_239\">Section   8</a>   of   the\nRepresentation of the People Act, 1951 the content of  the  amended  Section\ncannot be decided easily. Apart from the difficulty in  fixing  the  quantum\nof sentence (adverted to above), there are several other imponderables,  one\nof them being the nature of the offence. It has been pointed out  by  Rodney\nBrazier in “Is it a constitutional issue: fitness for ministerial office  in\nthe 1990s”[82] that there are  four  categories  of  offences.  The  learned\nauthor says:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">“But four types of crime may  be  distinguished.  First,  minor  convictions\nwould not count against a politician&#x27;s worthiness for office. Minor  driving\noffences, for example, are neither here nor  there.  Secondly,  and  at  the\nother extreme, convictions for  offences  involving  moral  turpitude  would\ndash any ministerial career. No one could remain in the Government  who  had\nbeen convicted of any offence of corruption, dishonesty,  serious  violence,\nor  sexual  misconduct.  Thirdly,  and  most  difficult,  are  offences  the\nseriousness of which turn on the facts. A conviction for (say)  assault,  or\ndriving with excess alcohol in the blood,  could  present  a  marginal  case\nwhich would turn on its own  facts.  Fourthly,  offences  committed  from  a\npolitical motive might be condoned. Possibly a person  who  had  refused  to\npay the poll tax might be considered fit.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">32.   Therefore, not only is  the  quantum  of  sentence  relevant  but  the\nnature of the offence  that  might  disqualify  a  person  from  becoming  a\nlegislator is equally important. Perhaps it  is  possible  to  make  out  an\nexhaustive list of offences which, if committed and the accused having  been\nfound  guilty  of  committing  that  offence,  can  be   disqualified   from\ncontesting an election. The offences and the sentence to be awarded for  the\npurpose of disqualifying a person from being elected to  a  Legislature  are\nmatters that Parliament may like to debate and consider, if  at  all  it  is\nfelt necessary. Until then, we must trust the watchful eye of the people  of\nthe country that the elected representative  of  the  people  is  worthy  of\nbeing a legislator. Thereafter  we  must  trust  the  wisdom  of  the  Prime\nMinister and Parliament that the elected representative is worthy  of  being\na Minister in the Central Government. In this context, it is appropriate  to\nrecall the words of  Dr.  Ambedkar  in  the  Constituent  Assembly  on  30th\nDecember, 1948. He said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">“His [Hon’ble  K.T.  Shah]  last  proposition  is  that  no  person  who  is\nconvicted may be appointed a Minister of the State.  Well,  so  far  as  his\nintention is concerned, it is no doubt very laudable and I do not think  any\nMember of this House would like to differ from him on that proposition.  But\nthe  whole  question  is  this  whether  we  should  introduce   all   these\nqualifications and disqualifications in the Constitution itself. Is  it  not\ndesirable, is it not sufficient that we should  trust  the  Prime  Minister,\nthe Legislature and  the  public  at  large  watching  the  actions  of  the\nMinisters and the actions of the legislature to see that  no  such  infamous\nthing is done by either of them? I think this is a case which may  eminently\nbe left to the good-sense of the Prime Minister and to  the  good  sense  of\nthe Legislature with the general public holding a watching brief upon  them.\nI therefore say that these amendments are unnecessary.”[83]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">33.   That a discussion is needed is evident from  the  material  placed  by\nthe learned Additional Solicitor General. He referred  to  the  18th  Report\npresented to the Rajya Sabha on 15th March, 2007 by  the  Department-Related\nParliamentary Standing Committee On Personnel, Public  Grievances,  Law  And\nJustice on Electoral Reforms (Disqualification Of  Persons  From  Contesting\nElections On Framing Of Charges Against  Them  For  Certain  Offences).  The\nReport acknowledges the criminalization of our polity and the  necessity  of\ncleansing the political climate and had this to say:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">“At the same time, the Committee is deeply conscious of the  criminalization\nof our polity and the fast erosion of confidence of the people at  large  in\nour political process of the day. This will certainly weaken  our  democracy\nand  will  render  the  democratic  institutions  sterile.   The   Committee\ntherefore  feels  that  politics  should  be  cleansed   of   persons   with\nestablished   criminal   background.   The   objective   is    to    prevent\ncriminalisation   of   politics   and   maintain   probity   in   elections.\nCriminalization  of  politics  is  the  bane  of  society  and  negation  of\ndemocracy.  But  the  arguments  against  the  proposal  of   the   Election\nCommission are overwhelming. As stated in the  foregoing  paras  the  Courts\nframe charges even when they are  conscious  that  the  case  is  ultimately\nbound to fail. Appreciation of evidence at  the  stage  of  framing  charges\nbeing more or less prohibited, charges are still framed even when the  court\nis convinced that  the  prosecution  will  never  succeed.  There  are  many\nglaring illustrations which are of common knowledge and any criminal  lawyer\ncan multiply instances of  such  nature.  Hence  the  proposal  can  not  be\naccepted in its present form as  the  country  has  witnessed  in  the  past\nmisuse of MISA, TADA, POTA etc.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">34.   On the issue of criminalization of politics,  the  learned  Additional\nSolicitor General also referred to the 244th Report of  the  Law  Commission\nof India on  “Electoral  Disqualifications”  presented  in  February,  2014.\nThough the Report concerns itself primarily with the disqualification to  be\na member of a Legislature, it does give some  interesting  statistics  about\nthe elected representatives of the people in the following words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">“In the current Lok Sabha, 30%  or  162  sitting  MPs  have  criminal  cases\npending against them, of which about half  i.e.  76  have  serious  criminal\ncases. Further, the prevalence  of  MPs  with  criminal  cases  pending  has\nincreased over time. In 2004, 24%  of  Lok  Sabha  MPs  had  criminal  cases\npending, which increased to 30% in the 2009 elections.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">The situation is similar across states  with  31%  or  1,258  out  of  4,032\nsitting MLAs with pending cases, with again about half being serious  cases.\nSome states have a much higher percentage of MLAs with criminal records:  in\nUttar Pradesh, 47% of MLAs have criminal cases pending. A number of MPs  and\nMLAs have been  accused  of  multiple  counts  of  criminal  charges.  In  a\nconstituency of Uttar Pradesh, for example, the MLA has  36  criminal  cases\npending including 14 cases related to murder.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">From this data it is clear that about one-third  of  elected  candidates  at\nthe Parliament and  State  Assembly  levels  in  India  have  some  form  of\ncriminal taint. Data elsewhere suggests that one-fifth of MLAs have  pending\ncases which have proceeded to the stage  of  charges  being  framed  against\nthem by a court at the time of their election. Even more disturbing  is  the\nfinding that the percentage  of  winners  with  criminal  cases  pending  is\nhigher than the percentage of candidates  without  such  backgrounds.  While\nonly 12% of candidates  with  a  “clean”  record  win  on  average,  23%  of\ncandidates  with  some  kind  of  criminal  record  win.  This  means   that\ncandidates charged with a crime  actually  fare  better  at  elections  than\n‘clean’ candidates. Probably as a result,  candidates  with  criminal  cases\nagainst them tend to be given tickets a second time. Not only  do  political\nparties select candidates with criminal backgrounds, there  is  evidence  to\nsuggest that untainted representatives later  become  involved  in  criminal\nactivities. The incidence of criminalisation of politics is  thus  pervasive\nmaking its remediation an urgent need.”\n\nWhile it may be necessary, due to the  criminalization  of  our  polity  and\nconsequently of our politics, to ensure that certain persons do  not  become\nMinisters, this is not possible through guidelines issued by this Court.  It\nis for the electorate to ensure that suitable (not merely eligible)  persons\nare elected to the Legislature and it is for the  Legislature  to  enact  or\nnot enact a more restrictive law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">Conclusions on the second relief\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">35.   The discussion leads to the following conclusions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">To become a legislator and to continue as a legislator, a person should  not\nsuffer  any  of  the  disqualifications  mentioned  in  <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_240\">Section  8</a>  of   the\nRepresentation of the People Act, 1951;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">There does seem to be a gap in  <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_241\">Section  8</a>  of  the  Representation  of  the\nPeople Act, 1951 inasmuch as a person convicted of a heinous  or  a  serious\noffence but awarded a sentence of  less  than  two  years  imprisonment  may\nstill be eligible for being elected as a Member of Parliament;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">While a debate is  necessary  for  bringing  about  a  suitable  legislation\ndisqualifying a  person  from  becoming  a  legislator,  there  are  various\nfactors that need to be taken into consideration;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">That there is some degree of criminalization of politics is quite evident;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">It is not for this Court to lay down any guidelines relating to  who  should\nor should not be entitled to become a legislator or  who  should  or  should\nnot be appointed a Minister in the Central Government;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">36.   The range of persons who may be elected to a Legislature is very  wide\nand  amongst  those,  who  may  be  appointed  a  Minister  in  the  Central\nGovernment is also very wide, as mentioned above.  Any  legislator  or  non-\nlegislator can be appointed as a Minister but must quit as  soon  as  he  or\nshe earns a disqualification either under the Constitution or under  <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_242\">Section\n8</a> of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.[84] In  B.P.  Singhal  this\nCourt  observed  that  “a  Minister  is  hand-picked  member  of  the  Prime\nMinister&#x27;s team. The relationship between the Prime Minister and a  Minister\nis purely political.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">37.   In addition to the above, how  long  a  Minister  should  continue  in\noffice is best answered by the response to a question  put  to  the  British\nPrime Minister John Major who was asked to  “list  the  circumstances  which\nrender Ministers unsuitable to retain office.” His written  reply  given  to\nthe House of Commons on 25th January, 1994 was: “There can be a  variety  of\ncircumstances but the main criterion should  be  whether  the  Minister  can\ncontinue to perform the duties of office effectively.”[85]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">38.   This being the position, the burden of appointing  a  suitable  person\nas a Minister in the Central Government lies entirely on  the  shoulders  of\nthe Prime Minister and may eminently be left to his or her good sense.  This\nis  what  our  Constitution  makers  intended,  notwithstanding   the   view\nexpressed by Shri H.V. Kamath in the  debate  on  30th  December,  1948.  He\nsaid:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">“My Friend, Prof. Shah, has just moved  amendment  No.1300  comprising  five\nsub-clauses. I dare say neither Dr. Ambedkar nor any of my other  honourable\nFriends in this House will question the principle  which  is  sought  to  be\nembodied in Clause (2E) of amendment No. 1300 moved by Prof.  Shah.  I  have\nsuggested my amendment No. 46 seeking to  delete  all  the  words  occurring\nafter  the  words  &quot;moral  turpitude&quot;  because  I  think  that  bribery  and\ncorruption are offences which involve moral turpitude. I  think  that  moral\nturpitude covers bribery, corruption and  many  other  cognate  offences  as\nwell. Sir, my friends here will, I am sure,  agree  with  me  that  it  will\nhardly redound to the credit of any government if that  government  includes\nin its fold any minister who has had a shady past or about  whose  character\nor integrity there is any widespread suspicion. I hope that  no  such  event\nor occurrence will take place in our country, but some of the recent  events\nhave created a little doubt in my mind. I refer, Sir, to a  little  comment,\na little article, which appeared in the Free Press Journal of  Bombay  dated\nthe 8th September 1948 relating to the **** Ministry.

In this respect, the Prime  Minister  is,  of  course,  answerable  to\nParliament and is under the gaze of the watchful eye of the  people  of  the\ncountry. Despite the fact that certain limitations  can  be  read  into  the\nConstitution and have been read in the past, the issue  of  the  appointment\nof a suitable person as a Minister is not one which enables  this  Court  to\nread implied limitations in the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">Epilogue\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">40.

However\nbad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to  be  good  if  those  who  are\ncalled to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working  of  a  Constitution\ndoes  not  depend  wholly  upon  the  nature  of   the   Constitution.   The\nConstitution can provide only the organs of State such as  the  Legislature,\nthe Executive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working  of  those\norgans of the State depend are the people and  the  political  parties  they\nwill set up as their  instruments  to  carry  out  their  wishes  and  their\npolitics. Who can say how the people of India and  their  purposes  or  will\nthey prefer revolutionary methods of  achieving  them?  If  they  adopt  the\nrevolutionary methods, however good the Constitution may be, it requires  no\nprophet to say that it will fail. It  is,  therefore,  futile  to  pass  any\njudgement upon the Constitution without reference  to  the  part  which  the\npeople and their parties are likely to play.”[87]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">41.   This sentiment was echoed  in  the  equally  memorable  words  of  Dr.\nRajendra Prasad on 26th November, 1949. He had this to say:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">“Whatever the Constitution may or  may  not  provide,  the  welfare  of  the\ncountry will depend upon the way in which the country is administered.  That\nwill depend upon the men who administer it. It is  a  trite  saying  that  a\ncountry can have only the  Government  it  deserves.  Our  Constitution  has\nprovision in it which appear to some to be objectionable from one  point  or\nanother. We must admit that the defects are inherent  in  the  situation  in\nthe country and the people at large. If  the  people  who  are  elected  are\ncapable and men of character and integrity, they would be able to  make  the\nbest even of a defective Constitution. If they are  lacking  in  these,  the\nConstitution cannot help the country.  After  all,  a  Constitution  like  a\nmachine is a lifeless thing.  It  acquires  life  because  of  the  men  who\ncontrol it and operate it, and India needs today nothing more than a set  of\nhonest men who will have the interest of the country before them.”[88]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">42.

Right or wrong, for  court,  not  in  the\nethical sense of morality but in the constitutional sense.

When  things  go  wrong\nconstitutionally, unless the conscience speaks, it is not  good  conscience;\nit will be accused of as numb conscience.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">One cannot think  of  the  Constitution  of  India  without  the  preambular\nprinciple of democracy and good governance.  Governance  is  mainly  in  the\nhands of the Executive. The executive power of the Union  under  <a href=\"/doc/1597349/\" id=\"a_245\">Article  53</a>\nand that of the States under <a href=\"/doc/1995256/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 154</a> vests in  the  President  of  India\nand the Governor of the State, respectively. <a href=\"/doc/127060/\" id=\"a_247\">Article 74</a>  for  the  Union  of\nIndia and <a href=\"/doc/674146/\" id=\"a_248\">Article 163</a> for  the  State  have  provided  for  the  Council  of\nMinisters to aid and advise the President or the Governor, as the  case  may\nbe. The executive power extends to the respective legislative competence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">Before entering office, a Minister has  to  take  oath  of  office  (Article\n75/164). In form, except for the change in the words ‘Union’  or  particular\n‘State’, there is no difference in the form of oath. Ministers take oath  to\n… “faithfully and conscientiously discharge  …”  their  duties  and  ….  “do\nright to all manner of people in accordance with Constitution and  the  law,\nwithout fear or favour, affection or ill-will”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">Allegiance  to  the  Constitution  of  India,  faithful  and   conscientious\ndischarge of the duties, doing right to people and all  these  without  fear\nor favour, affection or ill-will, carry heavy weight. ‘Conscientious’  means\n“wishing to do what is right, relating  to  a  person’s  conscience”  (Ref.:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">Concise Oxford English  Dictionary).  The  simple  question  is,  whether  a\nperson who has come in conflict with law and,  in  particular,  in  conflict\nwith law on offences involving moral turpitude and  laws  specified  by  the\nParliament under <a href=\"/doc/320017/\" id=\"a_249\">Chapter III of The Representation of the People Act,  1951</a>,\nwould be in a position  to  conscientiously  and  faithfully  discharge  his\nduties as Minister and that too, without any fear or favour?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">When does a person come in conflict with law?  No  quarrel,  under  criminal\njurisprudence, a person is presumed to be innocent until  he  is  convicted.\nBut is there not a stage when a person is presumed to be culpable and  hence\ncalled upon to face trial, on the court framing charges?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">Under <a href=\"/doc/411062/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 228</a> of the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973  (hereinafter\nreferred to as ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_251\">Cr.PC</a>’), charge is framed by the court  only  if  the  Judge\n(the Magistrate – under <a href=\"/doc/150946/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 240</a> Cr.PC) is of the opinion that  there  is\nground for presumption that the accused  has  committed  an  offence,  after\nconsideration of opinion given by the  police  under  <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_253\">Section  173(2)</a>  Cr.PC\n(challan/police charge-sheet) and the record of the case and  documents.  It\nmay be noted that the prosecutor and the accused person  are  heard  by  the\ncourt in the process. Is there not a cloud on his innocence at  that  stage?\nIs it not a stage where his integrity is questioned? If  so,  is  it  not  a\nstage where the person has come in conflict with  law,  and  if  so,  is  it\ndesirable in a country governed by rule of  law  to  entrust  the  executive\npower with such a person who is already  in  conflict  with  law?  Will  any\nreasonably prudent master leave the keys of his chest with a  servant  whose\nintegrity is doubted? It may not be altogether irrelevant  to  note  that  a\nperson even of doubtful integrity is not appointed in  the  important  organ\nof the State which interprets law  and  administers  justice;  then  why  to\nspeak of questioned integrity! What to say more,  a  candidate  involved  in\nany criminal case and facing trial, is not appointed in  any  civil  service\nbecause of the alleged criminal antecedents, until acquitted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">Good governance is only in the hands of good men. No doubt, what is good  or\nbad is not for the court to decide: but the court can  always  indicate  the\nconstitutional  ethos  on  goodness,   good   governance   and   purity   in\nadministration and remind  the  constitutional  functionaries  to  preserve,\nprotect and promote the same.  Those ethos are the unwritten  words  in  our\nConstitution. However,  as  the  Constitution  makers  stated,  there  is  a\npresumption that the Prime Minister/Chief Minister  would  be  well  advised\nand  guided  by  such  unwritten  yet  constitutional  principles  as  well.\nAccording to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, as specifically referred to by  my  learned\nbrother at pargraph-70 of the leading judgment, such things were only to  be\nleft to the good sense of the Prime  Minister,  and  for  that  matter,  the\nChief  Minister  of  State,  since  it  was  expected  that  the  two  great\nconstitutional functionaries would not dare to  do  any  infamous  thing  by\ninducting an  otherwise  unfit  person  to  the  Council  of  Ministers.  It\nappears, over a period of time, at least in some cases, it was only a  story\nof great expectations. Some  of  the  instances  pointed  out  in  the  writ\npetition indicate that Dr. Ambedkar  and  other  great  visionaries  in  the\nConstituent Assembly have been bailed out. Qualification  has  been  wrongly\nunderstood as the mere absence of  prescribed  disqualification.  Hence,  it\nhas become the bounden duty of the court to remind the  Prime  Minister  and\nthe Chief Minister of the State of their duty to act in accordance with  the\nconstitutional aspirations. To quote Dr. Ambedkar:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">“However, good a Constitution may be, it is sure to  turn  out  bad  because\nthose who are called to work it happen to be  a  bad  lot.  However,  bad  a\nConstitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are  called  to\nwork it happen to be a good lot. The working  of  a  Constitution  does  not\ndepend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution.”\n\n\n\nFortunately for us, our Constitution has stood  the  test  of  time  and  is\nacclaimed to be one of the best in the world.  Problem  has  been  with  the\nother  part,  though  sporadically.  Kautilya,  one  of  the  great   Indian\nexponents of art of government, has dealt with  qualification  of  king  and\nhis councillors at Chapter IX in Arthasastra, said to  be  compiled  between\nBC 321-296. To quote relevant portion:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">                                 “CHAPTER IX\n\n                   THE CREATION OF COUNCILLORS AND PRIESTS\n\nNATIVE, born of high family, influential, well trained  in  arts,  possessed\nof foresight, wise, of strong memory, bold, eloquent, skilful,  intelligent,\npossessed of enthusiasm, dignity and endurance, pure in character,  affable,\nfirm in loyal devotion, endowed with  excellent  conduct,  strength,  health\nand bravery, free from procrastination and  ficklemindedness,  affectionate,\nand free from such qualities as  excite  hatred  and  enmity-these  are  the\nqualifications of a ministerial officer.”\n\n\n\nThe attempt made by this court  in  the  above  background  history  of  our\ncountry and Constitution is only to plug some of the bleeding points in  the\nworking of our Constitution so that the  high  constitutional  functionaries\nmay work it well and not wreck  it.  Beauty  of  democracy  depends  on  the\nproper exercise of duty by those who work it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">No doubt, it is not for the court  to  issue  any  direction  to  the  Prime\nMinister or the Chief Minister, as the case may be,  as  to  the  manner  in\nwhich they should exercise their power while  selecting  the  colleagues  in\nthe Council of Ministers. That is the constitutional  prerogative  of  those\nfunctionaries who are called  upon  to  preserve,  protect  and  defend  the\nConstitution. But it is the prophetic duty of this Court to remind  the  key\nduty holders about their role in working the Constitution. Hence,  I  am  of\nthe firm view, that the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the  State,\nwho themselves have taken oath to bear true  faith  and  allegiance  to  the\nConstitution  of  India  and  to  discharge  their  duties  faithfully   and\nconscientiously, will be well advised to consider  avoiding  any  person  in\nthe Council of Ministers,  against  whom  charges  have  been  framed  by  a\ncriminal court in respect of offences involving  moral  turpitude  and  also\noffences specifically referred to in <a href=\"/doc/320017/\" id=\"a_254\">Chapter III of  The  Representation  of\nthe People Act, 1951</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">                                                               ...……………………J.\n           (KURIAN JOSEPH)\nNew Delhi;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">August 27, 2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">-----------------------</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">[1]</span>\n\n       AIR 1975 SC 2299\n[2]    (1995) 4 SCC 611\n[3]    AIR 2006 SC 3127\n[4]    (2013) 10 SCC 1\n[5]    (1978) 1 SCC 405\n[6]    AIR 1980 SC 1362\n[7]    (2002) 5 SCC 294\n[8]    (1997) 4 SCC 306\n[9]    (1997) 6 SCC 1\n[10]   AIR 2005 SC 688\n[11]   (2013) 4 SCC 642\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">[12]   Writ Petition (Civil) No. 38 of 1997 etc. pronounced on May 06, 2014\n[13]   (2013) 7 SCC 653\n[14]   (1973) 4 SCC 225\n[15]   (2011) 4 SCC 1\n[16]   (2009) 7 SCC 1\n[17]   (2006) 11 SCC 356\n[18]   (2014) 2 SCC 609\n[19]   (2013) 5 SCC 1\n[20]   (2005) 8 SCC 202\n[21]   (1974) 2 SCC 831\n[22]   (2001) 7 SCC 231\n[23]   (2004) 8 SCC 788\n[24]   1981 Supp SCC 87\n[25]   (2006) 8 SCC 212\n[26]   (1971) 2 SCC 63\n[27]   (1972) 3 SCC 717\n[28]   (2006) 2 SCC 682\n[29]   (2004) 10 SCC 699\n[30]   (2005) 5 SCC 294\n[31]   (2011) 2 SCC 83\n[32]   (2011) 4 SCC 324\n[33]   (2012) 2 SCC 34\n[34]   1936 AC 578\n[35]   1965 AC 172\n[36]   23 CLR 457\n[37]   (1967) 2 SCR 109\n[38]   (1980) 3 SCC 625\n[39]   (2007) 2 SCC 1\n[40]   AIR 1987 SC 232\n[41]   AIR 1997 SC 610\n[42]   (1997) 6 SCC 241\n[43]   (2010) 12 SCC 1\n[44]   (1994) 6 SCC 632\n[45]   AIR 1994 SC 1349\n[46]   AIR 1950 SC 124\n[47]   (1974) 74 CLR 31\n[48]   (1992) 177 CLR 106\n[49]   (1945) 71 CLR 29, 85\n[50]   (1958) 99 CLR 132, 144-5\n[51]   (1971) 122 CLR 353, 401\n[52]   Constituent Assembly Debates 1989: VII, 38.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">[53]   James Madison as Publius, Federalist 51\n[54]   Laurance H.
