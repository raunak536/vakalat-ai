In that case, the accused can be permitted to\n             take inspection of the concerned document either personally or through\n             his pleader in Court.

A fortiori, it necessarily follows that\n             even if the investigating officer appends his note in respect of any\n             particular document, that will be of no avail as his power is limited to\n             do so only in respect of &#x27;statements&#x27; referred to in subsection (6) of\n             Section 173 of the 1973 Code.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"599427\" id=\"span_13\">17.

State (NCT of Delhi</a>), this Court expounded thus:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                    &quot;218. The liberty of an accused cannot be interfered with\n                    except under due process of law. The expression &quot;due process\n                    of law&quot; shall deem to include fairness in trial. The court (sic\n                    Code) gives a right to the accused to receive all documents and\n                    statements as well as to move an application for production of\n                    any record or witness in support of his case. This constitutional\n                    mandate and statutory rights given to the accused place an\n                    implied obligation upon the prosecution (prosecution and the\n                    Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure. The concept of fair\n                    disclosure would take in its ambit furnishing of a document\n                    which the prosecution relies upon whether filed in court or not.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">                    That document should essentially be 3 (1992) 4 SCC 711 4\n                    (2010) 6 SCC 1 furnished to the accused and even in the cases\n                    where during investigation a document is bona fide obtained by\n                    the investigating agency and in the opinion of the Prosecutor is\n                    relevant and would help in arriving at the truth, that document\n                    should also be disclosed to the accused.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">                    219. The role and obligation of the Prosecutor particularly in\n                    relation to disclosure cannot be equated under our law to that\n                    prevalent under the English system as afore referred to. But at\n                    the same time, the demand for a fair trial cannot be ignored. It\n                    may be of different consequences where a document which has\n                    been obtained suspiciously, fraudulently or by causing undue\n                    advantage to the accused during investigation such document\n                    could be denied in the discretion of the Prosecutor to the\n                    accused whether the prosecution relies or not upon such\n                    documents, however in other cases the obligation to disclose\n                    would be more certain. As already noticed the provisions of\n                    Section 207 have a material bearing on this subject and make\n                    an interesting reading.

In contradistinction to the provisions\n                    of Section 173, where the legislature has used the expression\n                    &quot;documents on which the prosecution relies&quot; are not used under\n                    Section 207 of the Code. Therefore, the provisions of Section\n                    207 of the Code will have to be given liberal and relevant\n                    meaning so as to achieve its object. Not only this, the\n                    documents submitted to the Magistrate along with the report\n                    under Section 173(5) would deem to include the documents\n                    which have to be sent to the Magistrate during the course of\n                    investigation as per the requirement of Section 170(2) of the\n                    Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">                    220. The right of the accused with regard to disclosure of\n                    documents is a limited right but is codified and is the very\n                    foundation of a fair investigation and trial. On such matters, the\n                    accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to claim every\n                    document of the police file or even the portions which are\n                    permitted to be excluded from the documents annexed to the\n                    report under Section 173(2) as per orders of the court. But\n                    certain rights of the accused flow both from the codified law as\n                    well as from equitable concepts of the constitutional\n                    jurisdiction, as substantial variation to such procedure would\n                    frustrate the very basis of a fair trial. To claim documents\n                    within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read with the\n                    provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court\n                    under <a href=\"/doc/1735825/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 91</a> the Code to summon documents signifies and\n                    provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                    Page 8 of 19</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                             Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 05:32:33 IST 2022</span>\n R/SCR.A/9907/2019                                         JUDGMENT DATED: 03/08/2021\n\n\n\n                    claim copies of the statement and documents which the\n                    prosecution has collected during investigation and upon which\n                    they rely.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">                    221.

The issue that has emerged before us is, therefore,\n                    somewhat larger than what has been projected by the State and\n                    what has been dealt with by the High Court. The 5 (2012) 9\n                    SCC 771 question arising would no longer be one of\n                    compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n                    207</a> CrPC and would travel beyond the confines of the strict\n                    language of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Cr.P.C</a>. and touch upon the larger\n                    doctrine of a free and fair trial that has been painstakingly built\n                    up by the courts on a purposive interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of\n                    the Constitution. It is not the stage of making of the request; the\n                    efflux of time that has occurred or the prior conduct of the\n                    accused that is material. What is of significance is if in a given\n                    situation the accused comes to the court contending that some\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                     Page 9 of 19</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                              Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 05:32:33 IST 2022</span>\n R/SCR.A/9907/2019                                         JUDGMENT DATED: 03/08/2021\n\n\n\n                      papers forwarded to the court by the investigating agency have\n                      not been exhibited by the prosecution as the same favours the\n                      accused the court must concede a right to the accused to have\n                      an access to the said documents, if so claimed.

In this regard, we would like to be specific in\n                      saying that we find it difficult to agree with the view taken by\n                      the High Court that the accused must be made to await the\n                      conclusion of the trial to test the plea of prejudice that he may\n                      have raised. Such a plea must be answered at the earliest and\n                      certainly before the conclusion of the trial, even though it may\n                      be raised by the accused belatedly. This is how the scales of\n                      justice in our criminal jurisprudence have to be balanced.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                                                   (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">             21. The High Court adverted to certain judgments before\n             concluding that the memory card would be a material object. For\n             arriving at the said conclusion, the High Court relied on the\n             decision of the King&#x27;s Bench of United Kingdom in The King v.\n             Daye, wherein Darling J., adding to the majority opinion, had held\n             thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                      &quot;...But I should myself say that any written thing capable of\n                      being evidence is properly described as a document and that it\n                      is immaterial on what the writing may be inscribed. It might be\n                      inscribed on paper, as is the common case now; but the\n                      common case once was that it was not on paper, but on\n                      parchment; and long before that it was on stone, marble, or\n                      clay, and it might be, and often was, on metal. So I should\n                      desire to guard myself against being supposed to assent to the\n                      argument that a thing is not a document unless it be a paper\n                      writing.

Before briefly referring to such cases, it\n                           will, I think, be convenient to bear in mind that the\n                           derivation of the word is from the Latin &quot;documentum&quot;:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                           it is something which instructs or provides information.\n                           Indeed, according to Bullokar&#x27;s English Expositor\n                           (1621), it meant a lesson.

The concomitant is that the\n             contents of the memory card/pendrive must be furnished to the\n             accused, which can be done in the form of cloned copy of the\n             memory card/pendrive.
