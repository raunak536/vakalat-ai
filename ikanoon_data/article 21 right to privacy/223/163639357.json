Mankind, since\n\n          time            immemorial,    has   been       searching   for   explanation   or\n\n          justification to substantiate a point of view that hurts humanity.\n\n          The theoretical human values remain on paper.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">                                                                               Historically,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CHETAN KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2018.09.28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">15:49:38 IST</span>\n\n          women have been treated with inequality and that is why, many\nReason:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">          have fought for their rights. Susan B. Anthony, known for her\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                 2</span>\n\n\nfeminist activity, succinctly puts, “Men, their rights, and nothing\n\nmore; women, their rights, and nothing less.”        It is a clear\n\nmessage.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">2.   Neither the said message nor any kind of philosophy has\n\nopened up the large populace of this country to accept women as\n\npartners in their search for divinity and spirituality.     In the\n\ntheatre of life, it seems, man has put the autograph and there is\n\nno space for a woman even to put her signature.           There is\n\ninequality on the path of approach to understand the divinity.\n\nThe attribute of devotion to divinity cannot be subjected to the\n\nrigidity and stereotypes of gender. The dualism that persists in\n\nreligion by glorifying and venerating women as goddesses on one\n\nhand and by imposing rigorous sanctions on the other hand in\n\nmatters of devotion has to be abandoned. Such a dualistic\n\napproach and an entrenched mindset results in indignity to\n\nwomen and degradation of their status. The society has to\n\nundergo a perceptual shift from being the propagator of\n\nhegemonic patriarchal notions of demanding more exacting\n\nstandards of purity and chastity solely from women to be the\n\ncultivator of equality where the woman is in no way considered\n\nfrailer, lesser or inferior to man.   The law and the society are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                            3</span>\n\n\nbestowed with the Herculean task to act as levellers in this\n\nregard and for the same, one has to remember the wise saying of\n\nHenry Ward Beecher that deals with the changing perceptions of\n\nthe world in time. He says:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         “Our days are a kaleidoscope. Every instant a\n         change takes place in the contents. New\n         harmonies, new contrasts, new combinations of\n         every sort. Nothing ever happens twice alike. The\n         most familiar people stand each moment in some\n         new relation to each other, to their work, to\n         surrounding objects. The most tranquil house,\n         with the most serene inhabitants, living upon the\n         utmost regularity of system, is yet exemplifying\n         infinite diversities.”1\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">3.       Any relationship with the Creator is a transcendental one\n\ncrossing all socially created artificial barriers and not a\n\nnegotiated relationship bound by terms and conditions. Such a\n\nrelationship and expression of devotion cannot be circumscribed\n\nby dogmatic notions of biological or physiological factors arising\n\nout of rigid socio-cultural attitudes which do not meet the\n\nconstitutionally prescribed tests. Patriarchy in religion cannot be\n\npermitted to trump over the element of pure devotion borne out\n\nof faith and the freedom to practise and profess one‟s religion.\n\nThe subversion and repression of women under the garb of\n\nbiological or physiological factors cannot be given the seal of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">1</span>\n    Henry Ward Beecher, 1813-1887 - Eyes and Ears\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n\nlegitimacy. Any rule based on discrimination or segregation of\n\nwomen pertaining to biological characteristics is not only\n\nunfounded, indefensible and implausible but can also never pass\n\nthe muster of constitutionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">4.    It is a universal truth that faith and religion do not\n\ncountenance        discrimination    but       religious   practices   are\n\nsometimes seen as perpetuating patriarchy thereby negating the\n\nbasic tenets of faith and of gender equality and rights. The\n\nsocietal attitudes too centre and revolve around the patriarchal\n\nmindset thereby derogating the status of women in the social and\n\nreligious milieu. All religions are simply different paths to reach\n\nthe Universal One. Religion is basically a way of life to realize\n\none‟s identity with the Divinity. However, certain dogmas and\n\nexclusionary practices and rituals have resulted in incongruities\n\nbetween the true essence of religion or faith and its practice that\n\nhas   come    to    be   permeated      with     patriarchal   prejudices.\n\nSometimes, in the name of essential and integral facet of the\n\nfaith, such practices are zealously propagated.\n\n\n\n\nThe Reference\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                            5</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.

The High Court, after posing the aforesaid questions,\n\nobserved thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     “40. The deity in Sabarimala temple is in the form of\n     a Yogi or a Bramchari according to the Thanthri of\n     the temple. He stated that there are Sasta temples at\n     Achankovil, Aryankavu and Kulathupuzha, but the\n     deities there are in different forms. Puthumana\n     Narayanan      Namboodiri,     a     Thanthrimukhya\n     recognised by the Travancore Devaswom Board,\n     while examined as C.W. 1 stated that God in\n     Sabarimala is in the form of aNaisthikBramchari.\n     That, according to him, is the reason why young\n     women are not permitted to offer prayers in the\n     temple.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     41. Since the deity is in the form of a Naisthik\n     Brahmachari, it is therefore believed that young\n     women should not offer worship in the temple so\n     that even the slightest deviation from celibacy and\n     austerity observed by the deity is not caused by the\n     presence of such women.”\n\nAnd again:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     “… We are therefore of the opinion that the usage of\n     woman of the age group 10 to 50 not being permitted\n     to enter the temple and its precincts had been made\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                9</span>\n\n\n      applicable throughout the year and there is no\n      reason why they should be permitted to offer worship\n      during specified days when they are not in a position\n      to observe penance for 41 days due to physiological\n      reasons. In short, woman after menarche up to\n      menopause are not entitled to enter the temple and\n      offer prayars there at any time of the year.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">11. Analysing so, the High Court recorded its conclusions which\n\nread thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      “(1) The restriction imposed on women aged above 10\n      and below 50 from trekking the holy hills of\n      Sabarimala and offering worship at Sabarimala\n      Shrine is in accordance with the usage prevalent\n      from time immemorial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      (2) Such restriction imposed by the Devaswom Board\n      is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_27\">Articles 15</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_28\">, 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_29\">26</a> of the\n      Constitution of India.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      (3) Such restriction is also not violative of the\n      provisions of Hindu Place of Public Worship\n      (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 since there is no\n      restriction between one section and another section\n      or between one class and another class among the\n      Hindus in the matter of entry to a temple whereas\n      the prohibition is only in respect of women of a\n      particular age group and not women as a class.”\n\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the Petitioners\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">12. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners have alluded\n\nto the geographical location, historical aspect along with the\n\nBuddhist connection of the Sabarimala temple and the religious\n\nhistory of Lord Ayyappa. They have, for the purpose of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                               10</span>\n\n\nappreciating the functioning of the Sabarimala temple, also taken\n\nus through the history of Devaswom in Travancore. As regards\n\nthe statutory backing of the Devaswom Boards, the petitioners\n\nhave drawn the attention of this Court to the „Travancore -\n\n<a href=\"/doc/190188500/\" id=\"a_30\">Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act, 1950</a>‟, <a href=\"/doc/191323648/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 4</a> of the\n\nsaid Act contemplates a Devaswom Board for bringing all\n\nincorporated and unincorporated Devaswoms and other Hindu\n\nreligious institutions except Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">13. It has been put forth by them that the aforesaid enactment\n\nhas been subject to various amendments over a period of time,\n\nthe last amendment being made in the year 2007 vide <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_32\">Amending\n\nAct</a> of 2007 [published under Notification No. 2988/Leg.A1/2007\n\nin K.G. ext. No. 694 dated 12.04.2007] which led to the inclusion\n\nof women into the management Board. The petitioners have also\n\nreferred to Section 29A of the said Act which stipulates that all\n\nappointments of officers and employees in the Devaswom\n\nAdministrative Service of the Board shall be made from a select\n\nlist of candidates furnished by the Kerala Public Service\n\nCommission. It has been submitted by the petitioners that after\n\nthe 1950 Act, no individual Devaswom Board can act differently\n\nboth in matters of religion and administration as they have lost\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                11</span>\n\n\ntheir distinct character and Sabarimala no more remained a\n\ntemple of any religious denomination after the tak over of its\n\nmanagement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">14. As far as the funding aspect is considered, it is contended\n\nthat prior to the adoption of the Constitution, both the\n\nTravancore and Tamil Nadu Devaswom Boards were funded by\n\nthe State but after six years of the adoption of the Constitution,\n\nthe Parliament, in the exercise of its constituent power, inserted\n\n<a href=\"/doc/59268033/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 290-A</a> vide the 7th Amendment whereby a sum of rupees\n\nforty six lakhs and fifty thousand only is allowed to be charged\n\nupon the Consolidated Fund of the State of Kerala which is paid\n\nto the Travancore Devaswom Board. It has been asseverated by\n\nthe petitioners that after the insertion of <a href=\"/doc/59268033/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 290-A</a> in the\n\nConstitution and the consequent State funding, no individual\n\nill-practice could be carried on in any temple associated with the\n\nstatutory Devaswom Board even in case of Hindu temple as this\n\nconstitutional amendment has been made on the premise that no\n\nill-practice shall be carried on in any temple which is against the\n\nconstitutional principles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">15. It is urged that since all Devaswoms are Hindu Temples and\n\nthey are bound to follow the basic tenets of Hindu religion,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                    12</span>\n\n\nindividual ill-practice of any temple contrary to the basic tenets\n\nof Hindu religion is impermissible, after it being taken over by\n\nstatutory board and state funding in 1971. It is propounded that\n\nfor the purpose of constituting a „religious denomination; not only\n\nthe practices followed by that denomination should be different\n\nbut its administration should also be distinct and separate.\n\nThus, even if some practices are distinct in temples attached to\n\nstatutory board, since its administration is centralized under the\n\nDevaswom Board, it cannot attain a distinct identity of a separate\n\nreligious denomination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">16. It is contended that in legal and constitutional parlance, for\n\nthe purpose of constituting a religious denomination, there has to\n\nbe strong bondage among the members of its denomination. Such\n\ndenomination must be clearly distinct following a particular set of\n\nrituals/practices/usages having their own religious institutions\n\nincluding managing their properties in accordance with law.\n\nFurther, the petitioners have averred that religious denomination\n\nwhich closely binds its members with certain rituals/practices\n\nmust also be owning some property with perpetual succession\n\nwhich, as per the petitioners, the Constitution framers kept in\n\nmind   while   framing    <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_35\">Article    26</a>   of   the   Constitution   and,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                          13</span>\n\n\naccordingly, religious denominations have been conferred four\n\nrights under clauses (a) to (d) of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 26.</a> These rights, it is\n\nsubmitted, are not disjunctive and exclusive in nature but are\n\ncollectively conferred to establish their identity. To buttress this\n\nview, the petitioners have placed reliance on the views of the\n\nviews of H.M. Seervai4 wherein the learned author has stated that\n\nthe right to acquire property is implicit in clause (a) as no\n\nreligious institution could be created without property and\n\nsimilarly, how one could manage its own affairs in matters of\n\nreligion under clause (b) if there is no religious institution. Thus,\n\nfor a religious denomination claiming separate and distinct\n\nidentity, it must own some property requiring constitutional\n\nprotection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145565\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1553042\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"510078\" id=\"span_25\">17.

It does not have its separate\n\nadministration, but is administered by or through a statutory\n\nbody constituted under the „Travancore - <a href=\"/doc/190188500/\" id=\"a_41\">Cochin Hindu Religious\n\nInstitutions Act, 1950</a>‟ and further, as per Section 29(3A) of the\n\nsaid Act, the Devaswom Commissioner is required to submit\n\nreports to the government, once in three months, with respect to\n\nthe working of the Board.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1430396\" id=\"span_27\">19.

Syed   Hussain   Ali10</a>   wherein\n\nGajendragadkar, J. clarified that clauses (c) and (d) do not create\n\nany new right in favour of religious denominations but only\n\nsafeguard their rights. Similarly, in matters of religious affairs, it\n\nis observed that the same is also not sacrosanct as there may be\n\nmany ill-practices like superstitions which may, in due course of\n\ntime, become mere accretions to the basic theme of that religious\n\ndenomination. After so citing, the petitioners have submitted that\n\neven if any accretion added for any historical reason has become\n\nan essence of the said religious denomination, the same shall not\n\nbe protected under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 26(b)</a> if it is so abhorring and is\n\nagainst the basic concept of our Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">22. It is also the case of the petitioners that discrimination in\n\nmatters of entry to temples is neither a ritual nor a ceremony\n\nassociated with Hindu religion as this religion does not\n\ndiscriminate against women but, on the contrary, Hindu religion\n\naccords to women a higher pedestal in comparison to men and\n\nsuch a discrimination is totally anti-Hindu, for restriction on the\n\nentry of women is not the essence of Hindu religion.

Further, mere sight of women cannot affect one‟s celibacy if\n\none has taken oath of it, otherwise such oath has no meaning\n\nand moreover, the devotees do not go to the Sabarimala temple\n\nfor taking the oath of celibacy but for seeking the blessings of\n\nLord Ayyappa. Maintaining celibacy is only a ritual for some who\n\nwant to practise it and for which even the temple administration\n\nhas not given any justification. On the contrary, according to the\n\ntemple administration, since women during menstrual period\n\ncannot trek very difficult mountainous terrain in the dense forest\n\nand that too for several weeks, this practice of not permitting\n\nthem has started.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1430396\" id=\"span_35\">24.

It is a traditional custom\n            universally observed not to allow access to any\n            outsider to the particularly sacred parts of a temple\n            as for example, the place where the deity is located.\n            There are also fixed hours of worship and rest for the\n            idol when no disturbance by any member of the\n            public is allowed. Section 21, it is to be noted, does\n            not confine the right of entry to the outer portion of\n            the premises; it does not even exclude the inner\n            sanctuary the Holy of Holies&quot; as it is said, the\n            sanctity of which is `zealously preserved.

We think\n            that as the section stands, it interferes with the\n            fundamental rights of the Mathadhipati and the\n            denomination of which he is head guaranteed under\n            <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_49\">articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_50\">26</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">25.

All that a religious denomination\n\nmay do is to restrict the entry of a particular class or section in\n\ncertain rituals. The relevant portion of Devaru (supra) reads as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      “We have held that the right of a denomination to\n      wholly exclude members of the public from\n      worshipping in the temple, though comprised in <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_51\">Art.\n      26(b)</a>, must yield to the overriding right declared by\n      <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_52\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a> in favour of the public to enter into a\n      temple for worship. But where the right claimed is\n      not one of general and total exclusion of the public\n      from worship in the temple at all times but of\n      exclusion from certain religious services, they being\n      limited by the rules of the foundation to the\n      members of the denomination, ,then the question is\n      not whether <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_53\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a> over-rides that right so as\n      to extinguish it, but whether it is possible-so to\n      regulate the rights of the persons protected by <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_54\">Art.\n      25(2)(b)</a> as to give effect to both the rights. If the\n      denominational rights are such that to give effect to\n      them would substantially reduce the right conferred\n      by <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_55\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a>, then of course, on our conclusion\n      that <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_56\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a> prevails as against <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_57\">Art. 26(b)</a>, the\n      denominational rights must vanish. But where that\n      is not the position, and after giving effect to the\n      rights of the denomination what is left to the public\n      of the right of worship is something substantial and\n      not merely the husk of it, there is no reason why we\n      should not so construe <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_58\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a> as to give effect\n      to <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_59\">Art. 26(b)</a> and recognise the rights of the\n      denomination in respect of matters which are strictly\n      denominational, leaving the rights of the public in\n      other respects unaffected.”\n                                         (Emphasis is ours)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                               20</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">26. After referring to Sections 3 and 4 of the Kerala Hindu\n\nPlaces of Public Worship (Authorization of Entry) Act, 1965 and\n\nRule 3 (b) framed thereunder, the petitioners have submitted that\n\nthe expression „at any such time‟ occurring in Rule 3(b) does not\n\nlead to complete exclusion/prohibition of any woman. In other\n\nwords, if at such time during which, by any custom or usage, any\n\nwoman was not allowed, then the said custom or usage shall\n\ncontinue and to substantiate this claim, the petitioners have\n\ncited the example that if during late night, by custom or usage,\n\nwomen are not allowed to enter temple, the said custom or usage\n\nshall continue, however, it does not permit complete prohibition\n\non entry of women. Further, the petitioners have submitted that\n\nany other interpretation of Rule 3(b) would render the said rule\n\nopen to challenge as it would not only be violative of the Kerala\n\nHindu Places of Public Worship (Authorization of Entry) Rules,\n\n1965 but also of <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> of the Constitution read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_61\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_62\">15.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n\nSubmissions on behalf of Intervenor in I.A No. 10 of 2016\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">27.

As per the applicant/intervenor, there is\n\na catena of judgments by this Court wherein the rights of entry\n\ninto temples of all castes have been upheld on the premise that\n\nthey are Hindus and similarly, women who assert the right to\n\nenter the Sabarimala temple are also Hindus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_55\">35. The applicant/intervenor has referred to Section 4 of the\n\nKerala Places of Public Worship (Authorization of Entry) Act,\n\n1965 and Rule 3(b) made under the said section which disentitles\n\ncertain categories of people from entering any place of public\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">16</span>\n     (2014) 5 SCC 438\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">17</span>\n     (2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                 25</span>\n\n\nworship and this includes women who, by custom or usage, are\n\nnot allowed to enter a place of public worship. It has further been\n\nsubmitted by the applicant/intervenor that Rule 3(b) is ultra vires\n\nthe 1965 Act and is also unconstitutional for it violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_82\">Articles\n\n14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_83\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_84\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_85\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_86\">25</a> of the Constitution in so far as it prohibits\n\nwomen from entering a public temple. The said Rule 3(b), as per\n\nthe applicant/intervenor, is not an essential practice protected\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 26</a> of the Constitution for it is not a part of religion\n\nas the devotees of Lord Ayyappa are just Hindus and they do not\n\nconstitute a separate religious denomination under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 26</a> of\n\nthe Constitution as they do not have a common faith or a distinct\n\nname.

The intervenor, All India Democratic Women‟s Association,\n\nhas filed I.A No. 34/2017 wherein it has submitted that the\n\nmeaning of the Constitution cannot be frozen and it must\n\ncontinuously evolve with the changing times. Further, the\n\napplicant submits that merely because <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 26</a> does not specify\n\nthat it is subject to Part III or <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution, it\n\ncannot be said that it is insulated against Part III and especially\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_101\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_102\">, 15 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_104\">25</a> of the Constitution. To emphasize\n\nthe     same,       the   applicant/intervenor   has   relied   upon   the\n\nobservations made in Devaru case where the Court has stated\n\nthat the rule of construction is well settled that when there are\n\ntwo provisions in an enactment which cannot be reconciled with\n\neach other, they should be so interpreted that, if possible, effect\n\ncould be given to both. The Court observed that applying this\n\nrule of harmonious construction, if the contention of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">19</span>\n     (1997) 6 SCC 241\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                 28</span>\n\n\nappellants is to be accepted, then <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_105\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a> will become wholly\n\nnugatory in its application to denominational temples, though, as\n\nstated above, the language of that Article includes them. The\n\nCourt further observed that if the contention of the respondents\n\nis accepted, then full effect can be given to <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 26(b)</a> in all\n\nmatters of religion, subject only to this that as regards one aspect\n\nof them, entry into a temple for worship, the rights declared\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> will prevail and therefore while, in the\n\nformer case, <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> will be put wholly out of operation, in\n\nthe latter, effect can be given to both that provision and <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_109\">Article\n\n26(b)</a> and, hence, it must be accordingly held that <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_110\">Article\n\n26(b)</a> must be read subject to <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 25(2)(b).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">Submissions on behalf of Respondent No. 1</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">40. The State of Kerala, the first respondent herein, as indicated\n\nearlier, had taken contrary stands at different times. An affidavit\n\nwas filed on 13.11.2007 which indicated that the Government\n\nwas not in favour of discrimination towards any woman or any\n\nsection of the society.    The said stand was changed in the\n\naffidavit dated 5.2.2016 taking the stand that the earlier affidavit\n\nwas contrary to the judgment of the Kerala High Court. On\n\n7.11.2016 on a query being made by the Court, the learned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                 29</span>\n\n\ncounsel for the State submitted that it wanted to place reliance\n\non the original affidavit dated 13.11.2007. It is contended by Mr.\n\nJaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of\n\nKerala, that the 1965 Act and the Rules framed thereunder are in\n\nconsonance with <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> of the Constitution. Reference\n\nhas been made to <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 3</a> of the Act, for the said provision\n\ndeals with places of public worship to be open to Hindus\n\ngenerally or any section or class thereof.         The concept of\n\nprohibition is not conceived of.      It is urged by Mr. Gupta that\n\nthere is no restriction in view of the legislation in the field. In\n\nessence, the stand of the State is that it does not conceive of any\n\ndiscrimination as regards the entry of women into the temple\n\nwhere male devotees can enter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Submissions on behalf of Respondent No. 2</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_51\">41. The respondent no. 2 has submitted that Sabarimala is a\n\ntemple of great antiquity dedicated to Lord Ayyappa who the\n\npetitioner avers to be a deity depicting “a hyper masculine God\n\nborn out of the union of two male Gods Shiva and Mohini, where\n\nMohini is Vishnu in a female form.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">42. Thereafter, the respondent no. 2 reiterated the submissions\n\nof the respondent no. 4 pertaining to the observance of 41 days\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                30</span>\n\n\n„Vruthum‟ and the fact that the Sabarimala Temple is supposed\n\nto depict „Naishtika Brahmacharya‟. In addition to this, the\n\nrespondent no. 2 has also referred to a Ph.D thesis by Radhika\n\nSekar in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at\n\nCarleton University, Ottawa, Ontario in October 1987 titled “The\n\nProcess of Pilgrimage : The Ayyappa Cultus and Sabarimala\n\nYatra” which has established the very raison d’etre for the\n\nexistence of the denominational Temple of Sabarimala based\n\nupon deep penance, celibacy and abstinence by all visitors, male\n\nand female. The respondent no. 2 has also drawn the attention of\n\nthe Court to the fact that the Sabarimala temple is open only\n\nduring specific defined periods, that is, on the Malayalam month\n\nviz. 17th November to 26th December, for the first five days of\n\neach Malayalam month which starts approximately in the middle\n\nof each English calendar month and also during the period of\n\nMakar Sankranti, viz. approximately from January 1 to mid-\n\nJanuary of each year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Submissions on behalf of Respondent No. 4</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">43. At the outset, the respondent no. 4 has drawn the attention\n\nof the Court to the history of Kerala in general and Sabarimala in\n\nparticular and has highlighted the existence of stone inscriptions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                31</span>\n\n\nwhich state that the priest Kantaru Prabhakaru had made an\n\nidol consecration at Sabarimala years back and after the\n\nrampage of fire at Sabarimala, it was Kantaru Shankaru who\n\nconsecrated the existing idol in Sabarimala. The respondent no. 4\n\nhas submitted that the Thantri is the vedic head priest of Hindu\n\ntemples in Kerala and the popularity of any temple depends to a\n\ngreat extent on the Thantri and Santhikkaran (Archaka) who\n\nmust be able to induce a spiritual reverence among worshippers\n\nand explain the significance of the Mantras they recite and poojas\n\nthey perform.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_55\">44. The respondent no. 4 has averred that the custom and\n\nusage of young women (aged between 10 to 50 years) not being\n\nallowed to enter the Sabarimala temple has its traces in the basic\n\ntenets of the establishment of the temple, the deification of Lord\n\nAyyappa and His worship. As per the respondent no. 4, Ayyappa\n\nhad explained the manner in which the Sabarimala pilgrimage\n\nwas to be undertaken emphasizing the importance of „Vrutham‟\n\nwhich are special observances that need to be followed in order to\n\nachieve spiritual refinement, and that as a part of the „Vruthum‟,\n\nthe person going on pilgrimage separates himself from all family\n\nties for 41 days and during the said period either the woman\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">\f                                32</span>\n\n\nleaves the house or the man resides elsewhere in order to\n\nseparate himself from all family ties. Thereafter, the respondent\n\nno. 4 has pointed out that the problem with women is that they\n\ncannot complete the 41 days Vruthum as their periods would\n\neventually fall within the said period and it is a custom among all\n\nHindus that women do not go to temples or participate in\n\nreligious activities during periods and the same is substantiated\n\nby the statement of the basic Thantric text of temple worshipping\n\nin Kerala Thantra Samuchayam, Chapter 10, Verse II.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\">45. The respondent no. 4 has emphasized that the observance\n\nof 41 days Vruthum is a condition precedent for the pilgrimage\n\nwhich has been an age old custom and anyone who cannot fulfill\n\nthe said Vruthum cannot enter the temple and, hence, women\n\nwho have not attained puberty and those who are in menopause\n\nalone   can   undertake   the   pilgrimage   at   Sabarimala.   The\n\nrespondent no. 4 has also averred that the said condition of\n\nobservance of 41days Vruthum is not applicable to women alone\n\nand even men who cannot observe the 41 days Vruthum due to\n\nbirths and deaths in the family, which results in breaking of\n\nVruthum, are also not allowed to take the pilgrimage that year.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                  33</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">46. The respondent no. 4 has also drawn the attention of the\n\nCourt to the fact that religious customs as well as the traditional\n\nscience of Ayurveda consider menstrual period as an occasion for\n\nrest for women and a period of uncleanliness of the body and\n\nduring this period, women are affected by several discomforts\n\nand, hence, observance of intense spiritual discipline for 41 days\n\nis not possible. The respondent no. 4 has also contented that it is\n\nfor the sake of pilgrims who practise celibacy that young women\n\nare not allowed in the Sabarimala pilgrimage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">47. The respondent no. 4, thereafter, contends that the\n\nprohibition is not a social discrimination but is only a part of the\n\nessential spiritual discipline related to this particular pilgrimage\n\nand is clearly intended to keep the mind of the pilgrims away\n\nfrom the distraction related to sex as the dominant objective of\n\nthe pilgrimage is the creation of circumstances in all respects for\n\nthe successful practice of spiritual self-discipline.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_59\">48. The respondent no. 4 has also averred that for climbing the\n\n18 holy steps, one has to carry the irumudikettu (the sacred\n\npackage of offerings) and for making the pilgrimage really\n\nmeaningful, austerities for a period of 41 days have to be\n\nobserved and, hence, for a meaningful pilgrimage, it is always\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                34</span>\n\n\nprudent if women of the forbidden age group hold themselves\n\nback.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">49. The respondent no. 4 further submits that „devaprasanam‟\n\nis a ritual performed for answering questions pertaining to\n\nreligious practices when the Thantris are also unable to take\n\ndecisions and that „devaprasanams‟ conducted in the past also\n\nreveal that the deity does not want young women to enter the\n\nprecincts of the temple. As per the respondent no. 4, the\n\nphilosophy involved in evolving a particular aspect of power in a\n\ntemple is well reflected in the following mantra chanting during\n\nthe infusion of divine power:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     “O the Supreme Lord! It is well known that You\n     pervade everything and everywhere‟ yet I am invoking\n     You in this bimbhamvery much like a fan that gathers\n     and activates the all-pervading air at a particular spot.\n     At the fire latent in wood expresses itself through\n     friction, O Lord be specially active in this bimbhamas a\n     result of sacred act.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_61\">50. The respondent no. 4 is of the view that it is the particular\n\ncharacteristic of the field of power, its maintenance and impact\n\nwhich the „Devaprasanam‟ deals with and „Devaprasanam‟\n\nconfirms that the practice of women of particular age group not\n\nparticipating in the temple should be maintained.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">\f                                 35</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1915943\" id=\"span_76\">51.

The applicant/intervenor\n\nfurther highlights that during the said period, the pilgrims\n\ncoming to the temple must strictly follow the rituals which\n\nincludes taking a 41 days Vruthum and one of the rituals\n\npertains to not touching the ladies including daughters and wives\n\nas well. The applicant/intervenor has further submitted that if\n\nthe restriction under <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 3(b)</a> of the Kerala Hindu Places of\n\nWorship (Authorization of Entry) Rules, 1965 is allowed to\n\noperate only for the said period of 60 days, it would not amount\n\nto any violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_117\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_118\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_119\">17</a> of the Constitution and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">\f                                 37</span>\n\n\nit would also be well within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_120\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_121\">26</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_67\">Rejoinder Submissions on behalf of the Petitioners\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">55. In reply to the contention of the respondent no. 2-\n\nDevaswom Board that the writ jurisdiction does not lie in the\n\npresent matter, the petitioners submit that the validity of <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_122\">Section\n\n3(b)</a> could not have been challenged in suit proceedings as the\n\npresent writ petition has been filed against the State authorities\n\nand the Chief Thantri who has been impleaded as the respondent\n\nno. 4 is appointed by a Statutory Board; and since now „custom\n\nand usage‟ fall under the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 13</a>, they have become\n\nsubject to the constitutional provisions contained in Part III\n\nwhose violation can only be challenged in writ jurisdiction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">56. Thereafter,    the   petitioners   have    submitted   that   the\n\nrespondent no. 2 has merely pressed the theory of intelligible\n\ndifferentia to justify encircling of women of prohibited age without\n\nelaborating the object sought to be achieved and whether the\n\ndifferentia even has any nexus with the object and the object of\n\npreventing deflecting of the idol from the stage of celibacy cannot\n\nbe achieved from the present classification.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                                    38</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">57. Further, the petitioners have submitted that the respondent\n\nno. 2 has wrongly stated that the Sabarimala temple is a\n\nreligious denomination, for any temple under a statutory board\n\nlike a Devaswom Board and financed out of the Consolidated\n\nFund of Kerala and whose employees are employed by the Kerala\n\nService Commission cannot claim to be an independent „religious\n\ndenomination‟.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_72\">58. Besides, the petitioners have contended that several ill-\n\npractices in existence and falling within the ambit of religion as\n\ncited by the respondent no. 2 may not be acceptable today and\n\nthe said practices have not come up before this Court and should\n\nnot be taken cognizance of. Further, it is the view of the\n\npetitioners that the said practices cannot be held to be the\n\nessence of religion as they had evolved out of convenience and, in\n\ndue course of time, have become crude accretions. To prove its\n\npoint, the petitioners have cited the examples of the practices of\n\ndowry and restriction of women from entering mosques which,\n\nalthough had come into existence due to certain factors existing\n\nat the relevant time, no longer apply.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">59. Thereafter,      the    petitioners   have     contended     that   if\n\nSabarimala    does    not    come    in   the    category   of   religious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">\f                                39</span>\n\n\ndenomination, then it cannot claim the right under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 26</a> and\n\nit would come within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 12</a> making it subject\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_126\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_127\">15</a> and, hence, the State would be restrained\n\nfrom denying equal protection of law and cannot discriminate on\n\nthe basis of sex. Even if it is concluded that Sabarimala is a\n\nreligious denomination, then as per the Devaru case, there has\n\nto be a harmonious construction between <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_128\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_129\">26</a> of\n\nthe Constitution and, thus, to completely deny women of the age\n\ngroup of 10 to 50 years from entering the temple would be\n\nimpermissible as per the Devaru case. Finally, the petitioners\n\nhave submitted that in legal and constitutional parlance, after\n\ncoming into effect of the Constitution of India, „dignity of women‟\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1431035/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 51A(e)</a> is an essential ingredient of constitutional\n\nmorality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_74\">Rejoinder Submissions on behalf of Intervenor in I.A No. 10\nof 2016\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_75\">60. The applicant/intervenor has submitted that the law\n\nrelating to entry into temple for darshan is separate and distinct\n\nfrom the law relating to management of religious affairs. The\n\nformer is governed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 25</a> and the latter is governed by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 26.</a> Further, the applicant/intervenor has pointed out that\n\neven those institutions which are held to be denominations and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">\f                                40</span>\n\n\nclaim protection under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 26</a> cannot deny entry to any\n\nperson for the purpose of darshan and the ex facie denial of\n\nwomen between the age group of 10 to 50 years violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_134\">Articles\n\n14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_135\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_137\">25</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_84\">61. Thereafter, the applicant/intervenor has averred that the\n\nquestion whether Sabarimala is a denomination or not is\n\nirrelevant for the reason that even if it is concluded that\n\nSabarimala is a denomination, it can claim protection of only\n\nessential practices under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 26(b)</a> and denial of entry to\n\nwomen between the age of 10 to 50 years cannot be said to be an\n\nessential   aspect   of   the   Hindu    religion.   Further,   the\n\napplicant/intervenor has also averred that Sabarimala does not\n\nsatisfy the test of religious denomination as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/312939/\" id=\"a_139\">S.P.\n\nMittal</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"143215272\" id=\"span_85\">62. The applicant/intervenor has also submitted that the\n\nrespondents, by referring to the practice as a custom with\n\naberrations, have themselves suggested that there has been no\n\ncontinuity in the applicability of the said custom and that it has\n\nalso been established in the evidence before the High Court that\n\nwomen irrespective of their age were permitted to enter the\n\nSabarimala for the first rice feeding ceremony of their children\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">\f                                        41</span>\n\n\nand it is only since the last 60 years after the passing of the\n\nNotification in 1955 that women between the age of 10 to 50\n\nyears          were     prohibited   from    entering   the     temple.   The\n\napplicant/intervenor has also pointed out that even if the said\n\npractice is considered to be a custom, it has to still pass the test\n\nof constitutional morality and constitutional legitimacy and the\n\napplicant/intervenor has relied upon the decision of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/143215272/\" id=\"a_140\">Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal Nala Sangam and others v.\n\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu and others</a>                     21    wherein it was\n\nobserved:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"641343\" id=\"span_87\">“48. <a href=\"/doc/641343/\" id=\"a_141\">Seshammal vs State of T.N.</a>, (1972) 2 SCC 11] is\n          not an authority for any proposition as to what an\n          Agama or a set of Agamas governing a particular or\n          group of temples lay down with regard to the question\n          that confronts the court, namely, whether any\n          particular denomination of worshippers or believers\n          have an exclusive right to be appointed as Archakas to\n          perform the poojas. Much less, has the judgment\n          taken note of the particular class or caste to which the\n          Archakas of a temple must belong asprescribed by the\n          Agamas.

In reply to the contention of the respondents that the basis\n\nfor exclusion of women is that women cannot observe the 41 days\n\nVruthum and also on the ground that Ayyappa is a celibate God,\n\nthe applicant/intervenor has submitted that the meaning of\n\ncelibacy is the abstinence from sex and the respondents by\n\nsuggesting that women cannot practice Vruthum which requires\n\nabstinence from sex are stigmatizing women and stereotyping\n\nthem as being weak and lesser human beings than men. Hence,\n\nthe classification, in view of the applicant/intervenor, is not\n\nbased on intelligible differentia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_79\">64. The     applicant/intervenor          has   also   submitted   that\n\nmenstruating women and untouchables are being treated as\n\nsimilar in terms of entry to temple and, hence, the custom in\n\ndispute amounts to „untouchability‟.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">\f                                       43</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_80\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"512761\" id=\"span_92\">65. The             applicant/intervenor    has,   thereafter,   drawn   the\n\nattention of the Court to the fact that although the respondents\n\naver that they do not intend to discriminate on the basis of\n\ngender, yet the Court has to test the violation of the fundamental\n\nrights not on the basis of intention but the impact of the\n\nimpugned action.

The applicant/intervenor has also submitted that the age-\n\nold practice of considering women as impure while they are\n\nmenstruating amounts to untouchability and stigmatizes them as\n\nlesser human beings and is, therefore, violative of Articles14, 15,\n\n17 and 21 of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_83\">Submissions of learned Amicus Curiae, Sr. Advocate Mr. Raju\nRamchandran, assisted by Mr. K.

It is submitted on the behalf of learned Senior Advocate Mr.\n\nRaju Ramchandran, that the Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha\n\nTemple, Kerala is a public temple being used as a place of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">22</span>\n     (1995) 5 SCC 220\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">\f                                44</span>\n\n\nworship where members of the public are admitted as a matter of\n\nright and entry thereto is not restricted to any particular\n\ndenomination or part thereof. As per the learned Amicus, the\n\npublic character of the temple gives birth to the right of the\n\ndevotees to enter it for the purpose of darshan or worship and\n\nthis universal right to entry is not a permissive right dependent\n\nupon the temple authorities but a legal right in the true sense of\n\nthe expression. To advance this view, the learned Amicus has\n\nrelied upon the decisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/667935/\" id=\"a_148\">Deoki Nandan v.\n\nMurlidhar</a> and others23 and <a href=\"/doc/102200/\" id=\"a_149\">Sri Radhakanta Deb and\n\nanother v.

As regards the nature of the right claimed by the petitioners\n\nherein, learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Raju Ramchandran, the\n\nlearned Amicus, has submitted that it is the freedom of\n\nconscience and the right to practise and profess their religion\n\nwhich is recognized under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\nThis right, as per the learned Amicus, encompasses the liberty of\n\nbelief, faith and worship, pithily declared as a constitutional\n\nvision in the Preamble to the Constitution of India.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">23</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">     AIR 1957 SC 133\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">24</span>\n     (1981) 2 SCC 226\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">\f                                  45</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">69. Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Raju Ramchandran, the\n\nlearned Amicus, submits that the right of a woman to visit and\n\nenter a temple as a devotee of the deity and as a believer in\n\nHindu faith is an essential aspect of her right to worship without\n\nwhich her right to worship is significantly denuded. <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 25</a>\n\npertinently declares that all persons are „equally‟ entitled to freely\n\npractise religion. This, in view of the learned Amicus, implies not\n\njust inter-faith but intra-faith parity. Therefore, the primary right\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 25(1)</a> is a non-discriminatory right and is, thus,\n\navailable to men and women professing the same faith.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">70. Further, it has been put forth that the constitutional intent\n\nin keeping the understanding of untouchability in <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 17</a>\n\nopen-textured was to abolish all practices based on the notion of\n\npurity and pollution. This Article proscribes untouchability „in\n\nany form‟ as prohibited and the exclusion of menstruating\n\nwomen from religious spaces and practices is no less a form of\n\ndiscrimination than the exclusion of oppressed castes. After\n\nreferring to <a href=\"/doc/1326407/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 7(c)</a> of the Civil Rights Act, 1955, which\n\ncriminalizes the encouragement and incitement to practise\n\nuntouchability in „any form whatsoever‟ and the Explanation II\n\nappended to the said Section, the learned Amicus has submitted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">\f                                  46</span>\n\n\nthat untouchability cannot be understood in a pedantic sense\n\nbut must be understood in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/3026506/\" id=\"a_155\">Civil Rights Act</a> to\n\ninclude any exclusion based on the notions of purity and\n\npollution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">71. It is also the view of the learned Amicus that the phrase\n\n„equally entitled to‟ in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 25(1)</a> finds resonance in <a href=\"/doc/35915548/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 3(a)</a>\n\nof the Civil Rights Act, 1955 which criminalizes exclusion of\n\npeople to those places which are “open to other persons\n\nprofessing the same religion or any section thereof, as such\n\nperson” and prevention of worship “in the same manner and to\n\nthe same extent as is permissible to other persons professing the\n\nsame religion or any section thereof, as such persons”. That\n\napart, the learned Amicus has drawn our attention to <a href=\"/doc/12881554/\" id=\"a_158\">Section\n\n2(d)</a> of the 1955 Act which defines „place of public worship‟ to\n\nmean, inter alia, „by whatever name belonging to any religious\n\ndenomination or any section thereof, for the performance of any\n\nreligious service‟ and, therefore, the Amicus submits that a\n\ntemple is a public temple and irrespective of its denominational\n\ncharacter, it cannot prevent the entry of any devotee aspiring to\n\nenter and worship.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">\f                                   47</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_90\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_102\">72.

It has also been submitted by the Amicus Curiae that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> is not a mere enabling provision but is a\n\nsubstantive right as it creates an exception for laws providing for\n\nsocial reform or throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a\n\npublic character to all classes and sections of Hindus and\n\nthereby   embodies       the   constitutional   intent   of   abhorring\n\nexclusionary practices. Further, referring to the judgment of this\n\nCourt in Devaru (supra), the learned Amicus has submitted that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> does not merely seek to prevent exclusionary\n\npractices on the basis of caste only, for the rights under Part III of\n\nthe Constitution must be given a broad meaning and any\n\nexception must be given a narrow construction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"143215272\" id=\"span_103\">74.

After referring to Section 3 of the Kerala Hindu Places of\n\nPublic Worship (Authorization of Entry) Act, 1965 which makes a\n\nplace of worship open to all sections and classes, Mr. Raju\n\nRamchandran, learned senior counsel, is of the view that the said\n\nSection is nothing but a statutory enunciation of rights embodied\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> and similarly, the emphasis on the word\n\n„like‟ in <a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 3</a> is the statutory reflection of the phrase „equally‟\n\nfound in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_169\">Article 25(1).</a> That apart, it is the case of the learned\n\nAmicus curiae that the expression „section‟ or „class‟ in <a href=\"/doc/2851408/\" id=\"a_170\">Section\n\n2(c)</a> of the 1965 Act must necessarily include all sexes if <a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_171\">Section\n\n3</a> is to be in consonance with a woman‟s right to worship under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 25</a> and in consonance with <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 15.</a> As per the learned\n\nAmicus, women between the age of 10 to 50 years are a section\n\nor class of Hindus who are within the inclusive provision of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 3</a> and the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 3</a> brings in the right\n\nconferred in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 26</a>, for the inter-play between <a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 3</a> and\n\nthe proviso must be governed by how <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_178\">Articles 25(2)(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_179\">26</a> are\n\nreconciled by the judgment of this Court in Devaru (supra).\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">\f                                50</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">77. It have been asseverated by Mr. Raju Ramchandran, learned\n\nsenior counsel, that Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of\n\nPublic Worship (Authorization of Entry) Rules, 1965 is ultra vires\n\n<a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_180\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/104300010/\" id=\"a_181\">4</a> of the 1965 Act, for the reason that it protects\n\n„custom and usage‟ which may prohibit entry when <a href=\"/doc/192961113/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 3</a>\n\nexpressly overrides custom and usage. The said rule, in view of\n\nthe learned Amicus, discriminates against women when <a href=\"/doc/104300010/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 4</a>\n\nmakes it clear that rules made under it cannot be discriminatory\n\nagainst any section or class. It is submitted that the power\n\nentrusted under the 1965 Act to make rules, inter alia, for due\n\nobservance of religious rights and ceremonies is for the\n\nfurtherance of a devotee‟s right to worship under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 25</a>,\n\nwhereas to the contrary, Rule 3(b), by saving „custom and usage‟,\n\nmilitates against the very purpose of the 1965 Act which is to\n\nprotect the right to worship guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 25.</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">78. It has also been pointed out that there is another Rule,\n\nsimilar to Rule 3(b), in the form of Rule 6(c) framed under the\n\n1950 Act, which was relied upon by the High Court and this Rule\n\n6(c) has not been assailed by the petitioners in the present writ\n\npetition, but in view of the learned Amicus, this Rule 6(c) would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">\f                                 51</span>\n\n\nalso be unconstitutional for the same reason that Rule 3(b) is\n\nunconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1915943\" id=\"span_110\">79. The burden to prove that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa form\n\na denomination within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_186\">Article 26</a>, as per the\n\nlearned Amicus, is on the respondents, which they have failed to\n\ndischarge as none of the three tests for determination of\n\ndenominational status, i.e., (i) common faith, (ii) common\n\norganization and (iii) designation by a distinctive name, have\n\nbeen established by the respondents. Further, the Amicus has\n\nsubmitted that the decision of the Kerala High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1915943/\" id=\"a_187\">S.\n\nMahendran</a> (supra) does not indicate finding of a denominational\n\nstatus.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1915943\" id=\"span_111\">80.

The learned Amicus also averred that even if we are to\n\nassume that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa constitute a separate\n\ndenomination, the rights conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_189\">Article 26</a> being subject\n\nto the constitutional standard of morality, exclusion of women\n\nfrom entry would violate this standard of morality for a\n\ndenomination‟s right to manage its affairs in matters of religion\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 26(b)</a> is subject to <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> as has been\n\nsuccinctly explained by this Court in Devaru (supra) by\n\nobserving thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">     “And lastly, it is argued that whereas <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 25</a> deals\n     with the rights of individuals, <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_193\">Article 26</a> protects the\n     rights of denominations, and that as what the\n     appellants claim is the right of the Gowda Saraswath\n     Brahmins to exclude those who do not belong to that\n     denomination, that would remain unaffected by <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_194\">Article\n     25(2)(b).</a> This contention ignores the true nature of the\n     right conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 25(2)(b).</a> That is a right\n     conferred on &quot;all classes and sections of Hindus&quot; to\n     enter into a public temple, and on the unqualified\n     terms of that Article, that right must be available,\n     whether it is sought to be exercised against an\n     individual under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 25(1)</a> or against a\n     denomination under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 26(b).</a> The fact is that\n     though <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 25(1)</a> deals with rights of individuals,\n     <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_199\">Art. 25(2)</a> is much wider in its contents and has\n     reference to the rights of communities, and controls\n     both <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 26(b)</a>.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">\f                                53</span>\n\n\nSubmissions of learned Amicus Curiae, Senior Advocate Mr.\nK.

It has been asseverated by learned Senior Advocate Mr. K.\n\nRamamoorthy, learned Amicus curiae, that in all prominent\n\nHindu temples in India, there had been some religious practices\n\nbased on religious beliefs, which are essential part of the Hindu\n\nreligion as considered by people for a long time. It has been\n\nsubmitted that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa could also be\n\nbrought within the ambit of religious denomination who have\n\nbeen following the impugned religious practice which has been\n\nessential part of religion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_102\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_103\">83. Mr. K.

It is also submitted by Mr. K.\n\nRamamoorthy that in any of the judgments cited by the\n\npetitioners, the question never arose as to what the religious\n\npractice on the basis of religious belief is and, accordingly, the\n\nquestion as to whether religious practices based on religious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">\f                                  54</span>\n\n\nbeliefs in all prominent temples in India are violative of\n\nArticles14, 15, 17, 21 and 25 of the Constitution is to be\n\nconsidered herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_104\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">84. It has been put forth by Mr. K.

It has been submitted that what\n\nconstitutes an essential part of a religious practice is to be\n\ndecided with reference to the practices which are regarded by a\n\nlarge section of the community for several centuries and,\n\ntherefore, would have to be treated as a part of the religion.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_106\">85. It has also been averred that Ayyappa temple by itself is a\n\ndenomination as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 26</a> having regard to\n\nthe nature of worship and the practices followed by the temple\n\nand similarly, the devotees of Ayyappa temple would also\n\nconstitute a denomination who have accepted the impugned\n\nreligious practice based on religious belief which has been in\n\nvogue for several centuries unbroken and accepted by all sections\n\nof Hindus.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">\f                                 55</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_107\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">86. It has been submitted that it is too late in the day to\n\ncontend that religious practice based on religious faith, adhered\n\nto and followed by millions of Hindus for so long in consonance\n\nwith the natural rights of men and women is violative of\n\nfundamental rights. It is also the case of the Amicus Mr. K.\n\nRamamoorthy that to project such a religious practice as being\n\ncontrary to natural law is a shock to the judgment of the\n\ncommunity, as calling such a religious practice contrary to\n\nfundamental rights amounts to offending the common sense and\n\nwisdom of our ancestors in faithfully following the command of\n\nthe divine. Further, no group or individual can force other\n\nHindus to follow their view in the domain of religious faith.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_109\">87. As regards the challenge raised by the petitioners against\n\nRule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship\n\n(Authorization of Entry) Rules, 1965, it is asseverated by Mr. K.\n\nRamamoorthy      that the question which arises is whether the\n\nState Government, with reference to such a religious practice,\n\ncould make a rule so that the general public would know the\n\ndenominational character of the temple and the religious practice\n\nfollowed by the temple.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">\f                                56</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">\n\n\nFollowers of Lord Ayyappa do not constitute a religious\ndenomination\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">88. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_206\">Article 26</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees to every\n\nreligious denomination the right (a) to establish and maintain\n\ninstitutions for religious and charitable purposes; (b) to manage\n\nits own affairs in matters of religion; (c) to own and acquire\n\nmovable and immovable property; and (d) to administer such\n\nproperty in accordance with law.

The important question that emerges is as to what\n\nconstitutes a religious denomination. The said question has been\n\nthe subject matter of several decisions of this Court beginning\n\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/1430396/\" id=\"a_207\">Shirur Mutt</a> (supra) wherein the Court observed thus:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      “As regards <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 26</a>, the first question is, what is\n      the precise meaning or connotation of the expression\n      &quot;religious denomination&quot; and whether a Math could\n      come       within   this    expression.    The    word\n      &quot;denomination&quot; has been defined in the Oxford\n      Dictionary to mean &#x27;a collection of individuals\n      classed together under the same name: a religious\n      sect or body having a common faith and\n      Organisation and designated by a distinctive name.\n      It is well known that the practice of setting up Maths\n      as centres of the logical teaching was started by Shri\n      Sankaracharya and was followed by various teachers\n      since then. After Sankara, came a galaxy of religious\n      teachers and philosophers who founded the different\n      sects and sub-sects of the Hindu religion that we\n      find in India at the present day. Each one of such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">\f                                 57</span>\n\n\n      sects or sub-sects can certainly be balled a religious\n      denomination, as it is designated by a distinctive\n      name, -in many cases it is the name of the founder, -\n      and has a common faith and common spiritual\n      organization. The followers of Ramanuja, who are\n      known by the name of Shri Vaishnabas, undoubtedly\n      constitute a religious denomination; and so do the\n      followers of Madhwacharya and other religious\n      teachers. It is a fact well established by tradition that\n      the    eight     UdipiMaths       were    founded      by\n      Madhwacharya himself and the trustees and the\n      beneficiaries of these Maths profess to be followers of\n      that teacher. The High Court has found that the\n      Math in question is in charge of the Sivalli Brahmins\n      who constitute a section of the followers of\n      Madhwacharya. As <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_209\">article 26</a> contemplates not\n      merely a religious denomination but also a section\n      thereof, the Math or the spiritual fraternity\n      represented by it can legitimately come within the\n      purview of this article.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">90. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_119\">In <a href=\"/doc/312939/\" id=\"a_210\">S.P.

Sri\n\nAurobindo postulated the philosophy of cosmic salvation and\n\nalong with the disciples found the Aurobindo Society for\n\npreaching and propagating the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and\n\nThe Mother through its centres in India as well as abroad. After\n\nthe death of Sri Aurobindo, the Mother proposed an international\n\ncultural township, Auroville, in the then Pondicherry. The society\n\nreceived funds as grants from the Central Government, State\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">\f                                 58</span>\n\n\nGovernment and other organizations in India as well as from\n\noutside India for development of the township at Auroville. Upon\n\nthe death of the Mother, the Government started receiving\n\ncomplaints about the mismanagement of the society and,\n\naccordingly, enacted the <a href=\"/doc/909838/\" id=\"a_214\">Auroville (Emergency) Provisions Act,\n\n1980</a>. The Supreme Court, by a majority of 4:1, ruled that neither\n\nthe society nor the township of Auroville constituted a religious\n\ndenomination, for the teachings and utterances of Sri Aurobindo\n\ndid not constitute a religion and, therefore, taking over of the\n\nAuroville by the Government did not infringe the society‟s right\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_215\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_216\">26</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">91. The Court referred, inter alia, to the MoA of the society along\n\nwith Rule 9 of the Rules and Regulations of Sri Aurobindo Society\n\nwhich dealt with membership and read thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      “9. Any person or institution for organisation either\n      in India or abroad who subscribes to the aims and\n      objects of the Society, and whose application for\n      membership is approved by the                  Executive\n      Committee, will be member of the Society. The\n      membership is open to people everywhere without\n      any distinction of nationality, religion, caste, creed or\n      sex.”\n\n\nAfter so referring, the Court opined thus:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">\f                               59</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     “The only condition for membership is that the\n     person seeking the membership of the Society must\n     subscribe to the aims and objects of the Society. It\n     was further urged that what is universal cannot be a\n     religious denomination. In order to constitute a\n     separate denomination, there must be something\n     distinct from another. A denomination, argues the\n     counsel, is one which is different from the other and\n     if the Society was a religious denomination, then the\n     person seeking admission to the institution would\n     lose his previous religion. He cannot be a member of\n     two religions at one and the same time. But this is\n     not the position in becoming a member of the Society\n     and Auroville. A religious denomination must\n     necessarily be a new one and new methodology must\n     be provided for a religion. Substantially, the view\n     taken by Sri Aurobindo remains a part of the Hindu\n     philosophy.

It was argued in this\n\ncase that the Vellala Community observed special religious\n\npractices and beliefs which are integral part of their religion and\n\nthat the front mandappam of the sanctorium is open to access\n\nonly to the members of their community and no one else and\n\noutsiders can offer worship from the outer compound.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_126\">The Court\n\nheld that the temple at Nellor owned by the Vellala Community of\n\nMarthandam did not constitute a religious denomination as there\n\nwas no evidence to prove that the members of the Vellala\n\nCommunity had common religious tenets peculiar to themselves\n\nother than those which are common to the entire Hindu\n\ncommunity and further, the Court, following the principle <a href=\"/doc/491463/\" id=\"a_222\">laid\n\ndown in</a> <a href=\"/doc/312939/\" id=\"a_223\">S.P.

Though, the respondents have urged that the pilgrims\n\ncoming to visit the Sabarimala temple being devotees of Lord\n\nAyyappa are addressed as Ayyappans and, therefore, the third\n\ncondition for a religious denomination stands satisfied, is\n\nunacceptable.   There is no identified group called Ayyappans.\n\nEvery Hindu devotee can go to the temple. We have also been\n\napprised that there are other temples for Lord Ayyappa and there\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">\f                                  62</span>\n\n\nis no such prohibition.     Therefore, there is no identified sect.\n\nAccordingly, we hold, without any hesitation, that Sabarimala\n\ntemple is a public religious endowment and there are no\n\nexclusive identified followers of the cult.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">96. Coming to the first and the most important condition for a\n\nreligious denomination, i.e., the collection of individuals ought to\n\nhave a system of beliefs or doctrines which they regard as\n\nconducive to their spiritual well-being, there is nothing on record\n\nto show that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa have any common\n\nreligious tenets peculiar to themselves, which they regard as\n\nconducive to their spiritual well-being, other than those which\n\nare common to the Hindu religion. Therefore, the devotees of Lord\n\nAyyappa are just Hindus and do not constitute a separate\n\nreligious denomination. For a religious denomination, there must\n\nbe new methodology provided for a religion. Mere observance of\n\ncertain practices, even though from a long time, does not make it\n\na distinct religion on that account.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_120\">Enforceability of Fundamental Rights under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 25(1)</a> against\nthe Travancore Devaswom Board\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">97.

It needs to be understood that the kernel of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 26</a> is\n\n„establishment of a religious institution‟ so as to acclaim the\n\nstatus   of   religious    denomination.   Whereas,   <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_234\">Article   25(1)</a>\n\nguarantees the right to practise religion to every individual and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">\f                                 64</span>\n\n\nthe act of practice is concerned, primarily, with religious worship,\n\nrituals and observations as held in <a href=\"/doc/1308071/\" id=\"a_235\">Rev.

The right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_237\">Article 25(1)</a> has nothing to do\n\nwith gender or, for that matter, certain physiological factors,\n\nspecifically attributable to women. Women of any age group have\n\nas much a right as men to visit and enter a temple in order to\n\nfreely practise a religion as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 25(1).</a> When\n\nwe say so, we are absolutely alive to the fact that whether any\n\nsuch proposed exclusion of women from entry into religious\n\nplaces forms an essential part of a religion would be examined at\n\na subsequent stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">101. We have no hesitation to say that such an exclusionary\n\npractice violates the right of women to visit and enter a temple to\n\nfreely practise Hindu religion and to exhibit her devotion towards\n\nLord Ayyappa. The denial of this right to women significantly\n\ndenudes them of their right to worship.

Therefore, the right to practise religion under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 25(1)</a>,\n\nin its broad contour, encompasses a non-discriminatory right\n\nwhich is equally available to both men and women of all age\n\ngroups professing the same religion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_126\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"801837\" id=\"span_136\">102. Though not in reference to men or women, yet in the context\n\nof any Hindu worshipper seeking entry in a temple which is a\n\npublic place of worship for Hindus, the observations of the\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/801837/\" id=\"a_241\">Nar Hari Shastri and others v.

Another authoritative pronouncement in regard to the\n\nfreedom to practise a religion freely without with any fictitious\n\nand    vague     constraint     is    the    case     of    <a href=\"/doc/1723440/\" id=\"a_242\">Acharya\n\nJagadishwarananda Avadhuta</a> (supra), wherein the Court\n\nobserved thus:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_130\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      “The full concept and scope of religious freedom is\n      that there are no restraints upon the free exercise of\n      religion according to the dictates of one&#x27;s conscience\n      or upon the right freely to profess, practice and\n      propagate religion save those imposed under the\n      police power of the State and the other provisions of\n      Part II of the Constitution. This means the right to\n      worship God according to the dictates of one&#x27;s\n      conscience. Man&#x27;s relation to his God is made no\n      concern for the State. Freedom of conscience and\n      religious belief cannot, however, be, set up to avoid\n      those duties which every citizen owes to the nation;\n      e.g. to receive military training, to take an oath\n      expressing willingness to perform military service\n      and so on.”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">104. Therefore, it can be said without any hesitation or\n\nreservation that the impugned Rule 3(b) of the 1965 Rules,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">\f                                  67</span>\n\n\nframed in pursuance of the 1965 Act, that stipulates exclusion of\n\nentry of women of the age group of 10 to 50 years, is a clear\n\nviolation of the right of such women to practise their religious\n\nbelief which, in consequence, makes their fundamental right\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_243\">Article 25(1)</a> a dead letter. It is clear as crystal that as long\n\nas the devotees, irrespective of their gender and/or age group,\n\nseeking entry to a temple of any caste are Hindus, it is their legal\n\nright to enter into a temple and offer prayers. The women, in the\n\ncase at hand, are also Hindus and so, there is neither any viable\n\nnor any legal limitation on their right to enter into the\n\nSabarimala Temple as devotees of Lord Ayyappa and offer their\n\nprayers to the deity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_132\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_133\">105. When we say so, we may also make it clear that the said\n\nrule of exclusion cannot be justified on the ground that allowing\n\nentry to women of the said age group would, in any way, be\n\nharmful or would play a jeopardizing role to public order,\n\nmorality, health or, for that matter, any other provision/s of Part\n\nIII of the Constitution, for it is to these precepts that the right\n\nguaranteed under Article 25(1) has been made subject to.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">106. The term „morality‟ occurring in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_244\">Article 25(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution cannot be viewed with a narrow lens so as to confine\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">\f                                    68</span>\n\n\nthe sphere of definition of morality to what an individual, a\n\nsection or religious sect may perceive the term to mean.

It actually works at the\n      fulcrum and guides as a laser beam in institution\n      building. The traditions and conventions have to\n      grow to sustain the value of such a morality.

Having said so, the notions of public order, morality and\n\nhealth cannot be used as colourable device to restrict the\n\nfreedom to freely practise religion and discriminate against\n\nwomen of the age group of 10 to 50 years by denying them their\n\nlegal right to enter and offer their prayers at the Sabarimala\n\ntemple for the simple reason that public morality must yield to\n\nconstitutional morality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_143\">\nWhether exclusionary practice is an essential practice as per\nHindu religion\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_149\">112.

In the light of the above authorities, it has to be determined\n\nwhether the practice of exclusion of women of the age group of 10\n\nto 50 years is equivalent to a doctrine of Hindu religion or a\n\npractice that could be regarded as an essential part of the Hindu\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">\f                                78</span>\n\n\nreligion and whether the nature of Hindu religion would be\n\naltered without the said exclusionary practice. The answer to\n\nthese questions, in our considered opinion, is in the firm\n\nnegative. In no scenario, it can be said that exclusion of women\n\nof any age group could be regarded as an essential practice of\n\nHindu religion and on the contrary, it is an essential part of the\n\nHindu religion to allow Hindu women to enter into a temple as\n\ndevotees and followers of Hindu religion and offer their prayers to\n\nthe deity.

By allowing women to enter into the Sabarimala temple for\n\noffering prayers, it cannot be imagined that the nature of Hindu\n\nreligion would be fundamentally altered or changed in any\n\nmanner. Therefore, the exclusionary practice, which has been\n\ngiven the backing of a subordinate legislation in the form of Rule\n\n3(b) of the 1965 Rules, framed by the virtue of the 1965 Act, is\n\nneither an essential nor an integral part of the Hindu religion\n\nwithout which Hindu religion, of which the devotees of Lord\n\nAyyappa are followers, will not survive.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">\f                                  79</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_157\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">124.

Such a general\n              delegation may not be held to be laying down any\n              guidelines. Thus, by reason of such a provision\n              alone, the Regulation-making power cannot be\n              exercised so as to bring into existence\n              substantive rights or obligations or disabilities\n              which are not contemplated in terms of the\n              provisions of the said Act.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">139.

The Court, further, went on to hold\n\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">              &quot;The image of law which flows from this\n              framework is its neutrality and objectivity: the\n              ability of law to put sphere of general decision-\n              making outside the discretionary power of those\n              wielding governmental power. Law has to provide\n              a basic level of &quot;legal security&quot; by assuring that\n              law is knowable, dependable and shielded from\n              excessive manipulation.

The question\n              which needs to be asked is whether delegated\n              legislation promotes rational and accountable\n              policy implementation. While we say so, we are\n              not oblivious of the contours of the judicial\n              review of the legislative Acts.

These questions arise in the backdrop of an\n\nextremely famous temple at Sabarimala in which the idol of Lord\n\nAyyappa is installed. According to the Respondents, the said temple,\n\nthough open to all members of the public regardless of caste, creed, or\n\nreligion, is a denominational temple which claims the fundamental right\n\nto manage its own affairs in matters relating to religion. The question\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                                                                          1</span>\n\fthat arises is whether the complete exclusion of women between the\n\nages of 10 and 50 from entry, and consequently, of worship in this\n\ntemple, based upon a biological factor which is exclusive to women\n\nonly, and which is based upon custom allegedly constituting an\n\nessential part of religion, can be said to be violative of their rights\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_337\">Article 25.</a> Consequently, whether such women are covered by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_338\">Section 3</a> of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation\n\nof Entry) Act, 1965 and whether Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places\n\nof Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965 is violative of\n\ntheir fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_339\">Article 25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 15(1)</a>, and ultra\n\nvires the parent Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_189\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_190\">2.

As the\n        Panda as well as his client are both Hindu\n        worshippers, there can be nothing wrong in the one‘s\n        accompanying the other inside the temple and subject\n        to what we will state presently, the fact that the pilgrim,\n        being a stranger to the spot, takes the assistance of\n        the Panda in the matter of ‗darshan‘ or worship of the\n        deities or that the Panda gets remuneration from his\n        client for the services he renders, does not in any way\n        affect the legal rights of either of them. In law, it makes\n        no difference whether one performs the act of worship\n        himself or is aided or guided by another in the\n        performance of them. If the Pandas claim any special\n        right which is not enjoyed ordinarily by members of the\n        Hindu public, they would undoubtedly have to\n        establish such rights on the basis of custom, usage or\n        otherwise.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                                                                           3</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">\fThis right of entry into a public temple is, however, not\nan unregulated or unrestricted right. It is open to the\ntrustees of a public temple to regulate the time of\npublic visits and fix certain hours of the day during\nwhich alone members of the public would be allowed\naccess to the shrine. The public may also be denied\naccess to certain particularly sacred parts of the\ntemple, e.g., the inner sanctuary or as it is said the\n‗Holy of Holies‘ where the deity is actually located.\nQuite apart from these, it is always competent to the\ntemple authorities to make and enforce rules to ensure\ngood order and decency of worship and prevent\novercrowding in a temple. Good conduct or orderly\nbehaviour is always an obligatory condition of\nadmission into a temple [Vide Kalidas Jivram v. Gor\nParjaram, I.L.R. 15 Bom. p. 309; Thackeray v.\nHarbhum, I.L.R. 8 Bom. p. 432], and this principle has\nbeen accepted by and recognised in the Shri\nBadrinath Temple Act, section 25 of which provides for\nframing of bye-laws by the temple committee inter alia\nfor maintenance of order inside the temple and\nregulating the entry of persons within it [Vide Section\n25(1)(m)].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">The true position, therefore, is that the plaintiffs‘ right\nof entering the temple along with their Yajmans is not\na precarious or a permissive right depending for its\nexistence upon the arbitrary discretion of the temple\nauthorities; it is a legal right in the true sense of the\nexpression but it can be exercised subject to the\nrestrictions which the temple committee may impose in\ngood faith for maintenance of order and decorum\nwithin the temple and for ensuring proper performance\nof customary worship.

The word\n―denomination‖ has been defined in the Oxford\nDictionary to mean ―a collection of individuals\nclassed together under the same name: a religious\nsect or body having a common faith and\norganisation and designated by a distinctive name‖.\nIt is well known that the practice of setting up Maths\nas centers of theological teaching was started by\nShri Sankaracharya and was followed by various\nteachers since then. After Sankara, came a galaxy\nof religious teachers and philosophers who founded\nthe different sects and sub-sects of the Hindu\nreligion that we find in India at the present day. Each\none of such sects or sub-sects can certainly be\ncalled a religious denomination, as it is designated\nby a distinctive name, — in many cases it is the\nname of the founder, and has a common faith and\ncommon spiritual organization. The followers of\nRamanuja, who are known by the name of Shri\nVaishnabas, undoubtedly constitute a religious\ndenomination; and so do the followers of\nMadhwacharya and other religious teachers. It is a\nfact well established by tradition that the eight Udipi\nMaths were founded by Madhwacharya himself and\nthe trustees and the beneficiaries of these Maths\nprofess to be followers of that teacher. The High\nCourt has found that the Math in question is in\ncharge of the Sivalli Brahmins who constitute a\nsection of the followers of Madhwacharya. As <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_366\">Article\n26</a>     contemplates not         merely a       religious\ndenomination but also a section thereof, the Math or\nthe spiritual fraternity represented by it can\nlegitimately come within the purview of this article.‖\n                                  (emphasis supplied)\n                                    (at pp. 1021-1022)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                                                           7</span>\n\fWith regard to what constitutes ―religion‖, ―religious practice‖, and\n\n―essential religious practices‖, as opposed to ―secular practices‖, this\n\nCourt held:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_194\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">         ―It will be seen that besides the right to manage its\n         own affairs in matters of religion, which is given by\n         clause (b), the next two clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_367\">Article 26</a>\n         guarantee to a religious denomination the right to\n         acquire and own property and to administer such\n         property in accordance with law. The administration\n         of its property by a religious denomination has thus\n         been placed on a different footing from the right to\n         manage its own affairs in matters of religion. The\n         latter is a fundamental right which no legislature can\n         take away, whereas the former can be regulated by\n         laws which the legislature can validly impose. It is\n         clear, therefore, that questions merely relating to\n         administration of properties belonging to a religious\n         group or institution are not matters of religion to\n         which clause (b) of the Article applies. What then\n         are matters of religion? The word ―religion‖ has not\n         been defined in the Constitution and it is a term\n         which is hardly susceptible of any rigid definition. In\n         an American case [Vide Davis v. Benson, 133 US\n         333 at 342], it has been said ―that the term ‗religion‘\n         has reference to one‘s views of his relation to his\n         Creator and to the obligations they impose of\n         reverence for His Being and character and of\n         obedience to His will. It is often confounded with\n         cultus of form or worship of a particular sect, but is\n         distinguishable from the latter.‖ We do not think that\n         the above definition can be regarded as either\n         precise or adequate. <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_368\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_369\">26</a> of our\n         Constitution are based for the most part upon <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_370\">Article\n         44(2)</a> of the Constitution of Eire and we have great\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                                                           8</span>\n\fdoubt whether a definition of ―religion‖ as given\nabove could have been in the minds of our\nConstitution-makers when they framed the\nConstitution. Religion is certainly a matter of faith\nwith individuals or communities and it is not\nnecessarily theistic. There are well known religions\nin India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not\nbelieve in God or in any Intelligent First Cause. A\nreligion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of\nbeliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those\nwho profess that religion as conducive to their\nspiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say\nthat religion is nothing else but a doctrine or belief. A\nreligion may not only lay down a code of ethical\nrules for its followers to accept, it might prescribe\nrituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of\nworship which are regarded as integral parts of\nreligion, and these forms and observances might\nextend even to matters of food and dress.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_195\">The guarantee under our Constitution not only\nprotects the freedom of religious opinion but it\nprotects also acts done in pursuance of a religion\nand this is made clear by the use of the expression\n―practice of religion‖ in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_371\">Article 25.</a> Latham, C.J. of\nthe High Court of Australia while dealing with the\nprovision of section 116 of the Australian\nConstitution    which     inter   alia forbids    the\nCommonwealth to prohibit the ―free exercise of any\nreligion‖ made the following weighty observations\n[Vide Adelaide Company v. Commonwealth, 67\nC.L.R. 116, 127]:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">    ―It is sometimes suggested in discussions\n    on the subject of freedom of religion that,\n    though the civil Government should not\n    interfere with religious opinions, it\n    nevertheless may deal as it pleases with\n    any acts which are done in pursuance of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                                            9</span>\n\f    religious belief without infringing the\n    principle of freedom of religion. It appears\n    to me to be difficult to maintain this\n    distinction as relevant to the interpretation\n    of section 116. The section refers in\n    express terms to the exercise of religion,\n    and therefore it is intended to protect from\n    the operation of any Commonwealth laws\n    acts which are done in the exercise of\n    religion. Thus the section goes far beyond\n    protecting liberty of opinion. It protects also\n    acts done in pursuance of religious belief\n    as part of religion.‖\n\nThese observations apply fully to the protection of\nreligion as guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.\nRestrictions by the State upon free exercise of\nreligion are permitted both under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_372\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_373\">26</a>\non grounds of public order, morality and health.\nClause (2)(a) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_374\">Article 25</a> reserves the right of the\nState to regulate or restrict any economic, financial,\npolitical and other secular activities which may be\nassociated with religious practice and there is a\nfurther right given to the State by sub-clause (b)\nunder which the State can legislate for social\nwelfare and reform even though by so doing it might\ninterfere with religious practices. The learned\nAttorney-General lays stress upon clause (2)(a) of\nthe Article and his contention is that all secular\nactivities, which may be associated with religion but\ndo not really constitute an essential part of it, are\namenable to State regulation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">The contention formulated in such broad terms\ncannot, we think, be supported. In the first place,\nwhat constitutes the essential part of a religion is\nprimarily to be ascertained with reference to the\ndoctrines of that religion itself. If the tenets of any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                                          10</span>\n\freligious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings\nof food should be given to the idol at particular hours\nof the day, that periodical ceremonies should be\nperformed in a certain way at certain periods of the\nyear or that there should be daily recital of sacred\ntexts or oblations to the sacred fire, all these would\nbe regarded as parts of religion and the mere fact\nthat they involve expenditure of money or\nemployment of priests and servants or the use of\nmarketable commodities would not make them\nsecular activities partaking of a commercial or\neconomic character; all of them are religious\npractices and should be regarded as matters of\nreligion within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_375\">Article 26(b).</a> What\n<a href=\"/doc/1753683/\" id=\"a_376\">Article 25(2)(a)</a> contemplates is not regulation by the\nState of religious practices as such, the freedom of\nwhich is guaranteed by the Constitution except\nwhen they run counter to public order, health and\nmorality, but regulation of activities which are\neconomic, commercial or political in their character\nthough they are associated with religious practices.\nWe may refer in this connection to a few American\nand Australian cases, all of which arose out of the\nactivities of persons connected with the religious\nassociation known as ―Jehovah‘s Witnesses.‖ This\nassociation of persons loosely organised throughout\nAustralia, U.S.A. and other countries regard the\nliteral interpretation of the Bible as fundamental to\nproper religious beliefs. This belief in the supreme\nauthority of the Bible colours many of their political\nideas. They refuse to take oath of allegiance to the\nking or other constituted human authority and even\nto show respect to the national flag, and they decry\nall wars between nations and all kinds of war\nactivities. In 1941 a company of ―Jehovah‘s\nWitnesses‖ incorporated in Australia commenced\nproclaiming and teaching matters which were\nprejudicial to war activities and the defence of the\nCommonwealth and steps were taken against them\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                                          11</span>\n\f         under the National Security Regulations of the\n         State. The legality of the action of the Government\n         was questioned by means of a writ petition before\n         the High Court and the High Court held that the\n         action of the Government was justified and that\n         section 116, which guaranteed freedom of religion\n         under the Australian Constitution, was not in any\n         way infringed by the National Security Regulations\n         [Vide Adelaide Company v. Commonwealth, 67\n         C.L.R. 116, 127]. These were undoubtedly political\n         activities though arising out of religious belief\n         entertained by a particular community. In such\n         cases, as Chief Justice Latham pointed out, the\n         provision for protection of religion was not an\n         absolute protection to be interpreted and applied\n         independently of other provisions of the\n         Constitution. These privileges must be reconciled\n         with the right of the State to employ the sovereign\n         power to ensure peace, security and orderly living\n         without which constitutional guarantee of civil liberty\n         would be a mockery.‖\n                                          (emphasis supplied)\n                                            (at pp. 1023-1026)\n\n\nAs to what matters a religious denomination enjoys complete\n\nautonomy over, this Court said:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">         ―…… As we have already indicated, freedom of\n         religion in our Constitution is not confined to\n         religious beliefs only; it extends to religious practices\n         as well subject to the restrictions which the\n         Constitution itself has laid down. Under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_377\">Article 26(b)</a>,\n         therefore, a religious denomination or organization\n         enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding\n         as to what rites and ceremonies are essential\n         according to the tenets of the religion they hold and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                                                     12</span>\n\f         no outside authority has any jurisdiction to interfere\n         with their decision in such matters. Of course, the\n         scale of expenses to be incurred in connection with\n         these religious observances would be a matter of\n         administration of property belonging to the religious\n         denomination and can be controlled by secular\n         authorities in accordance with any law laid down by\n         a competent legislature; for it could not be the\n         injunction of any religion to destroy the institution\n         and its endowments by incurring wasteful\n         expenditure on rites and ceremonies. It should be\n         noticed, however, that under <a href=\"/doc/1838869/\" id=\"a_378\">Article 26(d)</a>, it is the\n         fundamental right of a religious denomination or its\n         representative to administer its properties in\n         accordance with law; and the law, therefore, must\n         leave the right of administration to the religious\n         denomination itself subject to such restrictions and\n         regulations as it might choose to impose. A law\n         which takes away the right of administration from\n         the hands of a religious denomination altogether\n         and vests it in any other authority would amount to a\n         violation of the right guaranteed under clause (d) of\n         Article 26.‖\n                                             (at pp. 1028-1029)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1307370\" id=\"span_222\">5.

Sub-clause (a) of\nclause (2) saves the power of the State to make\nlaws regulating or restricting any economic,\nfinancial, political or other secular activity which may\nbe associated with religious practice; and sub-\nclause (b) reserves the State‘s power to make laws\nproviding for social reform and social welfare even\nthough they might interfere with religious practices.\nThus, subject to the restrictions which this Article\nimposes, every person has a fundamental right\nunder our Constitution not merely to entertain such\nreligious belief as may be approved of by his\njudgment or conscience but to exhibit his belief and\nideas in such overt acts as are enjoined or\nsanctioned by his religion and further to propagate\nhis religious views for the edification of others. It is\nimmaterial also whether the propagation is made by\na person in his individual capacity or on behalf of\nany church or institution. The free exercise of\nreligion by which is meant the performance of\noutward acts in pursuance of religious belief, is, as\nstated above, subject to State regulation imposed to\nsecure order, public health and morals of the\npeople. What sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_383\">Article\n25</a> contemplates is not State regulation of the\nreligious practices as such which are protected\nunless they run counter to public health or morality\nbut of activities which are really of an economic,\ncommercial or political character though they are\nassociated with religious practices.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">So far as <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_384\">Article 26</a> is concerned, it deals with a\nparticular aspect of the subject of religious freedom.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">                                                           14</span>\n\fUnder this article, any religious denomination or a\nsection of it has the guaranteed right to establish\nand maintain institutions for religious and charitable\npurposes and to manage in its own way all affairs in\nmatters of religion.

In regard to affairs in matters of\nreligion, the right of management given to a religious\nbody is a guaranteed fundamental right which no\nlegislation can take away. On the other hand, as\nregards administration of property which a religious\ndenomination is entitled to own and acquire, it has\nundoubtedly the right to administer such property\nbut only in accordance with law. This means that the\nState can regulate the administration of trust\nproperties by means of laws validly enacted; but\nhere again it should be remembered that under\n<a href=\"/doc/1838869/\" id=\"a_386\">Article 26(d)</a>, it is the religious denomination itself\nwhich has been given the right to administer its\nproperty in accordance with any law which the State\nmay validly impose. A law, which takes away the\nright of administration altogether from the religious\ndenomination and vests it in any other or secular\nauthority, would amount to violation of the right\nwhich is guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1838869/\" id=\"a_387\">Article 26(d)</a> of the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1430396\" id=\"span_225\">The moot point for consideration, therefore, is where\nis the line to be drawn between what are matters of\nreligion and what are not? Our Constitution-makers\nhave made no attempt to define what ‗religion‘ is\nand it is certainly not possible to frame an\nexhaustive definition of the word ‗religion‘ which\nwould be applicable to all classes of persons. As\nhas been indicated in the <a href=\"/doc/1430396/\" id=\"a_388\">Madras</a> case <a href=\"/doc/1430396/\" id=\"a_389\">referred to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">                                                         15</span>\n\fabove</a>, the definition of ‗religion‘ given by Fields, J.\nin the American case of Davis v. Beason [133 U.S.\n333], does not seem to us adequate or precise. ―The\nterm ‗religion‘ ‖, thus observed the learned Judge in\nthe case mentioned above, ―has reference to one‘s\nviews of his relations to his Creator and to the\nobligations they impose of reverence for His Being\nand character and of obedience to His Will. It is\noften confounded with cultus or form of worship of a\nparticular sect, but is distinguishable from the latter‖.\nIt may be noted that ‗religion‘ is not necessarily\ntheistic and in fact there are well known religions in\nIndia like Buddhism and Jainism which do not\nbelieve in the existence of God or of any Intelligent\nFirst Cause. A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a\nsystem of beliefs and doctrines which are regarded\nby those who profess that religion to be conducive\nto their spiritual well being, but it would not be\ncorrect to say, as seems to have been suggested by\none of the learned Judges of the Bombay High\nCourt, that matters of religion are nothing but\nmatters of religious faith and religious belief.

It\nhas its outward expression in acts as well.</span> We may\nquote in this connection the observations of Latham,\nC.J. of the High Court of Australia in the case of\nAdelaide Company v.

Thus\nif the tenets of the Jain or the Parsi religion lay down\nthat certain rites and ceremonies are to be\nperformed at certain times and in a particular\nmanner, it cannot be said that these are secular\nactivities partaking of commercial or economic\ncharacter simply because they involve expenditure\nof money or employment of priests or the use of\nmarketable commodities. No outside authority has\nany right to say that these are not essential parts of\nreligion and it is not open to the secular authority of\nthe State to restrict or prohibit them in any manner\nthey like under the guise of administering the trust\nestate. Of course, the scale of expenses to be\nincurred in connection with these religious\nobservances may be and is a matter of\nadministration of property belonging to religious\ninstitutions; and if the expenses on these heads are\nlikely to deplete the endowed properties or affect the\nstability of the institution, proper control can certainly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">                                                             17</span>\n\fbe exercised by State agencies as the law provides.\nWe may refer in this connection to the observation\nof Davar, J. in the case of Jamshed ji v.

State of\n\nMysore and Ors., 1958 SCR 895, (―Sri Venkataramana Devaru‖), an\n\nancient temple dedicated to Sri Venkataramana, renowned for its\n\nsanctity, was before the Court in a challenge to the Madras Temple\n\nEntry Authorisation Act (V of 1947). It was noticed that the trustees of\n\nthis temple were all members of a sect known as the Gowda\n\nSaraswath Brahmins. Even though the temple had originally been\n\nfounded for the benefit of certain immigrant families of the Gowda\n\nSaraswath Brahmins, in the course of time, however, worshippers\n\nconsisted of all classes of Hindus. Finding that the said temple is a\n\npublic temple, it was further held that during certain religious\n\nceremonies, persons other than Gowda Saraswath Brahmins had\n\nbeen wholly excluded, as a result of which, the temple was held to be\n\na religious denomination within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_396\">Article 26.</a> The Court\n\nthen found that if an image becomes defiled or if there is any departure\n\nor violation of any of the rules relating to worship, as a result of entry of\n\ncertain persons into the temple, an essential religious practice can be\n\nsaid to have been affected.

Thus, under\nthe ceremonial law pertaining to temples, who are\nentitled to enter into them for worship and where\nthey are entitled to stand and worship and how the\nworship is to be conducted are all matters of\nreligion. The conclusion is also implicit in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_399\">Art. 25</a>\nwhich after declaring that all persons are entitled\nfreely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\nenacts that this should not affect the operation of\nany law throwing open Hindu religious institutions of\na public character to all classes and sections of\nHindus.

It\nis, thus, clear that a person is left completely free to\nworship God according to the dictates of his\nconscience, and that his right to worship as he\npleased is unfettered so long as it does not come\ninto conflict with any restraints, as aforesaid,\nimposed by the State in the interest of public order,\netc. A person is not liable to answer for the verity of\nhis religious views, and he cannot be questioned as\nto his religious beliefs, by the State or by any other\nperson. Thus, though his religious beliefs are\nentirely his own and his freedom to hold those\nbeliefs is absolute, he has not the absolute right to\nact in any way he pleased in exercise of his religious\nbeliefs. He has been guaranteed the right to practice\nand propagate his religion, subject to the limitations\naforesaid. His right to practice his religion must also\nbe subject to the criminal laws of the country, validly\npassed with reference to actions which the\nlegislature has declared to be of a penal character.\nLaws made by a competent legislature in the\ninterest of public order and the like, restricting\nreligious practices, would come within the regulating\npower of the State. For example, there may be\nreligious practices of sacrifice of human beings, or\nsacrifice of animals in a way deleterious to the well-\nbeing of the community at large. It is open to the\nState to intervene, by legislation, to restrict or to\nregulate to the extent of completely stopping such\ndeleterious practices. It must, therefore, be held that\nthough the freedom of conscience is guaranteed to\nevery individual so that he may hold any beliefs he\nlikes, his actions in pursuance of those beliefs may\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">                                                            25</span>\n\f         be liable to restrictions in the interest of the\n         community at large, as may be determined by\n         common consent, that is to say, by a competent\n         legislature. It was on such humanitarian grounds,\n         and for the purpose of social reform, that so called\n         religious practices like immolating a widow at the\n         pyre of her deceased husband, or of dedicating a\n         virgin girl of tender years to a God to function as\n         a devadasi, or of ostracizing a person from all social\n         contacts and religious communion on account of his\n         having eaten forbidden food or taboo, were stopped\n         by legislation.‖\n                                          (emphasis supplied)\n                                              (at pp. 518-520)\n\n\nThe learned Chief Justice upheld the said Act, stating that the Act is\n\naimed at fulfillment of the individual liberty of conscience guaranteed\n\nby <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_429\">Article 25(1)</a> of the Constitution, and not in derogation of it.

What\n         appears however to be clear is that where an\n         excommunication is itself based on religious\n         grounds such as lapse from the orthodox religious\n         creed or doctrine (similar to what is considered\n         heresy, apostasy or schism under the Canon Law)\n         or breach of some practice considered as an\n         essential part of the religion by the Dawoodi Bohras\n         in general, excommunication cannot but be held to\n         be for the purpose of maintaining the strength of the\n         religion. It necessarily follows that the exercise of\n         this power of excommunication on religious grounds\n         forms part of the management by the community,\n         through its religious head, ―of its own affairs in\n         matters of religion.‖ The impugned Act makes even\n         such excommunications invalid and takes away the\n         power of the Dai as the head of the community to\n         excommunicate even on religious grounds. It\n         therefore, clearly interferes with the right of the\n         Dawoodi Bohra community under clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_434\">Art.\n         26</a> of the Constitution.‖\n                                                    (at p. 535)\n\nHolding that the said law is not referable to <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_435\">Article 25(2)(b)</a>, the Court\n\nthen held:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">         ―It remains to consider whether the impugned Act\n         comes within the saving provisions embodied in\n         clause 2 of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_436\">Art. 25.</a> The clause is in these words:—\n\n         ―Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of\n         any existing law or prevent the State from making\n         any law—\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">                                                                            27</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">\f(a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial,\npolitical or other secular activity which may be\nassociated with religious practice;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">(b) providing for social welfare and reform or the\nthrowing open of Hindu religious institution of a\npublic character to all classes and section of\nHindus.‖\n\nQuite clearly, the impugned Act cannot be regarded\nas a law regulating or restricting any economic,\nfinancial, political or other secular activity. Indeed,\nthat was not even suggested on behalf of the\nrespondent State. It was faintly suggested however\nthat the Act should be considered to be a law\n―providing for social welfare and reform.‖ The mere\nfact that certain civil rights which might be lost by\nmembers of the Dawoodi Bohra community as a\nresult of excommunication even though made on\nreligious grounds and that the Act prevents such\nloss, does not offer sufficient basis for a conclusion\nthat it is a law ―providing for social welfare and\nreform.‖ The barring of excommunication on\ngrounds other than religious grounds, say, on the\nbreach of some obnoxious social rule or practice\nmight be a measure of social reform and a law\nwhich bars such excommunication merely might\nconceivably come within the saving provisions of\nclause 2(b) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_437\">Art. 25.</a> But barring of\nexcommunication on religious grounds pure and\nsimple, cannot however be considered to promote\nsocial welfare and reform and consequently the law\ninsofar as it invalidates excommunication on\nreligious grounds and takes away the Dai&#x27;s power to\nimpose such excommunication cannot reasonably\nbe considered to be a measure of social welfare and\nreform. As the Act invalidates excommunication on\nany ground whatsoever, including religious grounds,\nit must be held to be in clear violation of the right of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">                                                           28</span>\n\f         the Dawoodi Bohra community under Art. 26(b) of\n         the Constitution.‖\n                                        (at pp. 536-537)\n\n\nIn an illuminating concurring judgment, N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">upheld the Act on the ground that excommunication is not so much a\n\npunishment but is really used as a measure of discipline for the\n\nmaintenance of the integrity of the Dawoodi Bohra community. It\n\ntherefore violates the right to practice religion guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_438\">Articles\n\n25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_439\">26</a> in that it interferes with the right of the religious head –\n\nthe Dai – to administer, as trustee, the property of the denomination so\n\nas to exclude excommunicated persons. The learned Judge, however,\n\ndrew a distinction between the two parts of <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_440\">Article 25(2)(b)</a>, stating that\n\nthe expression ―social welfare and reform‖ could not affect essential\n\nparts of religious practice as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">         ―But very different considerations arise when one\n         has to deal with legislation which is claimed to be\n         merely a measure ―providing for social welfare and\n         reform.‖ To start with, it has to be admitted that this\n         phrase is, as contrasted with the second portion of\n         <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_441\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a>, far from precise and is flexible in its\n         content. In this connection it has to be borne in mind\n         that limitations imposed on religious practices on the\n         ground of public order, morality or health have\n         already been saved by the opening words of <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_442\">Art.\n         25(1)</a> and the saving would cover beliefs and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">                                                                             29</span>\n\fpractices even though considered essential or vital\nby those professing the religion. I consider that in\nthe context in which the phrase occurs, it is intended\nto save the validity only of those laws which do not\ninvade the basic and essential practices of religion\nwhich are guaranteed by the operative portion of\n<a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_443\">Art. 25(1)</a> for two reasons: (1) To read the saving as\ncovering even the basic essential practices of\nreligion, would in effect nullify and render\nmeaningless the entire guarantee of religious\nfreedom — a freedom not merely to profess, but to\npractice religion, for very few pieces of legislation for\nabrogating religious practices could fail to be\nsubsumed under the caption of ―a provision for\nsocial welfare or reform.‖ (2) If the phrase just\nquoted was intended to have such a wide operation\nas cutting at even the essentials guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_444\">Art.\n25(1)</a>, there would have been no need for the\nspecial provision as to ―throwing open of Hindu\nreligious institutions‖ to all classes and sections of\nHindus since the legislation contemplated by this\nprovision would be par excellence one of social\nreform.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">In my view by the phrase ―laws providing for social\nwelfare and reform‖ it was not intended to enable\nthe legislature to ―reform‖ a religion out of existence\nor identity. <a href=\"/doc/1753683/\" id=\"a_445\">Art. 25(2)(a)</a> having provided for\nlegislation dealing with ―economic, financial, political\nor secular activity which may be associated with\nreligious practices‖, the succeeding clause proceeds\nto deal with other activities of religious groups and\nthese also must be those which are associated with\nreligion. Just as the activities referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1753683/\" id=\"a_446\">Art.\n25(2)(a)</a> are obviously not of the essence of the\nreligion, similarly the saving in <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_447\">Art. 25(2)(b)</a> is not\nintended to cover the basic essentials of the creed\nof a religion which is protected by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_448\">Art. 25(1)</a>.‖\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                                                            30</span>\n\f                                                (at pp. 552-553)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1430396\" id=\"span_249\">10.    As this view is the view of only one learned Judge, and as it\n\ndoes not arise for decision in the present case, suffice it to say that this\n\nview will need to be tested in some future case for its validity. It is\n\ninstructive to remember that <a href=\"/doc/1430396/\" id=\"a_449\">Shirur Math</a> (supra) specifically\n\ncontained a sentence which stated that there is a further right given to\n\nthe State by <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_450\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> under which, the State can legislate for\n\nsocial welfare and reform ―even though by so doing it might interfere\n\nwith religious practices‖.

Referring to and following some of the\n\njudgments that have already been referred, this Court held that the\n\nNathdwara temple was a public temple and that as the Act\n\nextinguished the secular office of the Tilkayat by which he was\n\nmanaging the properties of the Temple, no right under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_455\">Article 26</a> could\n\nbe said to have been effected.

This formula may in some cases present\n         difficulties in its operation. Take the case of a\n         practice in relation to food or dress. If in a given\n         proceeding, one section of the community claims\n         that while performing certain rites white dress is an\n         integral part of the religion itself, whereas another\n         section contends that yellow dress and not the white\n         dress is the essential part of the religion, how is the\n         Court going to decide the question? Similar disputes\n         may arise in regard to food. In cases where\n         conflicting evidence is produced in respect of rival\n         contentions as to competing religious practices the\n         Court may not be able to resolve the dispute by a\n         blind application of the formula that the community\n         decides which practice is an integral part of its\n         religion, because the community may speak with\n         more than one voice and the formula would,\n         therefore, break down. This question will always\n         have to be decided by the Court and in doing so, the\n         Court may have to enquire whether the practice in\n         question is religious in character and if it is, whether\n         it can be regarded as an integral or essential part of\n         the religion, and the finding of the Court on such an\n         issue will always depend upon the evidence\n         adduced before it as to the conscience of the\n         community and the tenets of its religion. It is in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">                                                                            32</span>\n\flight of this possible complication which may arise in\nsome cases that this Court struck a note of caution\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/1262157/\" id=\"a_456\">The Durgah Committee Ajmer v. Syed\nHussain Ali</a> [(1962) 1 SCR 383, 411], and observed\nthat in order that the practices in question should be\ntreated as a part of religion they must be regarded\nby the said religion as its essential and integral part;\notherwise even purely secular practices which are\nnot an essential or an integral part of religion are apt\nto be clothed with a religious form and may make a\nclaim for being treated as religious practices within\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_457\">Art. 25(1).</a></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">In this connection, it cannot be ignored that what is\nprotected under Arts. 25(1) and 26(b) respectively\nare the religious practices and the right to manage\naffairs in matters of religion. If the practice in\nquestion is purely secular or the affair which is\ncontrolled by the statute is essentially and\nabsolutely secular in character, it cannot be urged\nthat <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_458\">Art. 25(1)</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_459\">Art. 26(b)</a> has been contravened.\nThe protection is given to the practice of religion and\nto the denomination‘s right to manage its own affairs\nin matters of religion. Therefore, whenever a claim is\nmade on behalf of an individual citizen that the\nimpugned statute contravenes his fundamental right\nto practise religion or a claim is made on behalf of\nthe denomination that the fundamental right\nguaranteed to it to manage its own affairs in matters\nof religion is contravened, it is necessary to consider\nwhether the practice in question is religious or the\naffairs in respect of which the right of management\nis alleged to have been contravened are affairs in\nmatters of religion. If the practice is a religious\npractice or the affairs are the affairs in matter of\nreligion, then, of course, the rights guaranteed by\n<a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_460\">Art. 25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_461\">Art. 26(b)</a> cannot be contravened.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                                                           33</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">\fIt is true that the decision of the question as to\nwhether a certain practice is a religious practice or\nnot, as well as the question as to whether an affair\nin question is an affair in matters of religion or not,\nmay present difficulties because sometimes\npractices, religious and secular, are inextricably\nmixed up. This is more particularly so in regard to\nHindu religion because as is well known, under the\nprovisions of ancient Smritis, all human actions from\nbirth to death and most of the individual actions from\nday-to-day are regarded as religious in character.\nAs an illustration, we may refer to the fact that the\nSmritis regard marriage as a sacrament and not a\ncontract. Though the task of disengaging the secular\nfrom the religious may not be easy, it must\nnevertheless be attempted in dealing with the claims\nfor protection under Arts 25(1) and 26(b). If the\npractice which is protected under the former is a\nreligious practice, and if the right which is protected\nunder the latter is the right to manage affairs in\nmatters of religion, it is necessary that in judging\nabout the merits of the claim made in that behalf the\nCourt must be satisfied that the practice is religious\nand the affair is in regard to a matter of religion. In\ndealing with this problem under Arts. 25(1) and\n26(b), Latham C.J.‘s observation in Adelaide\nCompany of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Incorporated v.\nThe Commonwealth [67 CLR 116, 123], that ―what\nis religion to one is superstition to another‖, on\nwhich Mr. Pathak relies, is of no relevance. If an\nobviously secular matter is claimed to be matter of\nreligion, or if an obviously secular practice is alleged\nto be a religious practice, the Court would be\njustified in rejecting the claim because the protection\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_462\">Art. 25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_463\">Art. 26(b)</a> cannot be\nextended to secular practices and affairs in regard\nto denominational matters which are not matters of\nreligion, and so, a claim made by a citizen that a\npurely secular matter amounts to a religious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">                                                           34</span>\n\f         practice, or a similar claim made on behalf of the\n         denomination that a purely secular matter is an\n         affair in matters of religion, may have to be rejected\n         on the ground that it is based on irrational\n         considerations and cannot attract the provisions of\n         <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_464\">Art. 25(1)</a> or Art 26(b). This aspect of the matter\n         must be borne in mind in dealing with the true scope\n         and effect of <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_465\">Art. 25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_466\">Art. 26(b)</a>.‖\n                                              (at pp. 620-623)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">12.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"641343\" id=\"span_257\">In <a href=\"/doc/641343/\" id=\"a_467\">Seshammal and Ors. v.

Rules with regard to daily and\n         periodical worship have been laid down for securing\n         the continuance of the Divine Spirit. The rituals have\n         a two-fold object. One is to attract the lay\n         worshipper to participate in the worship carried on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">                                                                        35</span>\n\f         by the priest or Archaka. It is believed that when a\n         congregation of worshippers participates in the\n         worship a particular attitude of aspiration and\n         devotion is developed and confers great spiritual\n         benefit. The second object is to preserve the image\n         from pollution, defilement or desecration. It is part of\n         the religious belief of a Hindu worshipper that when\n         the image is polluted or defiled the Divine Spirit in\n         the image diminishes or even vanishes. That is a\n         situation which every devotee or worshipper looks\n         upon with horror. Pollution or defilement may take\n         place in a variety of ways. According to the Agamas,\n         an image becomes defiled if there is any departure\n         or violation of any of the rules relating to worship. In\n         fact, purificatory ceremonies have to be performed\n         for restoring the sanctity of the shrine [1958 SCR\n         895 (910)]. Worshippers lay great store by the\n         rituals and whatever other people, not of the faith,\n         may think about these rituals and ceremonies, they\n         are a part of the Hindu religious faith and cannot be\n         dismissed as either irrational or superstitious.‖\n\n\nUltimately, it was held that since the appointment of an Archaka is a\n\nsecular act, the Amendment Act must be regarded as valid.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">13.

In order to constitute a\n         separate denomination, there must be something\n         distinct from another. A denomination argues the\n         counsel, is one which is different from the other and\n         if the Society was a religious denomination, then the\n         person seeking admission to the institution would\n         lose his previous religion. He cannot be a member\n         of two religions at one and the same time. But this is\n         not the position in becoming a member of the\n         Society and Auroville. A religious denomination\n         must necessarily be a new one and new\n         methodology must be provided for a religion.\n         Substantially, the view taken by Sri Aurobindo\n         remains a part of the Hindu philosophy.

In holding that the Tandava\n\ndance cannot be taken to be an essential religious right of the Anand\n\nMargis, this Court in paragraph 14 held:</span></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">         ―14. The question for consideration now, therefore,\n         is whether performance of Tandava dance is a\n         religious rite or practice essential to the tenets of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_271\">                                                                           41</span>\n\freligious faith of the Ananda Margis. We have\nalready indicated that Tandava dance was not\naccepted as an essential religious rite of Ananda\nMargis when in 1955 the Ananda Marga order was\nfirst established. It is the specific case of the\npetitioner that Shri Ananda Murti introduced\nTandava as a part of religious rites of Ananda\nMargis later in 1966. Ananda Marga as a religious\norder is of recent origin and Tandava dance as a\npart of religious rites of that order is still more\nrecent. It is doubtful as to whether in such\ncircumstances Tandava dance can be taken as an\nessential religious rite of the Ananda Margis. Even\nconceding that it is so, it is difficult to accept Mr.\nTarkunde‘s argument that taking out religious\nprocessions with Tandava dance is an essential\nreligious rite of Ananda Margis. In paragraph 17 of\nthe writ petition the petitioner pleaded that ―Tandava\ndance lasts for a few minutes where two or three\npersons dance by lifting one leg to the level of the\nchest, bringing it down and lifting the other‖. In\nparagraph 18 it has been pleaded that ―when the\nAnanda Margis greet their spiritual preceptor at the\nairport, etc., they arrange for a brief welcome dance\nof Tandava wherein one or two persons use the\nskull and symbolic knife and dance for two or three\nminutes‖. In paragraph 26 it has been pleaded that\n―Tandava is a custom among the sect members and\nit is a customary performance and its origin is over\nfour thousand years old, hence it is not a new\ninvention of Ananda Margis‖. On the basis of the\nliterature of the Ananda Marga denomination it has\nbeen contended that there is prescription of the\nperformance of Tandava dance by every follower of\nAnanda Marga. Even conceding that Tandava\ndance has been prescribed as a religious rite for\nevery follower of the Ananda Marga it does not\nfollow as a necessary corollary that Tandava dance\nto be performed in the public is a matter of religious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">                                                         42</span>\n\f         rite. In fact, there is no justification in any of the\n         writings of Sri Ananda Murti that Tandava dance\n         must be performed in public. At least none could be\n         shown to us by Mr. Tarkunde despite an enquiry by\n         us in that behalf. We are, therefore, not in a position\n         to accept the contention of Mr. Tarkunde that\n         performance of Tandava dance in a procession or at\n         public places is an essential religious rite to be\n         performed by every Ananda Margi.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">16.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"923604\" id=\"span_273\">In <a href=\"/doc/923604/\" id=\"a_486\">Sri Adi Visheshwara of Kashi Vishwanath Temple,\n\nVaranasi and Ors. v.

Where a temple has been constructed and\nconsecrated as per Agamas, it is considered\nnecessary to perform the daily rituals, poojas and\nrecitations as required to maintain the sanctity of the\nidol and it is not that in respect of any and every\ntemple any such uniform rigour of rituals can be\nsought to be enforced, dehors its origin, the manner\nof construction or method of consecration. No doubt\nonly a qualified person well versed and properly\ntrained for the purpose alone can perform poojas in\nthe temple since he has not only to enter into the\nsanctum sanctorum but also touch the idol installed\ntherein. It therefore goes without saying that what is\nrequired and expected of one to perform the rituals\nand conduct poojas is to know the rituals to be\nperformed and mantras, as necessary, to be recited\nfor the particular deity and the method of worship\nordained or fixed therefor. For example, in Saivite\ntemples or Vaishnavite temples, only a person who\nlearnt the necessary rites and mantras conducive to\nbe performed and recited in the respective temples\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">                                                          45</span>\n\fand appropriate to the worship of the particular deity\ncould be engaged as an Archaka. If traditionally or\nconventionally, in any temple, all along a Brahmin\nalone was conducting poojas or performing the job\nof Santhikaran, it may not be because a person\nother than the Brahmin is prohibited from doing so\nbecause he is not a Brahmin, but those others were\nnot in a position and, as a matter of fact, were\nprohibited from learning, reciting or mastering Vedic\nliterature, rites or performance of rituals and wearing\nsacred thread by getting initiated into the order and\nthereby acquire the right to perform homa and\nritualistic forms of worship in public or private\ntemples. Consequently, there is no justification to\ninsist that a Brahmin or Malayala Brahmin in this\ncase, alone can perform the rites and rituals in the\ntemple, as part of the rights and freedom\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_504\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution and\nfurther claim that any deviation would tantamount to\nviolation of any such guarantee under the\nConstitution. There can be no claim based upon\n<a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_505\">Article 26</a> so far as the Temple under our\nconsideration is concerned.

Thus, the power to\n\nsupersede the administration of a religious denomination, if only for a\n\ncertain purpose and for a limited duration, will have to be read as\n\nregulatory, otherwise, it will violate the fundamental right contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_510\">Article 26.</a></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">19.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"102089692\" id=\"span_281\">In <a href=\"/doc/102089692/\" id=\"a_511\">Riju Prasad Sarma and Ors. v.

This fundamental right equally entitles all such persons to the\n\nsaid fundamental right. Every member of a religious community has a\n\nright to practice the religion so long as he does not, in any way,\n\ninterfere with the corresponding right of his co-religionists to do the\n\nsame.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">21.3. The content of the fundamental right is the fleshing out of what\n\nis stated in the Preamble to the Constitution as ―liberty of thought,\n\nbelief, faith and worship‖. Thus, all persons are entitled to freedom of\n\nconscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate\n\nreligion.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">21.4. The right to profess, practice, and propagate religion will include\n\nall acts done in furtherance of thought, belief, faith, and worship.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                                                                            51</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">\f21.5. The content of the right concerns itself with the word ―religion‖.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">―Religion‖ in this Article would mean matters of faith with individuals or\n\ncommunities, based on a system of beliefs or doctrines which conduce\n\nto spiritual well-being. The aforesaid does not have to be theistic but\n\ncan include persons who are agnostics and atheists.\n\n\n21.6. It is only the essential part of religion, as distinguished from\n\nsecular activities, that is the subject matter of the fundamental right.\n\nSuperstitious beliefs which are extraneous, unnecessary accretions to\n\nreligion cannot be considered as essential parts of religion. Matters\n\nthat are essential to religious faith and/or belief are to be judged on\n\nevidence before a court of law by what the community professing the\n\nreligion itself has to say as to the essentiality of such belief. One test\n\nthat has been evolved would be to remove the particular belief stated\n\nto be an essential belief from the religion – would the religion remain\n\nthe same or would it be altered? Equally, if different groups of a\n\nreligious community speak with different voices on the essentiality\n\naspect presented before the Court, the Court is then to decide as to\n\nwhether such matter is or is not essential. Religious activities may also\n\nbe mixed up with secular activities, in which case the dominant nature\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                                                                             52</span>\n\f     of the activity test is to be applied. The Court should take a common-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">     sense view and be actuated by considerations of practical necessity.\n\n\n     21.7. The exceptions to this individual right are public order, morality,\n\n     and health. ―Public order‖ is to be distinguished from ―law and order‖.\n\n     ―Public disorder‖ must affect the public at large as opposed to certain\n\n     individuals. A disturbance of public order must cause a general\n\n     disturbance of public tranquility. The term ―morality‖ is difficult to\n\n     define. For the present, suffice it to say that it refers to that which is\n\n     considered abhorrent to civilized society, given the mores of the time,\n\n     by reason of harm caused by way, inter alia, of exploitation or\n\n     degradation.2 ―Health‖ would include noise pollution and the control of\n\n     disease.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">     21.8. Another exception to the fundamental right conferred by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_527\">Article\n\n     25(1)</a> is the rights that are conferred on others by the other provisions\n\n     of Part III. This would show that if one were to propagate one‘s religion\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">2</span>\n    We were invited by the learned Amicus Curiae, Shri Raju Ramachandran, to read the word ―morality‖ as\n    being ―constitutional morality‖ as has been explained in some of our recent judgments. If so read, it\n    cannot be forgotten that this would bring in, through the back door, the other provisions of Part III of the\n    Constitution, which <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_528\">Article 26</a> is not subject to, in contrast with <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_529\">Article 25(1).</a> In any case, the\n    fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_530\">Article 26</a> will have to be balanced with the rights of others contained in Part III\n    as a matter of harmonious construction of these rights as was held in Sri Venkataramana Devaru\n    (supra). But this would only be on a case to case basis, without necessarily subjecting the fundamental\n    right under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_531\">Article 26</a> to other fundamental rights contained in Part III.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">                                                                                                             53</span>\n\f     in such a manner as to convert a person of another religious faith,\n\n     such conversion would clash with the other person‘s right to freedom\n\n     of conscience and would, therefore, be interdicted.

We have refrained from doing so because, given our conclusion, based on <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_544\">Article 25(1)</a>,\n    this would not directly arise for decision on the facts of this case.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">                                                                                                      54</span>\n\fthrow open all Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all\n\nclasses and sections of Hindus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_229\">\n21.11. Contrasted with the fundamental right in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_545\">Article 25(1)</a> is the\n\nfundamental right granted by <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_546\">Article 26.</a> This fundamental right is not\n\ngranted to individuals but to religious denominations or sections\n\nthereof. A religious denomination or section thereof is to be\n\ndetermined on the basis of persons having a common faith, a common\n\norganization, and designated by a distinct name as a denomination or\n\nsection thereof. Believers of a particular religion are to be\n\ndistinguished from denominational worshippers. Thus, Hindu believers\n\nof the Shaivite and Vaishnavite form of worship are not denominational\n\nworshippers but part of the general Hindu religious form of worship.\n\n21.12. Four separate and distinct rights are given by <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_547\">Article 26</a> to\n\nreligious denominations or sections thereof, namely:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">         ―(a) to establish and maintain institutions for\n         religious and charitable purposes;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">         (b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">         (c) to own and acquire movable and immovable\n         property; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">         (d) to administer such property in accordance with\n         law.‖\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">                                                                           55</span>\n\fAs in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_548\">Article 25</a>, it is only essential religious matters which are\n\nprotected by this Article.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">21.13. The fundamental right granted under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_549\">Article 26</a> is subject to the\n\nexception of public order, morality, and health. However, since the\n\nright granted under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_550\">Article 26</a> is to be harmoniously construed with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_551\">Article 25(2)(b)</a>, the right to manage its own affairs in matters of\n\nreligion granted by <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_552\">Article 26(b)</a>, in particular, will be subject to laws\n\nmade under <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_553\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> which throw open religious institutions of a\n\npublic character to all classes and sections of Hindus.\n\n\n21.14. Thus, it is clear that even though the entry of persons into a\n\nHindu temple of a public character would pertain to management of its\n\nown affairs in matters of religion, yet such temple entry would be\n\nsubject to a law throwing open a Hindu religious institution of a public\n\ncharacter owned and managed by a religious denomination or section\n\nthereof to all classes or sections of Hindus. However, religious\n\npractices by the religious denomination or section thereof, which do\n\nnot have the effect of either a complete ban on temple entry of certain\n\npersons, or are otherwise not discriminatory, may pass muster under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_554\">Article 26(b).</a> Examples of such practices are that only certain qualified\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">                                                                            56</span>\n\fpersons are allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of a temple, or\n\ntime management of a temple in which all persons are shut out for\n\ncertain periods.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_231\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_232\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1915943\" id=\"span_296\">22.

The questions which require answers in this\n         original petition are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">              (1) Whether woman [sic women] of the age\n              group 10 to 50 can be permitted to enter the\n              Sabarimala temple at any period of the year or\n              during any of the festivals or poojas conducted\n              in the temple.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">              (2) Whether the denial of entry of that class of\n              woman [sic women] amounts to discrimination\n              and [sic is] violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_556\">Articles 15</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_557\">, 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_558\">26</a> of\n              the Constitution of India, and\n              (3) Whether directions can be issued by this\n              Court to the Devaswom Board and the\n              Government of Kerala to restrict the entry of\n              such woman [sic women] to the temple?‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_297\">                                                                       57</span>\n\fThe Division Bench referred to the all-important ―Vratham‖ (41-day\n\npenance), which, according to the Division Bench, ladies between the\n\nages of 10 and 50 would not be physically capable of observing. In\n\nparagraph 7, the Division Bench stated that while the old customs\n\nprevailed, women did visit the temple, though rarely, as a result of\n\nwhich, there was no prohibition. The affidavit filed on behalf of the\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board stated that, even in recent years, many\n\nfemale worshippers in the age group of 10 to 50 had gone to the\n\ntemple for the first rice-feeding ceremony of their children. The Board,\n\nin fact, used to issue receipts on such occasions on payment of the\n\nprescribed charge. However, on the advice of the priest i.e. the\n\nThanthri, changes were effected in order to preserve the temple‘s\n\nsanctity. The Division Bench found that women, irrespective of their\n\nage, were allowed to visit the temple when it opens for monthly poojas,\n\nbut were not permitted to enter the temple during Mandalam,\n\nMakaravilakku, and Vishu seasons. After examining the evidence of\n\none Thanthri, the Secretary of the Ayyappa Seva Sangham, and a 75-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">year old man who had personal knowledge of worshipping at the\n\ntemple, the Division Bench stated that the usage of not permitting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_298\">                                                                           58</span>\n\fwomen between the age group of 10 to 50 to worship in the temple\n\nhad been established. This was further sanctified by Devaprasnams\n\nconducted at Sabarimala by astrologers, who reported that the deity\n\ndoes not like young ladies entering the precincts of the temple. It was\n\nthen held in paragraph 38 that since women of the age group of 10 to\n\n50 years would not be able to observe Vratham for a period of 41 days\n\ndue to physiological reasons, they were not permitted to go on a\n\npilgrimage of Sabarimala. It was also held that the deity is in the form\n\nof a Naisthik Brahmachari, as a result of which, young women should\n\nnot offer worship in the temple, so that even the slightest deviation\n\nfrom celibacy and austerity observed by the deity is not caused by the\n\npresence of such women. The conclusion of the Division Bench in\n\nparagraph 44 was, therefore, as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">         ―44. Our conclusions are as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">             (1) The restriction imposed on women aged\n             above 10 and below 50 from trekking the holy\n             hills of Sabarimala and offering worship at\n             Sabarimala Shrine is in accordance with the\n             usage prevalent from time immemorial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">             (2) Such restriction imposed by the Devaswom\n             Board is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_559\">Articles 15</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_560\">, 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_561\">26</a>\n             of the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_299\">                                                                           59</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">\f             (3) Such restriction is also not violative of the\n             provisions of Hindu Place of Public Worship\n             (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 since there is\n             no restriction between one section and another\n             section or between one class and another class\n             among the Hindus in the matter of entry to a\n             temple whereas the prohibition is only in\n             respect of women of a particular age group and\n             not women as a class.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">23.   In the present writ petition filed before this Court, an affidavit\n\nfiled by a Thanthri of the Sabarimala temple dated 23.04.2016 makes\n\ninteresting reading. According to the affidavit, two Brahmin brothers\n\nfrom Andhra Pradesh were tested by Sage Parasuram and were\n\nnamed ―Tharanam‖ and ―Thazhamon‖. The present Thanthri is a\n\ndescendant of the Thazhamon brother, who is authorized to perform\n\nrituals in Sastha temples. The affidavit then refers to the Sabarimala\n\nTemple, which is dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, as a prominent temple in\n\nKerala which is visited by over twenty million pilgrims and devotees\n\nevery year. The temple is only open during the first five days of every\n\nMalayalam    month,    and   during   the   festivals   of   Mandalam,\n\nMakaravilakku, and Vishu. Significantly, no daily poojas are performed\n\nin the said temple. It is stated in the affidavit that Lord Ayyappa had\n\nhimself explained that the pilgrimage to Sabarimala can be undertaken\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_300\">                                                                           60</span>\n\fonly by the performance of Vratham, which are religious austerities\n\nthat train man for evolution to spiritual consciousness.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">Paragraph 10 of the affidavit is important and states as follows:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">         ―10. I submit that as part of observing ―vrutham‖, the\n         person going on pilgrimage to Sabarimala separates\n         himself from all family ties and becomes a student\n         celibate who is under Shastras banned any contact\n         with females of the fertile age group. Everywhere\n         when somebody takes on the ―vrutham‖, either the\n         women leave the house and take up residence\n         elsewhere or the men separate themselves from the\n         family so that normal Asauchas in the house do not\n         affect his ―vrutham‖. The problem with women is\n         that they cannot complete the 41 days vrutham\n         because the Asaucham of periods will surely fall\n         within the 41 days. It is not a mere physiological\n         phenomenon. It is the custom among all Hindus\n         that women during periods do not go to Temples or\n         participate in religious activity. This is as per the\n         statement of the basic Thantric text of Temple\n         worshipping in Kerala Thanthra Samuchayam,\n         Chapter 10, Verse II. A true copy of the relevant\n         page of Thanthra Samuchchaya is attached\n         herewith and marked as Annexure A-1 (Pages 30-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">         31).‖\n\n\nThe affidavit then goes on to state that the Shastras forbid religious\n\nausterity by menstruating women, which is why women above the age\n\nof 10 and below the age of 50 are not allowed entering into the temple.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">The affidavit then states, in paragraph 15:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_236\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_301\">                                                                          61</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">\f         ―15. ……… During this period, many women are\n         affected by physical discomforts like headache,\n         body pain, vomiting sensation etc. In such\n         circumstances, intense and chaste spiritual\n         disciplines for forty-one days are not possible. It is\n         for the sake of pilgrims who practiced celibacy that\n         youthful women are not allowed in the Sabarimala\n         pilgrimage. ………‖\n\n\nThe other reason given in the affidavit for the usage of non-entry of\n\nwomen between these ages is as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">         ―24. That the deity at Sabarimala is in the form of a\n         ‗Naishtik Brahmachari‘ and that is the reason why\n         young women are not permitted to offer prayers in\n         the temple as the slightest deviation from celibacy\n         and austerity observed by the deity is not caused by\n         the presence of such women. ………‖\n\n\nIt will thus be seen that women are barred entry to the temple at\n\nSabarimala because of the biological or physiological phenomenon of\n\nmenstruation, which forbids their participation in religious activity. The\n\nsecond reason given is that young women should not, in any manner,\n\ndeflect the deity, who is in the form of a Naisthika Brahmachari, from\n\ncelibacy and austerity.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">24.    All the older religions speak of the phenomenon of menstruation\n\nin women as being impure, which therefore, forbids their participation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_302\">                                                                             62</span>\n\f     in religious activity. Thus, in the Old Testament, in Chapter 15, Verse\n\n     19 of the book of Leviticus, it is stated:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">                  ―19. And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in\n                  her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven\n                  days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean\n                  until the even.‖4\n\n\n     Similarly, in the Dharmasutra of Vasistha, an interesting legend of how\n\n     women were made to menstruate is stated as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">                  ―A menstruating woman remains impure for three\n                  days. She should not apply collyrium on her eyes or\n                  oil on her body, or bathe in water; she should sleep\n                  on the floor and not sleep during the day; she\n                  should not touch the fire, make a rope, brush her\n                  teeth, eat meat, or look at the planets; she should\n                  not laugh, do any work, or run; and she should drink\n                  out of a large pot or from her cupped hands or a\n                  copper vessel. For it is stated: ‗Indra, after he had\n                  killed the three-headed son of Tvastr, was seized by\n                  sin, and he regarded himself in this manner: ―An\n                  exceedingly great guilt attaches to me‖. And all\n                  creatures railed against him: ―Brahmin-killer!\n                  Brahmin-killer!‖ He ran to the women and said:\n                  ―Take over one-third of this my guilt of killing a\n                  Brahmin.‖ They asked: ―What will we get?‖ He\n                  replied: ―Make a wish.‖ They said: ―Let us obtain\n                  offspring during our season, and let us enjoy sexual\n                  intercourse freely until we give birth.‖ He replied: ―So\n                  be it!‖ And they took the guilt upon themselves.

From this, it is also clear\n\nthat Hindus of all kinds, Muslims, Christians etc., all visit the temple as\n\nworshippers, without, in any manner, ceasing to be Hindus, Christians\n\nor Muslims. They can therefore be regarded, as has been held in <a href=\"/doc/923604/\" id=\"a_563\">Sri\n\nAdi Visheshwara</a> (supra), as Hindus who worship the idol of Lord\n\nAyyappa as part of the Hindu religious form of worship but not as\n\ndenominational worshippers. The same goes for members of other\n\nreligious communities. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1262157\" id=\"span_320\">We may remember that in <a href=\"/doc/1262157/\" id=\"a_564\">Durgah Committee</a>\n\n(supra), this Court had held that since persons of all religious faiths\n\nvisit the Durgah as a place of pilgrimage, it may not be easy to hold\n\nthat they constitute a religious denomination or a section thereof.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of the appeal, they proposed to deal with the\n\ndispute between the parties on the basis that the Chishtia sect, whom\n\nthe respondents represented, were a separate religious denomination,\n\nbeing a sub-sect of Soofies. We may hasten to add that we find no\n\nsuch thing here.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_321\">We may also add that in <a href=\"/doc/312939/\" id=\"a_565\">S.P.

Also, the\n\npowerful argument addressed, noticed at paragraph 106 of the\n\nmajority judgment, that persons who joined the Auroville Society did\n\nnot give up their religion, also added great substance to the fact that\n\nthe Auroville Society could not be regarded as a religious\n\ndenomination for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_566\">Article 26.</a> Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n\nalone, in dissent, held the Auroville Society to be a religious\n\ndenomination, without adverting to the fact that persons who are a part\n\nof the Society continued to adhere to their religion.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_250\">27.    In these circumstances, we are clearly of the view that there is\n\nno distinctive name given to the worshippers of this particular temple;\n\nthere is no common faith in the sense of a belief common to a\n\nparticular religion or section thereof; or common organization of the\n\nworshippers of the Sabarimala temple so as to constitute the said\n\ntemple into a religious denomination. Also, there are over a thousand\n\nother Ayyappa temples in which the deity is worshipped by practicing\n\nHindus of all kinds. It is clear, therefore, that <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_567\">Article 26</a> does not get\n\nattracted to the facts of this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_251\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">                                                                            70</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_252\">\f28.

Secularism was not a new idea but a formal reiteration of what the\n\nConstitution always respected and accepted: the equality of all faiths. Besides\n\nincorporating a specific reference to a secular republic, the Preamble divulges\n\nthe position held by the framers on the interface of religion and the fundamental\n\nvalues of a constitutional order. The Constitution is not – as it could not have\n\nbeen - oblivious to religion. Religiosity has moved hearts and minds in the\n\nhistory of modern India. Hence, in defining the content of liberty, the Preamble\n\nhas spoken of the liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. While\n\nrecognising and protecting individual liberty, the Preamble underscores the\n\nimportance of equality, both in terms of status and opportunity. Above all, it\n\n\n\n\n1   The Constitution (Forty-second) Amendment, 1976\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_335\">                                                      3</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\nseeks to promote among all citizens fraternity which would assure the dignity\n\nof the individual.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">2     The significance of the Preamble lies both in its setting forth the founding\n\nprinciples of the Constitution as well as in the broad sweep of their content. The\n\nConstitution was brought into existence to oversee a radical transformation.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_261\">There would be a transformation of political power from a colonial regime. There\n\nwas to be a transformation in the structure of governance. Above all the\n\nConstitution envisages a transformation in the position of the individual, as a\n\nfocal point of a just society. The institutions through which the nation would be\n\ngoverned would be subsumed in a democratic polity where real power both in\n\nlegal and political terms would be entrusted to the people. The purpose of\n\nadopting a democratic Constitution was to allow a peaceful transition from a\n\ncolonial power to home rule. In understanding the fundamental principles of the\n\nConstitution which find reflection in the Preamble, it is crucial to notice that the\n\ntransfer of political power from a colonial regime was but one of the purposes\n\nwhich the framers sought to achieve. The transfer of political power furnished\n\nthe imperative for drafting a fundamental text of governance. But the task which\n\nthe framers assumed was infinitely more sensitive. They took upon themselves\n\nabove all, the task to transform Indian society by remedying centuries of\n\ndiscrimination against Dalits, women and the marginalised. They sought to\n\nprovide them a voice by creating a culture of rights and a political environment\n\nto assert freedom. Above all, placing those who were denuded of their human\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_336\">                                         4</span>\n\f                                                                             PART A\n\n\nrights before the advent of the Constitution – whether in the veneer of caste,\n\npatriarchy or otherwise – were to be placed in control of their own destinies by\n\nthe assurance of the equal protection of law. Fundamental to their vision was\n\nthe ability of the Constitution to pursue a social transformation. Intrinsic to the\n\nsocial transformation is the role of each individual citizen in securing justice,\n\nliberty, equality and fraternity in all its dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n3     The four founding principles are not disjunctive. Together, the values\n\nwhich they incorporate within each principle coalesce in achieving the fulfilment\n\nof human happiness. The universe encompassed by the four founding principles\n\nis larger the sum total of its parts. The Constitution cannot be understood without\n\nperceiving the complex relationship between the values which it elevates. So,\n\nliberty in matters of belief, faith and worship, must produce a compassionate\n\nand humane society marked by the equality of status among all its citizens. The\n\nfreedom to believe, to be a person of faith and to be a human being in prayer\n\nhas to be fulfilled in the context of a society which does not discriminate between\n\nits citizens. Their equality in all matters of status and opportunity gives true\n\nmeaning to the liberty of belief, faith and worship. Equality between citizens is\n\nafter all, a powerful safeguard to preserve a common universe of liberties\n\nbetween citizens, including in matters of religion. Combined together, individual\n\nliberty, equality and fraternity among citizens are indispensable to a social and\n\npolitical ordering in which the dignity of the individual is realised. Our\n\nunderstanding of the Constitution can be complete only if we acknowledge the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_337\">                                          5</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\ncomplex relationship between the pursuit of justice, the protection of liberty,\n\nrealisation of equality and the assurance of fraternity.

In giving meaning to its provisions and\n\nin finding solutions to the intractable problems of the present, it is well to remind\n\nourselves on each occasion that the purpose of this basic document which\n\ngoverns our society is to bring about a constitutional transformation. In a\n\nconstitutional transformation, the means are as significant as are our ends. The\n\nmeans ensure that the process is guided by values. The ends, or the\n\ntransformation, underlie the vision of the Constitution. It is by being rooted in\n\nthe Constitution’s quest for transforming Indian society that we can search for\n\nanswers to the binaries which have polarised our society. The conflict in this\n\ncase between religious practices and the claim of dignity for women in matters\n\nof faith and worship, is essentially about resolving those polarities.\n\n\n\n\n5     Essentially, the significance of this case lies in the issues which it poses\n\nto the adjudicatory role of this Court in defining the boundaries of religion in a\n\ndialogue about our public spaces. Does the Constitution, in the protection which\n\nit grants to religious faith, allow the exclusion of women of a particular age group\n\nfrom a temple dedicated to the public? Will the quest for human dignity be\n\nincomplete or remain but a writ in sand if the Constitution accepts the exclusion\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">                                         6</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART A\n\n\nof women from worship in a public temple?                  Will the quest for equality and\n\nfraternity be denuded of its content where women continue to be treated as\n\nchildren of a lesser god in exercising their liberties in matters of belief, faith and\n\nworship? Will the pursuit of individual dignity be capable of being achieved if\n\nwe deny to women equal rights in matters of faith and worship, on the basis of\n\na physiological aspect of their existence? These questions are central to\n\nunderstanding the purpose of the Constitution, as they are to defining the role\n\nwhich is ascribed to the Constitution in controlling the closed boundaries of\n\norganised religion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_263\">\n\n\n6     The chapter on Fundamental Rights encompasses the rights to (i)\n\nEquality (Articles 14 to 18); (ii) Freedom (Articles 19 to 24); (iii) Freedom of\n\nreligion (Articles 25 to 28); (iv) Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29 and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_264\">30); and (v) Constitutional remedies (<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_591\">Article 32</a>).\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_592\">Article 25</a> provides thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">             “25.

By\n\nconferring this right on all persons, the Constitution emphasises the universal\n\nnature of the right. By all persons, the Constitution means exactly what it says :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">every individual in society without distinction of any kind whatsoever is entitled\n\nto the right. By speaking of an equal entitlement, the Constitution places every\n\nindividual on an even platform. Having guaranteed equality before the law and\n\nthe equal protection of laws in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_594\">Article 14</a>, the draftspersons specifically\n\ncontinued the theme of an equal entitlement as an intrinsic element of the\n\nfreedom of conscience and of the right to profess, practice and propagate\n\nreligion. There are three defining features of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_595\">Article 25:</a> firstly, the\n\nentitlement of all persons without exception, secondly, the recognition of an\n\nequal entitlement; and thirdly, the recognition both of the freedom of conscience\n\nand the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion. The right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_596\">Article 25(1)</a> is evidently an individual right for, it is in the individual that a\n\nconscience inheres. Moreover, it is the individual who professes, practices and\n\npropagates religion. Freedom of religion in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_597\">Article 25(1)</a> is a right which the\n\nConstitution recognises as dwelling in each individual or natural person.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_340\">                                              8</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_191\">\f                                                                               PART A\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_266\">7      Yet, the right to the freedom of religion is not absolute.            For the\n\nConstitution has expressly made it subject to public order, morality and health\n\non one hand and to the other provisions of Part III, on the other. The subjection\n\nof the individual right to the freedom of religion to the other provisions of the Part\n\nis a nuanced departure from the position occupied by the other rights to freedom\n\nrecognised in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_598\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_599\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_600\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_601\">21.</a> While guaranteeing equality and the\n\nequal protection of laws in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_602\">Article 14</a> and its emanation, in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_603\">Article 15</a>, which\n\nprohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth,\n\nthe Constitution does not condition these basic norms of equality to the other\n\nprovisions of Part III. Similar is the case with the freedoms guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_604\">Article\n\n19(1)</a> or the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_605\">Article 21.</a> The subjection of the individual right\n\nto the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_606\">Article 25(1)</a> to the other provisions of Part III\n\nwas not a matter without substantive content. Evidently, in the constitutional\n\norder of priorities, the individual right to the freedom of religion was not intended\n\nto prevail over but was subject to the overriding constitutional postulates of\n\nequality, liberty and personal freedoms recognised in the other provisions of\n\nPart III.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_267\">\n\n\n8      Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_607\">Article 25</a> protects laws which existed at the adoption of the\n\nConstitution and the power of the state to enact laws in future, dealing with two\n\ncategories. The first of those categories consists of laws regulating or restricting\n\neconomic, financial, political or other secular activities which may be associated\n\nwith religious practices. Thus, in sub-clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_608\">Article 25 (2)</a>, the Constitution\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_341\">                                          9</span>\n\f                                                                               PART A\n\n\nhas segregated matters of religious practice from secular activities, including\n\nthose of an economic, financial or political nature.        The expression “other\n\nsecular activity” which follows upon the expression “economic, financial,\n\npolitical” indicates that matters of a secular nature may be regulated or restricted\n\nby law. The fact that these secular activities are associated with or, in other\n\nwords, carried out in conjunction with religious practice, would not put them\n\nbeyond the pale of legislative regulation. The second category consists of laws\n\nproviding for (i) social welfare and reform; or (ii) throwing open of Hindu religious\n\ninstitutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus. The\n\nexpression “social welfare and reform” is not confined to matters only of the\n\nHindu religion. However, in matters of temple entry, the Constitution recognised\n\nthe disabilities which Hindu religion had imposed over the centuries which\n\nrestricted the rights of access to dalits and to various groups within Hindu\n\nsociety. The effect of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_609\">Article 25</a> is to protect the ability of the state\n\nto enact laws, and to save existing laws on matters governed by sub-clauses\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_268\">(a) and (b). Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_610\">Article 25</a> is clarificatory of the regulatory power of the\n\nstate over matters of public order, morality and health which already stand\n\nrecognised in clause (1). Clause 1 makes the right conferred subject to public\n\norder, morality and health. Clause 2 does not circumscribe the ambit of the\n\n‘subject to public order, morality or health’ stipulation in clause 1. What clause\n\n2 indicates is that the authority of the state to enact laws on the categories is\n\nnot trammelled by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_611\">Article 25.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_269\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_342\">                                         10</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART A\n\n\n9     <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_612\">Article 26</a>, as its marginal note indicates, deals with the “freedom to\n\nmanage religious affairs”:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_192\">             “26.

The\n\nArticle covers four distinct facets: (i) establishment and maintenance of\n\ninstitutions for purposes of a religious and charitable nature; (ii) managing the\n\naffairs of the denomination in matters of religion; (iii) ownership and acquisition\n\nof immovable property; and (iv) administration of the property in accordance\n\nwith law. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_614\">Article 26</a>, as in the case of <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_615\">Article 25(1)</a>, is prefaced by a “subject to\n\npublic order, morality and health” stipulation. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_616\">Article 26(1)</a> does not embody the\n\nadditional stipulation found in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_617\">Article 25(1)</a> viz; “and to the other provisions of\n\nthis Part.” The significance of this will be explored shortly.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_270\">10    Public order, morality and health are grounds which the Constitution\n\ncontemplates as the basis of restricting both the individual right to freedom of\n\nreligion in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_618\">Article 25(1)</a> and the right of religious denominations under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_619\">Article 26.</a>\n\nThe vexed issue is about the content of morality in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_620\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_621\">26.</a> What\n\nmeaning should be ascribed to the content of the expression ‘morality’ is a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">                                               11</span>\n\f                                                                            PART A\n\n\nmatter of constitutional moment. In the case of the individual right as well as\n\nthe right of religious denominations, morality has an overarching position similar\n\nto public order and health because the rights recognised by both the Articles are\n\nsubject to those stipulations. <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_622\">Article 25(2)</a> contemplates that the Article will\n\nneither affect the operation of existing law or prevent the state from enacting a\n\nlaw for the purposes stipulated in sub-clauses (a) and (b).\n\n\n\n\n11    In defining the content of morality, did the draftspersons engage with\n\nprevailing morality in society? Or does the reference to morality refer to\n\nsomething more fundamental? Morality for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_623\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_624\">26</a>\n\ncannot have an ephemeral existence. Popular notions about what is moral and\n\nwhat is not are transient and fleeting. Popular notions about what is or is not\n\nmoral may in fact be deeply offensive to individual dignity and human rights.\n\nIndividual dignity cannot be allowed to be subordinate to the morality of the mob.\n\nNor can the intolerance of society operate as a marauding morality to control\n\nindividual self-expression in its manifest form.    The Constitution would not\n\nrender the existence of rights so precarious by subjecting them to passing\n\nfancies or to the aberrations of a morality of popular opinion. The draftspersons\n\nof the Constitution would not have meant that the content of morality should\n\nvary in accordance with the popular fashions of the day. The expression has\n\nbeen adopted in a constitutional text and it would be inappropriate to give it a\n\ncontent which is momentary or impermanent.         Then again, the expression\n\n‘morality’ cannot be equated with prevailing social conceptions or those which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">                                        12</span>\n\f                                                                             PART A\n\n\nmay be subsumed within mainstream thinking in society at a given time. The\n\nConstitution has been adopted for a society of plural cultures and if its provisions\n\nare any indication, it is evident that the text does not pursue either a religious\n\ntheocracy or a dominant ideology. In adopting a democratic Constitution, the\n\nframers would have been conscious of the fact that governance by a majority is\n\nall about the accumulation of political power. Constitutional democracies do not\n\nnecessarily result in constitutional liberalism. While our Constitution has\n\nadopted a democratic form of governance it has at the same time adopted\n\nvalues based on constitutional liberalism. Central to those values is the position\n\nof the individual. The fundamental freedoms which Part III confers are central\n\nto the constitutional purpose of overseeing a transformation of a society based\n\non dignity, liberty and equality. Hence, morality for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_625\">Articles 25</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_626\">26</a> must mean that which is governed by fundamental constitutional\n\nprinciples.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_271\">\n\n12    The content of morality is founded on the four precepts which emerge\n\nfrom the Preamble. The first among them is the need to ensure justice in its\n\nsocial, economic and political dimensions. The second is the postulate of\n\nindividual liberty in matters of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship.\n\nThe third is equality of status and opportunity amongst all citizens. The fourth\n\nis the sense of fraternity amongst all citizens which assures the dignity of\n\nhuman life. Added to these four precepts is the fundamental postulate of\n\nsecularism which treats all religions on an even platform and allows to each\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_345\">                                        13</span>\n\f                                                                             PART A\n\n\nindividual the fullest liberty to believe or not to believe. Conscience, it must be\n\nremembered, is emphasised by the same provision. The Constitution is meant\n\nas much for the agnostic as it is for the worshipper. It values and protects the\n\nconscience of the atheist. The founding faith upon which the Constitution is\n\nbased is the belief that it is in the dignity of each individual that the pursuit of\n\nhappiness is founded. Individual dignity can be achieved only in a regime which\n\nrecognises liberty as inhering in each individual as a natural right. Human dignity\n\npostulates an equality between persons. Equality necessarily is an equality\n\nbetween sexes and genders.         Equality postulates a right to be free from\n\ndiscrimination and to have the protection of the law in the same manner as is\n\navailable to every citizen. Equality above all is a protective shield against the\n\narbitrariness of any form of authority. These founding principles must govern\n\nour constitutional notions of morality. Constitutional morality must have a value\n\nof permanence which is not subject to the fleeting fancies of every time and age.\n\nIf the vision which the founders of the Constitution adopted has to survive,\n\nconstitutional morality must have a content which is firmly rooted in the\n\nfundamental postulates of human liberty, equality, fraternity and dignity. These\n\nare the means to secure justice in all its dimensions to the individual citizen.\n\nOnce these postulates are accepted, the necessary consequence is that the\n\nfreedom of religion and, likewise, the freedom to manage the affairs of a\n\nreligious denomination is subject to and must yield to these fundamental notions\n\nof constitutional morality. In the public law conversations between religion and\n\nmorality, it is the overarching sense of constitutional morality which has to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_346\">                                        14</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\nprevail. While the Constitution recognises religious beliefs and faiths, its\n\npurpose is to ensure a wider acceptance of human dignity and liberty as the\n\nultimate founding faith of the fundamental text of our governance. Where a\n\nconflict arises, the quest for human dignity, liberty and equality must prevail.\n\nThese, above everything else, are matters on which the Constitution has willed\n\nthat its values must reign supreme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_272\">\n\n\n13    The expression “subject to” is in the nature of a condition or proviso.\n\nMaking a provision subject to another may indicate that the former is controlled\n\nby or is subordinate to the other. In making clause 1 of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_627\">Article 25</a> subject to the\n\nother provisions of Part III without introducing a similar limitation in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_628\">Article 26</a>,\n\nthe Constitution should not readily be assumed to have intended the same\n\nresult. Evidently the individual right under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_629\">Article 25(1)</a> is not only subject to\n\npublic order, morality and health, but it is also subordinate to the other freedoms\n\nthat are guaranteed by Part III. In omitting the additional stipulation in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_630\">Article\n\n26</a>, the Constitution has consciously not used words that would indicate an\n\nintent specifically to make <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_631\">Article 26</a> subordinate to the other freedoms. This\n\ntextual interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_632\">Article 26</a>, in juxtaposition with <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_633\">Article 25</a> is good as far\n\nas it goes. But does that by itself lend credence to the theory that the right of a\n\nreligious denomination to manage its affairs is a standalone right uncontrolled\n\nor unaffected by the other fundamental freedoms? The answer to this must lie\n\nin the negative. It is one thing to say that <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_634\">Article 26</a> is not subordinate to (not\n\n‘subject to’) other freedoms in Part III. But it is quite another thing to assume\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_347\">                                         15</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_635\">Article 26</a> has no connect with other freedoms or that the right of religious\n\ndenominations is unconcerned with them. To say as a matter of interpretation\n\nthat a provision in law is not subordinate to another is one thing. But the absence\n\nof words of subjection does not necessarily attribute to the provision a status\n\nindependent of a cluster of other entitlements, particularly those based on\n\nindividual freedoms. Even where one provision is not subject to another there\n\nwould still be a ground to read both together so that they exist in harmony.\n\nConstitutional interpretation is all about bringing a sense of equilibrium, a\n\nbalance, so that read individually and together the provisions of the Constitution\n\nexist in contemporaneous accord. Unless such an effort were to be made, the\n\nsynchrony between different parts of the Constitution would not be preserved.\n\nIn interpreting a segment of the Constitution devoted exclusively to fundamental\n\nrights one must eschew an approach which would result in asynchrony. Co-\n\nexistence of freedoms is crucial, in the ultimate analysis, to a constitutional order\n\nwhich guarantees them and seeks to elevate them to a platform on which every\n\nindividual without distinction can reap their fruit without a bar to access. Thus,\n\nthe absence of words in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_636\">Article 26</a> which would make its provisions subordinate\n\nto the other fundamental freedoms neither gives the right conferred upon\n\nreligious denominations a priority which overrides other freedoms nor does it\n\nallow the freedom of a religious denomination to exist in an isolated silo. In real\n\nlife it is difficult to replicate the conditions of a controlled experiment in a\n\nlaboratory. Real life is all about complexities and uncertainties arising out of the\n\nassertions of entitlements and conflicts of interests among groups of different\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_348\">                                         16</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\nhues in society. The freedoms which find an elaboration in Part III are exercised\n\nwithin a society which is networked. The freedoms themselves have linkages\n\nwhich cannot be ignored. There is, therefore, a convincing reason not to allow\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_637\">Article 26</a> to tread in isolation. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_638\">Article 26</a> is one among a large\n\ncluster of freedoms which the Constitution has envisaged as intrinsic to human\n\nliberty and dignity. In locating the freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_639\">Article 26</a> within a group – the\n\nreligious denomination – the text in fact allows us to regard the fundamental\n\nright recognised in it as one facet of the overall components of liberty in a free\n\nsociety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_273\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513801\" id=\"span_349\">14        This approach to constitutional interpretation which I propose and follow\n\nis acceptable for another reason, as a matter of constitutional doctrine.

The procedure for deprivation must be free of the taint of that which\n\nis arbitrary. This reading of the fundamental rights as constellations emanating\n\nfrom a cosmos of freedom and as having paths which intersect and merge\n\nenhances the value of freedom itself. Though the principal provision relating to\n\nequality before the law is embodied in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_644\">Article 14</a>, the four articles which follow it\n\nare a manifestation of its basic doctrines. <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_645\">Article 15</a> in outlawing discrimination\n\non grounds of religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth is but a manifestation\n\nof equality. Equality in matters of public employment under <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_646\">Article 16</a> is a facet\n\nof the basic postulate of equality. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_647\">Article 17</a> gives expression to equality in\n\nabolishing untouchability: a practice fundamentally at odds to the notion of an\n\nequal society. Titles which place some citizens above others are abolished by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_648\">Article 18</a> in manifesting yet another aspect of equality. As we have seen, a\n\nfundamental notion of equality is embodied in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_649\">Article 25(1)</a> itself when it speaks\n\nof an equal entitlement to freely practice, profess and propagate religion. This\n\nsense of equality permeates the other guarantees of fundamental freedoms as\n\nwell. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_650\">Article 19</a> recognises six freedoms as an entitlement “of all citizens”.\n\nRecognizing that a right inheres in all citizens is a constitutional affirmation that\n\nevery citizen, without exception or discrimination of any kind is entitled to those\n\nfreedoms. Then again, the restrictions on the freedoms contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_651\">Articles\n\n19(2)</a> to (6) have to be reasonable. Reasonableness is a facet of equality. The\n\nequal application of law to persons similarly circumstanced is a fundamental\n\n\n\n4   (1978) 1 SCC 248\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">                                         18</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\npostulate of the protections which are conferred by <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_652\">Articles 20</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_653\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_654\">22.</a> Thus\n\nthe principle which has become an entrenched part of our constitutional doctrine\n\nafter the decision in Bank Nationalization is based on a sure foundation. The\n\nfreedoms which we possess and those which we exercise are not disjunctive\n\nparts, separate from each other. Individuals in society exercise not one but\n\nmany of the freedoms. An individual exercises a multitude of freedoms as a\n\ncomposite part of the human personality. A single act embodies within it the\n\nexercise of many choices reflecting the assertion of manifold freedoms. From\n\nthis perspective, it is but a short step to hold that all freedoms exist in harmony.\n\nOur freedoms are enveloped in the womb created by the Constitution for the\n\nsurvival of liberty. Hence, the absence of a clause of subjection in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_655\">Article 26</a>\n\ndoes not lead to the conclusion that the freedom of a religious denomination\n\nexists as a discrete element, divorced from the others. This approach is quite\n\nindependent of the consideration that even <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_656\">Article 26</a> like <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_657\">Article 25(1)</a> is subject\n\nto public order, morality and health. Once we hold, following the line which is\n\nnow part of conventional doctrine, that all freedoms have linkages and exist in\n\na state of mutual co-existence, the freedom of religious denominations under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_658\">Article 26</a> must be read in a manner which preserves equally, other individual\n\nfreedoms which may be impacted by an unrestrained exercise. Hence, the\n\ndignity of women which is an emanation of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_659\">Article 15</a> and a reflection of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_660\">Article\n\n21</a> cannot be disassociated from the exercise of religious freedom under Article</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_275\">26.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_354\">                                        19</span>\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n\n15    Once <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_661\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_662\">26</a> are read in the manner in which they have been\n\ninterpreted, the distinction between the articles in terms of the presence or\n\nabsence of a clause of subjection should make little practical significance to the\n\nrelationship between the freedom of religion with the other freedoms recognized\n\nin the fundamental rights. If the Constitution has to have a meaning, is it\n\npermissible for religion – either as a matter of individual belief or as an organized\n\nstructure of religious precepts – to assert an entitlement to do what is derogatory\n\nto women? Dignity of the individual is the unwavering premise of the\n\nfundamental rights. Autonomy nourishes dignity by allowing each individual to\n\nmake critical choices for the exercise of liberty. A liberal Constitution such as\n\nours recognizes a wide range of rights to inhere in each individual. Without\n\nfreedom, the individual would be bereft of her individuality. Anything that is\n\ndestructive of individual dignity is anachronistic to our constitutional ethos. The\n\nequality between sexes and equal protection of gender is an emanation of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_663\">Article 15.</a> Whether or not <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_664\">Article 15</a> is attracted to a particular source of the\n\ninvasion of rights is not of overarching importance for the simple reason that the\n\nfundamental principles which emerge from the Preamble, as we have noticed\n\nearlier, infuse constitutional morality into its content. In our public discourse of\n\nindividual rights, neither religious freedom nor organized religion can be heard\n\nto assert an immunity to adhere to fundamental constitutional precepts\n\ngrounded in dignity and human liberty. The postulate of equality is that human\n\nbeings are created equal. The postulate is not that all men are created equal\n\nbut that all individuals are created equal. To exclude women from worship by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_355\">                                         20</span>\n\f                                                                             PART A\n\n\nallowing the right to worship to men is to place women in a position of\n\nsubordination. The Constitution, should not become an instrument for the\n\nperpetuation of patriarchy. The freedom to believe, the freedom to be a person\n\nof faith and the freedom of worship, are attributes of human liberty. Facets of\n\nthat liberty find protection in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_665\">Article 25.</a> Religion then cannot become a cover to\n\nexclude and to deny the basic right to find fulfilment in worship to women. Nor\n\ncan a physiological feature associated with a woman provide a constitutional\n\nrationale to deny to her the right to worship which is available to others. Birth\n\nmarks and physiology are irrelevant to constitutional entitlements which are\n\nprovided to every individual. To exclude from worship, is to deny one of the most\n\nbasic postulates of human dignity to women. Neither can the Constitution\n\ncountenance such an exclusion nor can a free society accept it under the veneer\n\nof religious beliefs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_276\">\n\n\n16     Much of our jurisprudence on religion has evolved, as we shall see,\n\naround what constitutes an essential religious practice. At a certain level an\n\nadjudication of what is a religious practice seems to have emerged from the\n\ndistinction made in clause 2(a) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_666\">Article 25</a> between a religious practice and\n\neconomic, financial, political or other secular activities which are associated with\n\nreligious practices. Where the state has enacted a law by which it claims to have\n\nregulated a secular activity associated with a religious practice, but not the\n\nreligious practice, it becomes necessary to decide the issue, where the validity\n\nof the law is challenged. Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_667\">Article 26(b)</a> speaks of “matters of religion”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_356\">                                        21</span>\n\f                                                                             PART A\n\n\nwhen it recognises the right of a religious denomination to manage them. In the\n\ncontext of <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_668\">Article 26(b)</a>, this Court has embarked upon a course to decide in\n\nindividual cases whether, what was said to be regulated by the state was a\n\nmatter of religion which falls within the freedom guaranteed to the denomination.\n\nThese compulsions nonetheless have led the court to don a theological mantle.\n\nThe enquiry has moved from deciding what is essentially religious to what is an\n\nessential religious practice. Donning such a role is not an easy task when the\n\nCourt is called upon to decide whether a practice does nor does not form an\n\nessential part of a religious belief.     Scriptures and customs merge with\n\nbewildering complexity into superstition and dogma. Separating the grain from\n\nthe chaff involves a complex adjudicatory function. Decisions of the Court have\n\nattempted to bring in a measure of objectivity by holding that the Court has been\n\ncalled upon to decide on the basis of the tenets of the religion itself. But even\n\nthat is not a consistent norm.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_277\">\n\n17    Our conversations with the Constitution must be restructured to evolve\n\nboth with the broadening of the content of liberty and dignity and the role of the\n\nCourt as an enforcer of constitutional doctrine. The basic principle which must\n\nguide any analysis in this area is the dominance of the values of liberty, equality\n\nand fraternity as instruments in achieving individual dignity. Once individual\n\ndignity assumes the character of a shining star in the constellation of\n\nfundamental rights, the place of religion in public places must be conditioned by\n\nIndia’s unwavering commitment to a constitutional order based on human\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_357\">                                        22</span>\n\f                                                                                PART A\n\n\ndignity. Practices which are destructive of liberty and those which make some\n\ncitizens less equal than others can simply not be countenanced.              To treat\n\nwomen as children of a lesser god is to blink at the Constitution itself. Among\n\nthe fundamental duties of every citizen recognized by the Constitution is “to\n\nrenounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women”.5 In speaking to the\n\nequality between individuals in matters of livelihood, health and remuneration\n\nfor work, the Directive Principles speak to the conscience of the Constitution.\n\nTo allow practices derogatory to the dignity of a woman in matters of faith and\n\nworship would permit a conscious breach of the fundamental duties of every\n\ncitizen. We cannot adopt an interpretation of the Constitution which has such\n\nan effect. Our inability to state this as a matter of constitutional doctrine is liable\n\nto lead us to positions of pretence or, worse still, hypocrisy. Both are willing\n\nallies to push critical issues under the carpet. If we are truly to emerge out of\n\nthe grim shadows of a society which has subjugated groups of our citizens under\n\nthe weight of discrimination for centuries, it is time that the Constitution is\n\nallowed to speak as it can only do: in a forthright manner as a compact of\n\ngovernance, for today and the future.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_278\">\n\n\n18         Now it is in this background that it would be necessary to explore the\n\nprinciples which emerge from the precedents of this Court which explain the\n\ncontent of <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_669\">Article 25(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_670\">Article 26.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_279\">\n\n\n5   <a href=\"/doc/1431035/\" id=\"a_671\">Article 51A(e)</a>, The Constitution of India\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">                                                23</span>\n\f                                                                                                      PART B\n\n\nB          History: Lord Ayyappa and the Sabarimala Temple\n\nOrigins\n\n\n19         The Sabarimala Temple, devoted to Lord Ayyappa is a temple of great\n\nantiquity.

The Minister suggested that the Queen\n\npretend that she was suffering from a severe headache, whereupon he would\n\nmake the physician prescribe that the milk of a tigress be brought to cure her.\n\nTo achieve this, he suggested that Manikanta should be sent to the forest.\n\n\n\n21    Manikanta soon left for the forest after promising the King that he would\n\nreturn with the milk of a tigress. Manikanta set out on his journey after having\n\nrefused an escort of men that the King had desired to accompanying him. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_360\">                                       25</span>\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\n\nKing had sent with Manikanta food and coconuts with three eyes, in the\n\nremembrance of Lord Shiva. In the forest, Lord Shiva appeared before\n\nManikanta and told him that though he had done his duty towards the devas, he\n\nwas left with the task to ensure the King’s comfort. Lord Shiva told Manikanta\n\nthat he could go back to the Palace with Lord Indra in the form of a tiger.\n\n\n\nWhen Manikanta was seated on the tiger, and all the female devatas in the\n\ndisguise of tigresses started their journey to the palace, the schemers were\n\nfrightened into confessing their plot. They were convinced of his divine origins\n\nand prayed for their own salvation and for the safety of the Kingdom. Manikanta\n\ndisappeared. The King refused to eat anything till his return. Manikanta\n\nappeared in the form of a vision before the King. Filled with emotions of\n\nhappiness, grief, fear, wonder and ‘Bhakti, the King stood praying for mercy and\n\nthe blessings of Manikanta. He repented in front of Manikanta for not having\n\nrealized his divine power and for treating him merely as his child. The Lord\n\nlovingly embraced the King who prayed to bless him by freeing him from ego\n\nand the worldy cycle of rebirth. Manikanta granted him Moksha (salvation). He\n\ntold the King that he was destined to return. The King implored Manikanta to\n\nallow him to build a temple and dedicate it to him. The Lord assented. Manikanta\n\nthen enlightened the King on the path of Moksha.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_282\">\n\n22    The Lord shot an arrow that fell at the pinnacle of Sabarimala and told the\n\nKing that he could construct a temple at Sabarimala, north of the Holy river\n\nPampa and install his deity there.

The pilgrimage takes place in four stages. First, there\n\nis a formal initiation ceremony that begins a forty-one day Vratham. This is\n\nfollowed by another formal ceremony at the end of the Vratham period, called\n\nthe Irumuti Kattal (tying of bundle), after which the pilgrims set off for their yatra\n\nto the Ayyappa Temple at Sabarimala. This stage includes the physical travel\n\nto the pilgrimage site, bathing in the holy river Pampa at the foot of Mount Sabari\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_362\">                                         27</span>\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n\nand the climb up Mount Sabari. This involves a trek from the Pampa river,\n\nclimbing 3000 feet to the Sannidhanam, which is a trek of around 13 Kms, or\n\nthrough forests which is a trek of 41 Kms. It ends with the pilgrim’s ascending\n\nthe sacred” eighteen steps to the shrine for the first darshan or glimpse of the\n\ndeity. The fourth stage is the return journey and the final incorporation back into\n\nlife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_285\">\n\n\nModern communications have made the task less arduous. In 1960, an access\n\nroad was constructed for vehicles, so that a pilgrim can drive right up to the foot\n\nof Sabarimala. From here, the holy summit is just 8 kms away. The Kerala State\n\nTransport Corporation runs special buses during the season of pilgrimage. The\n\nbuses connect Pampa directly with almost all the main cities in Kerala, Tamil\n\nNadu and Karnataka.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_286\">\n\n\n24      The pilgrimage has three distinctive features: (i) It is almost exclusively a\n\nmale-centric pilgrimage that bars women between the ages of ten and fifty from\n\nparticipating in the rituals; (ii) Though the worshippers of Lord Ayyappa fall\n\nbroadly within the Hindu tradition, yet males of all ages may participate on an\n\nequal footing, regardless of caste, creed or religion. Muslims and Christians are\n\nalso known to undertake this pilgrimage, enjoying the same equality; and (iii)\n\nThe actual journey to the pilgrimage site is preceded by a preparatory period of\n\nforty-one days. During this period, pilgrims are obliged to wear black clothes\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_363\">                                          28</span>\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n\nand the ‘mala’ with which they are initiated, and they must observe celibacy,\n\nabstinence from meat and intoxicants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_287\">\n\n25      Traditionally though the Vratham period extended over forty-one days,\n\nnowadays shorter periods are permitted. While it is expected that for first time\n\ninitiaties observe the forty-one day Vratham, others shorten the term to two\n\nweeks or even six days. A key essential of the Vratham is a sathvic lifestyle and\n\nbrahmacharya. This is believed to be a step towards a pure body and mind an\n\neffort to be aloof from the materialistic world, by taking a step towards the path\n\nof devotion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_288\">\nThe Vratham or penance entails:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_289\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">(i)     Abstaining from physical relations with a spouse;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">(ii)    Abstention from intoxicating drinks, smoking and tamasic food;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">(iii)   Living in isolation from the rest of the family;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">(iv)    Refraining from interacting with women in daily life including those\n\n        in the family;\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">(v)     Cooking one’s own food;\n\n(vi)    Maintaining hygiene including bathing twice a day before prayers;\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">(vii)   Wearing a black mundu and upper garments;</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n\n(viii) Partaking of one meal a day; and\n\n(ix)    Walking barefoot.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_364\">                                           29</span>\n\f                                                                                                   PART C\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">The penance is to be carried out in the manner prescribed.

The Court\n\n\n26   (1958) SCR 895\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_386\">                                                    47</span>\n\f                                                                             PART F\n\n\naccepted the claim that the temple was a denominational temple founded for\n\nthe benefit of the Gowda Saraswats, and proceeded to examine whether\n\nexercising the right of a religious denomination under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_761\">Article 26(b)</a>, they were\n\n‘entitled to exclude other communities from entering into it for worship on the\n\nground that it was a matter of religion.’\n\n\n\n\nRather than allowing the religious denomination ‘complete autonomy in the\n\nmatter of deciding as to what rites and ceremonies are essential’, the Court\n\nexamined scripture and precedent to determine whether the exclusion of a\n\nperson from entering into a temple for worship was a matter of religion under\n\nHindu Ceremonial Law. Justice Venkatarama Aiyar reviewed ancient literature,\n\nthe practice of Hindus, and the role of temples in that practice, and concluded\n\non behalf of the Court that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_291\">             “18…Thus, under the ceremonial law pertaining to temples,\n             who are entitled to enter them for worship and where they are\n             entitled to stand and worship and how the worship is to be\n             conducted are all matters of religion.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nThis firmly established the Court’s role in determining what constituted\n\n‘essential’ religious practices.

Such intention can be gathered only from the\n             words actually used in the statute; and in a Court of law, what\n             is unexpressed has the same value as what is unintended.

In Shirur Mutt, the\n\nautonomy to decide what is essential to religion was coupled with the definition\n\nof religion itself, which was to comprehend belief and practice. In Devaru, the\n\nCourt laid down a crucial precedent in carving out its role in examining the\n\nessentiality of such practices. While the Court would take into consideration the\n\nviews of a religious community in determining whether a practice qualified as\n\nessential, this would not be determinative.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_313\">Prior to Devaru, this Court used the word ‘essential’ to distinguish between\n\nreligious and secular practices in order to circumscribe the extent of state\n\nintervention in religious matters. The shift in judicial approach took place when\n\n‘essentially religious’ (as distinct from the secular) became conflated with\n\n‘essential to religion.’ The Court’s enquiry into the essentiality of the practice in\n\nquestion represented a shift in the test, which now enjoined upon the Court the\n\nduty to decide which religious practices would be afforded constitutional\n\nprotection, based on the determination of what constitutes an essential religious\n\npractice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_314\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131364175\" id=\"span_389\">33         In <a href=\"/doc/131364175/\" id=\"a_777\">Mohd.

The Court relied on firmans (edicts or administrative orders)\n\nissued by emperors of the erstwhile Mughal Empire to hold that the temple was\n\npublic and that the Tilkayat was “merely a custodian, manager and trustee of\n\nthe temple.” Justice Gajendragadkar, writing for the Bench, underlined why the\n\nclaims of a community regarding their religious practices could not be accepted\n\nwithout scrutiny:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_303\">                  “57.In deciding the question as to whether a given religious\n                  practice is an integral part of the religion or not, the test always\n                  would be whether it is regarded as such by the community\n                  following the religion or not.

The Court observed that where\n\n‘conflicting evidence is produced in respect of rival contentions as to competing\n\nreligious practices,’ a ‘blind application’ of the Shirur Mutt formula may not\n\nresolve a dispute, because persons within a community may have diverse and\n\ncontrasting conceptions of what is essential to their religion. It was therefore\n\nheld to be incumbent upon the Court to determine not only whether a practice\n\nwas religious in character, but also whether it could be considered an essential\n\npart of religion. Beginning with the Shirur Mutt formulation that what is essential\n\nto religion would be determined by the adherents to the faith, the Court moved\n\ntowards a doctrine that what is essential “will always have to be decided by the\n\nCourt.” In fact, the Court would determine whether a statute sought to regulate\n\nwhat is “essentially and absolutely secular.” What is religious and what is\n\nsecular and the boundaries of both were then to be adjudicated by the Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_401\">                                                58</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_305\">\f                                                                                      PART F\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_321\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145565\" id=\"span_402\">40        In <a href=\"/doc/145565/\" id=\"a_802\">Sastri Yagnapurushadji v.

The\n\nmajority and minority concurred, however, that the belief of a religious\n\ndenomination claiming a particular practice to be essential must be taken into\n\nconsideration in the determination of the essentiality of that practice.\n\n\n\n\n47    In its jurisprudence on religious freedom, this Court has evolved a body\n\nof principles which define the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_815\">Article 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_816\">Article 26</a>\n\nto practices ‘essential’ to the religion. The Constitution has been held to protect\n\nnot only freedom of religious belief, but acts done in pursuance of those beliefs.\n\nWhile the views of a religious denomination are to be taken into consideration\n\nin determining whether a practice is essential, those views are not determinative\n\nof its essentiality. The Court has assumed a central role in determining what is\n\nor is not essential to religious belief. Intrinsic to the role which the Court has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_415\">                                           66</span>\n\f                                                                              PART F\n\n\ncarved out, it has sought to distinguish between what is religious and what is a\n\nsecular practice, even if it is associated with a religious activity. Going further,\n\nthe Court has enquired into whether a practice is essential to religion.\n\nEssentiality of the practice would, as the Court as held depend on whether the\n\nfundamental character of a religion would be altered. if it were not observed.\n\nAbove all, there is an emphasis on constitutional legitimacy, which underscores\n\nneed to preserve the basic constitutional values associated with the dignity of\n\nthe individual. The ephemeral distinction between religion and superstition\n\nbecomes more coherent in terms of the need to preserve fundamental\n\nconstitutional values associated with human liberty.\n\n\n\n\n48    In determining the essentiality of a practice, it is crucial to consider\n\nwhether the practice is prescribed to be of an obligatory nature within that\n\nreligion. If a practice is optional, it has been held that it cannot be said to be\n\n‘essential’ to a religion. A practice claimed to be essential must be such that the\n\nnature of the religion would be altered in the absence of that practice. If there is\n\na fundamental change in the character of the religion, only then can such a\n\npractice be claimed to be an ‘essential’ part of that religion.\n\n\n\n\nIn Tilkayat, this Court noted that ‘whether an affair in question is an affair in\n\nmatters of religion or not, may present difficulties because sometimes practices,\n\nreligious and secular, are inextricably mixed up.’ The process of disentangling\n\nthem in order to adjudicate upon claims grounded in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_817\">Article 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_818\">Article 26(b)</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_416\">                                         67</span>\n\f                                                                             PART F\n\n\nbecomes ultimately an exercise of judicial balancing. Durgah Committee\n\nestablished that in examining a claim that a practice is essential to religion, the\n\nCourt must ‘carefully scrutinize’ the claims put before it in order to ensure that\n\npractices which have sprung from ‘superstitious beliefs’, through grounded in\n\nreligion, will not be afforded constitutional protection. Saifuddin recognized that\n\nwhere a purportedly essential practice is based on an ‘obnoxious social rule or\n\npractice’, it would be amenable to a measure of social reform.\n\n\n\n\nOf crucial importance are the observations in Devaru, where the Court\n\nharmonized the inherent tension between the individual right under <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_819\">Article\n\n25(2)(b)</a> and the denominational right under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_820\">Article 26(b).</a> Where the protection\n\nof denominational rights would substantially reduce the right conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_821\">Article\n\n25(2)(b)</a>, the latter would prevail against the former. This ensures that the\n\nconstitutional guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_822\">Article 25(2)(b)</a> is not destroyed by exclusionary\n\nclaims which detract from individual dignity. That a practice claimed to be\n\nessential has been carried on since time immemorial or is grounded in religious\n\ntexts, does not lend to it constitutional protection unless it passes the test of\n\nessentiality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_330\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_417\">                                        68</span>\n\f                                                                                           PART G\n\n\nG        The      engagement           of     essential       religious        practices   with\n         constitutional values\n\n\n\n49        For decades, this Court has witnessed claims resting on the essentiality\n\nof a practice that militate against the constitutional protection of dignity and\n\nindividual freedom under the Constitution.

Such an approach militates against the fundamental role of the\n\nconstitutional Court as a guardian of fundamental rights.

However, since\n\nthe claim in this case has a significant bearing on the dignity and fundamental\n\nrights of women, an issue of principle must be analysed.\n\n\n\n\n53          It was brought to the notice of this Court that in earlier days, the prohibition\n\non women was because of non-religious factors.55 The ‘main reason’ as\n\nobserved by the High Court in Mahendran, is the arduous nature of the\n\n\n\n54   Ibid, at para 37\n55   Ibid, at para 7\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_427\">                                               73</span>\n\f                                                                                         PART G\n\n\njourney56 which according to the Court could not be completed by women for\n\nphysiological reasons. This claim falls foul of the requirement that the practice\n\nclaiming constitutional protection must be on strictly religious grounds. Of\n\nsignificant importance, is that such a claim is deeply rooted in a stereotypical\n\n(and constitutionally flawed) notion that women are the ‘weaker’ sex and may\n\nnot undertake tasks that are ‘too arduous’ for them. This paternalistic approach\n\nis contrary to the constitutional guarantee of equality and dignity to women.\n\nInterpreting the Constitution in accordance with the values that infuse it requires\n\nthat the dignity of women, which is an emanation of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_826\">Article 15</a> and founded in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_827\">Article 21</a>, cannot be disassociated from the exercise of religious freedom.\n\nHolding that stereotypical understandings of sex hold no legitimate claim under\n\nour Constitution, one of us (Chandrachud J) in <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_828\">Navtej Singh v Union of India,57</a>\n\nheld:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">                     “A discriminatory act will be tested against constitutional\n                     values.

In the ethos of the Constitution, it is inconceivable that age could\n\nfound a rational basis to condition the right to worship. The ages of ten to fifty\n\nhave been marked out for exclusion on the ground that women in that age group\n\nare likely to be in the procreative age. Does the Constitution permit this as basis\n\nto exclude women from worship? Does the fact that a woman has a\n\nphysiological feature – of being in a menstruating age – entitle anybody or a\n\ngroup to subject her to exclusion from religious worship? The physiological\n\nfeatures of a woman have no significance to her equal entitlements under the\n\nConstitution. All women in the age group of ten and fifty may not in any case\n\nfall in the ‘procreative age group’. But that to my mind is again not a matter of\n\nsubstance. The heart of the matter lies in the ability of the Constitution to assert\n\nthat the exclusion of women from worship is incompatible with dignity,\n\ndestructive of liberty and a denial of the equality of all human beings. These\n\nconstitutional values stand above everything else as a principle which brooks\n\nno exceptions, even when confronted with a claim of religious belief. To exclude\n\nwomen is derogatory to an equal citizenship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_337\">\n\n\n55    The Respondents submitted that the deity at Sabarimala is in the form of\n\na Naishtika Brahmacharya: Lord Ayyappa is celibate. It was submitted that since\n\ncelibacy is the foremost requirement for all the followers, women between the\n\nages of ten and fifty must not be allowed in Sabarimala. There is an assumption\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_429\">                                        75</span>\n\f                                                                               PART G\n\n\nhere, which cannot stand constitutional scrutiny. The assumption in such a claim\n\nis that a deviation from the celibacy and austerity observed by the followers\n\nwould be caused by the presence of women. Such a claim cannot be sustained\n\nas a constitutionally sustainable argument. Its effect is to impose the burden of\n\na man’s celibacy on a woman and construct her as a cause for deviation from\n\ncelibacy. This is then employed to deny access to spaces to which women are\n\nequally entitled. To suggest that women cannot keep the Vratham is to\n\nstigmatize them and stereotype them as being weak and lesser human beings.\n\nA constitutional court such as this one, must refuse to recognize such claims.\n\n\n\n\n56    Human dignity postulates an equality between persons. The equality of\n\nall human beings entails being free from the restrictive and dehumanizing effect\n\nof stereotypes and being equally entitled to the protection of law. Our\n\nConstitution has willed that dignity, liberty and equality serve as a guiding light\n\nfor individuals, the state and this Court. Though our Constitution protects\n\nreligious freedom and consequent rights and practices essential to religion, this\n\nCourt will be guided by the pursuit to uphold the values of the Constitution,\n\nbased in dignity, liberty and equality. In a constitutional order of priorities, these\n\nare values on which the edifice of the Constitution stands. They infuse our\n\nconstitutional order with a vision for the future – of a just, equal and dignified\n\nsociety. Intrinsic to these values is the anti-exclusion principle. Exclusion is\n\ndestructive of dignity. To exclude a woman from the might of worship is\n\nfundamentally at odds with constitutional values.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_430\">                                         76</span>\n\f                                                                           PART H\n\n\n57    It was briefly argued that women between the ages of ten and fifty are not\n\nallowed to undertake the pilgrimage or enter Sabarimala on the ground of the\n\n‘impurity’ associated with menstruation. The stigma around menstruation has\n\nbeen built up around traditional beliefs in the impurity of menstruating women.\n\nThey have no place in a constitutional order. These beliefs have been used to\n\nshackle women, to deny them equal entitlements and subject them to the\n\ndictates of a patriarchal order. The menstrual status of a woman cannot be a\n\nvalid constitutional basis to deny her the dignity of being and the autonomy of\n\npersonhood. The menstrual status of a woman is deeply personal and an\n\nintrinsic part of her privacy. The Constitution must treat it as a feature on the\n\nbasis of which no exclusion can be practised and no denial can be perpetrated.\n\nNo body or group can use it as a barrier in a woman’s quest for fulfilment,\n\nincluding in her finding solace in the connect with the creator.\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">H     Religious Denominations\n\n\n58    One of the major planks of the response to the petition is that Sabarimala\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_338\">is a denominational temple and is entitled to the rights granted to ‘religious\n\ndenominations’ by <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_832\">Article 26</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n59    The rights conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_833\">Article 26</a> are not unqualified.

We are\n            therefore concerned with the Gowda Saraswath Brahmins\n            not as a section of a community but as a sect associated\n            with the foundation and maintenance of the Sri\n            Venkataramana Temple, in other words, not as a mere\n            denomination, but as a religious denomination. From the\n            evidence of PW 1, it appears that the Gowda Saraswath\n            Brahmins have three Gurus, that those in Moolky Petah are\n            followers of the head of the Kashi Mutt, and that it is he that\n            performs some of the important ceremonies in the temple.\n            Exhibit A is a document of the year 1826-27.

While it is stated in the impugned\n\nnotification that women between the age of ten and fifty five are forbidden from\n\nentering the temple as a matter of custom followed since time immemorial, the\n\nstand taken by the Respondent before the Kerala High Court differs to a great\n\nextent. The Board had submitted before the High Court:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_334\">            “7. In olden days worshippers visit the temple only after\n            observing penance for 41 days.

The religious practices and customs\n            followed earlier had changed during the last 40 years\n            particularly from 1950, the year in which the renovation of the\n            temple took place after the “fire disaster”. Even while the old\n            customs prevailed, women used to visit the temple though\n            very rarely. The Maharaja of Travancore accompanied by\n            the Maharani and the Divan had visited the temple in 1115\n            M.E. There was thus no prohibition for women to enter the\n            Sabarimala temple in olden days, but women in large\n            number were not visiting the temple. That was not because\n            of any prohibition imposed by Hindu religion but because\n            of other non-religious factors. In recent years, many\n            worshippers had gone to the temple with lady worshippers\n            within the age group 10 to 50 for the first rice-feeding\n            ceremony of their children (Chottoonu). The Board used to\n            issue receipts on such occasions on payment of the\n            prescribed charges. A change in the old custom and\n            practice was brought about by installing a flag staff\n            (Dhwajam) in 1969. Another change was brought about by\n            the introduction of Padipooja. These were done on the\n            advice of the Thanthri. Changes were also effected in other\n            practices.

But women visited\n\nthe temple in fewer numbers for ‘non-religious’ reasons.

The basis\n\nof the claim that there exists a religious denomination of Ayyapans is that the\n\npresiding deity is celibate and a strict regime of forty one days is prescribed for\n\nworship. Women between the age groups of ten and fifty would not for\n\nphysiological reasons (it is asserted) be able to perform the penance associated\n\nwith worship and hence their exclusion is intrinsic to a common faith. As\n\nindicated earlier, the exclusion of women between the ages of ten and fifty has\n\nnot been shown to be a uniform practice or tenet. The material before the Kerala\n\nHigh Court in Mahendran in fact indicates that there was no such uniform tenet,\n\ndown the ages. Therefore, the claim that the exclusion of women is part of a\n\ncommon set of religious beliefs held by those who worship the deity is not\n\nestablished. Above all, what is crucial to a religious denomination is a religious\n\nsect or body. A common faith and spiritual organisation must be the chord which\n\nunites the adherents together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_355\">\n\n68    Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar in his concurring judgement in Saifuddin,\n\nemphasised the necessity of an identity of doctrines, creeds and tenets in a\n\n‘religious denomination’:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_337\">             “52…The identity of a religious denomination consists in the\n             identity of its doctrines, creeds and tenets and these are\n             intended to ensure the unity of the faith which its adherents\n             profess and the identity of the religious views are the bonds of\n             the union which binds them together as one community.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_445\">                                             88</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART H\n\n\nThe judgement cited the ruling of Lord Halsbury in Free Church of Scotland\n\nv Overtoun70 :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_338\">                   “In the absence of conformity to essentials, the denomination\n                   would not be an entity cemented into solidity by harmonious\n                   uniformity of opinion, it would be a mere incongruous heap of,\n                   as it were, grains of sand, thrown together without being united,\n                   each of these intellectual and isolated grains differing from\n                   every other, and the whole forming a but nominally united while\n                   really unconnected mass; fraught with nothing but internal\n                   dissimilitude, and mutual and reciprocal contradiction and\n                   dissension.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_356\">69         Adherence to a ‘common faith’ would entail that a common set of beliefs\n\nhave been followed since the conception of the particular sect or denomination.\n\nA distinctive feature of the pilgrimage is that pilgrims of all religions participate\n\nin the pilgrimage on an equal footing.

However, in the Draft Constitution\n\n(dated October 1947) prepared by the constitutional advisor, B N Rau, the third\n\namendment moved by Kunhiraman was adopted in effect and after the word\n\n“offence” the words “which shall be punishable in accordance with law” were\n\ninserted.82 On 30-31 October 1947, the Drafting Committee considered the\n\n“untouchability” provision and redrafted it as <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_861\">article 11.</a> It was proposed 83 by Dr\n\nAmbedkar before the Constituent Assembly as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_350\">81 Constituent Assembly Debates (29 April 1947)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_454\">82</span>\n   B Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: A Study, Indian Institution of Public Administration (1968), at\n   page 204\n83 B Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: A Study, Indian Institution of Public Administration (1968), at\n\n   page 205\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_455\">                                                        96</span>\n\f                                                                                                            PART I\n\n\n                  ““Untouchability” is abolished and its practice in any form is\n                  forbidden.

Naziruddin Ahmad supported his contention by\n\nobserving that draft <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_863\">Article 11</a> prepared by the Drafting Committee was vague,\n\nas it provides no legal meaning of the term “untouchability”. Stressing that the\n\nterm was “rather loose”, Ahmad wanted the draft Article to be given “a better\n\nshape”. Professor KT Shah had a similar concern. He observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_352\">                  “… I would like to point out that the term ‘untouchability’ is\n                  nowhere defined.

You follow up the general\n                  proposition about abolishing untouchability, by saying that it\n                  will be in any form an offence and will be punished at law.

A reconstruction of the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly\n\nsuggests that the members agreed to the Constitutional Advisor’s insistence\n\nthat the law which is to be enacted for implementing the provision on\n\n“untouchability” would provide a definition of the term. The rejection of\n\nNaziruddin Ahmad’s amendment by the members of the Constituent Assembly\n\nreflects a conscious effort not to limit the scope of the legislation to be enacted.\n\n\n\n\n73         In order to fully understand the constitutional philosophy underlying the\n\ninsertion of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_866\">Article 17</a>, this Court must also deal with one specific instance during\n\nthe proceedings of the Constituent Assembly. As mentioned above, while\n\nProfessor KT Shah gave specific examples of acts of “untouchability”, including\n\nthat of women being considered untouchables “in certain periods”, and argued\n\nfor a specific definition, Dr Ambedkar furnished no reply. This raises the\n\nquestion as to why Dr Ambedkar did not accept Naziruddin Ahmad’s\n\namendment and refused to reply to KT Shah’s remarks.

Besides the struggle for independence from the\n\nBritish rule, there was another struggle going on since centuries and which still\n\ncontinues. That struggle has been for social emancipation. It has been the\n\nstruggle for the replacement of an unequal social order. It has been a fight for\n\nundoing historical injustices and for righting fundamental wrongs with\n\nfundamental rights. The Constitution of India is the end product of both these\n\nstruggles. It is the foundational document, which in text and spirit, aims at social\n\ntransformation namely, the creation and preservation of an equal social order.\n\nThe Constitution represents the aspirations of those, who were denied the basic\n\ningredients of a dignified existence. It contains a vision of social justice and lays\n\ndown a roadmap for successive governments to achieve that vision. The\n\ndocument sets out a moral trajectory, which citizens must pursue for the\n\nrealization of the values of liberty, equality, fraternity and justice. It is an\n\nassurance to the marginalized to be able to rise to the challenges of human\n\nexistence. The Constituent Assembly was enriched by the shared wisdom and\n\nexperiences gathered by its members from the ongoing social struggle for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_459\">                                        100</span>\n\f                                                                              PART I\n\n\nequality and justice. In particular, as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee,\n\nDr Ambedkar brought with himself ideas, values and scholarship, which were\n\nderived from the experiences and struggles which singularly were his own. He\n\ndrew as well from other social reformers in their movements against social\n\ninjustice. Some of these experiences and literature ought to be discussed in\n\norder to understand the vision behind the philosophy of the Constitution and,\n\nparticularly, <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_867\">Article 17.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_368\">\n\n\nHaving himself faced discrimination and stigmatization, Dr Ambedkar had\n\nlaunched an active movement against “untouchability”. In 1924, he founded the\n\nBahishkrut Hitkarani Sabha, aimed at advancing the rights of those who were\n\nneglected by society. Over the following years, Dr Ambedkar organised\n\nmarches demanding rights for untouchables to drinking water from public\n\nresources, and their right to enter temples. These movements were part of the\n\nlarger demand of equality for the untouchables.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_369\">\n\n\nIn his profound work, “Annihilation of Caste”, while advocating the destruction\n\nof the caste system, Dr Ambedkar recorded some of the “untouchability”\n\npractices by which the Untouchables were subjected to inhuman treatment:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_354\">              “Under the rule of the Peshwas in the Maratha country, the\n              Untouchable was not allowed to use the public streets if a\n              Hindu was coming along, lest he should pollute the Hindu by\n              his shadow. The Untouchable was required to have a black\n              thread either on his wrist or around his neck, as a sign or a\n              mark to prevent the Hindus from getting themselves polluted\n              by his touch by mistake. In Poona, the capital of the Peshwa,\n              the Untouchable was required to carry, strung from his waist,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_460\">                                            101</span>\n\f                                                                                               PART I\n\n\n                a broom to sweep away from behind himself the dust he trod\n                on, lest a Hindu walking on the same dust should be polluted.\n                In Poona, the Untouchable was required to carry an earthen\n                pot hung around his neck wherever he went—for holding his\n                spit, lest his spit falling on the earth should pollute a Hindu who\n                might unknowingly happen to tread on it.”88\n\n\n\nHis autobiographical notes published after his death with the title “Waiting for a\n\nVisa”89, contain reminiscences drawn by Dr Ambedkar on his own experiences\n\nwith “untouchability”. Dr Ambedkar mentions several experiences from his\n\nchildhood. No barber would consent to shave an untouchable. During his days\n\nas an Officer in Baroda State, he was denied a place to stay in quarters. In\n\nanother note, which was handwritten by Dr Ambedkar and was later published\n\nwith the title “Frustration”, he wrote:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_355\">                “The Untouchables are the weariest, most loathed and the\n                most miserable people that history can witness. They are a\n                spent and sacrificed people… To put it in simple language the\n                Untouchables have been completely overtaken by a sense of\n                utter frustration. As Mathew Arnold says “life consists in the\n                effort to affirm one’s own essence; meaning by this, to develop\n                one’s own existence fully and freely... Failure to affirm ones\n                own essence is simply another name for frustration… ” Many\n                people suffer such frustrations in their history. But they soon\n                recover from the blight and rise to glory again with new\n                vibrations. The case of the Untouchables stands on a different\n                footing. Their frustration is frustration for ever. It is unrelieved\n                by space or time. In this respect the story of the Untouchables\n                stands in strange contrast with that of the Jews.”90\n\n\n\n\n88  Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, (Vasant Moon ed.)

In his words:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_356\">                 “.. untouchability is obligatory. A person is permitted to hold\n                 another as his slave. There is no compulsion on him if he does\n                 not want to. But an Untouchable has no option. Once he is born\n                 an Untouchable, he is subject to all the disabilities of an\n                 Untouchable… [U]ntouchability is an indirect and therefore the\n                 worst form of slavery… It is enslavement without making the\n                 Untouchables conscious of their enslavement.”92\n\n\n\nDr Ambedkar’s thoughts and ideas bear an impact of other social reformers who\n\npreceded him, in particular Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule. In 1873, in the\n\npreface to his book titled “Gulamgiri” (Slavery), Jyotirao Phule made a stinging\n\ncritique on the cause of “untouchability”:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_357\">                 “[The] Sudras and Atisudras were regarded with supreme\n                 hatred and contempt, and the commonest rights of humanity\n                 were denied [to] them. Their touch, nay, even their shadow, is\n                 deemed a pollution.

Locating the basis of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_877\">Article 17</a> in the protection of dignity and preventing\n\nstigmatization and social exclusion, would perhaps be the apt answer to\n\nProfessor KT Shah’s unanswered queries. The Constitution has designedly left\n\nuntouchability undefined. Any form of stigmatization which leads to social\n\nexclusion is violative of human dignity and would constitute a form of\n\n“untouchability”. The Drafting Committee did not restrict the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_878\">Article 17.</a>\n\nThe prohibition of “untouchability”, as part of the process of protecting dignity\n\nand preventing stigmatization and exclusion, is the broader notion, which this\n\nCourt seeks to adopt, as underlying the framework of these articles.\n\n\n\n\n76          The practice of “untouchability”, as pointed out by the members of the\n\nConstituent Assembly, is a symptom of the caste system. The root cause of\n\n“untouchability” is the caste system.95 The caste system represents a\n\n\n95   In his paper on “Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development” (1916) presented at the Columbia\n     University, Dr Ambedkar wrote: “The caste problem is a vast one, both theoretically and practically. Practically,\n     it is an institution that portends tremendous consequences. It is a local problem, but one capable of much wider\n     mischief, for as long as caste in India does exist, Hindus will hardly intermarry or have any social intercourse with\n     outsiders; and if Hindus migrate to other regions on earth, Indian caste would become a world problem”. See Dr.\n     Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, (Vasant Moon ed.) Government of Maharashtra, Vol. 1 (2014),\n     at pages 5-6\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_464\">                                                            105</span>\n\f                                                                                                   PART I\n\n\nhierarchical order of purity and pollution enforced by social compulsion. Purity\n\nand pollution constitute the core of caste. While the top of the caste pyramid is\n\nconsidered pure and enjoys entitlements, the bottom is considered polluted and\n\nhas no entitlements. Ideas of “purity and pollution” are used to justify this\n\ndistinction which is self-perpetuality. The upper castes perform rituals that, they\n\nbelieve, assert and maintain their purity over lower castes. Rules of purity and\n\npollution are used to reinforce caste hierarchies.96 The notion of “purity and\n\npollution” influences who people associate with, and how they treat and are\n\ntreated by other people. Dr Ambedkar’s rejection of privileges associated with\n\ncaste, in “Annihilation of Caste”97, is hence a battle for human dignity. Dr\n\nAmbedkar perceived the caste system to be violative of individual dignity. 98 In\n\nhis last address to the Constituent Assembly, he stated that the caste system is\n\ncontrary to the country’s unity and integrity, and described it as bringing\n\n“separation in social life”.99 Individual dignity cannot be based on the notions of\n\npurity and pollution. “Untouchability” against lower castes was based on these\n\nnotions, and violated their dignity. It is for this reason that <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_879\">Article 17</a> abolishes\n\n“untouchability”, which arises out of caste hierarchies. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_880\">Article 17</a> strikes at the\n\nfoundation of the notions about “purity and pollution”.\n\n\n\n\n96 Diane Coffey and Dean Spears, Where India Goes: Abandoned Toilets, Stunted Development and the Costs of\n   Caste, Harper Collins (2017), at pages 74-79\n97 See Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, (Vasant Moon ed.)

Notions of “purity and pollution” have been its sustaining force.\n\nIn abolishing “untouchability”, the Constitution attempts a dynamic shift in the\n\nsocial orderings upon which prejudice and discrimination were institutionalized.\n\nThe first feature is a moral re-affirmation of human dignity and of a society\n\ngoverned by equal entitlements. The second important feature of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_885\">Article 17</a> is\n\nthat the practice of “untouchability” is forbidden. The practice is an emanation\n\nof the institution which sustains it. The abolition of the practice as a\n\nmanifestation is a consequence of the abolition of the institution of\n\n“untouchability”.    The third significant feature is that the practice of\n\nuntouchability” is forbidden “in any form”. The “in any form” prescription has a\n\nprofound significance in indicating the nature and width of the prohibition. Every\n\nmanifestation of untouchability without exception lies within the fold of the\n\nprohibition. The fourth feature of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_886\">Article 17</a> is that the enforcement of disabilities\n\nfounded upon “untouchability” shall constitute an offence punishable in\n\naccordance with law. The long arms of the criminal law will lend teeth to the\n\nenforcement of the prohibition.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_373\">\n\n\n79    The Constitution has carefully eschewed a definition of “untouchability”.\n\nThe draftspersons realized that even a broadly couched definition may be\n\nrestrictive. A definition would become restrictive if the words used or the\n\ninstances depicted are not adequate to cover the manifold complexities of our\n\nsocial life through which prejudice and discrimination is manifest. Hence, even\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_470\">                                        109</span>\n\f                                                                              PART I\n\n\nthough the attention of the framers was drawn to the fact that “untouchability” is\n\nnot a practice referable only to the lowest in the caste ordering but also was\n\npracticed against women (and in the absence of a definition, the prohibition\n\nwould cover all its forms), the expression was designedly left undefined. The\n\nConstitution uses the expression “untouchability” in inverted comas. The use of\n\na punctuation mark cannot be construed as intent to circumscribe the\n\nconstitutional width of the expression. The historical backdrop to the inclusion\n\nof the provision was provided by centuries of subjugation, discrimination and\n\nsocial exclusion. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_887\">Article 17</a> is an intrinsic part of the social transformation which\n\nthe Constitution seeks to achieve. Hence in construing it, the language of the\n\nConstitution should not be ascribed a curtailed meaning which will obliterate its\n\ntrue purpose. “Untouchability” in any form is forbidden. The operation of the\n\nwords used by the Constitution cannot be confined to a particular form or\n\nmanifestation of “untouchability”. The Constitution as a constantly evolving\n\ninstrument has to be flexible to reach out to injustice based on untouchability, in\n\nany of its forms or manifestations. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_888\">Article 17</a> is a powerful guarantee against\n\nexclusion. As an expression of the anti-exclusion principle, it cannot be read to\n\nexclude women against whom social exclusion of the worst kind has been\n\npracticed and legitimized on notions of purity and pollution.\n\n\n\n80         The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_889\">Article 17</a> have been adverted to in judicial decisions.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"337685\" id=\"span_471\">In <a href=\"/doc/337685/\" id=\"a_890\">Devarajiah v B Padmanna106</a>, a learned single judge of the Mysore High\n\n\n106   AIR 1958 Mys 84\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_472\">                                          110</span>\n\f                                                                                         PART I\n\n\nCourt observed that the absence of a definition of the expression “untouchability\n\nin the Constitution and the use of inverted commas indicated that “the subject-\n\nmatter of that Article is not untouchability in its literal or grammatical sense but\n\nthe practice as it had developed historically in this country”.

The values of constitutional morality\n\nare a non-derogable entitlement. Notions of “purity and pollution”, which\n\nstigmatize individuals, can have no place in a constitutional regime. Regarding\n\nmenstruation as polluting or impure, and worse still, imposing exclusionary\n\ndisabilities on the basis of menstrual status, is against the dignity of women\n\nwhich is guaranteed by the Constitution. Practices which legitimise menstrual\n\ntaboos, due to notions of “purity and pollution”, limit the ability of menstruating\n\nwomen to attain the freedom of movement, the right to education and the right\n\nof entry to places of worship and, eventually, their access to the public sphere.\n\nWomen have a right to control their own bodies. The menstrual status of a\n\nwoman is an attribute of her privacy and person. Women have a constitutional\n\nentitlement that their biological processes must be free from social and religious\n\npractices, which enforce segregation and exclusion. These practices result in\n\nhumiliation and a violation of dignity. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_917\">Article 17</a> prohibits the practice of\n\n\n\n\nwhich a widow is not allowed to remarry, and pre-pubertal marriage of girls.

Prejudice against women based on notions of impurity and pollution\n\nassociated with menstruation is a symbol of exclusion. The social exclusion of\n\nwomen, based on menstrual status, is but a form of untouchability which is an\n\nanathema to constitutional values. As an expression of the anti-exclusion\n\nprinciple, <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_919\">Article 17</a> cannot be read to exclude women against whom social\n\nexclusion of the worst kind has been practiced and legitimized on notions of\n\npurity and pollution. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_920\">Article 17</a> cannot be read in a restricted manner.

There is a degree of overlap\n\nin the Articles of the Constitution which recognize fundamental human freedoms\n\nand they must be construed in the widest sense possible. To say then that the\n\ninclusion of an Article in the Constitution restricts the wide ambit of the rights\n\nguaranteed, cannot be sustained. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_1038\">Article 17</a> was introduced by the framers to\n\nincorporate a specific provision in regard to untouchability. The introduction of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_1039\">Article 17</a> reflects the transformative role and vision of the Constitution. It brings\n\nfocus upon centuries of discrimination in the social structure and posits the role\n\nof the Constitution to bring justice to the oppressed and marginalized. The\n\npenumbra of a particular article in Part III which deals with a specific facet of\n\nfreedom may exist elsewhere in Part III. That is because all freedoms share an\n\ninseparable connect. They exist together and it is in their co-existence that the\n\nvision of dignity, liberty and equality is realized. As noted in Puttaswamy, “the\n\nConstituent Assembly thought it fit that some aspects of liberty require a more\n\nemphatic declaration so as to restrict the authority of the State to abridge or\n\ncurtail them”.

The court recognized that religious practices are\n\nas much a part of religion. Hence, where the tenets of a religious sect prescribe\n\nceremonies at particular hours of the day or regular offerings of food to the deity,\n\nthis would constitute a part of religion. The mere fact that these practices involve\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_540\">                                        149</span>\n\f                                                                            PART M\n\n\nthe expenditure of money would not take away their religious character. The\n\nprecept that religion encompasses doctrine and ceremony enabled the court to\n\nallow religion a broad autonomy in deciding what according to its tenets is\n\nintegral or essential. Shirur Mutt was followed by another decision in Ratilal.\n\nBoth cases were decided in the same year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_416\">\n\n\n108   As the jurisprudence of the court evolved, two separate issues came to\n\nthe fore. The first was the divide between what is religious and secular. This\n\ndivide is reflected in <a href=\"/doc/1753683/\" id=\"a_1088\">Article 25(2)(a)</a> which allows the state to enact legislation\n\nwhich would regulate or restrict economic, financial, political or “other secular\n\nactivities” which may be associated with religious practice. A second distinct\n\nissue, however, was addressed by this Court. That was whether a practice is\n\nessential to religion. While the religious versus secular divide finds support in\n\nconstitutional text, neither <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1089\">Article 25</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1090\">Article 26</a> speaks about practices which\n\nare essential to religion. As the jurisprudence of this Court unfolded, the court\n\nassumed the function of determining whether or not a practice constitutes an\n\nessential and integral part of religion. This set the determination up at the\n\nthreshold. Something which the court holds not to be essential to religion would\n\nnot be protected by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1091\">Article 25</a>, or as the case may be, <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1092\">Article 26.</a> Matters of\n\nreligion under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_1093\">Article 26(b)</a> came to be conflated with what is an essential part\n\nof religion. In Qureshi (1959), a Constitution Bench (of which Justice\n\nGajendragadkar was a part) emphasised the non-obligatory nature of the\n\npractice and held that the sacrificing of cows at Bakr-Id was not an essential\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_541\">                                        150</span>\n\f                                                                             PART M\n\n\npractice for the Muslim community.        Durgah Committee (1962), Tilkayat\n\n(1964) and Sastri Yagnapurushadji (1966), Justice Gajendragadkar reserved\n\nto the court the authority to determine whether a practice was religious and, if it\n\nis, whether the practice can be regarded as essential or integral to religion. In\n\nDurgah Committee, Justice Gajendragadkar sought to justify the exercise of\n\nthat adjudicatory function by stating that otherwise, practices which may have\n\noriginated in “merely superstitious beliefs” and would, therefore, be “extraneous\n\nand unessential accretions” to religion would be treated as essential parts of\n\nreligion.   In   Sastri   Yagnapurushadji,      Chief   Justice   Gajendragadkar\n\npropounded a view of Hinduism which in doctrinal terms segregates it from\n\npractices which could be isolated from a rational view of religion. The result\n\nwhich followed was that while at a formal level, the court continued to adopt a\n\nview which placed credence on the role of the community in deciding what\n\nconstitutes a part of its religion, there is a super imposed adjudicatory role of\n\nthe court which would determine as to whether something is essential or\n\ninessential to religion. In the case of the Avadhuta II, the assumption of this role\n\nby the Court came to the forefront in allowing it to reject a practice as not being\n\nessential, though it had been prescribed in a religious text by the founder of the\n\nsect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_417\">\n\nBy reserving to itself the authority to determine practices which are essential or\n\ninessential to religion, the Court assumed a reformatory role which would allow\n\nit to cleanse religion of practices which were derogatory to individual dignity.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_542\">                                        151</span>\n\f                                                                            PART M\n\n\nExclusions from temple entry could be regarded as matters which were not\n\nintegral to religion. While doing so, the Court would set up a progressive view\n\nof religion. This approach is problematic. The rationale for allowing a religious\n\ncommunity to define what constitutes an essential aspect of its religion is to\n\nprotect the autonomy of religions and religious denominations. Protecting that\n\nautonomy enhances the liberal values of the Constitution. By entering upon\n\ndoctrinal issues of what does or does not constitute an essential part of religion,\n\nthe Court has, as a necessary consequence, been required to adopt a religious\n\nmantle. The Court would determine as to whether a practice is or is not an\n\nessential part of religion. This has enabled the Court to adopt a reformist vision\n\nof religion even though it may conflict with the views held by the religion and by\n\nthose who practice and profess the faith. The competence of the Court to do\n\nso and the legitimacy of the assumption of that role may be questionable. The\n\nCourt discharges a constitutional (as distinct from an ecclesiastical) role in\n\nadjudication. Adjudicating on what does or does not form an essential part of\n\nreligion blurs the distinction between the religious-secular divide and the\n\nessential/inessential approach. The former has a textual origin in <a href=\"/doc/1753683/\" id=\"a_1094\">Article\n\n25(2)(a).</a> The latter is a judicial creation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_418\">\n\n\n109   The assumption by the court of the authority to determine whether a\n\npractice is or is not essential to religion has led to our jurisprudence bypassing\n\nwhat should in fact be the central issue for debate. That issue is whether the\n\nConstitution ascribes to religion and to religious denominations the authority to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_543\">                                         152</span>\n\f                                                                              PART M\n\n\nenforce practices which exclude a group of citizens. The exclusion may relate\n\nto prayer and worship, but may extend to matters which bear upon the liberty\n\nand dignity of the individual. The Constitution does recognise group rights when\n\nit confers rights on religious denominations in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1095\">Article 26.</a> Yet the basic question\n\nwhich needs to be answered is whether the recognition of rights inhering in\n\nreligious denominations can impact upon the fundamental values of dignity,\n\nliberty and equality which animate the soul of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\nIn analysing this issue, it is well to remind ourselves that the right to freedom of\n\nreligion which is comprehended in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1096\">Articles 25</a><a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1097\">, 26</a><a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_1098\">, 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_1099\">28</a> is not a stand alone\n\nright. These Articles of the Constitution are an integral element of the entire\n\nchapter on fundamental rights.          Constitutional articles which recognise\n\nfundamental rights have to be understood as a seamless web. Together, they\n\nbuild the edifice of constitutional liberty. Fundamental human freedoms in Part\n\nIII are not disjunctive or isolated. They exist together. It is only in cohesion that\n\nthey bring a realistic sense to the life of the individual as the focus of human\n\nfreedoms. The right of a denomination must then be balanced with the individual\n\nrights to which each of its members has a protected entitlement in Part III.\n\n\n\n\n110   Several articles in the chapter on fundamental rights are addressed\n\nspecifically to the state. But significantly, others have a horizontal application\n\nto state as well non-state entities. <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_1100\">Article 15(2)</a> embodies a guarantee against\n\ndiscrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or birth place in access to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_544\">                                        153</span>\n\f                                                                            PART M\n\n\nlisted public places. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_1101\">Article 17</a> which abolishes untouchability has a horizontal\n\napplication which is available against the state as well as non-state entities.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_1102\">Article 23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_1103\">Article 24</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_1104\">Article 25(1)</a> are illustrations of horizontal rights\n\nintended to secure the dignity of the individual. All these guarantees rest in\n\nequilibrium with other fundamental freedoms that the Constitution recognizes:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_440\">equality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1105\">Article 14</a>, freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1106\">Article 19</a> and life and personal liberty\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1107\">Article 21.</a> The individual right to the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1108\">Article 25</a>\n\nmust rest in mutual co-existence with other freedoms which guarantee above\n\nall, the dignity and autonomy of the individual. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1109\">Article 26</a> guarantees a group\n\nright – the right of a religious denomination. The co-existence of a group right in\n\na chapter on fundamental rights which places the individual at the forefront of\n\nits focus cannot be a matter without significance. Would the Constitution have\n\nintended to preserve the assertion of group rights even at the cost of denigrating\n\nindividual freedoms? Should the freedom conferred upon a group - the religious\n\ndenomination under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_1110\">Article 26(b)</a> – have such a broad canvas as would allow\n\nthe denomination to practice exclusion that would be destructive of individual\n\nfreedom? The answer to this, in my view, would have to be in the negative for\n\nthe simple reason that it would be impossible to conceive of the preservation of\n\nliberal constitutional values while at the same time allowing group rights to defy\n\nthose values by practicing exclusion and through customs which are derogatory\n\nto dignity. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by postulating that\n\nnotwithstanding the recognition of group rights in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1111\">Article 26</a>, the Constitution has\n\nnever intended that the assertion of these rights destroy individual dignity and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_545\">                                       154</span>\n\f                                                                                                           PART M\n\n\nliberty. Group rights have been recognized by the Constitution in order to\n\nprovide a platform to individuals within those denominations to realize fulfilment\n\nand self-determination. Gautam Bhatia156 in a seminal article on the subject\n\nsuccinctly observes:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_441\">                  “While it is true that <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_1112\">Article 26(b)</a> makes groups the bearers of\n                  rights, as pointed out above, the Constitution does not state the\n                  basis of doing so. It does not clarify whether groups are granted\n                  rights for the instrumental reason that individuals can only\n                  achieve self-determination and fulfilment within the ‘context of\n                  choice’157 provided by communities, or whether the\n                  Constitution treats groups, along with individuals, as\n                  constitutive units worthy of equal concern and respect.158 The\n                  distinction is crucial, because the weight that must be accorded\n                  to group integrity, even at the cost of blocking individual access\n                  to important public goods, can only be determined by deciding\n                  which vision the Constitution subscribes to.”\n\n\n\nRelevant to the subject which this section explores, Bhatia’s thesis is that the\n\nessential religious practices doctrine, which lacks a sure constitutional\n\nfoundation, has led the court into a maze in the process of unraveling theological\n\nprinciples. While deciding what is or is not essential to religion, the court has\n\nventured into areas where it lacks both the competence and legitimacy to\n\npronounce on the importance of specific doctrines or beliefs internal to religion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_442\">In making that determination, the court essentially imposes an external point of\n\nview.

In doing so, the courts therefore could be said to\n                   risk drawing an arbitrary line between protected and non-\n                   protected religions, beliefs or practices.”161\n\n\n\n\n159 Faizan Mustafa and Jagteshwar Singh Sohi, Freedom of Religion in India: Current Issues and Supreme Court\n    Acting as Clergy, Brigham Young University Review (2017)\n160 Jaclyn L Neo, Definitional imbroglios: A critique of the definition of religion and essential practice tests in religious\n\n    freedom adjudication, International Journal of Constitutional Law, Vol. 16 (2018), at pages 574-595\n161 Ibid, at pages 575, 576\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_548\">                                                            156</span>\n\f                                                                                          PART M\n\n\nAssociated with this conceptual difficulty in applying the essential religious\n\npractices test is the issue of competence and legitimacy for the court to rule on\n\nreligious tenets:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_444\">                     “While it may be legitimate for religious courts to apply internal\n                     religious doctrines, civil courts are constitutionally established\n                     to adjudicate upon secular constitutional statutory and\n                     common law issues. In a religiously pluralistic society, judges\n                     cannot presume to have judicial competence to have\n                     theological expertise over all religions.”162\n\n\n\nShe suggests a two stage determination which is explained thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_445\">                     “Accordingly, there would be a two-stage test in adjudicating\n                     religious freedom claims that adopts a more deferential\n                     approach to definition, bearing in mind…a workable approach\n                     to religious freedom protection in plural societies. In the first\n                     stage, as mentioned, the courts should accept a group’s self-\n                     definition except in extreme cases where there is clearly a lack\n                     of sincerity, fraud or ulterior motive. At the second stage, the\n                     courts should apply a balancing, compelling reason inquiry, or\n                     proportionality analysis to determine whether the religious\n                     freedom claim is outweighed by competing state or public\n                     interest.”163\n\n\n\nA deferential approach to what constitutes a part of religious tenets would free\n\nthe court from the unenviable task of adjudicating upon religious texts and\n\ndoctrines. The deference, however, that is attributed to religion is subject to the\n\nfundamental principles which emerge from the quest for liberty, equality and\n\ndignity in Part III of the Constitution.

It represents\n\na break from a history marked by the indignation and discrimination attached to\n\ncertain identities and serves as a bridge to a vision of a just and equal\n\ncitizenship. In a deeply divided society marked by intermixing identities such as\n\nreligion, race, caste, sex and personal characteristics as the sites of\n\ndiscrimination and oppression, the Constitution marks a perception of a new\n\nsocial order. This social order places the dignity of every individual at the heart\n\nof its endeavours. As the basic unit of the Constitution, the individual is the focal\n\npoint through which the ideals of the Constitution are realized.\n\n\n\n\nThe framers had before them the task of ensuring a balance between individual\n\nrights and claims of a communitarian nature. The Constituent Assembly\n\nrecognised that the recognition of a truly just social order situated the individual\n\nas the ‘backbone of the state, the pivot, the cardinal center of all social activity,\n\nwhose happiness and satisfaction should be the goal of every social\n\nmechanism.’166 In forming the base and the summit of the social pyramid, the\n\ndignity of every individual illuminates the constitutional order and its aspirations\n\nfor a just social order. Existing structures of social discrimination must be\n\nevaluated through the prism of constitutional morality. The effect and endeavour\n\nis to produce a society marked by compassion for every individual.\n\n\n\n166Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant (Member, Constituent Assembly) in a speech to the Constituent Assembly on 24\n  January, 1947\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_552\">                                                   159</span>\n\f                                                                             PART N\n\n\n114   The Constitution protects the equal entitlement of all persons to a freedom\n\nof conscience and to freely profess, protect and propagate religion. Inhering in\n\nthe right to religious freedom, is the equal entitlement of all persons, without\n\nexception, to profess, practice and propagate religion. Equal participation of\n\nwomen in exercising their right to religious freedom is a recognition of this right.\n\nIn protecting religious freedom, the framers subjected the right to religious\n\nfreedom to the overriding constitutional postulates of equality, liberty and\n\npersonal freedom in Part III of the Constitution. The dignity of women cannot be\n\ndisassociated from the exercise of religious freedom. In the constitutional order\n\nof priorities, the right to religious freedom is to be exercised in a manner\n\nconsonant with the vision underlying the provisions of Part III. The equal\n\nparticipation of women in worship inheres in the constitutional vision of a just\n\nsocial order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_423\">\n\n\n115   The discourse of freedom in the Constitution cannot be denuded of its\n\ncontext by construing an Article in Part III detached from the part within which it\n\nis situated. Even the right of a religious denomination to manage its own affairs\n\nin matters of religion cannot be exercised in isolation from Part III of the\n\nConstitution. The primacy of the individual, is the thread that runs through the\n\nguarantee of rights. In being located in Part III of the Constitution, the exercise\n\nof denominational rights cannot override and render meaningless constitutional\n\nprotections which are informed by the overarching values of a liberal\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_424\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_553\">                                        160</span>\n\f                                                                             PART N\n\n\n116   The Constitution seeks to achieve a transformed society based on\n\nequality and justice to those who are victims of traditional belief systems\n\nfounded in graded inequality. It reflects a guarantee to protect the dignity of all\n\nindividuals who have faced systematic discrimination, prejudice and social\n\nexclusion. Construed in this context, the prohibition against untouchability\n\nmarks a powerful guarantee to remedy the stigmatization and exclusion of\n\nindividuals and groups based on hierarchies of the social structure. Notions of\n\npurity and pollution have been employed to perpetuate discrimination and\n\nprejudice against women. They have no place in a constitutional order. In\n\nacknowledging the inalienable dignity and worth of every individual, these\n\nnotions are prohibited by the guarantee against untouchability and by the\n\nfreedoms that underlie the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_425\">\n\n\nIn civic as in social life, women have been subjected to prejudice, stereotypes\n\nand social exclusion. In religious life, exclusionary traditional customs assert a\n\nclaim to legitimacy which owes its origin to patriarchal structures. These forms\n\nof discrimination are not mutually exclusive. The intersection of identities in\n\nsocial and religious life produces a unique form of discrimination that denies\n\nwomen an equal citizenship under the Constitution. Recognizing these forms of\n\nintersectional discrimination is the first step towards extending constitutional\n\nprotection against discrimination attached to intersecting identities.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_554\">                                        161</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART N\n\n\n117        In the dialogue between constitutional freedoms, rights are not isolated\n\nsilos. In infusing each other with substantive content, they provide a cohesion\n\nand unity which militates against practices that depart from the values that\n\nunderlie the Constitution – justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Substantive\n\nnotions of equality require the recognition of and remedies for historical\n\ndiscrimination which has pervaded certain identities. Such a notion focuses on\n\nnot only distributive questions, but on the structures of oppression and\n\ndomination which exclude these identities from participation in an equal life. An\n\nindispensable facet of an equal life, is the equal participation of women in all\n\nspheres of social activity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_426\">\n\n\nThe case at hand asks important questions of our conversation with the\n\nConstitution. In a dialogue about our public spaces, it raises the question of the\n\nboundaries of religion under the Constitution. The quest for equality is denuded\n\nof its content if practices that exclude women are treated to be acceptable. The\n\nConstitution cannot allow practices, irrespective of their source, which are\n\nderogatory to women. Religion cannot become a cover to exclude and to deny\n\nthe right of every woman to find fulfillment in worship. In his speech before the\n\nConstituent Assembly on 25 November 1949, Dr B R Ambedkar sought answers\n\nto these questions: ‘How long shall we continue to live this life of\n\ncontradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and\n\neconomic life?’167 Sixty eight years after the advent of the Constitution, we have\n\n\n167   Dr. B R Ambedkar in a speech to the Constituent Assembly on 25 November 1949\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_555\">                                                     162</span>\n\f                                                                           PART N\n\n\nheld that in providing equality in matters of faith and worship, the Constitution\n\ndoes not allow the exclusion of women.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_427\">\n\n\n118   Liberty in matters of belief, faith and worship, must produce a\n\ncompassionate and humane society marked by the equality of status of all its\n\ncitizens. The Indian Constitution sought to break the shackles of social\n\nhierarchies. In doing so, it sought to usher an era characterized by a\n\ncommitment to freedom, equality and justice. The liberal values of the\n\nConstitution secure to each individual an equal citizenship. This recognizes that\n\nthe Constitution exists not only to disenable entrenched structures of\n\ndiscrimination and prejudice, but to empower those who traditionally have been\n\ndeprived of an equal citizenship. The equal participation of women in every\n\nsphere of the life of the nation subserves that premise.\n\n\n\n\n119   I hold and declare that:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_428\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_448\">1) The devotees of Lord Ayyappa do not satisfy the judicially enunciated\n\n   requirements to constitute a religious denomination under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1115\">Article 26</a> of the\n\n   Constitution;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_556\">                                       163</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_429\">\f                                                                              PART N\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_430\">2) A claim for the exclusion of women from religious worship, even if it be\n\n   founded in religious text, is subordinate to the constitutional values of liberty,\n\n   dignity and equality.

As per a centuries old tradition of this temple,\n\n      and the ‘acharas’, beliefs and customs followed by this Temple,\n\n      women in the age group of 10 to 50 years are not permitted to enter\n\n      this Temple.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_476\">         This is attributable to the manifestation of the deity at the\n\n      Sabarimala Temple which is in the form of a ‘Naishtik Bramhachari’,\n\n      who practises strict penance, and the severest form of celibacy.\n\n         According to legend, it is believed that Lord Ayyappa, the\n\n      presiding deity of Sabarimala had his human sojourn at Pandalam\n\n      as the son of the King of Pandalam, known by the name of\n\n      Manikandan, who found him as a radiant faced infant on the banks\n\n      of the river Pampa, wearing a bead (‘mani’) around his neck.\n\n      Manikandan’s feats and achievements convinced the King and others\n\n      of his divine origin.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_477\">         The Lord told the King that he could construct a temple at\n\n      Sabarimala, north of the holy river Pampa, and install the deity\n\n      there.   The King duly constructed the temple at Sabarimala and\n\n      dedicated it to Lord Ayyappa.        The deity of Lord Ayyappa in\n\n      Sabarimala Temple was installed in the form of a ‘Naishtik\n\n      Brahmachari’ i.e. an eternal celibate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_478\">         Lord Ayyappa is believed to have explained the manner in which\n\n      the pilgrimage to the Sabarimala Temple is to be undertaken, after\n\n      observing a 41-day ‘Vratham’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_479\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_573\">                                      10</span>\n\f     It is believed that Lord Ayyappa himself undertook the 41-day\n\n‘Vratham’ before he went to Sabarimala Temple to merge with the\n\ndeity. The whole process of the pilgrimage undertaken by a pilgrim\n\nis to replicate the journey of Lord Ayyappa. The mode and manner of\n\nworship at this Temple as revealed by the Lord himself is chronicled\n\nin the ‘Sthal Purana’ i.e. the ‘Bhuthanatha Geetha’.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_480\">     The 41 day “Vratham” is a centuries old custom and practise\n\nundertaken by the pilgrims referred to as ‘Ayyappans’. The object of\n\nthis ‘Vratham’ is to discipline and train the devotees for the evolution\n\nof   spiritual   consciousness    leading   to   self-realization.   Before\n\nembarking on the pilgrimage to this shrine, a key essential of the\n\n‘Vratham’ is observance of a ‘Sathvic’ lifestyle and ‘Brahmacharya’ so\n\nas to keep the body and mind pure. A basic requirement of the\n\n‘Vratham’ is to withdraw from the materialistic world and step onto\n\nthe spiritual path.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_481\">     When a pilgrim undertakes the ‘Vratham’, the pilgrim separates\n\nhimself from the women-folk in the house, including his wife,\n\ndaughter, or other female members in the family.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_482\">     The “Vratham” or penance consists of:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_459\">       • Forsaking all physical relations with one’s spouse;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_460\">       • Giving up anything that is intoxicating, including alcohol,\n\n         cigarettes and ‘tamasic’ food;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_461\">       • Living separately from the rest of the family in an isolated\n\n         room or a separate building;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_574\">                                 11</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_462\">\f            • Refraining from interacting with young women in daily life,\n\n               including one’s daughter, sister, or other young women\n\n               relatives;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_463\">            • Cooking one’s own food;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_464\">            • Observing cleanliness, including bathing twice a day before\n\n               prayers;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_465\">            • Wearing a black mundu and upper garments;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_466\">            • Having only one meal a day;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_467\">            • Walking barefoot.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_468\">          On the 41st day, after puja, the pilgrim takes the irimudi\n\n       (consisting of rice and other provisions for one’s own travel,\n\n       alongwith a coconut filled with ghee and puja articles) and starts the\n\n       pilgrimage to climb the 18 steps to reach the ‘Sannidhanam’, for\n\n       darshan of the deity.

This emphasis on celibacy could be in order to gain\n           protection from other forest spirits, for as mentioned earlier,\n           Yaksas are said to protect “sages and celibates…\n           …Though there is no formal declaration, it is understood that\n           the Ayyappa (as he is now called) will follow the strictest\n           celibacy, abstain from intoxicants and meat, and participate\n           only in religious activities. He may continue to work at his\n           profession, but he may not indulge in social enterprises.\n           Ayyappas are also required to eat only once a day (at noon)\n           and to avoid garlic, onion and stale food. In the evening, they\n           may eat fruit or something very light. As far as the dress code\n           is concerned, a degree of flexibility is allowed during the vratam\n           period. The nature of one’s profession does not always permit\n           this drastic change in dress code. For example, Ayyappas in\n           the army or police force wear their regular uniforms and change\n           into black only when off duty. Black or blue vestis and\n           barefootedness are, however, insisted upon during the actual\n           pilgrimage…\n           …The rule of celibacy is taken very seriously and includes\n           celibacy in thought and action. Ayyappas are advised to look\n           upon all women older than them as mothers and those younger\n           as daughters or sisters. Menstrual taboos are now strictly\n           imposed….. Sexual cohabitation is also forbidden. During the\n           vratam, Ayyappas not only insist on these taboos being rigidly\n           followed but they go a step further and insist on physical\n           separation.

There\n\n       is no absolute restriction on women per se. Such practise is\n\n       consistent with the ‘Nishta’ or ‘Naishtik Buddhi’ of the deity. This\n\n       being the underlying reason behind the custom, there is no\n\n       derogation of the dignity of women.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n        We have heard the arguments of the Counsel representing various\n\n  parties, and perused the pleadings and written submissions filed by them.\n\n\n      6.1. The issues raised in the present Writ Petition have far-reaching\n\n           ramifications and implications, not only for the Sabarimala Temple in\n\n           Kerala, but for all places of worship of various religions in this\n\n           country, which have their own beliefs, practises, customs and\n\n           usages, which may be considered to be exclusionary in nature. In a\n\n           secular polity, issues which are matters of deep religious faith and\n\n           sentiment, must not ordinarily be interfered with by Courts.\n\n      6.2. In the past, the Courts, in the context of Hindu temples, have been\n\n           asked to identify the limits of State action under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1192\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1193\">26</a>\n\n           on the administration, control and management of the affairs of\n\n           temples, including the appointment of archakas. For instance, in the\n\n           case of <a href=\"/doc/143215272/\" id=\"a_1194\">Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal Nala Sangam &amp; Ors. v.

MAINTAINABILITY &amp; JUSTICIABILITY\n\n      7.1. <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1195\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution guarantees to all persons the freedom\n\n            of conscience, and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate\n\n            religion. This is however subject to public order, morality and health,\n\n            and to the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution.\n\n      7.2. The right to move the Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1196\">Article 32</a> for violation of\n\n            Fundamental Rights, must be based on a pleading that the\n\n            Petitioners’ personal rights to worship in this Temple have been\n\n            violated. The Petitioners do not claim to be devotees of the\n\n            Sabarimala Temple where Lord Ayyappa is believed to have\n\n            manifested himself as a ‘Naishtik Brahmachari’. To determine the\n\n            validity of long-standing religious customs and usages of a sect, at\n\n            the instance of an association/Intervenors who are “involved in social\n\n            developmental activities especially activities related to upliftment of\n\n            women and helping them become aware of their rights”17, would\n\n            require this Court to decide religious questions at the behest of\n\n            persons who do not subscribe to this faith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_517\">                The right to worship, claimed by the Petitioners has to be\n\n            predicated on the basis of affirmation of a belief in the particular\n\n            manifestation of the deity in this Temple.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_518\">\n\n\n 17   Paragraph 2 of the Writ Petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_519\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_597\">                                           23</span>\n\f     7.3. The absence of this bare minimum requirement must not be viewed\n\n         as a mere technicality, but an essential requirement to maintain a\n\n         challenge   for   impugning      practises    of   any   religious   sect,   or\n\n         denomination. Permitting PILs in religious matters would open the\n\n         floodgates to interlopers to question religious beliefs and practises,\n\n         even if the petitioner is not a believer of a particular religion, or a\n\n         worshipper of a particular shrine. The perils are even graver for\n\n         religious minorities if such petitions are entertained.\n\n            Dr. A.M. Singhvi, Senior Advocate appeared on behalf of the\n\n         Travancore Devaswom Board, and submitted an illustrative list of\n\n         various religious institutions where restrictions on the entry of both\n\n         men and women exist on the basis of religious beliefs and practises\n\n         being followed since time immemorial.18\n\n     7.4. In matters of religion and religious practises, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1197\">Article 14</a> can be\n\n         invoked only by persons who are similarly situated, that is, persons\n\n         belonging to the same faith, creed, or sect. The Petitioners do not\n\n         state that they are devotees of Lord Ayyappa, who are aggrieved by\n\n         the practises followed in the Sabarimala Temple. The right to equality\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1198\">Article 14</a> in matters of religion and religious beliefs has to be\n\n         viewed differently.

Equal treatment under\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1231\">Article 25</a> is conditioned by the essential beliefs and practises of any\n\n        religion. Equality in matters of religion must be viewed in the context\n\n        of the worshippers of the same faith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_534\">   8.2. The twin-test for determining the validity of a classification under\n\n        Article 14 is:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_487\">        • The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_488\">          and\n\n        • It must have a rational nexus with the object sought to be\n\n          achieved by the impugned law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_489\">            The difficulty lies in applying the tests under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1232\">Article 14</a> to\n\n        religious practises which are also protected as Fundamental Rights\n\n        under our Constitution. The right to equality claimed by the\n\n        Petitioners under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1233\">Article 14</a> conflicts with the rights of the\n\n        worshippers of this shrine which is also a Fundamental Right\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_608\">                                       28</span>\n\f    guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1234\">Articles 25</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1235\">26</a> of the Constitution.

The submissions made by the Counsel for the Petitioners is premised\n\n    on the view that this practise constitutes gender discrimination\n\n    against women.

The right to gender equality to offer worship to Lord Ayyappa is\n\n    protected by permitting women of all ages, to visit temples where he\n\n    has not manifested himself in the form of a ‘Naishtik Brahamachari’,\n\n    and there is no similar restriction in those temples. It is pertinent to\n\n    mention that the Respondents, in this context, have submitted that\n\n    there are over 1000 temples of Lord Ayyappa, where he has\n\n    manifested in other forms, and this restriction does not apply.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_609\">                                    29</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_494\">\f   8.6.

This view makes it possible\n      to reconcile religious freedom with ordered government. It\n      does not mean that the mere fact that the Commonwealth\n      Parliament passes a law in the belief that it will promote\n      peace, order and good government of Australia precludes\n      any consideration by a court of the question whether that\n      question by Parliament would remove all reality from the\n      constitutional guarantee. That guarantee is intended to\n      limit the sphere of action of the legislature. The\n      interpretation and application of the guarantee cannot,\n      under our Constitution, be left to Parliament. If the\n      guarantee is to have any real significance it must be left to\n      the courts of justice to determine its meaning and to give\n      effect to it by declaring the invalidity of laws which\n      infringes it and by declining to enforce them. The courts\n      will therefore have the responsibility of determining\n      whether a particular law can fairly be regarded, as a law\n      to protect the existence of the community, or whether, on\n      the other hand, it is a law for prohibiting the free exercise\n      of any religion…\n   What Latham, C.J. has said about the responsibility of the court\n   accords with what we have said about the function of the court\n   when a claim to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1250\">Article\n   25</a> is put forward…\n   …20…In Ratilal’s case we also notice that Mukherjea, J. quoted\n   as appropriate Davar, J.’s following observations in <a href=\"/doc/1022011/\" id=\"a_1251\">Jamshed Ji\n   v.

It is submitted that the real question is whether\n             the religious denomination looks upon it as an essential part of\n             its religion, and however irrational it may appear to persons\n             who do not share that religious belief, the view of the\n             denomination must prevail, for, it is not open to a court to\n             describe as irrational that which is a part of a denomination’s\n             religion. The actual decision in the case, that the right to\n             manage the property was a secular matter, is correct, but that\n             is because, as pointed out by Mukherjea J., <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_1269\">Art. 26(b)</a> when\n             constrasted with <a href=\"/doc/547354/\" id=\"a_1270\">Art. 26(c)</a> and (d) shows that matters of\n             religious belief and practises are distinct and separate from the\n             management of property of a religious denomination.

The word essential is now in\n               familiar use for this purpose. As we shall there is a context in\n               which the religious community is allowed freedom to determine\n               what is ‘essential’ to its belief and practise, but the individual\n               has no freedom to determine what is essential to his religion,\n               for if it were otherwise and if the law gave any protection to\n               religion as determined on this basis the State’s power to protect\n               and direct would be at an end.

This is a limited inquiry. The Court is\n               concerned to ensure an assertion of religious belief is made in\n               good faith: neither fictitious, nor capricious, and that it is not an\n               artifice, to adopt the felicitous phrase of Iacobucci J in the\n               decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Syndicat Northcrest\n               v. Amselem (2004) 241 DLR (4th) 1, 27, para 52. But,\n               emphatically, it is not for the Court to embark on an inquiry into\n               the asserted belief and judge its validity by some objective\n               standard such as the source material upon which the claimant\n               founds his belief or the orthodox teaching of the religion in\n               question or the extent to which the claimant’s belief conforms to\n               or differs from the views of others professing the same religion.\n               Freedom of religion protects the subjected belief of an\n               individual.

The European Court of\n               Human Rights has rightly noted that in principle, the right to\n               freedom of religion as understood in the Convention rules out\n               any appreciation by the State of the legitimacy of religious\n               beliefs or of the manner in which these are expressed:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_507\">               Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia v Moldova (2002) 35 EHRR\n               306, 335, para 117.

In Eddie C. Thomas v.

The Court noted that the determination of what constitutes\n\n           a religious belief or practise is a very “difficult and delicate task”, and\n\n           noted as follows about the role of a Constitutional Court:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_508\">               “…The determination of what is a religious belief or practise is\n               more often than not a difficult and delicate task…However, the\n               resolution of that question is not to turn upon a judicial\n               perception of the particular belief or practise in question;\n               religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or\n               comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment\n               protection…\n               …The Indiana court also appears to have given significant\n               weight to the fact that another Jehovah’s Witness had no\n               scruples about working on tank turrets; for that other Witness,\n               at least, such work was scripturally acceptable. Intrafaith\n               differences of that kind are not uncommon among followers of a\n               particular creed, and the judicial process is singularly ill\n               equipped to resolve such differences in relation to the Religious\n               Clauses…Particularly in this sensitive area, it is not within the\n               judicial function and judicial competence to inquire whether the\n               petitioner or his fellow worker more correctly perceived the\n\n36   450 U.S. 707 (1981)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_634\">                                           38</span>\n\f                commands of their common faith.

The devotees follow an identifiable set of beliefs, customs and\n\n  usages, and code of conduct which are being practised since time\n\n  immemorial, and are founded in a common faith. The religious\n\n  practises being followed in this Temple are founded on the belief\n\n  that the Lord has manifested himself in the form of a ‘Naishtika\n\n  Brahmachari’. It is because of this nishtha, that women between\n\n  the ages of 10 to 50 years, are not permitted to enter the temple.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_525\">      The practises followed by this religious denomination, or sect\n\n  thereof, as the case maybe, constitute a code of conduct, which is\n\n  a part of the essential spiritual discipline related to this\n\n  pilgrimage.

Of them one is the Thanthri of the temple\n           who can authoritatively speak about the usage followed in the\n           temple. His knowledge extends to a period of more than 40\n           years. The Secretary of the Ayyappa Seva Sangham had been\n           a regular pilgrim to Sabarimala shrine for a period of 60 years.\n           A senior member of the Pandalam palace has also testified\n           about the practise followed and the view of the members of the\n           palace to which the temple at one time belonged. The\n           testimony of these witnesses would therefore conclusively\n           establish the usage followed in the temple of not permitting\n           women of the age group 10 to 50 to worship in the temple. It\n           necessarily flows that women of that age group were also not\n           permitted either to enter the precincts of the temple or to trek\n           Sabarimala for the purpose of pilgrimage.”\n                                                      (Emphasis supplied)\n\n13.14.

Any interference with the mode and manner of worship of\n\n      this religious denomination, or sect, would impact the character of\n\n      the Temple, and affect the beliefs and practises of the worshippers of\n\n      this Temple.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_549\">13.15. Based on the material adduced before this Court, the Respondents\n\n      have certainly made out a plausible case that the practise of\n\n      restricting entry of women between the age group of 10 to 50 years is\n\n      an essential religious practise of the devotees of Lord Ayyappa at the\n\n      Sabarimala Temple being followed since time immemorial.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_687\">                                     66</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_550\">\f14. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_1359\">ARTICLE 17\n\n  14.1.</a>   The contention of the Petitioners that the restriction imposed on the\n\n          entry of women during the notified age group, tantamounts to a form\n\n          of ‘Untouchability’ under <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_1360\">Article 17</a> of the Constitution, is liable to be\n\n          rejected for the reasons stated hereinafter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_551\">  14.2.

In the present case, women of the notified age group are allowed\n\n          entry into all other temples of Lord Ayyappa. The restriction on the\n\n          entry of women during the notified age group in this Temple is based\n\n          on the unique characteristic of the deity, and not founded on any\n\n          social exclusion.

The proviso carves out an exception to the <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1379\">Section 3</a> itself. The\n\n           declaration that places of public worship shall be open to Hindus of\n\n           all sections and classes is not absolute, but subject to the right of a\n\n           religious denomination to “manage its own affairs in matters of\n\n           religion”. <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1380\">Section 3</a> must be viewed in the Constitutional context\n\n           where the legislature has framed an enabling legislation under <a href=\"/doc/1539376/\" id=\"a_1381\">Article\n\n           25(2)(b)</a> which has been made expressly subject to religious practises\n\n           peculiar to a denomination under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_1382\">Article 26(b).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_613\">\n\n\n60   “2.

Rule 3(b) is a statutory recognition of a pre-existing custom and\n\n        usage being followed by this Temple.

The Petitioners have not challenged the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1384\">Section 3</a> as being\n\n        unconstitutional on any ground. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1385\">Section 3</a> makes an\n\n        exception in cases of religious denominations, or sects thereof to\n\n        manage their affairs in matters of religion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_615\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1915943\" id=\"span_694\">15.5.   The Notification dated November 27, 1956 issued by the Travancore\n\n        Devaswom Board restricts the entry of women between the ages of 10\n\n        to 55 years as a custom and practise integral to the sanctity of the\n\n        Temple, and having the force of law under <a href=\"/doc/15421639/\" id=\"a_1386\">Article 13(3)(a)</a> of the\n\n        Constitution.

The Secretary,\n\n        Travancore Devaswom Board, Thiruvananthapuram &amp; Ors.</a> (supra)\n\n        noted that this practise of restricting the entry of women is admitted\n\n        to have been prevalent since the past several centuries. These\n\n        practises are protected by the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1388\">Section 3</a> of the 1965 Act\n\n        which is given effect to by Rule 3(b) of the 1965 Rules.\n\n15.6.   The contention of the Petitioners that Rule 3(b) is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1389\">Section\n\n        3</a> of the 1965 Act, fails to take into consideration the proviso to\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1390\">Section 3</a> of the 1965 Act. <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1391\">Section 3</a> applies to all places of public\n\n        worship, whereas the proviso applies to temples founded for the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_695\">                                       73</span>\n\f           benefit of any religious denomination or sect thereof. Hence, the\n\n           contentions of the Petitioners that Rule 3(b) is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/144975152/\" id=\"a_1392\">Section 3</a> of\n\n           the 1965 Act is rejected.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_616\">16.
