It is the case of the petitioners that due to the lackadaisical and\n\n                      corrupt act of the respondent in collusion with the then Executive Officer of the\n\n                      Town Panchayat by misusing the funds, more than 5 villages in the said\n\n                      panchayat have not been getting their rightful share of welfare measures.

It is the case of the petitioners that on 18.12.2012, the respondent\n\n                      caused legal notice to the petitioners alleging that they have harmed his name\n\n                      and reputation by giving the details of the representation to the media and,\n\n                      thereby, have defamed him.

The said private\n\n                      complaint of the respondent has been taken on file in C.C. No.147 of 2013 by the\n\n                      learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Coimbatore, and summons have been issued,\n\n                      necessitating the petitioners to knock the doors of this Court to quash the said\n\n                      complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">                             5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, at the outset, drew the\n\n                      attention of this Court to the complaint lodged by the petitioners before the\n\n                      District Collector and the Assistant Director of Panchayat and submitted that the\n\n                      act of the respondent in not discharging his duties as President, as is mandated\n\n                      under the <a href=\"/doc/96516710/\" id=\"a_2\">Panchayat Act</a> in collusion with the Executive Officer of the Town\n\n                      Panchayat, to the detriment of the villages falling within the said Panchayat\n\n                      prompted the petitioners to go before the competent authorities. It is the\n\n                      further contention of the learned counsel that pursuant to the said\n\n                      representation, enquiry was caused which resulted in an adverse report against\n\n                      the respondent being filed prompting the respondent to file the suit seeking stay,\n\n                      though no stay was granted in the said suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                      4/24</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                             ______________\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                     Crl. O.P. No.24872/2013</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">                             6. It is the further contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\n                      that the act of the respondent to the detriment of the post which he was holding\n\n                      had only prompted the petitioners to move the representation for No Confidence\n\n                      Motion, which is as per the provisions prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/96516710/\" id=\"a_3\">Panchayat Act</a> and\n\n                      the Rules. Though the details of the representation have been flashed in the\n\n                      media, it cannot be said that the same is defamatory for the simple reason that\n\n                      the respondent is holding a public office and, therefore, he is accountable to the\n\n                      public/citizens of the said locality for all his acts. The petitioners, as elected\n\n                      members of the Panchayat, have only brought to light the inaction of the\n\n                      respondent and the collusive act of the respondent with the Executive Officer to\n\n                      the detriment of the villages and this act, by no means, could be termed as a\n\n                      calculated act to defame the respondent. Once the respondent has accepted the\n\n                      post, which is a public office, it is not open to the respondent to take umbrage\n\n                      under the defamation laws, more so, when the representation is only against the\n\n                      acts committed by the respondent holding the public office and in the discharge\n\n                      of such duties and not against the individual. It is the contention of the learned\n\n                      counsel for the petitioners that the said publication, which is alleged to be\n\n                      defamatory and derogatory in character, in no way could be termed as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                      5/24</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                              ______________\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                                      Crl. O.P. No.24872/2013</span>\n\n                      defamation or derogation to the respondent. Further, it is the contention of the\n\n                      learned counsel for the petitioners that the tenor of the material published\n\n                      would unequivocally show that what has been published is the happenings in the\n\n                      meeting of the elected representatives, where the petitioners, as elected\n\n                      representatives, highlighted the mala fide acts of the respondent in the discharge\n\n                      of public duties and also the non-furnishing of particulars relating to income and\n\n                      expenditure and no where, any allegation is made against person of the\n\n                      respondent, thereby, tarnishing his image in the public forum. It is the vehement\n\n                      submission of the learned counsel that there is not even a single iota of\n\n                      satisfaction of the ingredients of defamation, as codified<a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/s 499</a> IPC stands\n\n                      satisfied. The proceedings have been initiated only to put shackles on the right of\n\n                      the elected representatives to question the corrupt and mala fide acts of the\n\n                      respondent, which right cannot be curtailed, but should be exercised with\n\n                      reasonable restrictions. It is the submission of the learned counsel that allowing\n\n                      the trial to continue would be nothing but travesty of justice and this Court, in\n\n                      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, should strike down the prosecution and\n\n                      release the petitioners from the shackles of the malicious prosecution.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                             7.

The\n                                legislation should not invade the rights and should not smack of\n                                arbitrariness. The test of reasonableness cannot be determined\n                                by laying down any abstract standard or general pattern. It\n                                would depend upon the nature of the right which has been\n                                infringed or sought to be infringed. The ultimate “impact”, that\n                                is, effect on the right has to be determined. The “impact\n                                doctrine” or the principle of “inevitable effect” or “inevitable\n                                consequence” stands in contradistinction to abuse or misuse of a\n                                legislation or a statutory provision depending upon the\n                                circumstances of the case.

As the submissions would show, the stress is given on the\n                                 right to freedom of speech and expression in the context of\n                                 individual growth, progress of democracy, conceptual respect for\n                                 a voice of dissent, tolerance for discordant note and acceptance\n                                 of different voices. Right to say what may displease or annoy\n                                 others cannot be throttled or garrotted. There can never be any\n                                 cavil over the fact that the right to freedom of speech and\n                                 expression is a right that has to get ascendance in a democratic\n                                 body polity, but at the same time the limit has to be\n                                 proportionate and not unlimited. It is urged that the defamation\n                                 has been described as an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 499</a> IPC that\n                                 protects an individual&#x27;s perception of his own reputation which\n                                 cannot be elevated to have the status of public interest. The\n                                 argument is that to give a remedy by taking recourse to criminal\n                                 jurisprudence to curb the constitutional right, that is, right to\n                                 freedom of speech and expression, is neither permissible nor\n                                 justified.

It is also canvassed\n                                 that in the colonial era the defamation was conceived of to keep\n                                 social peace and social order but with the changing climate of\n                                 growing democracy, it is not permissible to keep alive such a\n                                 restriction.”\n                                                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                              15.

A citizen has a right to safeguard the\n                              privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation,\n                              motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">                              None can publish anything concerning the above matters\n                              without his consent — whether truthful or otherwise and\n                              whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating\n                              the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable\n                              in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if\n                              a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or\n                              voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">                                 (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n                              publication    concerning     the    aforesaid    aspects     becomes\n                              unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records\n                              including court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\n                              becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n                              subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\n                              press and media among others.

This is so even where the publication is\n                              based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the\n                              official establishes that the publication was made (by the\n                              defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n                              would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or\n                              media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of\n                              the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has\n                              written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be\n                              false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n                              defendant would have no defence and would be liable for\n                              damages.

In fact, a careful perusal of the representation, which is\n\n                      alleged to have been given to the media for publication, but which is actually not\n\n                      reflected in the publication, also categorically speaks only about the\n\n                      administrative overreach perpetrated by the respondent in relation to his corrupt\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                      18/24</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                                 ______________\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                                         Crl.

It is to be pointed out at this juncture that criticism is the hallmark of\n\n                      the proper functioning of any administrative setup. More so, in a public office, as\n\n                      one held by the respondent, criticisms are prone to be thrown from all corners\n\n                      and unmindful of such criticism, the person holding the public office has to\n\n                      function effectively, thereby, undermining the slur cast on the said public office.\n\n                      The public office held by the respondent is one such office, which is an authority,\n\n                      entrusted with the social work to be carried out for the benefit of the general\n\n                      public. Brickbats thrown at the individual, in the course of discharge of his duties,\n\n                      unless they are on a personal level, cannot be made the basis for slapping\n\n                      defamation proceedings.
