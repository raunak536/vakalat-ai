The value of any freedom is determined by  the  extent  to  which  the\ncitizens  are  able  to  enjoy  such  freedom.   Ours  is  a  constitutional\ndemocracy and it is axiomatic that citizens have the  right  to  know  about\nthe affairs of the Government which, having been elected by them,  seeks  to\nformulate some policies of governance  aimed  at  their  welfare.   However,\nlike any other freedom, this freedom also has limitations.  It is a  settled\nproposition that the Right to Freedom of  Speech  and  Expression  enshrined\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  of  the  Constitution  of  India  (for  short  ‘the\nConstitution’) encompasses the right  to  impart  and  receive  information.\nThe Right to Information has been stated to be one of the  important  facets\nof proper governance.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_1\">With the passage of time, this concept has  not  only\ndeveloped in the field of law, but also has attained new dimensions  in  its\napplication.  This court while highlighting the need  for  the  society  and\nits entitlement to know has observed that public interest is  better  served\nby effective application of the right  to  information.   This  freedom  has\nbeen accepted in one form or the other in various parts of the world.   This\nCourt, in absence of any statutory law, in the case of  <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_2\">Secretary,  Ministry\nof Information and Broadcasting, Government  of  India  &amp;  Ors.  v.  Cricket\nAssociation of Bengal &amp; Anr.</a> [(1995) 2 SCC 161] held as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           “The democracy cannot exist unless all citizens have a right  to\n           participate in the affairs of the polity of  the  country.   The\n           right  to  participate  in  the  affairs  of  the   country   is\n           meaningless unless the citizens are well informed on  all  sides\n           of the issues, in respect of  which  they  are  called  upon  to\n           express their  views.   One-sided  information,  disinformation,\n           misinformation  and  non-information,  all  equally  create   an\n           uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce  when  medium\n           of information is  monopolized  either  by  a  partisan  central\n           authority or by private individuals or oligarchy  organizations.\n           This is particularly so in a country like ours  where  about  65\n           per cent of the population is illiterate and  hardly  1  ½   per\n           cent of the population has an access to the print media which is\n           not subject to pre-censorship.”\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The legal principle of ‘A man’s house is  his  castle.   The  midnight\nknock by the police bully breaking into the peace of the citizen’s  home  is\noutrageous in law’, stated by Edward Coke  has  been  explained  by  Justice\nDouglas as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           “The free State offers what a police state denies – the  privacy\n           of the home, the dignity and peace of mind  of  the  individual.\n           That precious right to be left alone is violated once the police\n           enter our conversations.”\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The States which are  governed  by  Policing  and  have  a  policy  of\ngreater restriction and control obviously restrict  the  enjoyment  of  such\nfreedoms.  That, however, does not necessarily imply that  this  freedom  is\nrestriction-free  in  the  States  where  democratic  governance   prevails.\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution itself is controlled by the  reasonable\nrestrictions imposed by the State by enacting  various  laws  from  time  to\ntime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4.    The petitioner, a public spirited citizen, has approached  this  Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 32</a> of the  Constitution  stating  that  though  the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">Right  to\nInformation Act, 2005</a> (for short ‘Act of 2005’) is an important tool in  the\nhands of any citizen to keep checks and  balances  on  the  working  of  the\npublic servants, yet the criterion for appointment of the  persons  who  are\nto adjudicate the disputes under this Act  are  too  vague,  general,  ultra\nvires the Constitution and contrary to the  established  principles  of  law\n<a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_6\">laid down by</a> a plethora of judgments of this Court.  It is the stand of  the\npetitioner that the persons who  are  appointed  to  discharge  judicial  or\nquasi-judicial functions or powers under the Act of 2005  ought  to  have  a\njudicial approach, experience, knowledge and expertise.  Limitation  has  to\nbe read into the competence of the legislature to prescribe the  eligibility\nfor  appointment  of  judicial  or  quasi-judicial  bodies  like  the  Chief\nInformation Commissioner, Information Commissioners  and  the  corresponding\nposts  in  the  States,  respectively.   The  legislative  power  should  be\nexercised in a  manner  which  is  in  consonance  with  the  constitutional\nprinciples and guarantees.  Complete  lack  of  judicial  expertise  in  the\nCommission may render the decision making process impracticable,  inflexible\nand in given cases, contrary to  law.   The  availability  of  expertise  of\njudicial members in the Commission would facilitate the  decision-making  to\nbe more practical, effective and meaningful,  besides  giving  semblance  of\njustice being done.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"359668\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1180101\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1152518\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132042\" id=\"span_5\">The provision of eligibility criteria which  does  not\neven lay down any qualifications for appointment  to  the  respective  posts\nunder the Act of 2005 would be unconstitutional, in terms of  the  judgments\nof this Court in the cases of Union of India  v.

It is contended  that  keeping  in  view  the  powers,  functions  and\njurisdiction  that  the  Chief/State  Information  Commissioner  and/or  the\nInformation  Commissioners  exercise  undisputedly,  including   the   penal\njurisdiction, there is a certain requirement of legal acumen  and  expertise\nfor attaining the ends of justice, particularly,  under  the  provisions  of\nthe Act of 2005.   On  this  premise,  the  petitioner  has  questioned  the\nconstitutional validity of sub-Sections (5) and (6) of <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 12</a>  and  sub-\nSections (5) and (6) of <a href=\"/doc/762785/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 15</a> of the Act  of  2005.   These  provisions\nprimarily deal with the eligibility criteria for appointment  to  the  posts\nof Chief Information Commissioners and Information  Commissioners,  both  at\nthe Central and the State levels.  It will  be  useful  to  refer  to  these\nprovisions at this very stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">         “<a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_13\">Section  12</a>  —  (5)  The  Chief   Information   Commissioner   and\n         Information Commissioners shall be persons of  eminence  in  public\n         life with  wide  knowledge  and  experience  in  law,  science  and\n         technology, social service, management, journalism, mass  media  or\n         administration and governance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">         (6)  The  Chief  Information   Commissioner   or   an   Information\n         Commissioner shall not be a Member of Parliament or Member  of  the\n         Legislature of any State or Union territory, as the case may be, or\n         hold any other office of profit or  connected  with  any  political\n         party or carrying on any business or pursuing any profession.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">                  XXX                 XXX              XXX\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 15 (5)</a> The State Chief  Information  Commissioner  and  the\n         State Information Commissioners shall be  persons  of  eminence  in\n         public life with wide knowledge and experience in law, science  and\n         technology, social service, management, journalism, mass  media  or\n         administration and governance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">         (6) The State Chief Information Commissioner or a State Information\n         Commissioner shall not be a Member of Parliament or Member  of  the\n         Legislature of any State or Union territory, as the case may be, or\n         hold any other office of profit or  connected  with  any  political\n         party or carrying on any business or pursuing any profession.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">6.    The challenge to the constitutionality of the above  provisions  inter\nalia is on the following grounds :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(i)   Enactment of the provisions of eligibility  criteria  for  appointment\n       to such high  offices,  without  providing  qualifications,  definite\n       criterion or  even  consultation  with  judiciary,  are  in  complete\n       violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Article  14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_16\">,  16</a>\n       and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_17\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(ii)  Absence  of  any  specific  qualification  and  merely  providing  for\n       experience in the various specified fields, without there  being  any\n       nexus of either of these fields to the object of the Act of 2005,  is\n       violative of the fundamental constitutional values.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(iii) Usage of extremely vague and general terminology like social  service,\n       mass media and alike terms, being  indefinite  and  undefined,  would\n       lead to arbitrariness and are open to abuse.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(iv)  This vagueness and uncertainty is bound to  prejudicially  affect  the\n       administration of justice by such Commissions or Tribunals which  are\n       vested with wide adjudicatory  and  penal  powers.   It  may  not  be\n       feasible for a person  of  ordinary  experience  to  deal  with  such\n       subjects with legal accuracy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(v)   The Chief Information Commissioner and  Information  Commissioners  at\n       the State and Centre level  perform  judicial  and/or  quasi-judicial\n       functions under the Act of 2005 and therefore, it is  mandatory  that\n       persons with judicial experience or  majority  of  them  should  hold\n       these posts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(vi)         The  fundamental  right  to  equality  before  law  and   equal\n       protection of law  guaranteed  by  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Article  14</a>  of  the  Constitution\n       enshrines in itself the person’s right to  be  adjudged  by  a  forum\n       which exercises judicial power in an impartial and independent manner\n       consistent with the recognised principles of adjudication.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(vii)       Apart from specifying a high powered committee  for  appointment\n       to these posts, the Act of 2005 does not prescribe any mechanism  for\n       proper scrutiny and consultation  with  the  judiciary  in  order  to\n       render effective performance of  functions  by  the  office  holders,\n       which is against the basic scheme of our Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(viii)      Even if the Court repels the attack to the constitutionality  of\n       the provisions, still, keeping in view the  basic  structure  of  the\n       Constitution and the independence of judiciary,  it  is  a  mandatory\n       requirement that  judicial  or  quasi-judicial  powers  ought  to  be\n       exercised by persons having judicial  knowledge  and  expertise.   To\n       that extent, in any case, these provisions  would  have  to  be  read\n       down.   Resultantly, limitation has to be read into the competence of\n       the legislature to prescribe requisite qualifications for appointment\n       of judicial or quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">Discussion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">7.    The Constitution of India expressly confers upon the courts the  power\nof judicial review.  The courts, as regards  the  fundamental  rights,  have\nbeen assigned the role of sentinel on the qui vive under <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 13</a>  of  the\nConstitution.   Our courts have exercised  the  power  of  judicial  review,\nbeyond legislative competence, but within the specified limitations.   While\nthe court gives immense weightage to  the  legislative  judgment,  still  it\ncannot deviate from its own duties to determine the constitutionality of  an\nimpugned  statute.    Every  law  has  to   pass   through   the   test   of\nconstitutionality which is stated  to  be  nothing  but  a  formal  test  of\nrationality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"753224\" id=\"span_6\">8.    The foundation of this power of judicial review,  as  explained  by  a\nnine-Judge’s Bench  in  the  case  of  Supreme  Court  Advocates  on  <a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_20\">Record\nAssociation &amp; Ors. v. Union of India</a> [(1993) 4 SCC 441], is the theory  that\nthe Constitution which is the fundamental law of the land, is the ‘will’  of\nthe  ‘people’,  while  a  statute  is  only  the  creation  of  the  elected\nrepresentatives  of  the  people;  when,  therefore,  the  ‘will’   of   the\nlegislature as declared in the statute, stands in opposition to that of  the\npeople as declared in the Constitution -  the  ‘will’  of  the  people  must\nprevail.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">9.    In determining the constitutionality or validity of  a  constitutional\nprovision, the court must weigh the real impact and effect thereof,  on  the\nfundamental rights.   The Court would not allow the legislature to  overlook\na constitutional provision by employing indirect methods.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1215719\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/1215719/\" id=\"a_21\">Minerva  Mills\nLtd. &amp; Ors. v. Union of  India  &amp;  Ors.</a>  [(1980)  3  SCC  625],  this  Court\nmandated without ambiguity, that it is the Constitution which is supreme  in\nIndia  and  not  the  Parliament.   The   Parliament   cannot   damage   the\nConstitution, to which  it  owes  its  existence,  with  unlimited  amending\npower.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">10.    An  enacted  law   may   be   constitutional   or   unconstitutional.\nTraditionally, this Court had provided very  limited  grounds  on  which  an\nenacted law could be  declared  unconstitutional.    They  were  legislative\ncompetence, violation of Part III of the Constitution and reasonableness  of\nthe law.   The first two were definite in their scope and application  while\nthe cases falling in the third category remained in a state of  uncertainty.\n   With the  passage  of  time,  the  law  developed  and  the  grounds  for\nunconstitutionality also widened.  D.D. Basu in  the  ‘Shorter  Constitution\nof India’  (Fourteenth  Edition,  2009)  has  detailed,  with  reference  to\nvarious judgments of this Court, the grounds  on  which  the  law  could  be\ninvalidated or could not be invalidated.

The wisdom or motive  of  the  legislature  in\nmaking it is not a relative consideration.   The Court  should  examine  the\nprovisions of the statute in light of the  provisions  of  the  Constitution\n(e.g. Part III), regardless  of  how  it  is  actually  administered  or  is\ncapable of being administered.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"212098\" id=\"span_14\">In this regard, the Court may consider  the\nfollowing factors as noticed in <a href=\"/doc/212098/\" id=\"a_31\">D.D.

It is  a  settled  canon  of  constitutional  jurisprudence  that  the\ndoctrine of classification is a subsidiary rule evolved by  courts  to  give\npractical  content  to  the  doctrine  of  equality.  Over-emphasis  of  the\ndoctrine of classification or anxious or sustained attempt to discover  some\nbasis for classification may gradually and imperceptly  erode  the  profound\npotency of the glorious content of equality enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 14</a>  of  the\nConstitution.

The  statute\nitself may indicate the  persons  or  things  to  whom  its  provisions  are\nintended to apply.

State of Haryana &amp; Ors.</a> [(1986) 2 SCC 249],  the\nCourt stated that whether it is the Constitution that is  expounded  or  the\nconstitutional validity of a statute that is considered, a cardinal rule  is\nto look to the Preamble of the Constitution as the guiding light and to  the\nDirective Principles of State Policy as  the  Book  of  Interpretation.  The\nConstitution being sui generis, these are  the  factors  of  distant  vision\nthat help in the determination of the constitutional issues.

In order to examine the constitutionality or otherwise  of  a  statute\nor any of its provisions, one of the most  relevant  considerations  is  the\nobject and reasons as well as the legislative history of the  statute.    It\nwould help the court in arriving at a more objective and  justful  approach.\nIt would be necessary for the Court to examine the reasons of  enactment  of\na particular provision so as to find out its ultimate impact  vis-a-vis  the\nconstitutional provisions.

In light of  the  law  guaranteeing  the  right  to  information,  the\ncitizens have the fundamental right to know what the Government is doing  in\nits name.  The freedom of speech is the lifeblood of  democracy.   The  free\nflow of information and ideas informs political  growth.   It  is  a  safety\nvalve.  People are more ready to accept the decisions that go  against  them\nif they can in principle seem to influence them.  In a way, it checks  abuse\nof power by the public officials.  In the  modern  times,  where  there  has\nbeen globalization of trade and  industry,  the  scientific  growth  in  the\ncommunication system and faster commuting has turned the world into  a  very\nwell-knit community.  The view projected, with some emphasis,  is  that  the\nimparting of information qua the working of the government on the  one  hand\nand its decision affecting the domestic and international  trade  and  other\nactivities on the other,  impose  an  obligation  upon  the  authorities  to\ndisclose information.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">22.   The Right to  Information  was  harnessed  as  a  tool  for  promoting\ndevelopment; strengthening the democratic governance and effective  delivery\nof socio-economic services.  Acquisition of information  and  knowledge  and\nits application have intense and pervasive impact on the process  of  taking\ninformed decision, resulting in overall  productivity  gains.   It  is  also\nsaid that information and knowledge are critical  for  realising  all  human\naspirations such  as  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life.   Sharing  of\ninformation, for instance, about the new techniques of farming, health  care\nfacilities,  hazards  of  environmental   degradation,   opportunities   for\nlearning and earning, legal remedies for combating gender  bias  etc.,  have\novertime, made significant contributions to the well being of  poor  people.\nIt is also felt that this right and the laws relating thereto empower  every\ncitizen to take charge of his life and make proper choices on the  basis  of\nfreely available information for effective  participation  in  economic  and\npolitical activities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">23.   Justice V.R.  Krishna  Iyer  in  his  book  “Freedom  of  Information”\nexpressed the view:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">           “The  right  to  information  is  a  right  incidental  to   the\n           constitutionally guaranteed  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and\n           expression.  The international movement to  include  it  in  the\n           legal system gained prominence in 1946 with the General Assembly\n           of the United Nations declaring freedom of information to  be  a\n           fundamental  human  right  and  a  touchstone  for   all   other\n           liberties. It culminated in the  United  Nations  Conference  on\n           Freedom of Information held in Geneva in 1948.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                 <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 19</a> of the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights\n           says:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                      “Everyone has the right to freedom of information and\n                      expression;  this  right  includes  freedom  to  hold\n                      opinions without interference and  to  seek,  receive\n                      and impart information and ideas  through  any  media\n                      and regardless of frontiers.”\n\n                 It may be a coincidence  that  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_44\">Article  19</a>  of  the  Indian\n           Constitution also provides every citizen the right to freedom of\n           speech and  expression.   However,  the  word  ‘information’  is\n           conspicuously absent.  But, as the highest Court has explicated,\n           the right of information is integral to freedom of expression.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                      “India was a member of the Commission on Human Rights\n                      appointed by the Economic and Social Council  of  the\n                      United Nations which drafted  the  1948  Declaration.\n                      As such it would have been eminently fit  and  proper\n                      if the right  to  information  was  included  in  the\n                      rights   enumerated   under   <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_45\">Article   19</a>   of   our\n                      Constitution.   <a href=\"/doc/1164414/\" id=\"a_46\">Article  55</a>  of  the   U.N.

Despite the absence of any express mention of the  word  ‘information’\nin  our  Constitution  under  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_48\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>,  this   right   has   stood\nincorporated therein by the interpretative process by this Court laying  the\nunequivocal statement of law by this Court that there was a  definite  right\nto information of the citizens of this country.  Before  the  Supreme  Court\nspelt out with clarity the right to information as a right  inbuilt  in  the\nconstitutional framework, there existed no provision giving  this  right  in\nabsolute terms or otherwise.  Of course, one finds glimpses of the right  to\ninformation of the citizens and obligations of the State  to  disclose  such\ninformation in various other laws, for example, <a href=\"/doc/1227984/\" id=\"a_49\">Sections 74</a>  to  <a href=\"/doc/1106405/\" id=\"a_50\">78</a>  of  the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 give right to a person to know about the  contents\nof the public documents and  the  public  officer  is  required  to  provide\ncopies of such public documents to any person, who has the right to  inspect\nthem.   Under  <a href=\"/doc/1304436/\" id=\"a_51\">Section  25(6)</a>  of  the  Water  (Prevention  and  Control  of\nPollution) Act, 1974, every State is required  to  maintain  a  register  of\ninformation on water pollution and it is further provided that  so  much  of\nthe register as relates to any outlet or effluent from any land or  premises\nshall  be  open  to  inspection  at  all  reasonable  hours  by  any  person\ninterested in or affected by such outlet, land or premises, as the case  may\nbe.  Dr. J.N. Barowalia in ‘Commentary on  the  Right  to  Information  Act’\n(2006) has noted that the Report of the National Commission  for  Review  of\nWorking   of   Constitution    under    the    Chairmanship    of    Justice\nM.N.Venkatachaliah, as he then was,  recognised  the  right  to  information\nwherein it  is  provided  that  major  assumption  behind  a  new  style  of\ngovernance is the citizen’s access to information. Much of the common  man’s\ndistress and  helplessness  could  be  traced  to  his  lack  of  access  to\ninformation and lack of knowledge of decision-making processes.  He  remains\nignorant and unaware of the process which virtually  affects  his  interest.\nGovernment procedures and regulations shrouded in the  veil  of  secrecy  do\nnot allow the litigants to know how their cases are being handled. They  shy\naway from questioning the officers  handling  their  cases  because  of  the\nlatter’s snobbish attitude.  Right to information should be  guaranteed  and\nneeds to be given real  substance.  In  this  regard,  the  Government  must\nassume a  major  responsibility  and  mobilize  skills  to  ensure  flow  of\ninformation to citizens.  The traditional insistence on  secrecy  should  be\ndiscarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">25.   The Government of India had appointed a  Working  Group  on  Right  to\nInformation and Promotion of  Open  and  Transparent  Government  under  the\nChairmanship  of  Shri  H.D.

In  the  Chief  Ministers  Conference  on  ‘Effective  and  Responsive\nGovernment’ held on 24th May, 1997, the need to enact a law on the Right  to\nInformation was recognized unanimously.  This conference  was  primarily  to\ndiscuss the measures to be taken to ensure a more effective  and  responsive\ngovernment. The recommendations of various Committees constituted  for  this\npurpose and awareness in the Government machinery of  the  significance  and\nbenefits of this freedom ultimately led to the enactment of the ‘<a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_53\">Freedom  of\nInformation Act, 2002</a>’ (for short, the ‘Act of 2002’).   The  proposed  Bill\nwas to enable the citizens to have information on a  statutory  basis.   The\nproposed Bill was stated to be  in  accord  with  both  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_54\">Article  19</a>  of  the\nConstitution of India as well as <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19</a> of the Universal Declaration  of\nHuman Rights, 1948. This is how the Act of 2002 was enacted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">27.   In terms of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act  of  2002,\nit was stated that this law was enacted in  order  to  make  the  government\nmore transparent and accountable to the public.  It was  felt  that  in  the\npresent democratic framework, free flow of information for citizens and non-\nGovernment institutions  suffers  from  several  bottlenecks  including  the\nexisting legal framework, lack of infrastructure at  the  grass  root  level\nand an attitude of secrecy within the Civil Services as a result of the  old\nframework of rules.  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_56\">The Act</a>  was  to  deal  with  all  such  aspects.   The\npurpose  and  object  was  to  make  the  government  more  transparent  and\naccountable to the public and to provide freedom to every citizen to  secure\naccess to information under the control of  public  authorities,  consistent\nwith public  interest,  in  order  to  promote  openness,  transparency  and\naccountability in  administration  and  in  relation  to  matters  connected\ntherewith or incidental thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">28.   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_57\">After the Act</a> of 2002 came into force, there was  a  definite  attempt\nto exercise such freedom but it did not operate  fully  and  satisfactorily.\nThe Civil Services (Conduct) Rules and the Manual of  the  Office  Procedure\nas well as the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_58\">Official Secrets Act,  1923</a>  and  also  the  mindset  of  the\nauthorities were implied impediments to the full,  complete  and  purposeful\nachievement of the object of enacting the Act  of  2002.   Since,  with  the\npassage of time, it was felt that the Act of 2002 was neither sufficient  in\nfulfilling the aspirations of the citizens of India nor in making the  right\nto freedom of information more progressive,  participatory  and  meaningful,\nsignificant changes  to  the  existing  law  were  proposed.   The  National\nAdvisory Council suggested certain important changes to be  incorporated  in\nthe said Act of 2002 to ensure smoother and greater access  to  information.\nAfter  examining  the  suggestions  of  the  Council  and  the  public,  the\nGovernment decided that the Act of 2002 should be replaced and, in fact,  an\nattempt was made to enact another law for providing an  effective  framework\nfor effectuating the right to information recognized under  the  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_59\">Article  19</a>\nof the Constitution.  The Right to Information Bill was introduced in  terms\nof its statements  of  objects  and  reasons  to  ensure  greater  and  more\neffective access to information.  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_60\">The Act</a> of 2002 needed  to  be  made  even\nmore progressive,  participatory  and  meaningful.   The  important  changes\nproposed to be incorporated therein included establishment of  an  appellate\nmachinery with investigative powers to review the  decision  of  the  Public\nInformation Officer, providing penal provisions in the event of  failure  to\nprovide information as per law, etc.  This  Bill  was  passed  by  both  the\nHouses of the Parliament and upon receiving the assent of the  President  on\n15th June, 2005, it came on the statute book as  the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_61\">Right  to  Information\nAct, 2005</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">SCHEME OF ACT of 2005 (COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ACT OF 2002 AND ACT OF  2005)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">29.   Now, we may deal with the comparative  analysis  of  these  two  Acts.\nThe first and the foremost significant change was the  change  in  the  very\nnomenclature of the Act of 2005 by replacing the  word  ‘freedom’  with  the\nword ‘right’ in the title of the statute.  The  obvious  legislative  intent\nwas to make seeking of prescribed information  by  the  citizens,  a  right,\nrather than a mere freedom.  There exists a subtle  difference  when  people\nperceive it as a right to get information in contra-distinction to it  being\na freedom.  Upon such comparison, the connotations of the two have  distinct\nand different application.  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_62\">The Act</a> of 2005 was enacted to  radically  alter\nthe administrative ethos and culture of secrecy and control, the  legacy  of\ncolonial era and bring in a new era of transparency  and  accountability  in\ngovernance.  In substance, the Act of 2005 does not alter the spirit of  the\nAct of 2002 and on the contrary, the substantive provisions like <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_63\">Sections  3</a>\nto <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_64\">11</a> of both the Acts are similar except with some variations  in  some  of\nthe provisions.  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_65\">The Act</a> of 2005 makes the definition clause more  elaborate\nand comprehensive.  It broadens the definition  of  public  authority  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 2(h)</a> by including therein even an authority or body  or  institution\nof self-government established or constituted by a  notification  issued  or\norder made by the  appropriate  Government  and  includes  any  body  owned,\ncontrolled or  substantially  financed  by  the  Government  and  also  non-\ngovernmental  organization  substantially  financed   by   the   appropriate\nGovernment, directly or indirectly.  Similarly,  the  expression  ‘Right  to\nInformation’ has been defined in  <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_67\">Section  2(j)</a>  to  include  the  right  to\ninspection  of  work,  documents,  records,  taking  certified  samples   of\nmaterial, taking notes and extracts and even obtaining  information  in  the\nform of floppies, tapes, video cassettes, etc.  This is an addition  to  the\nimportant  step  of  introduction  of  the  Central  and  State  Information\nCommissions  and  the  respective  Public  Information  Officers.   Further,\n<a href=\"/doc/342710/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 4(2)</a> is a new provision which places  a  mandatory  obligation  upon\nevery public authority to take steps in accordance with the requirements  of\nclause  (b)  of  sub-Section  (1)  of  that  Section  to  provide  as   much\ninformation suo moto to the public  at  regular  intervals  through  various\nmeans of communication including internet so that the  public  have  minimum\nresort to use of this Act to obtain information.  In other  words,  the  aim\nand object as highlighted in  specific  language  of  the  statute  is  that\nbesides it being a right of  the  citizenry  to  seek  information,  it  was\nobligatory upon the State to provide information relatable to its  functions\nfor the information of the public at large and this would avoid  unnecessary\ninvocation of such right by the citizenry under the provisions  of  the  Act\nof 2005.  Every authority/department is required  to  designate  the  Public\nInformation Officers and to appoint the Central Information  Commission  and\nState Information Commissions in accordance with the provisions of  <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections\n12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/762785/\" id=\"a_70\">15</a> of the Act of 2005.  It may be noticed that under  the  scheme  of\nthis Act, the Public Information Officer at the Centre and the State  Levels\nare  expected  to  receive  the  requests/applications  for  providing   the\ninformation.  Appeal against decision of  such  Public  Information  Officer\nwould lie to his senior in rank in terms of <a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 19(1)</a>  within  a  period\nof 30 days.  Such First Appellate Authority may admit the appeal  after  the\nexpiry of this statutory period subject  to  satisfactory  reasons  for  the\ndelay being established.  A second appeal lies to the Central or  the  State\nInformation Commission, as the case  may  be,  in  terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/1852611/\" id=\"a_72\">Section  19(3)</a>\nwithin a period of 90 days The decision of the  Commission  shall  be  final\nand binding as per <a href=\"/doc/485075/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 19(7)</a>.   <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 19</a> is  an  exhaustive  provision\nand the Act of 2005 on its cumulative reading is a complete code in  itself.\n <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1152518\" id=\"span_22\">However, nothing in the Act of 2005 can take away the powers vested in  the\nHigh Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and  of  this  Court  under\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 32.</a>  The finality indicated in <a href=\"/doc/156779/\" id=\"a_77\">Sections 19(6)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/485075/\" id=\"a_78\">19(7)</a>  cannot  be\nconstrued to oust  the  jurisdiction  of  higher  courts,  despite  the  bar\ncreated under <a href=\"/doc/1698308/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 23</a>  of  the  Act.   It  always  has  to  be  read  and\nconstrued subject to the powers of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 226</a>  of  the\nConstitution. Reference in this regard can be made  to  the  decision  of  a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1152518/\" id=\"a_81\">L. Chandra Kumar  vs.  Union\nof India and Ors.</a> [(1997) 3 SCC 261].</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">30.   Exemption from disclosure of information is a  common  provision  that\nappears in both the Acts.  <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 8</a> of both  the  Acts  open  with  a  non-\nobstante language.  It states that  notwithstanding  anything  contained  in\nthe respective Act, there shall be no obligation to  give  any  citizen  the\ninformation specified in the exempted clauses.  It may,  however,  be  noted\nthat <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 8</a> of the Act of 2005 has  a  more  elaborate  exemption  clause\nthan that of the Act of 2002. In addition, the Act  of  2005  also  provides\nthe  Second  Schedule  which  enumerates  the  intelligence   and   security\norganizations established by the Central Government  to  which  the  Act  of\n2005 shall not apply in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1767825/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 24</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">31.   Further, under  the  Act  of  2002,  the  appointment  of  the  Public\nInformation Officers is provided in terms of <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 5</a> and there  exists  no\nprovision  for  constituting  the  Central   and   the   State   Information\nCommission.   Also,  the  Act  does  not  provide  any   qualifications   or\nrequirements to be satisfied before a person can be so  appointed.   On  the\nother hand, in terms of Section 12 and  Section  15  of  the  Act  of  2005,\nspecific provisions have been made to provide for the  constitution  of  and\neligibility for appointment to the Central  Information  Commission  or  the\nState Information Commission, as the case may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">32.   <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 12(5)</a> is a very significant provision under the scheme of  the\nAct of 2005 and we shall deal with it in some elaboration  at  a  subsequent\nstage.  Similarly, the powers and functions of the  Authorities  constituted\nunder the Act of 2005 are conspicuous by their  absence  under  the  Act  of\n2002, which under the Act of 2005 are contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_87\">Section  18</a>.   This\nsection deals  in  great  detail  with  the  powers  and  functions  of  the\nInformation Commissions.  An  elaborate  mechanism  has  been  provided  and\ndefinite powers have been conferred upon the authorities to ensure that  the\nauthorities are able to implement and enforce the provisions of the  Act  of\n2005 adequately.  Another very significant provision which was  non-existent\nin the Act of 2002, is in relation to penalties.  No provision was made  for\nimposition of any penalty in the earlier Act,  while  in  the  Act  of  2005\nsevere punishment like imposition of  fine  upto  Rs.250/-  per  day  during\nwhich the provisions of the Act are violated, has been provided in terms  of\n<a href=\"/doc/291269/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 20(1)</a>.  The Central/State Information Commission can, under  <a href=\"/doc/461811/\" id=\"a_89\">Section\n20(2)</a>,  even  direct  disciplinary  action   against   the   erring   Public\nInformation  Officers.   Further,  the  appropriate   Government   and   the\ncompetent authority have been empowered to frame  rules  under  <a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_90\">Sections  27</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_91\">28</a> of the Act of 2005, respectively, for carrying out the provisions  of\nthe Act.  Every rule made by the Central Government under the Act has to  be\nlaid before each House of the Parliament while it is in session for a  total\nperiod of 30 days, if no specific modifications are made,  the  rules  shall\nthereafter have effect either in the modified form or if  not  annulled,  it\nshall come into force as laid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">33.   Greater transparency,  promotion  of  citizen-government  partnership,\ngreater accountability and reduction in corruption  are  stated  to  be  the\nsalient  features  of  the   Act   of   2005.     Development   and   proper\nimplementation of essential and  constitutionally  protected  laws  such  as\n<a href=\"/doc/137942173/\" id=\"a_92\">Mahatma Gandhi Rural Guarantee Act, 2005</a>,  Right  to  Education  Act,  2009,\netc. are some of the basic objectives of this Act.    Revelation  in  actual\npractice is likely  to  conflict  with  other  public  interests,  including\nefficiency, operation of the  government,  optimum  use  of  limited  fiscal\nresources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive  information.\n It is necessary to harness these  conflicting  interests  while  preserving\nthe parameters of the democratic ideal or the aim with which  this  law  was\nenacted.  It is  certainly  expedient  to  provide  for  furnishing  certain\ninformation to the citizens who desire to have it and there may even  be  an\nobligation of the state authorities to declare such  information  suo  moto.\nHowever,  balancing  of  interests  still  remains  the   most   fundamental\nrequirement of the objective enforcement of the provisions  of  the  Act  of\n2005 and for attainment of the real purpose of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">34.   The Right to Information, like any other right, is  not  an  unlimited\nor unrestricted right.   It  is  subject  to  statutory  and  constitutional\nlimitations.  <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 3</a> of the Act of  2005  clearly  spells  out  that  the\nright to information is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Act.   Other\nprovisions require that information must be held by or under the control  of\npublic authority besides providing for specific exemptions  and  the  fields\nto which  the  provisions  of  the  Act  do  not  apply.   The  doctrine  of\nseverability finds place in the statute in the shape of <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_94\">Section  10</a>  of  the\nAct of 2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">35.   Neither the Act of  2002  nor  the  Act  of  2005,  under  its  repeal\nprovision, repeals the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_95\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>.   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_96\">The Act</a>  of  2005  only\nrepeals the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_97\">Freedom of Information Act, 2002</a> in terms of  <a href=\"/doc/1443302/\" id=\"a_98\">Section  31</a>.    It\nwas felt that under the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_99\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>, the  entire  development\nprocess had been shrouded in secrecy  and  practically  the  public  had  no\nlegal right to know as to what process had been followed  in  designing  the\npolicies affecting them and  how  the  programmes  and  schemes  were  being\nimplemented.   Lack  of  openness  in  the  functioning  of  the  Government\nprovided a fertile ground for growth of inefficiency and corruption  in  the\nworking of the public authorities.   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_100\">The Act</a> of 2005 was intended to  remedy\nthis widespread evil  and  provide  appropriate  links  to  the  government.\nIt was also expected to bring reforms in  the  environmental,  economic  and\nhealth sectors, which were primarily being controlled by the Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">36.   The Central and State Information Commissions have played  a  critical\nrole in enforcing the  provisions  of  the  Act  of  2005,  as  well  as  in\neducating the  information  seekers  and  providers  about  their  statutory\nrights and obligations.   Some section of experts opined  that  the  Act  of\n2005 has been a  useful  statutory  instrument  in  achieving  the  goal  of\nproviding free and effective information to the citizens as enshrined  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.  It is true  that  democratisation  of\ninformation and knowledge resources is  critical  for  people’s  empowerment\nespecially to realise the entitlements as well as to  augment  opportunities\nfor enhancing the options for improving the  quality  of  life.    Still  of\ngreater significance is the inclusion of privacy or  certain  protection  in\nthe process of disclosure, under the right to  information  under  the  Act.\nSometimes, information ought not  to  be  disclosed  in  the  larger  public\ninterest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"909939\" id=\"span_23\">37.   The courts have observed that when the law making power of a State  is\nrestricted by a written fundamental law, then  any  law  enacted,  which  is\nopposed to such fundamental law, being in excess of  fundamental  authority,\nis  a  nullity.   Inequality  is  one  such  example.    Still,   reasonable\nclassification is permissible under the  Indian  Constitution.   Surrounding\ncircumstances  can  be  taken  into  consideration   in   support   of   the\nconstitutionality of the law which is otherwise  hostile  or  discriminatory\nin  nature,  but  the  circumstances  must  be  such  as  to   justify   the\ndiscriminatory  treatment  or  the  classification,  subserving  the  object\nsought to be achieved.  Mere apprehension of the order  being  used  against\nsome  persons  is  no  ground  to  hold  it  illegal   or   unconstitutional\nparticularly  when  its  legality  or   constitutionality   has   not   been\nchallenged.  {Ref. <a href=\"/doc/909939/\" id=\"a_102\">K. Karunakaran v. State of Kerala &amp; Anr.</a>  [(2000)  3  SCC\n761]}.  To raise the plea of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, the element  of\ndiscrimination and arbitrariness has to be brought out in clear terms.   The\nCourts have to keep in mind that  by  the  process  of  classification,  the\nState has the power of determining who should be regarded  as  a  class  for\nthe purposes of legislation and in relation to law enacted on  a  particular\nsubject.  The power, no doubt, to some degree  is  likely  to  produce  some\ninequality but if a law deals with liberties of a number of  individuals  or\nwell defined classes, it is not open  of  the  charge  of  denial  of  equal\nprotection  on  the  ground  that  has  no  application  to  other  persons.\nClassification, thus, means segregation in classes which have  a  systematic\nrelation  usually  found  in  common  properties  and  characteristics.   It\npostulates a rational basis and does not mean herding  together  of  certain\npersons and classes arbitrarily, as already noticed.  The differentia  which\nis the basis of the classification and the object of the  Act  are  distinct\nthings and what is necessary is that there must be  a  nexus  between  them.\nThe basis of  testing  constitutionality,  particularly  on  the  ground  of\ndiscrimination, should not  be  made  by  raising  a  presumption  that  the\nauthorities are acting in an arbitrary manner.   No  classification  can  be\narbitrary.  One of the known concepts of  constitutional  interpretation  is\nthat the legislature cannot be expected to carve  out  classification  which\nmay be scientifically perfect or logically complete  or  which  may  satisfy\nthe  expectations  of  all  concerned.   The  Courts   would   respect   the\nclassification  dictated  by  the  wisdom  of  the  Legislature  and   shall\ninterfere only on being convinced that the classification  would  result  in\npronounced inequality or palpable arbitrariness tested on the touchstone  of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  {Ref.</span> Welfare Association of  Allottees  of\nResidential Premises, Maharashtra v.

The rule of equality or equal  protection  does  not  require  that  a\nState must choose between  attacking  every  aspect  of  a  problem  or  not\nattacking the problem at  all,  and  particularly  with  respect  to  social\nwelfare programme. So long as the line drawn, by  the  State  is  rationally\nsupportable, the  Courts  will  not  interpose  their  judgment  as  to  the\nappropriate stopping point.  A statute is not invalid because it might  have\ngone further than it did, since the  legislature  need  not  strike  at  all\nevils at the same time and may address itself to the phase  of  the  problem\nwhich seemed most acute to the legislative mind.  A classification based  on\nexperience was a reasonable classification,  and  that  it  had  a  rational\nnexus to the object thereof and to hold otherwise would  be  detrimental  to\nthe interest of the service itself.  This opinion was taken  by  this  Court\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/1877922/\" id=\"a_105\">State of UP &amp; Ors. v. J.P. Chaurasia &amp;  Ors.</a>  [(1989)  1  SCC\n121].  Classification on the basis of educational qualifications  made  with\na view to achieve administrative efficiency cannot be said to  rest  on  any\nfortuitous circumstances and one has always to bear in mind  the  facts  and\ncircumstances  of  the  case  in  order  to  judge   the   validity   of   a\nclassification.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1264252\" id=\"span_25\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1264252/\" id=\"a_106\">State of Jammu  &amp;  Kashmir  v.

If the law deals equally with members of a well defined class,  it  is\nnot open to the charge of denial of equal protection.  There  may  be  cases\nwhere even a single individual may be in a class by himself  on  account  of\nsome special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and  not  applicable\nto others.

We  have  noticed  the   challenge   of   the   petitioner   to   the\nconstitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 12(5)</a> and (6) and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 15(5)</a> and (6) of  the\nAct of 2005.   The challenge is made to these provisions  stating  that  the\neligibility  criteria  given  therein  is  vague,  does  not   specify   any\nqualification, and the stated ‘experience’ has no nexus  to  the  object  of\nthe Act.   It is also contended that the classification  contemplated  under\nthe Act is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 14</a>  of  the  Constitution.   The  petitioner\ncontends that the legislative power has been exercised in a manner which  is\nnot in consonance with the  constitutional  principles  and  guarantees  and\nprovides for no proper consultative process  for  appointment.   It  may  be\nnoted that the only distinction between the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_112\">Sections  12(5)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_113\">12(6)</a> on the one hand and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_114\">Sections 15(5)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_115\">15(6)</a>  on  the  other,  is\nthat under <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 12</a>, it is the Central Government  who  has  to  make  the\nappointments in consonance with the  provisions  of  the  Act,  while  under\n<a href=\"/doc/762785/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 15</a>, it is the  State  Government  which  has  to  discharge  similar\nfunctions  as  per  the  specified  parameters.   Thus,  discussion  on  one\nprovision would sufficiently cover the other as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">42.   Sub-Section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 12</a> concerns  itself  with  the  eligibility\ncriteria for appointment to the post of the Chief  Information  Commissioner\nand Information Commissioners to the  Central  Information  Commission.   It\nstates that these authorities shall be persons of eminence  in  public  life\nwith wide knowledge and experience in law, science  and  technology,  social\nservice,  management,  journalism,  mass   media   or   administration   and\ngovernance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">43.    Correspondingly,  Sub-Section  (6)  of  <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_119\">Section  12</a>  states   certain\ndisqualifications for appointment to these  posts.   If  such  person  is  a\nMember of Parliament or Member of the legislature  of  any  State  or  Union\nTerritory or holds  any  other  office  of  profit  or  connected  with  any\npolitical party or carrying on any business or pursuing any  profession,  he\nwould not be eligible for appointment to these posts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">44.   In order to examine the constitutionality of these provisions, let  us\nstate the parameters which would finally help the Court in determining  such\nquestions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_65\">   a)  Whether the law under challenge lacks legislative competence?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">   b)  Whether it violates any Article of  Part  III  of  the  Constitution,\n      particularly, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 14?</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_67\">   c) Whether the prescribed criteria and classification resulting therefrom\n      is discriminatory, arbitrary and has no nexus to  the  object  of  the\n      Act?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">   d) Lastly, whether it a legislative exercise of power  which  is  not  in\n      consonance with the constitutional guarantees  and  does  not  provide\n      adequate guidance to make the law just, fair and reasonable?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">45.   As far as the first issue is concerned,  it  is  a  commonly  conceded\ncase before us that the Act  of  2005  does  not,  in  any  form,  lack  the\nlegislative  competence.    In  other  words,  enacting  such  a  law  falls\nsquarely within the domain of the Indian Parliament and has so been  enacted\nunder Entry 97 (residuary powers) of the Union List. Thus, this  issue  does\nnot require any discussion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">46.   To examine constitutionality of a statute in its correct perspective,\nwe have to bear in mind certain fundamental principles  as  afore-recorded.\nThere is presumption of constitutionality in  favour  of  legislation.  The\nLegislature has the power to carve out a classification which is based upon\nintelligible differentia and has rational nexus to the object of  the  Act.\nThe burden to prove that the enacted law offends any of the Articles  under\nPart  III  of  the  Constitution  is  on  the   one   who   questions   the\nconstitutionality and shows that despite such presumption in favour of  the\nlegislation, it is unfair, unjust and unreasonable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">47.   Another most significant canon of determination of  constitutionality\nis that the courts would be reluctant to declare a  law  invalid  or  ultra\nvires on account  of  unconstitutionality.   The  courts  would  accept  an\ninterpretation which would be in favour of the constitutionality,  than  an\napproach which would render the law unconstitutional.   Declaring  the  law\nunconstitutional is one of the last  resorts  taken  by  the  courts.   The\ncourts would preferably put into service the principle of ‘reading down’ or\n‘reading into’ the provision to make it effective, workable and ensure  the\nattainment of the object of  the  Act.   These  are  the  principles  which\nclearly emerge from the consistent view taken by this court in its  various\npronouncements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">48.    The  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_121\">Section  12(5)</a>  do  not   discuss   the   basic\nqualification needed, but refer to two components: (a) persons of  eminence\nin public life; and (b) with wide knowledge and experience  in  the  fields\nstated in the provision.  The provision, thus, does  not  suffer  from  the\ninfirmity of providing no criteria resulting in  the  introduction  of  the\nelement of arbitrariness or discrimination.   The  provisions  require  the\npersons to be  of  eminence  and  with  knowledge  in  the  stated  fields.\nKnowledge and experience in these fields normally shall be  preceded  by  a\nminimum requisite qualification prescribed in  that  field.   For  example,\nknowledge and experience in the field of law would pre-suppose a person  to\nbe a law graduate.  Similarly, a person with wide knowledge and  experience\nin the field of science and technology would invariably be expected  to  be\nat least a graduate or possess basic qualification in science &amp; technology.\nThe  vagueness  in  the  expression  ‘social  service’,  ‘mass  media’   or\n‘administration and governance’ does create some  doubt.   But,  certainly,\nthis vagueness or doubt does not introduce the element of discrimination in\nthe provision. The persons from these various walks of life are  considered\neligible for appointment to the post of Chief Information Commissioner  and\nInformation Commissioners in the respective Information Commissions.   This\ngives a wide zone of consideration and this alleged vagueness can always be\nclarified by the appropriate government in exercise  of  its  powers  under\n<a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_123\">28</a> of the Act, respectively.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">Constitutional Validity of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 12(6)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">49.   Similarly, as stated above, sub-Section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 12</a> creates  in\na way a disqualification in terms thereof.  This  provision  does  have  an\nelement of uncertainty and indefiniteness.  Upon its  proper  construction,\nan issue as to what class of persons are eligible to be appointed to  these\nposts, would unexceptionally arise.   According to this provision, a person\nto be appointed to these posts ought not  to  have  been  carrying  on  any\nbusiness or pursuing any profession.  It  is  difficult  to  say  what  the\nperson eligible under the provision should be doing and  for  what  period.\nThe section does not specify any such period.   Normally, the persons would\nfall  under  one  or  the  other  unacceptable  categories.    To  put   it\ndifferently, by necessary implication, it excludes practically all  classes\nwhile not specifying as to  which  class  of  persons  is  eligible  to  be\nappointed to that post. The exclusion is  too  vague,  while  inclusion  is\nuncertain.  It creates a situation of confusion which could not  have  been\nthe intent of law.  It is also not clear  as  to  what  classification  the\nframers of the Act intended to  lay  down.   The  classification  does  not\nappear to have any  nexus  with  the  object  of  the  Act.   There  is  no\nintelligible differentia to support such classification.   Which  class  is\nintended to be protected  and  is  to  be  made  exclusively  eligible  for\nappointment in terms of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_126\">Sections 12(5)</a> and (6) is  something  that  is  not\nunderstandable.  Wherever, the Legislature wishes to exercise its power  of\nclassification, there it has to be a reasonable classification,  satisfying\nthe tests discussed above.  No Rules have been brought to our notice  which\neven intend to  explain  the  vagueness  and  inequality  explicit  in  the\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 12(6)</a>.  According to the petitioner, it tantamounts  to\nan absolute bar because the legislature cannot be stated to  have  intended\nthat only the persons who are ideal within the terms of Sub-section (6)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 12</a>, would be eligible to be appointed to the post.  If we read  the\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_129\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_130\">12(6)</a> together, the  provisions  under  sub-\nSection (6) appear to be in conflict with those under sub-Section (5).  Sub-\nSection (5) requires the person to have eminence in public  life  and  wide\nknowledge and experience in the specified field.   On  the  contrary,  sub-\nSection (6) requires that the person should not hold any office of  profit,\nbe connected with any political party or carry on any  business  or  pursue\nany profession.  The object of sub-section (5) stands partly frustrated  by\nthe language of sub-Section (6).  In other  words,  sub-section  (6)  lacks\nclarity, reasonable classification and has no nexus to the  object  of  the\nAct of 2005 and if construed on its plain  language,  it  would  result  in\ndefeating the provisions of sub-Section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 12</a> to some extent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">50.   The legislature is required to exercise its power in conformity  with\nthe constitutional mandate, particularly  contained  in  Part  III  of  the\nConstitution.  If the impugned provision denies equality and the  right  of\nequal consideration, without reasonable classification, the courts would be\nbound to declare it invalid.  <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 12(6)</a> does not speak of the class  of\neligible persons, but practically debars all persons from  being  appointed\nto the post of Chief Information Commissioner or Information  Commissioners\nat the Centre and State levels, respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">51.   It will be difficult for the Court to comprehend as to which class  of\npersons is  intended  to  be  covered  under  this  clause.    The  rule  of\ndisqualification has to be  construed  strictly.    If  anyone,  who  is  an\nelected representative, in Government service, or  one  who  is  holding  an\noffice of profit, carrying on any business or profession, is  ineligible  in\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 12(6)</a>, then  the  question  arises  as  to  what  class  of\npersons would be eligible?  The Section is silent on that behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">52.   The element of arbitrariness and discrimination is evidenced  by  the\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 12(6)</a> itself, which can be examined from another  point\nof view.  No period has been stated for which the person is expected to not\nhave carried on any business or pursued any profession.  It  could  be  one\nday or even years prior to his nomination.  It is not clear as to  how  the\npersons falling in either of these classes can be stated to be  differently\nplaced.   This  uncertainty  is  bound  to  bring   in   the   element   of\ndiscrimination and arbitrariness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">53.   Having noticed the presence of  the  element  of  discrimination  and\narbitrariness in the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 12(6)</a> of the Act, we now have to\nexamine whether this Court should declare this provision  ultra  vires  the\nConstitution or read it down to give it its possible  effect,  despite  the\ndrawbacks noted above. We have already noticed that the Court will normally\nadopt an approach which is tilted in favour of constitutionality and  would\nprefer reading down the provision,  if  necessary,  by  adding  some  words\nrather than declaring it  unconstitutional.    Thus,  we  would  prefer  to\ninterpret the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 12(6)</a>  as  applicable  post-appointment\nrather than pre-appointment  of  the  Chief  Information  Commissioner  and\nInformation Commissioners.   In other words, these  disqualifications  will\nonly come into play  once  a  person  is  appointed  as  Chief  Information\nCommissioner/ Information Commissioner at any level and he  will  cease  to\nhold any office of profit or carry any business or  pursue  any  profession\nthat he did prior to such  appointment.    It  is  thus  implicit  in  this\nprovision that a person cannot hold any of  the  posts  specified  in  sub-\nsection (6)  of  <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_137\">Section  12</a>  simultaneous  to  his  appointment  as  Chief\nInformation Commissioner or Information Commissioner.    In fact, cessation\nof  his  previous  appointment,  business  or  profession  is  a  condition\nprecedent to the commencement  of  his  appointment  as  Chief  Information\nCommissioner or Information Commissioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">Constitutional Validity of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 12(5)</a>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">54.   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_139\">The Act</a> of 2005 was enacted to  harmonise  the  conflicting  interests\nwhile preserving the paramountcy of the democratic  ideal  and  provide  for\nfurnishing of certain information to the citizens who  desire  to  have  it.\nThe basic purpose of the Act is to set up a practical  regime  of  right  to\ninformation for the citizens to secure  and  access  information  under  the\ncontrol of the public authorities. The intention is to provide  and  promote\ntransparency and accountability  in  the  functioning  of  the  authorities.\nThis right  of  the  public  to  be  informed  of  the  various  aspects  of\ngovernance by the State is a pre-requisite of the  democratic  value.    The\nright to privacy too, is to be protected as both these rival interests  find\ntheir origin under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. This brings in  the\nneed for an effective adjudicatory process. The authority or  tribunals  are\nassigned  the  responsibility  of  determining  the  rival  contentions  and\ndrawing a balance between the two conflicting  interests.    That  is  where\nthe scheme, purpose and the  object  of  the  Act  of  2005  attain  greater\nsignificance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">55.   In order to examine whether <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act suffers from  the\nvice of discrimination  or  inequality,  we  may  discuss  the  adjudicatory\nfunctions of the authorities under the Act in the backdrop of the scheme  of\nthe Act of 2005, as discussed above. The authorities  who  have  to  perform\nadjudicatory functions of quasi-judicial content are:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     1. The Central/State Public Information Officer;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">     2. Officers senior in rank to  the  Central/State  Public  Information\n        Officer to whom an appeal would lie under <a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 19(1)</a> of the Act;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">        and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">     3. The Information  Commission  (Central/State)  consisting  of  Chief\n        Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">56.   In terms of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 12(5)</a>,  the  Chief  Information  Commissioner  and\nInformation Commissioners should be the persons of eminence in  public  life\nwith wide knowledge in the prescribed fields.   We  have  already  indicated\nthat the terminology used  by  the  legislature,  such  as  ‘mass-media’  or\n‘administration  and  governance’,  are  terms  of   uncertain   tenor   and\namplitude.   It is somewhat difficult to state with exactitude  as  to  what\nclass of persons would be eligible under these categories.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">57.   The legislature in its wisdom has chosen not to provide  any  specific\nqualification, but has primarily prescribed ‘wide knowledge and  experience’\nin the cited subjects as the criteria for selection.   It  is  not  for  the\ncourts to spell out what ought to be the qualifications  or  experience  for\nappointment to a  particular  post.    Suffices  it  to  say,  that  if  the\nlegislature  itself  provides  ‘knowledge  and  experience’  as  the   basic\ncriteria of eligibility for appointment, this per se, would not attract  the\nrigors of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  On  a  reasonable  and  purposive\ninterpretation, it will be appropriate to interpret and  read  into  <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_145\">Section\n12(5)</a> that the ‘knowledge and experience’ in a particular subject  would  be\ndeemed to include the basic qualification in that subject.  We would  prefer\nsuch an approach than to hold it to  be  violative  of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_146\">Article  14</a>  of  the\nConstitution. <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 12(5)</a>  has  inbuilt  guidelines  to  the  effect  that\nknowledge and experience, being two distinct concepts, should  be  construed\nin their correct perspective.  This would include  the  basic  qualification\nas well as an experience in  the  respective  field,  both  being  the  pre-\nrequisites for this section. Ambiguity, if any, resulting from the  language\nof the provision is insignificant, being merely linguistic  in  nature  and,\nas already noticed, the same  is  capable  of  being  clarified  by  framing\nappropriate rules in exercise of powers  of  the  Central  Government  under\n<a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 27</a> of the Act of 2005.  We are unable to find  that  the  provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 12(5)</a> suffer from the vice of  arbitrariness  or  discrimination.\nHowever,  without  hesitation,  we  would  hasten  to   add   that   certain\nrequirements of law and procedure would have to be read into this  provision\nto sustain its constitutionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">58.   It is a settled principle of law,  as  stated  earlier,  that  courts\nwould generally adopt an interpretation which is favourable  to  and  tilts\ntowards the constitutionality of a statute, with the aid of the  principles\nlike ‘reading into’  and/or  ‘reading down’  the  relevant  provisions,  as\nopposed to declaring a provision unconstitutional.   The  courts  can  also\nbridge the gaps that have been left by the legislature  inadvertently.   We\nare of the considered view that both these principles have  to  be  applied\nwhile  interpreting  <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_150\">Section  12(5)</a>.   It  is  the  application  of   these\nprinciples that would render the provision constitutional and  not  opposed\nto the doctrine of equality.  Rather the application of the provision would\nbecome more effective.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">59.   Certainty to vague  expressions,  like  ‘social  service’  and  ‘mass\nmedia’, can be provided under the provisions which  are  capable  of  being\nexplained  by  framing  of  proper  rules  or  even  by  way  of   judicial\npronouncements.  In order to examine the scope of this  provision  and  its\nramifications on the other parts of the Act of 2005,  it  is  important  to\nrefer back to the scheme of the Act.  Under  the  provisions  of  the  Act,\nparticularly, <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_151\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_152\">12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_153\">18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_154\">19</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_155\">20</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_156\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1698308/\" id=\"a_157\">23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1493194/\" id=\"a_158\">25</a>, it is  clear  that\nthe Central or State Information Commission, as the case may be,  not  only\nexercises adjudicatory powers of a nature  no  different  than  a  judicial\ntribunal but  is  vested  with  the  powers  of  a  civil  court  as  well.\nTherefore, it is required to decide a lis, where information is required by\na person and its furnishing is contested  by  the  other.   The  Commission\nexercises two kinds of penal powers: firstly, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/291269/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 20(1)</a>, it\ncan impose penalty upon the defaulters or violators of  the  provisions  of\nthe Act and, secondly, <a href=\"/doc/461811/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 20(2)</a> empowers the  Central  and  the  State\nInformation Commission to conduct  an  enquiry  and  direct  the  concerned\ndisciplinary authority  to  take  appropriate  action  against  the  erring\nofficer in accordance with law.  Hence, the Commission has powers  to  pass\norders having civil as  well  as  penal  consequences.  Besides  this,  the\nCommission has been given monitoring and recommendatory powers.   In  terms\nof <a href=\"/doc/1698308/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 23</a>, the jurisdiction of Civil Courts has been expressly  barred.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">60.   Now, let us take an  overview  of  the  nature  and  content  of  the\ndisputes arising before such Commission.   Before  the  Public  Information\nOfficers, the controversy may  fall  within  a  narrow  compass.   But  the\nquestion  before  the  First  Appellate  Authority  and  particularly,  the\nInformation Commissioners (Members of the Commission) are of a  very  vital\nnature.  The impact of such adjudication, instead of being  tilted  towards\nadministrative adjudication  is  specifically  oriented  and  akin  to  the\njudicial  determinative  process.   Application  of  mind  and  passing  of\nreasoned orders are inbuilt into the scheme of the Act of 2005.   In  fact,\nthe provisions of the Act are specific in that regard.  While applying  its\nmind, it has to dwell upon the issues of legal essence and effect.  Besides\nresolving and balancing the conflict between the  ‘right  to  privacy’  and\n‘right to information’, the Commission has to  specifically  determine  and\nreturn a finding as to whether the case falls under any of  the  exceptions\nunder <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 8</a> or relates to any of the  organizations  specified  in  the\nSecond Schedule, to which the Act does not apply in terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/1767825/\" id=\"a_163\">Section  24</a>.\nAnother significant adjudicatory function to be performed by the Commission\nis where interest of a third party is involved.  The legislative intent  in\nthis regard is demonstrated by the language of <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 11</a>  of  the  Act  of\n2005.  A third party is not only entitled to a notice, but is also entitled\nto hearing with a specific right to raise objections  in  relation  to  the\ndisclosure of information.  Such functions, by no stretch  of  imagination,\ncan be termed as ‘administrative decision’ but are clearly in the domain of\n‘judicial determination’ in accordance with the rule of law and  provisions\nof the Act.  Before we proceed  to  discuss  this  aspect  in  any  further\nelaboration, let us examine the status  of  such  Tribunal/Commissions  and\ntheir functions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">B) TRIBUNAL/COMMISSIONS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">61.   Before dwelling upon determination of nature of  Tribunals  in  India,\nit is worthwhile to take a brief account of the scenario prevalent  in  some\nother jurisdictions of the world.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">62.   In United Kingdom, efforts have been made for improvising  the  system\nfor administration of justice.  The  United  Kingdom  has  a  growing  human\nrights jurisprudence, following the  enactment  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_165\">Human  Rights  Act,\n1998</a>, and it has a well-established ombudsman system.   The  Tribunals  have\nbeen constituted to provide specialised adjudication, alongside the  courts,\nto the citizens dissatisfied from the directives  made  by  the  Information\nCommissioners under either of  these  statutes.   The  Tribunals,  important\ncogs in the machinery of administration of justice, have recently  undergone\nsome  major  reforms.   A  serious  controversy  was  raised   whether   the\nfunctioning of these Tribunals was more akin to the  Government  functioning\nor were they a part  of  the  Court-attached  system  of  administration  of\njustice.  The  Donoughmore  Committee  had  used   the   term   ‘ministerial\ntribunals’,  and  had  regarded  them  as   part   of   the   machinery   of\nadministration.  The Franks Report saw their role quite differently:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           “Tribunals  are  not  ordinary  courts,  but  neither  are  they\n           appendages of Government  Departments.   Much  of  the  official\n           evidence… appeared to reflect the  view  that  tribunals  should\n           properly be regarded as part of the machinery of administration,\n           for which the Government must  retain  a  close  and  continuing\n           responsibility.  Thus, for  example,  tribunals  in  the  social\n           services  field  would  be   regarded   as   adjuncts   to   the\n           administration of the services themselves.   We  do  not  accept\n           this view.   We  consider  that  tribunals  should  properly  be\n           regarded as machinery provided by  Parliament  for  adjudication\n           rather than as part of the  machinery  of  administration.   The\n           essential point is  that  in  all  these  cases  Parliament  has\n           deliberately provided for a decision outside and independent  of\n           the Department concerned,  either  at  first  instance….  or  on\n           appeal from a decision of a Minister or  of  an  official  in  a\n           special statutory position….Although the  relevant  statutes  do\n           not in all cases expressly enact that tribunals are  to  consist\n           entirely of persons outside the Government service, the  use  of\n           the  term  ‘tribunal’  in  legislation  undoubtedly  bears  this\n           connotation, and the intention of the Parliament to provide  for\n           the independence of tribunals is clear and unmistakable.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">63.    Franks  recommended  that  tribunal  chairmen   should   be   legally\nqualified.  This was implemented in respect of some categories of  tribunal,\nbut not others.  But one of the most interesting  issues  arising  from  the\nFranks exercise is the extent to which the identification  of  tribunals  as\npart of the machinery of adjudication  led  the  Committee,  in  making  its\nspecific recommendations, down the road of  increased  legal  formality  and\njudicialisation.    (Refer  :  “The  Judicialisation   of   ‘Administrative’\nTribunals in the UK : from Hewart to Leggatt” by Gavin Drewry).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">64.   In the United Kingdom, the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act,\n2007 (for short, the ‘TCEA’) explicitly confirmed  the  status  of  Tribunal\nJudges (as the legally qualified members of the Tribunals  are  now  called)\nas part of the independent judicial  system,  extending  to  them  the  same\nguarantees of independence as apply to the judges in the ordinary courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">65.   From the analysis  of  the  above  system  of  administrative  justice\nprevalent in United Kingdom, a very subtle and clear distinction from  other\nlaws is noticeable in as much as the sensitive personal data  and  right  of\nprivacy of an individual is assured a greater  protection  and  any  request\nfor access to such information firstly, is subject to the provisions of  the\nAct and secondly, the members of the Tribunals, who hear the appeals from  a\nrejection of request for information by the Information Commissioners  under\nthe  provisions  of  either  of  these  Acts,  include   persons   qualified\njudicially and having requisite experience as Judges in the regular courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">66.   In United States of America, the  statute  governing  the  subject  is\n‘<a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_166\">Freedom of Information Act, 1966</a>’ (for short, the  ‘FOIA’).   This  statute\nrequires each ‘agency’ to furnish the requisite information  to  the  person\ndemanding such information, subject to the  limitations  and  provisions  of\nthe  Act.   Each  agency  is  required  to  frame  rules.    A   complainant\ndissatisfied  from  non-furnishing  of  the  information  can  approach  the\ndistrict  courts  of  the  United  States  in  the  district  in  which  the\ncomplainant resides or the place in which the agency records  are  situated.\nSuch complaints are to be dealt with as per  the  procedure  prescribed  and\nwithin the time specified under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">67.   In New South Wales,  under  the  Privacy  and  Government  Information\nLegislation  Amendment  Bill,  2010,  amendments  were  made  to  both,  the\nGovernment Information (Public  Access)  Act,  2009  and  the  Personal  and\nPrivacy Information Act, 1998, to bring  the  Information  Commissioner  and\nthe Privacy Commissioner together within a single office.  This led  to  the\nestablishment of the Information and Privacy Commission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">68.   On  somewhat  similar  lines  is  the  law  prevalent  in  some  other\njurisdictions including Australia and Germany, where there exists a  unified\noffice of Information and Privacy Commissioner.  In Australia,  the  Privacy\nCommissioner was integrated into the office of  the  Australian  Information\nCommissioner in the year 2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">69.   In most of the international  jurisdictions,  the  Commission  or  the\nTribunals have been treated to be part  of  the  court  attached  system  of\nadministration of justice and as said  by  the  Donoughmore  Committee,  the\n‘ministerial tribunals’ were different and they were  regarded  as  part  of\nmachinery  of  the  administration.   The   persons   appointed   to   these\nCommissions were persons of legal background  having  legally  trained  mind\nand judicial experience.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">       a)  NATURE OF FUNCTION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">70.   The Information Commission, as a  body,  performs  functions  of  wide\nmagnitude, through its members, including adjudicatory, supervisory as  well\nas penal functions.  Access to  information  is  a  statutory  right.   This\nright,  as  indicated  above,  is  subject  to  certain  constitutional  and\nstatutory  limitations.   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_167\">The  Act</a>  of  2005  itself  spells  out   exempted\ninformation as well as the areas where the Act would  be  inoperative.   The\nCentral and State Information Commissioners have been vested with the  power\nto decline furnishing of an information under certain circumstances  and  in\nthe specified situations.  For disclosure  of  Information,  which  involves\nthe question of prejudice to a  third  party,  the  concerned  authority  is\nrequired to issue notice to the third party who can  make  a  representation\nand such  representation  is  to  be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  the\nprovisions of the Act of 2005.  This position of law in India  is  in  clear\ncontrast to the law prevailing in some  other  countries  where  information\ninvolving a third party cannot be disclosed without consent of  that  party.\nHowever, the authority  can  direct  such  disclosure,  for  reasons  to  be\nrecorded, stating that the public interest outweighs the  private  interest.\nThus, it involves an adjudicatory process where parties are required  to  be\nheard, appropriate directions are to be issued, the orders are  required  to\nbe passed upon due application of mind and for valid reasons.  The  exercise\nof powers and passing of the orders by the authorities concerned  under  the\nprovisions of the Act of  2005  cannot  be  arbitrary.   It  has  to  be  in\nconsonance with the principles of natural justice and the procedure  evolved\nby such authority.  Natural justice has three  indispensable  facets,  i.e.,\ngrant of notice, grant of  hearing  and  passing  of  reasoned  orders.   It\ncannot be disputed that the authorities  under  the  Act  of  2005  and  the\nTribunals are discharging quasi-judicial functions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">71.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1158072\" id=\"span_27\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1158072/\" id=\"a_168\">Indian National Congress (I)  v.  Institute  of  Social\nWelfare &amp; Ors.</a> [(2002) 5 SCC 685], the Court explained that where there  are\ntwo or  more  parties  contesting  each  other’s  claim  and  the  statutory\nauthority is required to adjudicate the rival claims  between  the  parties,\nsuch a statutory  authority  can  be  held  to  be  quasi-judicial  and  the\ndecision rendered by it as a quasi judicial order.  Thus, where there  is  a\nlis between the two  contesting  parties  and  the  statutory  authority  is\nrequired to decide such a dispute, in absence of any other attributes  of  a\nquasi-judicial authority, such a statutory  authority  is  a  quasi-judicial\nauthority.  The legal principles which emerge  from  the  various  judgments\nlaying down when an act of a statutory authority would be  a  quasi-judicial\nact are that where (a) a statutory authority empowered under  a  statute  to\ndo any act (b) which would prejudicially affect  the  subject  (c)  although\nthere is no lis or two contending parties and the  contest  is  between  the\nauthority and the subject and (d) the statutory  authority  is  required  to\nact judicially under the statute, the decision  of  the  said  authority  is\nquasi-judicial.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">72.   In other words, an authority is described as quasi  judicial  when  it\nhas some attributes or trappings of judicial provisions  but  not  all.   In\nthe matter before us, there is a  lis.   The  request  of  a  party  seeking\ninformation is allowed  or  disallowed  by  the  authorities  below  and  is\ncontested by both parties before the Commission.  There may  also  be  cases\nwhere  a  third  party  is  prejudicially  affected  by  disclosure  of  the\ninformation requested for.  It  is  clear  that  the  concerned  authorities\nparticularly the Information Commission, possess  the  essential  attributes\nand trappings of a Court.  Its powers and functions, as  defined  under  the\nAct of 2005 also sufficiently  indicate  that  it  has  adjudicatory  powers\nquite  akin  to  the  Court  system.  They  adjudicate  matters  of  serious\nconsequences.  The Commission may be called  upon  to  decide  how  far  the\nright to information is affected where information sought for is  denied  or\nwhether the information asked for is ‘exempted’ or impinges upon the  ‘right\nto privacy’ or where it falls in the ‘no go area’ of  applicability  of  the\nAct.  It is not mandatory for the authorities  to  allow  all  requests  for\ninformation in a routine manner.  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_169\">The Act</a>  of  2005  imposes  an  obligation\nupon the authorities to examine each matter seriously being  fully  cautious\nof its consequences and effects on the  rights  of  others.   It  may  be  a\nsimple query for information but can have  far  reaching  consequences  upon\nthe right of a third party  or  an  individual  with  regard  to  whom  such\ninformation is sought.  Undue  inroad  into  the  right  to  privacy  of  an\nindividual which is protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_170\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of  India\nor any other law in force would not be permissible. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_28\">In <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_171\">Gobind  v.  State  of\nMadhya Pradesh &amp; Anr.</a> [(1975) 2 SCC  148]  this  Court  held  that  privacy-\ndignity claims deserve to be examined with care and to be denied  only  when\nan important countervailing  interest  is  shown  to  be  superior.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_29\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_172\">Ram\nJethmalani &amp; Ors. v. Union  of  India</a>  [(2011)  8  SCC  1]  this  Court  has\nobserved that the right to privacy is an  integral  part  of  the  right  to\nlife. Thus, the decision making process by these authorities is  not  merely\nof an administrative nature.  The functions of these  authorities  are  more\naligned towards the judicial  functions  of  the  courts  rather  than  mere\nadministrative acts of the State authority.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">73.   ‘Quasi judicial’ is a term which may not always be  used  with  utmost\nclarity and precision.  An authority which exercises judicial  functions  or\nfunctions analogous to the judicial authorities would normally be termed  as\n‘quasi-judicial’.  In the ‘Advanced Law Lexicon’  (3rd  Edn.,  2005)  by  P.\nRamanathan Aiyar, the expression ‘quasi judicial’ is explained as under :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           “Of, relating to, or involving an  executive  or  administrative\n           official’s adjudicative acts.  Quasi-judicial  acts,  which  are\n           valid if there is no abuse of discretion,  often  determine  the\n           fundamental rights of citizens.  They are subject to  review  by\n           Courts. (Blacm, 7th Edn., 1999)\n\n\n           ‘Quasi-judicial is a term that is …. Not easily  definable.   In\n           the United States, the phrase often  covers  judicial  decisions\n           taken by an administrative agency – the test is  the  nature  of\n           the tribunal rather than what it is doing.   In  England  quasi-\n           judicial belongs to the administrative category and is  used  to\n           cover situations where the administrator is bound by the law  to\n           observe certain forms and possibly hold  a  public  hearing  but\n           where he is a free agent in reaching the final decision.  If the\n           rules are broken, the determination may be set aside, but it  is\n           not sufficient to show that  the  administration  is  biased  in\n           favour of a certain policy, or that the  evidence  points  to  a\n           different conclusion..’ (George Whitecross Paton, A Textbook  of\n           Jurisprudence 336 (G.W.

This Court in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh  &amp;  Ors.  v.  Raja\nMahendra Pal &amp; Anr. [1995 Supp  (2)  SCC  731],  held  that  the  expression\n‘quasi judicial’ has been termed to be one which stands  midway  a  judicial\nand an administrative function.  If the authority has any express  statutory\nduty to act judicially in arriving at the decision in question, it would  be\ndeemed to be quasi-judicial.  Where the function to determine a  dispute  is\nexercised by virtue of an executive discretion rather than  the  application\nof law, it is a quasi-judicial  function.   A  quasi-judicial  act  requires\nthat a decision is to be given not arbitrarily or in mere discretion of  the\nauthority but according to the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  as\ndetermined  upon  an  enquiry  held  by  the  authority  after   giving   an\nopportunity to the affected parties of being heard or wherever necessary  of\nleading evidence in support of their  contention.   The  authority  and  the\nTribunal constituted under the provisions of the Act of 2005  are  certainly\nquasi-judicial authority/tribunal performing judicial functions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\">75.   Under the scheme of the Act of 2005, in  terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_174\">Section  5</a>,  every\npublic authority, both in the State and the Centre, is required to  nominate\nPublic Information Officers to effectuate and make the right to  information\na more effective right by furnishing the information asked  for  under  this\nAct.  The Information Officer can even refuse to provide  such  information,\nwhich order is appealable  under  <a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_175\">Section  19(1)</a>  to  the  nominated  senior\nofficer, who is required to hear  the  parties  and  decide  the  matter  in\naccordance with law.  This is a first appeal.  Against  the  order  of  this\nappellate authority, a second  appeal  lies  with  the  Central  Information\nCommission or the State Information Commission,  as  the  case  may  be,  in\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1852611/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 19(3)</a> of the Act of 2005.  The Legislature, in its  wisdom,\nhas provided for two appeals.   Higher the adjudicatory  forum,  greater  is\nthe requirement of adherence to the rule of judiciousness, fairness  and  to\nact in accordance with the procedure prescribed and in absence of  any  such\nprescribed procedure, to act in consonance with the  principles  of  natural\njustice.  Higher also is the public expectation from  such  tribunal.    The\nadjudicatory functions performed by these bodies are of  a  serious  nature.\nAn order passed by the Commission is final  and  binding  and  can  only  be\nquestioned before the High Court or the Supreme Court  in  exercise  of  the\nCourt’s  jurisdiction  under  <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_177\">Article  226</a>  and/or   <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_178\">Article   32</a>   of   the\nConstitution, respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">76.   If one analyses the scheme of the Act of 2005  and  the  multi-farious\nfunctions that the Information Commission is expected to  discharge  in  its\nfunctioning, following features become evident :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">1.    It has a lis pending before it  which  it  decides.    ‘Lis’,  as  per\n       Black’s Law Dictionary (8th Edition) means ‘a piece of litigation;  a\n       controversy or a dispute’.   One  party  asserting  the  right  to  a\n       particular information, the other party  denying  the  same  or  even\n       contesting that it was invasion into his protected right  gives  rise\n       to a lis which has to be adjudicated by the Commission in  accordance\n       with law and, thus, cannot be  termed  as  ‘administrative  function’\n       simpliciter.  It,  therefore,  becomes  evident  that  the  appellate\n       authority and the Commission  deal  with  lis  in  the  sense  it  is\n       understood in the legal parlance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">2.     It  performs  adjudicatory  functions  and  is  required   to   grant\n       opportunity of hearing to the affected party and  to  record  reasons\n       for its orders.  The orders of the  Public  Information  Officer  are\n       appealable to first  appellate  authority  and  those  of  the  First\n       Appellate Authority are appealable  to  the  Information  Commission,\n       which are then open to challenge before the Supreme Court or the High\n       Court in exercise of its extraordinary power of judicial review.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">3.     It  is  an  adjudicatory   process   not   akin   to   administrative\n       determination of disputes but  similar  in  nature  to  the  judicial\n       process of determination.  The concerned  authority  is  expected  to\n       decide not only whether  the  case  was  covered  under  any  of  the\n       exceptions or related to any of the organizations to which the Act of\n       2005 does not apply, but even to determine, by applying the legal and\n       constitutional provisions, whether  the  exercise  of  the  right  to\n       information amounted to invasion into the right  to  privacy.    This\n       being a very fine distinction of law, application of legal principles\n       in such cases becomes very significant.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">4.    The concerned authority exercises penal powers and can impose  penalty\n       upon the defaulters as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 20</a> of  the  Act  of\n       2005.   It has to perform investigative and supervisory functions. It\n       is expected to act in  consonance  with  the  principles  of  natural\n       justice as well as those applicable  to  service  law  jurisprudence,\n       before it can make a report and recommend disciplinary action against\n       the defaulters, including the persons in service in terms of  <a href=\"/doc/461811/\" id=\"a_180\">Section\n       20(2)</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">5.     The  functioning  of  the  Commission  is  quite  in  line  with  the\n       functioning of the civil courts and it has even expressly been vested\n       with limited powers of the civil Court.   Exercise  of  these  powers\n       and discharge of the functions  discussed  above  not  only  gives  a\n       colour  of  judicial  and/or  quasi-judicial  functioning  to   these\n       authorities  but  also  vests  the  Commission  with  the   essential\n       trappings of a civil Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">77.   Let us now examine some other pre-requisites of vital significance  in\nthe functioning of the Commission.  In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 22</a> of this Act,  the\nprovisions of the Act are to be given effect  to,  notwithstanding  anything\ninconsistent therewith contained in the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_182\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>  and  any\nother law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect  by\nvirtue of any law other than this Act.  <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_183\">This Act</a> is, therefore,  to  prevail\nover the specified Acts and even instruments. The same, however, is only  to\nthe  extent  of  any  inconsistency  between  the  two.   Thus,  where   the\nprovisions of any  other  law  can  be  applied  harmoniously,  without  any\nconflict, the question of repugnancy would not arise.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">78.    Further,  Section  23  is  a  provision  relating  to  exclusion   of\njurisdiction of the Courts.  In  terms  of  this  Section,  no  Court  shall\nentertain any suit, application or  other  proceedings  in  respect  of  any\norder made under this Act and no such order  shall  be  called  in  question\notherwise than by way of an appeal provided for under this Act.    In  other\nwords, the jurisdiction of the Court has been ousted  by  express  language.\nNevertheless, it is a settled principle of law that despite  such  excluding\nprovision, the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court and the  Supreme\nCourt, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_184\">Articles 226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_185\">32</a> of  the  Constitution,  respectively,\ncannot be divested.  It is a  jurisdiction  incapable  of  being  eroded  or\ntaken away by exercise of legislative power, being  an  important  facet  of\nthe basic structure of the Constitution.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1152518\" id=\"span_31\">In the case of  <a href=\"/doc/1152518/\" id=\"a_186\">L.

They  can,  however,  perform  a\nsupplemental role.  Thus, all decisions of the Tribunals  were  held  to  be\nsubject to scrutiny before the High  Court  under  Article  226/227  of  the\nConstitution.  Therefore, the orders passed  by  the  authority,  i.e.,  the\nCentral or the State Information Commissions under the  Act  of  2005  would\nundoubtedly be subject to judicial review of the High  Court  under  Article\n226/227 of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">79.   <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 24</a> of the Act of 2005 empowers the Central Government to  make\namendments to the Second Schedule specifying such  organization  established\nby  the  Government  to  which  the  Act  of  2005  would  not  apply.

Further, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1152518/\" id=\"a_194\">L.

The Court held as under :</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">           “88.

What is needed in a tribunal, which is intended  to\n           supplant the High Court, is legal training and  experience,  and\n           judicial acumen, equipment and approach. When such a tribunal is\n           composed of personnel drawn from the judiciary as well  as  from\n           services or from amongst experts in the field, any weightage  in\n           favour of the service  members  or  expert  members  and  value-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"359668\" id=\"span_35\">discounting the judicial members would render the tribunal  less\n           effective and efficacious than the High Court. <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_196\">The  Act</a>  setting\n           up such a tribunal would itself have  to  be  declared  as  void\n           under such circumstances. The same would not at all be conducive\n           to  judicial  independence  and  may  even  tend,  directly   or\n           indirectly,  to   influence   their   decision-making   process,\n           especially when the Government is a  litigant  in  most  of  the\n           cases coming before such tribunal. (See <a href=\"/doc/359668/\" id=\"a_197\">S.P.  Sampath  Kumar  v.\n           Union of India</a>.) The protagonists of specialist  tribunals,  who\n           simultaneously with their establishment want  exclusion  of  the\n           writ jurisdiction of  the  High  Courts  in  regard  to  matters\n           entrusted for adjudication  to  such  tribunals,  ought  not  to\n           overlook these vital and  important  aspects.  It  must  not  be\n           forgotten that what is permissible to be supplanted  by  another\n           equally effective and efficacious institutional mechanism is the\n           High Courts and not the judicial review  itself.  Tribunals  are\n           not an end in themselves but a means to  an  end;  even  if  the\n           laudable objectives of speedy justice, uniformity  of  approach,\n           predictability of decisions and specialist  justice  are  to  be\n           achieved, the framework of the tribunal intended to be set up to\n           attain them must still retain its basic judicial  character  and\n           inspire public confidence. Any  scheme  of  decentralisation  of\n           administration  of  justice   providing   for   an   alternative\n           institutional mechanism in substitution of the High Courts  must\n           pass the aforesaid test in order to be constitutionally valid.”</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">82.   In India, the Central or the  State  Information  Commission,  as  the\ncase may be,  is  vested  with  dual  jurisdiction.   It  is  the  appellate\nauthority against the orders passed by the first  appellate  authority,  the\nInformation Officer, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 19(1)</a> of the  Act  of  2005,  while\nadditionally it is also a supervisory and investigative authority  in  terms\nof <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 18</a> of the Act wherein it is empowered to hear complaints  by  any\nperson against the inaction,  delayed  action  or  other  grounds  specified\nunder Section  18(1)  against  any  State  and  Central  Public  Information\nOfficer.  This inquiry is to be conducted in accordance with the  prescribed\nprocedure and by exercising the powers conferred on it under Section  18(3).\n It has to record its satisfaction that there exist  reasonable  grounds  to\nenquire into the matter.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">83.   Section 20 is the penal provision.  It empowers  the  Central  or  the\nState Information Commission to impose  penalty  as  well  as  to  recommend\ndisciplinary action against such Public Information  Officers  who,  in  its\nopinion, have committed any acts or omissions  specified  in  this  section,\nwithout any reasonable cause.  The above  provisions  demonstrate  that  the\nfunctioning of the Commission  is  not  administrative  simpliciter  but  is\nquasi-judicial in nature.  It  exercises  powers  and  functions  which  are\nadjudicatory in character and legal in nature.   Thus,  the  requirement  of\nlaw, legal procedures, and the protections would  apparently  be  essential.\nThe finest exercise of quasi-judicial discretion by  the  Commission  is  to\nensure and effectuate the right of information recognized under  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_200\">Article  19</a>\nof the Constitution vis-a-vis the protections enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 21</a>  of\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">84.   The Information Commission has the power  to  deal  with  the  appeals\nfrom the First Appellate Authority and, thus, it has to examine whether  the\norder of the appellate authority and even the Public Information Officer  is\nin consonance with the  provisions  of  the  Act  of  2005  and  limitations\nimposed by the Constitution.   In this background, no  Court  can  have  any\nhesitation in holding that the Information Commission is akin to a  Tribunal\nhaving the trappings of a  civil  Court  and  is  performing  quasi-judicial\nfunctions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">85.   The various provisions  of  this  Act  are  clear  indicators  to  the\nunquestionable  proposition  of  law  that  the  Commission  is  a  judicial\ntribunal and not a ministerial tribunal.  It is an important cog in  and  is\npart of  court  attached  system  of  administration  of  justice  unlike  a\nministerial tribunal which is more influenced and  controlled  and  performs\nfunctions akin to machinery of administration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">       b) REQUIREMENT OF LEGAL MIND\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">86.   Now, it will be necessary for us to dwell upon somewhat  controversial\nbut  an  aspect  of  greater  significance  as  to  who  and  by  whom  such\nadjudicatory machinery, at its various stages under the  provisions  of  the\nAct of 2005 particularly in the Indian context, should be manned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">87.   <a href=\"/doc/190959557/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 5</a> of the Act of 2005 makes it  obligatory  upon  every  public\nauthority to designate as  many  officers,  as  Central  Public  Information\nOfficers and State Information Public Officers in all  administrative  units\nor offices, as may be  necessary  to  provide  information  to  the  persons\nrequesting information under the Act of 2005.   Further,  the  authority  is\nrequired to designate  Central  Assistant  Public  Information  Officer  and\nState Assistant Public Information Officer at  the  sub-divisional  or  sub-\ndistrict level.  The Assistant Public Information Officers  are  to  perform\ndual functions – (1) to receive the applications for  information;  and  (2)\nto receive appeals under the Act.  The applications for information  are  to\nbe forwarded to the concerned Information Officer and the appeals are to  be\nforwarded to the Central Information Commission  or  the  State  Information\nCommission, as the case may be.  It was  contemplated  that  these  officers\nwould be designated at all the  said  levels  within  hundred  days  of  the\nenactment of the Act.  There is no provision under the  Act  of  2005  which\nprescribes the qualification or experience  that  the  Information  Officers\nare required to possess.  In fact, the language of the Section itself  makes\nit clear that any officer can be designated as  Central  Public  Information\nOfficer or State Public Information Officer.  Thus, no specific  requirement\nis mandated for  designating  an  officer  at  the  sub-divisional  or  sub-\ndistrict level.  The appeals, under <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 19(1)</a> of the  Act,  against  the\norder of the Public Information  Officer  are  to  be  preferred  before  an\nOfficer senior in the rank to  the  Public  Information  Officer.   However,\nunder Section 19(3), a further appeal lies  to  the  Central  or  the  State\nInformation Commission, as the case  may  be,  against  the  orders  of  the\nCentral or State Appellate Officer.  These officers are required to  dispose\nof such application or appeal within the time schedule specified  under  the\nprovisions of the  Act.   There  is  also  no  qualification  or  experience\nrequired of these designated officers to whom the first  appeal  would  lie.\nHowever, in contradistinction, <a href=\"/doc/33472685/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/95598506/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 15(5)</a>  provide  for\nthe experience and knowledge that the  Chief  Information  Commissioner  and\nthe  Information  Commissioners  at  the  Centre  and  the   State   levels,\nrespectively,  are  required  to  possess.   This  provision  is   obviously\nmandatory in nature.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">88.   As already noticed, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/33472685/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 12(5)</a>, the  Chief  Information\nCommissioner and Information Commissioners are required  to  be  persons  of\neminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience in  law,  science\nand technology or any of the other specified fields.   Further,  Sub-Section\n(6) of <a href=\"/doc/33472685/\" id=\"a_207\">Sections  12</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/95598506/\" id=\"a_208\">15</a>  lays  down  the  disqualifications  for  being\nnominated as such. It is provided that the  Chief  Information  Commissioner\nor Information Commissioners shall not be a Member of Parliament  or  Member\nof the Legislative Assembly of any State or  Union  Territory  or  hold  any\nother office of profit or connected with any political party or carrying  on\nany business or pursuing any profession.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">89.   The requirement of legal person in a  quasi-judicial  body  has  been\ninternationally recognized.  We have already referred, amongst  others,  to\nthe relevant provisions of the respective Information Acts of the  USA,  UK\nand Canada.  Even in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, under the Canadian\nHuman Rights Act,  the  Vice-Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Tribunal  are\nrequired to have a degree in law from a recognized university  and  be  the\nmember of the bar of a province or a Chamber des notaires du Quebec for  at\nleast 10 years.  Along with this qualification, such person needs  to  have\ngeneral knowledge of human rights law  as  well  as  public  law  including\nAdministrative and Constitutional Laws.  The Information Commissioner under\nthe Canadian Law has to be appointed  by  the  Governor  in  Council  after\nconsultation with the leader of every recognized party in  the  Senate  and\nthe House of Commons.  Approval of such appointment is done  by  resolution\nof the Senate and the House  of  Commons.   It  is  noted  that  the  Vice-\nChairperson plays a pre-eminent role within this Administrative Tribunal by\nensuring a fair, timely and impartial adjudication process for human rights\ncomplaints, for the benefit of all concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">90.   As already noticed, in the United  Kingdom,  the  Information  Rights\nTribunal and the Information Commissioners are to  deal  with  the  matters\narising from both, the FOIA as well  as  the  Data  Protection  Act,  1998.\nThese tribunals are discharging quasi-judicial functions.  Appointments  to\nthem are dealt with and controlled by the  TCEA.   These  appointments  are\ntreated as judicial appointments and are covered under Part 2 of the  TCEA.\n  Section  50  provides  for  the  eligibility  conditions   for   judicial\nappointment.  Section  50(1)(b)  refers  to  a  person  who  satisfies  the\njudicial-appointment eligibility condition on an N-year  basis.   A  person\nsatisfies that condition on N-year basis if (a) the person has  a  relevant\nqualification and (b) the total length of the person’s  qualifying  periods\nis at least N years.  Section 52 provides for the meaning of the expression\n‘gain experience in law’ appearing in Section 50(3)(b).  It states  that  a\nperson gains experience in law during a period if the period is one  during\nwhich the person is engaged in  law-related  activities.   The  essence  of\nthese statutory provisions is that the concerned person under that  law  is\nrequired to possess both a degree as well as experience in the legal field.\n Such experience inevitably relates to working in that field.   Only  then,\nthe  twin  criteria  of  requisite  qualification  and  experience  can  be\nsatisfied.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">91.   It may be of some relevance here to note that in UK, the Director  in\nthe office of the Government  Information  Service,  an  authority  created\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_209\">Freedom of Information Act, 2000</a> possesses a degree  of  law  and\nhas been a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia and North Carolina\nin UK.  The Principal Judge of Information Rights Jurisdiction in the First-\ntier Tribunal, not only had a law degree but were also  retired  solicitors\nor barristers in private practice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">92.   Thus, there exists a definite requirement for appointing  persons  to\nthese posts with legal background and acumen so as to ensure complete faith\nand confidence  of  the  public  in  the  independent  functioning  of  the\nInformation Commission and for fair  and  expeditious  performance  of  its\nfunctions.  The Information Commissions are  required  to  discharge  their\nfunctions and duties strictly in accordance with law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">93.   In India, in terms of sub-Section  (5),  besides  being  a  person  of\neminence  in  public  life,  the  necessary   qualification   required   for\nappointment as Chief Information Commissioner  or  Information  Commissioner\nis that the person should have wide knowledge  and  experience  in  law  and\nother specified fields.  The term ‘experience in law’ is  an  expression  of\nwide connotation.  It pre-supposes that a person should have  the  requisite\nqualification in law as well as experience in the field  of  law.   However,\nit is worthwhile  to  note  that  having  a  qualification  in  law  is  not\nequivalent to having experience  in  law  and  vice-versa.   ‘Experience  in\nlaw’, thus, is an expression of composite content and would take within  its\nambit both the requisite qualification in law as well as experience  in  the\nfield of law.  A person may  have  some  experience  in  the  field  of  law\nwithout possessing the requisite qualification.  That  certainly  would  not\nserve the requirement and purpose of the Act of 2005, keeping  in  view  the\nnature of  the  functions  and  duties  required  to  be  performed  by  the\nInformation Commissioners.  Experience in  absence  of  basic  qualification\nwould certainly be insufficient in its content and  would  not  satisfy  the\nrequirements of the said provision.  Wide knowledge in  a  particular  field\nwould, by  necessary  implication,  refer  to  the  knowledge  relatable  to\neducation in such field whereas experience would necessarily relate  to  the\nexperience attained by  doing  work  in  such  field.   Both  must  be  read\ntogether in order to satisfy the  requirements  of  <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_210\">Sections  12(5)</a>  of  and\n15(5) the Act of 2005.  Similarly, wide knowledge and  experience  in  other\nfields  would  have  to  be  construed  as  experience  coupled  with  basic\neducational qualification in that field.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">94.   Primarily it may depend upon the language of the  rules  which  govern\nthe service but it can safely be stated as  a  rule  that  experience  in  a\ngiven post or field may not necessarily satisfy the condition of  prescribed\nqualification of a diploma or a degree in such field. Experience by  working\nin a post or by practice in the respective field even for long  time  cannot\nbe equated with the basic or the prescribed qualification. In absence  of  a\nspecific language of the provision, it is not feasible for a person to  have\nexperience in the field of law  without  possessing  a  degree  in  law.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"732151\" id=\"span_36\">In\nsomewhat different circumstances, this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/732151/\" id=\"a_211\">State of  Madhya\nPradesh v. Dharam Bir</a> [(1998) 6 SCC 165], while dealing with  Rule  8(2)  of\nthe  Madhya  Pradesh  Industrial  Training  (Gazetted)  Service  Recruitment\nRules, 1985, took the view that the stated qualification  for  the  post  of\nPrincipal Class I or Principal Class II were also applicable to  appointment\nby promotion and  that  the  applicability  of  such  qualification  is  not\nrestricted to direct appointments.  Before a  person  becomes  eligible  for\nbeing promoted to the post of Principal, Class II or Principal, Class-I,  he\nmust possess a Degree  or  Diploma  in  Engineering,  as  specified  in  the\nSchedule.  The fact that the person had worked as a Principal for  a  decade\nwould not lead to a situation of accepting that the person was qualified  to\nhold the post.  The Court held as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">           “32. “Experience” gained by the respondent  on  account  of  his\n           working on the post in question for  over  a  decade  cannot  be\n           equated with educational qualifications required to be possessed\n           by a candidate as a condition of eligibility  for  promotion  to\n           higher posts. If the Government, in exercise  of  its  executive\n           power, has created certain posts, it is for it to prescribe  the\n           mode of appointment or  the  qualifications  which  have  to  be\n           possessed by the candidates before they are appointed  on  those\n           posts. The qualifications would naturally vary with  the  nature\n           of posts or the service created by the Government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">           33. The post in  question  is  the  post  of  Principal  of  the\n           Industrial Training Institute. The Government has  prescribed  a\n           Degree or Diploma in Engineering as the essential  qualification\n           for this post. No one who does not  possess  this  qualification\n           can be appointed on this post. The educational qualification has\n           a direct nexus with the nature of the post.  The  Principal  may\n           also have an occasion to take classes and teach the students.  A\n           person  who  does  not  hold  either  a  Degree  or  Diploma  in\n           Engineering cannot possibly teach the students of the Industrial\n           Training  Institute  the  technicalities  of  the   subject   of\n           Engineering and its various branches.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">95.   Thus, in our opinion, it is clear that experience  in  the  respective\nfield referred to  in  <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_212\">Section  12(5)</a>  of  the  Act  of  2005  would  be  an\nexperience gained by the person upon possessing the basic  qualification  in\nthat field.  Of course, the matter  may  be  somewhat  different  where  the\nfield itself does not prescribe any degree or appropriate  course.   But  it\nwould be applicable for  the  fields  like  law,  engineering,  science  and\ntechnology, management, social service and journalism, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">96.   This takes us to discuss the kind of duties and responsibilities  that\nsuch high post is expected to perform.  Their functions are adjudicatory  in\nnature.  They are required to give notice to the  parties,  offer  them  the\nopportunity of  hearing  and  pass  reasoned  orders.   The  orders  of  the\nappellate authority and the Commission have  to  be  supported  by  adequate\nreasoning as they grant relief to  one  party,  despite  opposition  by  the\nother or reject the request for information made in exercise of a  statutory\nright.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">97.   It is not only appropriate but is a solemn duty of every  adjudicatory\nbody, including the tribunals, to  state  the  reasons  in  support  of  its\ndecisions.  Reasoning is the soul of a judgment  and  embodies  one  of  the\nthree pillars on which the very foundation of natural justice  jurisprudence\nrests.  It is informative to the claimant of the basis for rejection of  his\nclaim, as well as provides the grounds for challenging the order before  the\nhigher authority/constitutional court.  The reasons, therefore,  enable  the\nauthorities, before whom an order is challenged, to test  the  veracity  and\ncorrectness of the impugned order.  In the present  times,  since  the  fine\nline of distinction between the functioning of the administrative and quasi-\njudicial bodies is gradually becoming faint, even the administrative  bodies\nare required to pass reasoned orders.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508507\" id=\"span_37\">In  this  regard,  reference  can  be\nmade to the judgments of this Court in the cases of  <a href=\"/doc/1508507/\" id=\"a_213\">Siemens  Engineering  &amp;\nManufacturing Co. of India Ltd. v. Union of  India  &amp;  Anr.</a>  [(1976)  2  SCC\n981]; and Assistant Commissioner, Commrcial Tax  Department  Works  Contract\nand Leasing, Kota v. Shukla &amp; Brothers [(2010) 4 SCC 785].</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">98.   The Chief Information Commissioner and members of the  Commission  are\nrequired to possess wide knowledge and experience in the respective  fields.\n They are expected to be well versed with the procedure  that  they  are  to\nadopt while performing the adjudicatory  and  quasi  judicial  functions  in\naccordance with the statutory provisions and the scheme of the Act of  2005.\n They are to examine whether the information required by an applicant  falls\nunder any of the exemptions stated under <a href=\"/doc/1669859/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 8</a> or  the  <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_215\">Second  Schedule\nof the Act</a> of 2005. Some of the exemptions under  <a href=\"/doc/1669859/\" id=\"a_216\">Section  8</a>,  particularly,\nsub-sections  (e),  (g)  and  (j)  have  been  very  widely  worded  by  the\nLegislature keeping in mind the need to afford due  protection  to  privacy,\nnational security and the larger  public  interest.   In  terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/1052190/\" id=\"a_217\">Section\n8(1)(e)</a>, (f), (g), (h) and (i),  the  authority  is  required  to  record  a\ndefinite satisfaction whether disclosure of  information  would  be  in  the\nlarger  public  interest  or  whether  it  would  impede  the   process   of\ninvestigation  or apprehension or prosecution of the offenders  and  whether\nit would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of  an  individual.   All\nthese  functions  may  be  performed  by  a  legally   trained   mind   more\nefficaciously.   The most significant function which may often  be  required\nto be performed by these authorities is to  strike  a  balance  between  the\napplication of the freedom guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_218\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the  rights\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_219\">Article  21</a>  of  the  Constitution.   In  other  words,  the\ndeciding authority ought to be  conscious  of  the  constitutional  concepts\nwhich hold significance while determining  the  rights  of  the  parties  in\naccordance with the provisions of the statute  and  the  Constitution.   The\nlegislative scheme of the Act  of  2005  clearly  postulates  passing  of  a\nreasoned order in light of the above.   A  reasoned  order  would  help  the\nparties to question the correctness of the order effectively and within  the\nlegal requirements of the writ jurisdiction of the  Supreme  Court  and  the\nHigh Courts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">99.   ‘Persons of eminence in public life’ is also  an  expression  of  wide\nimplication and ramifications.  It takes in its ambit all  requisites  of  a\ngood citizen with values and having a public image of  contribution  to  the\nsociety.  Such person  should  have  understanding  of  concepts  of  public\ninterest and public  good.    Most  importantly,  such  person  should  have\ncontributed  to  the  society  through  social  or   allied   works.     The\nauthorities cannot lose sight of the fact that ingredients of  institutional\nintegrity would be applicable by necessary implication  to  the  Commissions\nand their members.   This discussion safely leads us to  conclude  that  the\nfunctions  of   the   Chief   Information   Commissioner   and   Information\nCommissioners may be better performed by a  legally  qualified  and  trained\nmind possessing the requisite experience.  The same should also  be  applied\nto the designation of  the  first  appellate  authority,  i.e.,  the  senior\nofficers to be designated at the Centre and State levels.  However, in  view\nof language of <a href=\"/doc/1930877/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 5</a>, it may not be necessary to  apply  this  principle\nto the designation of Public Information Officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">100.   Moreover,  as  already  noticed,  the  Information   Commission,   is\nperforming quasi-judicial functions and essence of its  adjudicatory  powers\nis akin to the Court system. It also possesses the essential trappings of  a\nCourt and  discharges  the  functions  which  have  immense  impact  on  the\nrights/obligations of the parties. Thus, it must be  termed  as  a  judicial\nTribunal which  requires  to  be  manned  by  a  person  of  judicial  mind,\nexpertise and experience in that field. This Court, while dealing  with  the\ncases relating to the powers of the Parliament  to  amend  the  Constitution\nhas observed that every  provision  of  the  Constitution,  can  be  amended\nprovided in the result, the basic structure of the Constitution remains  the\nsame. The dignity of the individual secured  by  the  various  freedoms  and\nbasic rights contained in Part III of the Constitution and their  protection\nitself has been treated as the basic structure of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">101.  Besides separation of powers, the  independence  of  judiciary  is  of\nfundamental constitutional value  in  the  structure  of  our  Constitution.\nImpartiality,  independence,  fairness  and   reasonableness   in   judicial\ndecision making are the hallmarks of the  Judiciary.  If  ‘Impartiality’  is\nthe soul of Judiciary,  `Independence&#x27;  is  the  life  blood  of  Judiciary.\nWithout independence, impartiality cannot thrive, as this  Court  stated  in\nthe case of Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President, Madras  Bar  Association\n[(2010) 11 SCC 17].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">102.  The independence of judiciary  stricto  sensu  applies  to  the  Court\nsystem.  Thus,  by  necessary  implication,  it  would  also  apply  to  the\ntribunals whose functioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the court  system.\n  The entire administration of justice system has to be so  independent  and\nmanaged by persons of  legal  acumen,  expertise  and  experience  that  the\npersons demanding  justice must not only receive justice,  but  should  also\nhave the faith that justice would be done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">103.  The above detailed analysis leads to an  ad  libitum  conclusion  that\nunder the provisions and scheme of the Act of  2005,  the  persons  eligible\nfor appointment should be of public eminence, with knowledge and  experience\nin the specified fields and should preferably have  a  judicial  background.\nThey  should  possess  judicial  acumen  and  experience   to   fairly   and\neffectively deal with the intricate questions of law that would come up  for\ndetermination  before  the  Commission,  in  its  day-to-day  working.   The\nCommission satisfies abecedarians of  a  judicial  tribunal  which  has  the\ntrappings of a court.  It will serve the ends  of  justice  better,  if  the\nInformation Commission was manned by persons of  legal  expertise  and  with\nadequate experience in the field of adjudication.  We  may  further  clarify\nthat such judicial members could work individually or  in  Benches  of  two,\none being a judicial member while the other being a  qualified  person  from\nthe specified fields to be called  an expert  member.   Thus,  in  order  to\nsatisfy the test of constitutionality, we will have  to  read  into  <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_221\">Section\n12(5)</a> of the Act that the expression  ‘knowledge  and  experience’  includes\nbasic degree in that field and experience  gained  thereafter  and  secondly\nthat  legally  qualified,  trained  and  experienced  persons  would  better\nadminister justice to the people, particularly when  they  are  expected  to\nundertake an adjudicatory process which involves  critical  legal  questions\nand niceties of law.  Such appreciation and application of legal  principles\nis a sine qua non to the determinative functioning of the Commission  as  it\ncan tilt the balance of justice either way.   Malcolm  Gladwell  said,  “the\nkey to good decision making is not knowledge.  It is understanding.  We  are\nswimming in the former.  We are lacking in the latter”.  The requirement  of\na judicial mind for  manning  the  judicial  tribunal  is  a  well  accepted\ndiscipline in all the major international  jurisdictions  with  hardly  with\nany exceptions.  Even if the intention is to not only  appoint  people  with\njudicial background and expertise, then  the  most  suitable  and  practical\nresolution would be that a ‘judicial member’ and  an  ‘expert  member’  from\nother specified fields should constitute a Bench and perform  the  functions\nin accordance with the provisions of the Act  of  2005.   Such  an  approach\nwould further the mandate of the statute by resolving the  legal  issues  as\nwell as other serious issues like an inbuilt conflict between the  Right  to\nPrivacy and Right to Information while applying the balancing principle  and\nother incidental controversies.  We  would  clarify  that  participation  by\nqualified  persons  from  other  specified  fields  would  be   a   positive\ncontribution in attainment of the proper administration of justice  as  well\nas the object of the Act of 2005.  Such an approach would help to  withstand\nthe challenge to the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 12(5)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">104.  As a natural sequel to the above,  the  question  that  comes  up  for\nconsideration  is  as  to  what  procedure  should  be   adopted   to   make\nappointments to this august body.  <a href=\"/doc/160606486/\" id=\"a_223\">Section  12(3)</a>  states  about  the  High-\npowered Committee, which has to recommend the names for appointment  to  the\npost of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners to  the\nPresident.  However, this Section, and any other provision for that  matter,\nis entirely silent as to what procedure for appointment should  be  followed\nby this High Powered Committee.  Once we have held that  it  is  a  judicial\ntribunal having the essential trappings of a court,  then  it  must,  as  an\nirresistible corollary, follow that the appointments  to  this  august  body\nare made in consultation with the judiciary.  In the event,  the  Government\nis of the opinion and desires to appoint not only judicial members but  also\nexperts from other fields to the Commission in terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_224\">Section  12(5)</a>  of\nthe Act of 2005, then it may do so, however, subject to  the  riders  stated\nin this judgment.  To ensure judicial independence,  effective  adjudicatory\nprocess and public confidence  in  the  administration  of  justice  by  the\nCommission, it would be necessary that the Commission is  required  to  work\nin Benches.  The Bench should consist of one judicial member and  the  other\nmember from the specified fields in terms of <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 12(5)</a>  of  the  Act  of\n2005.  It will be incumbent and in conformity with the  scheme  of  the  Act\nthat  the  appointments  to  the  post  of  judicial  member  are  made  ‘in\nconsultation’ with the Chief Justice of India in case of  Chief  Information\nCommissioner and members of  the  Central  Information  Commission  and  the\nChief Justices of the High Courts of the respective States, in case  of  the\nState Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioners  of\nthat State Commission.  In  the  case  of  appointment  of  members  to  the\nrespective Commissions from other specified fields, the DoPT in  the  Centre\nand the concerned Ministry in the States should prepare a panel,  after  due\npublicity, empanelling the names proposed at least three  times  the  number\nof vacancies existing in the Commission.  Such panel should be  prepared  on\na rational basis, and should inevitably  form  part  of  the  records.   The\nnames so empanelled, with the relevant record should be  placed  before  the\nsaid High Powered Committee.  In furtherance to the recommendations  of  the\nHigh Powered Committee, appointments to the Central  and  State  Information\nCommissions should be made by the competent authority.  Empanelment  by  the\nDoPT and other competent authority has to be  carried  on  the  basis  of  a\nrational  criteria,  which  should  be  duly  reflected  by   recording   of\nappropriate reasons.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1152518\" id=\"span_38\">The advertisement issued by such agency should not  be\nrestricted to any particular class of persons stated  under  <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_226\">Section  12(5)</a>,\nbut must cover persons from all fields.  Complete information, material  and\ncomparative data of the empanelled persons should be made available  to  the\nHigh  Powered  Committee.   Needless  to  mention  that  the  High   Powered\nCommittee  itself  has  to  adopt  a  fair  and  transparent   process   for\nconsideration of  the  empanelled  persons  for  its  final  recommendation.\nThis approach, is in no way innovative  but  is  merely  derivative  of  the\nmandate and procedure stated by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1152518/\" id=\"a_227\">L.  Chandra  Kumar</a>\n(supra)  wherein  the  Court  dealt  with  similar  issues  with  regard  to\nconstitution of the Central  Administrative  Tribunal.   All  concerned  are\nexpected to keep in mind that the Institution  is  more  important  than  an\nindividual.  Thus, all must do what is expected to be done in  the  interest\nof  the institution and enhancing the  public  confidence.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"310431\" id=\"span_39\">A  three  Judge\nBench of this Court in the case of Centre for  <a href=\"/doc/310431/\" id=\"a_228\">PIL  and  Anr.  v.

Giving effect to the above scheme would not only further the cause  of\nthe Act but would attain greater efficiency, and accuracy in  the  decision-\nmaking process, which in turn would serve the  larger  public  purpose.   It\nshall also ensure greater and more effective access  to  information,  which\nwould  result  in  making  the  invocation  of  right  to  information  more\nobjective and meaningful.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">106.  For the elaborate discussion and reasons afore-recorded, we  pass  the\nfollowing order and directions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">1. The writ petition is partly allowed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">2. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_229\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/526130/\" id=\"a_230\">15(5)</a> of the Act of  2005  are  held\n   to be constitutionally valid, but with the  rider  that,  to  give  it  a\n   meaningful and purposive interpretation,  it is necessary for  the  Court\n   to  ‘read  into’  these  provisions  some  aspects  without  which  these\n   provisions are bound to offend the doctrine of equality.  Thus,  we  hold\n   and declare that the expression ‘knowledge and experience’  appearing  in\n   these provisions would mean and include a basic degree in the  respective\n   field  and  the  experience  gained  thereafter.  Further,  without   any\n   peradventure  and  veritably,  we  state  that  appointments  of  legally\n   qualified, judicially trained and  experienced  persons  would  certainly\n   manifest in more effective serving of the ends  of  justice  as  well  as\n   ensuring better administration of justice by  the  Commission.  It  would\n   render the adjudicatory process which involves critical  legal  questions\n   and nuances of law, more adherent to justice and shall enhance the public\n   confidence in the working of  the  Commission.     This  is  the  obvious\n   interpretation of the language of these provisions and, in fact,  is  the\n   essence thereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">3. As opposed to  declaring  the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_231\">Section  12(6)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/526130/\" id=\"a_232\">15(6)</a>\n   unconstitutional, we would prefer to  read  these  provisions  as  having\n   effect  ‘post-appointment’.  In  other  words,  cessation/termination  of\n   holding of office of profit, pursuing  any  profession  or  carrying  any\n   business is a condition precedent to the appointment of a person as Chief\n   Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner  at  the  Centre  or\n   State levels.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">4. There is an absolute necessity for the legislature  to  reword  or  amend\n   the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 12(5)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/800351/\" id=\"a_234\">12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/526130/\" id=\"a_235\">15(5)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/526130/\" id=\"a_236\">15(6)</a> of the Act.    We\n   observe and hope that these provisions would be amended at  the  earliest\n   by the legislature to avoid any ambiguity or impracticability and to make\n   it in consonance with the constitutional mandates.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">5.  We  also  direct  that  the  Central  Government  and/or  the  competent\n   authority shall frame all practice and procedure related  rules  to  make\n   working of the Information Commissions effective and in  consonance  with\n   the basic rule of law.   Such rules  should  be  framed  with  particular\n   reference to <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_238\">28</a> of the Act within a period of  six  months\n   from today.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">6. We are of the considered view that it is  an  unquestionable  proposition\n   of law that the Commission is a ‘judicial tribunal’ performing  functions\n   of ‘judicial’ as well as ‘quasi-judicial’ nature and having the trappings\n   of a Court.   It is an important cog and is part of  the  court  attached\n   system of administration of justice, unlike a ministerial tribunal  which\n   is more influenced and controlled and  performs  functions  akin  to  the\n   machinery of administration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">7. It will be just, fair and  proper  that  the  first  appellate  authority\n   (i.e. the senior officers to be nominated in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1930877/\" id=\"a_239\">Section  5</a>  of  the\n   Act of 2005) preferably should be the persons possessing a degree in  law\n   or having adequate knowledge and experience in the field of law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">8. The Information Commissions at the  respective  levels  shall  henceforth\n   work in Benches of two members each.   One  of  them  being  a  ‘judicial\n   member’, while the other an ‘expert member’.  The judicial member  should\n   be a person possessing a degree in law, having a judicially trained  mind\n   and experience in performing judicial functions.   A  law  officer  or  a\n   lawyer may also be eligible provided he is a person who has practiced law\n   at  least  for  a  period  of  twenty  years  as  on  the  date  of   the\n   advertisement.  Such lawyer should also have experience in  social  work.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">   We are of the considered view that the competent authority should  prefer\n   a person who is or has been a Judge of the High Court for appointment  as\n   Information Commissioners.  Chief Information Commissioner at the  Centre\n   or State level shall only be a person who is or has been a Chief  Justice\n   of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">9. The appointment of the judicial members to any of these  posts  shall  be\n   made ‘in consultation’ with the Chief Justice of India and Chief Justices\n   of the High Courts of the respective States, as the case may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">10. The appointment of the Information Commissioners at both  levels  should\n   be made from amongst the persons empanelled by the DoPT in  the  case  of\n   Centre and the concerned Ministry in the case of a State.  The panel  has\n   to be prepared upon due advertisement and on a rational basis  as  afore-\n   recorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">11. The panel so prepared by the DoPT or the concerned Ministry ought to  be\n   placed before the High-powered Committee in terms of <a href=\"/doc/160606486/\" id=\"a_240\">Section  12(3)</a>,  for\n   final recommendation to the President of India.  Needless to repeat  that\n   the High Powered Committee at the Centre and the State levels is expected\n   to adopt a fair and transparent method  of  recommending  the  names  for\n   appointment to the competent authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">12. The selection process should be commenced at least  three  months  prior\n   to the occurrence of vacancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_144\">13. This judgment shall have effect only prospectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">14. Under the scheme of the Act of 2005, it is clear that the orders of  the\n   Commissions are subject to judicial review before the High Court and then\n   before the Supreme Court of India.   In  terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_241\">Article  141</a>  of  the\n   Constitution, the judgments of the Supreme Court are law of the land  and\n   are binding on all courts and tribunals.  Thus, it  is  abundantly  clear\n   that the Information Commission is bound by the law of precedence,  i.e.,\n   judgments of the High Court and the Supreme Court of India.  In order  to\n   maintain judicial discipline and consistency in the  functioning  of  the\n   Commission,  we  direct  that  the  Commission  shall  give   appropriate\n   attention to the doctrine  of  precedence  and  shall  not  overlook  the\n   judgments  of  the  courts  dealing  with  the  subject  and   principles\n   applicable, in a given case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">           It is not only the higher court’s  judgments  that  are  binding\n       precedents for the Information Commission,  but  even  those  of  the\n       larger Benches of the Commission should be given due  acceptance  and\n       enforcement by the smaller Benches of the Commission.
