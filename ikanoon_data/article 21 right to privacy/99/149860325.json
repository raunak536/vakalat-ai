The cause of action giving rise to the present petition relates to the\nalleged disclosure of First Information Report (FIR) of the petitioner‟s\ndaughter, alleging a case of sexual abuse against her own father, by\nRespondent No. 1 herein to other respondents herein viz. respondent No.2 -\nHindustan Times House, and respondent No.3 - Aaj Tak, and consequent\npublicity of the same by the latter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"46627\" id=\"span_2\">3.       Keeping in view the gravity and nature of allegations and also the\nsocial    object     of   preventing   societal   victimisation,   ostracism and\nembarrassment of the victim of alleged sexual abuse, as taken note of by the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/46627/\" id=\"a_3\">State of Karnataka v.

It is the petitioner‟s case that an FIR was registered by her daughter\nalleging a case of sexual abuse against her father in the concerned Police\nStation on 02.08.2005. It is alleged that the contents of the said FIR were\nleaked by respondent no. 1, as the same came to be- quoted and published in\nthe newspaper article dated 04.08.2005 of respondent no. 2, and also\nreported &amp; aired by respondent no. 3 in its television programme on\n07.08.2005.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C.)

It is alleged that the newspaper article dated 04.08.2005 of respondent\nno. 2 reveals the age of the petitioner‟s daughter, the locality in which she\nresides, the class in which she studies and the occupation of her father. It is\nalleged that the said article extensively quotes not only the contents of the\nFIR but also the statement of the police officer concerned with the said\ncomplaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.      As regards respondent no. 3, it is alleged that the crew members of\nrespondent no. 3 approached the petitioner and her daughter at their home\nand attempted to interview them in a deceptive manner against their will. It\nis alleged that thereafter, respondent no. 3 aired a programme on its\ntelevision channel on 07.08.2005, telecasting the said intrusion and giving\nwide publicity to the incident- by revealing the name, designation, and office\nof the accused father; by showing several images of the colony in which the\nPetitioner and her family were residing along with the petitioner‟s doorstep;\nand by airing the recorded voice of the Petitioner refusing entry to crew\nmembers of respondent no. 3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">7.      Ms. Satpute, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that publicity\nof such minute details         was sufficient for the identity of the\nvictim/prosecutrix to be revealed. Respondents having done so, without\nobtaining the consent/authorisation from the petitioner, have violated the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1696350/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 228A</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter\nreferred to as the „<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">IPC</a>‟); the „Norms of Journalistic conduct‟ <a href=\"/doc/46627/\" id=\"a_6\">laid down by</a>\nthe Press Council of India (PCI), governing respondent no. 2 &amp; 3; and above\nall the right of the minor victim of alleged sexual abuse to privacy and\nconfidentiality enshrined in the right to life guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P.(C.)

Rajagopal ALIAS R.R. Gopal &amp; Another v.\nState of T.N. &amp; Ors., (1994) 6 SCC 632, and Delhi Domestic Working\nWomen‟s <a href=\"/doc/1765970/\" id=\"a_8\">Forum v.

It is further submitted that respondent no. 1 by making the contents of\nthe FIR known to the other respondents violated its own circular No.\nXXXIX/140/Spl./48927-49020/C&amp;T(AC-II)/PHQ dated 17.12.2002 wherein\nit has been specifically mentioned that, &quot;Under no circumstances the name\nand identity of the victim shall be given to the media and the press briefing\nshall always be given only by the concerned DCP or the Joint C.P.\nranges/C.A.W. Cell. No member of Crisis Intervention Centre shall brief the\nmedia about the incident or follow up action taken nor permit photographs\nto be taken.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.      It is argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that on account of\nsuch publicity, the prosecutrix was faced with irremediable social\nembarrassment, and was unable to attend school regularly.            She was\nconstrained to move cities and had to start her education afresh in the middle\nof the school term, which led to great mental trauma and agony. So much so,\nthe petitioner and the victim went into oblivion and were not contacting\neven their counsel for years. It was only during the pendency of the matter,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.(C.)

The petitioner, therefore, by the present petition seeks a direction to\nrespondent no. 1 to order an immediate inquiry into the disclosure of the FIR\nand its details by the representatives of respondent no.1 to the other\nrespondents herein and to forthwith restrain the respondents from passing\noff such information anymore. The petitioner also claims compensation\nfrom the respondents for the blatant violation of the fundamental and other\nlegal rights of her daughter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"404603\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1728255\" id=\"span_10\">11.     Ms. Satpute submits that this court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution is conferred with wide powers- for the purpose of enforcement\nof fundamental rights as well as other legal rights. Citing reference to the\njudgments of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1728255/\" id=\"a_12\">Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee\nVandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust &amp; Ors v.

Union of\nIndia &amp; Ors.</a>, (2005) 4 SCC 649, Ms. Satpute argues that the power of this\ncourt to issue directions, for the purposes of enforcement, and to remedy the\nbreach of, fundamental rights of the aggrieved, is confined not only to\nstatutory authorities and instrumentalities of the State but also covers\npersons or bodies performing public functions and discharging public duties.\nShe further submits that the Press and the media, being the fourth pillar of\ndemocracy, perform a public function and discharge a public duty in\nproviding news, information and infusing transparency in governmental\nfunctioning. By doing so, the press and the media assume a public character\nand as such become subject to the writ jurisdiction of this court in relation to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.(C.)

The Station House Officer (SHO) of the concerned Police Station, on\nbehalf of Respondent no. 1, in his affidavit has not disputed the factum of\nthe registration of the afore-said FIR. However, at the same time he refutes\nthe allegation of the petitioner that the contents or details of the FIR have\nbeen revealed to anyone by respondent No.1. It is stated that the as per\npractice, one copy of the FIR was given to the complainant, one was sent to\nthe Court, one copy to the DCP‟s office and one was kept in the records of\nRespondent no. 1. It is submitted that due care has been taken to maintain\nsecrecy and the Police authorities are not the source of publicity of the\ncontents or details of the FIR in the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">Respondent No.2&#x27;s Submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">14.

It is submitted that respondent no. 2 has no intention of writing about\nthe episode again and, as such, the prayer for injunction as against it- is\ninfructuous. Learned Counsel for respondent no. 2, Mr. Bhambhani submits\nthat respondent No.2 is a private entity with no governmental control and\nthe present writ for enforcement of a fundamental right is not maintainable\nagainst a private party. Reference in this regard is made to the judgment of\nthis court in Indu Jain v. Forbes Inc., I.A. 12993/2006 in CS (OS) No.\n2172/2006 decided on 12.10.2007. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1628260\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"810491\" id=\"span_14\">Placing reliance upon the judgments of\nthe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/810491/\" id=\"a_14\">Rudul Shah v.

Mr. Bhambhani submits that the present petition is not maintainable\nqua the answering respondent since the petitioner has other efficacious\nalternate remedies. He submits that claim for compensation for breach of the\nright to privacy and/or defamation, as alleged in the present petition, if at all\ntenable, may only be brought by way of a suit and not by invoking the writ\njurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,\nsince the same requires to be proved by leading evidence in accordance with\nlaw.

It is submitted that the\npetitioner herein could also raise its grievances under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_18\">Juvenile Justice\n(Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000</a> which makes publication of the\nname of the juvenile, involved in proceedings under the said Act,\npunishable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">17.     On merits, it is argued by Mr. Bhambhani that the respondent no. 2\nhas neither violated any norms of the journalistic code of conduct, as <a href=\"/doc/1628260/\" id=\"a_19\">laid\ndown by</a> the PCI, nor has it acted with any impropriety while writing and\npublishing the said article. It is submitted that nowhere in the article has\nrespondent no. 2 revealed the name of the minor in question, nor has it\nrevealed any particulars or specifics of the minor as would likely make the\nidentity of the minor discoverable. It is submitted that by way of the said\narticle, it has also reported the statistics on similar sexual crimes, which\nwould make its motives and bona fides clear.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">18.     Mr. Bhambhani argues that it is not only the right but also the\nbounden duty of the press to publish such reports so as to expose the\nperversion in the society and that respondent No. 2 while doing so in the\npresent case, in eminent public interest, has made a sincere endeavour to\nstrike a balance between such right and its duty to protect the identity of the\nminor victim of sexual abuse. He submits that the report must be read in the\ncontext in which it was reported, i.e. reporting/highlighting of such heinous\nacts, which was required to be pointed out, and not of highlighting the\nparticular incident. However at the same time, it is stated that it would not\nhave been possible to cover the incident meaningfully and effectively, if the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.(C.)

Mr. Salwan, learned Counsel for Respondent no. 3, at the outset,\nstates that the allegations in the present petition do not pertain to the\nanswering respondent, who has been impleaded as an afterthought i.e. after\ntwo months from the date of the impugned telecast. Reliance is placed on\napplication under Order I Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code moved by the\npetitioner, being C.M. No. 13315/2005, and the amended petition, wherein it\nis stated that correspondent of the deleted respondent, namely Star News,\nhad in a treacherous manner interviewed the petitioner and her daughter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">20.     Mr. Salwan submits that the petitioner had herself given an Interview\nto the deleted respondent, namely Star News, and had thereafter filed\nthrough her counsel the present petition without effacing or concealing her\ndaughter‟s identity. Having done so, it does not lie in the mouth of the\npetitioner to allege violation of the right of confidentiality or other legal\nrights of her daughter, as she is seeking to do now.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">21.     Mr. Salwan disputes the violation of the right of confidentiality or\nother legal rights of the petitioner‟s daughter by respondent no. 3 and the\nconsequent alleged mental trauma suffered by her, as claimed in the petition.\nIt is submitted that the crew members of the answering respondent, on\ngetting information about the episode from its sources in the media,\ncontacted the petitioner at her home and after disclosing the full identity of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.(C.)

However, the\npetitioner did not step out of her flat and did not even open the main door. It\nis stated that since the petitioner refused to reply to any of the queries of the\nnews correspondent of respondent no. 3, no further questions were asked by\nthe said correspondent, who thereafter left with the other crew members. It\nis submitted that when the correspondent initiated talks with the petitioner,\nthe recording mike and the camera were put into motion- which were made\nfully visible and of which the petitioner was duly informed about, and no\nattempt had been made to hide or conceal the same. Since the petitioner\nrefused to answer any of the correspondent‟s queries and had also refused to\nstep out of the door and speak on the matter, neither the face of the\npetitioner was visible, nor her child‟s interview was recorded or photograph\ntaken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">22.      Mr. Salwan submits that the same is evident from a perusal of the\ntelecast as well as the transcript of the said telecast, which only mentioned\nthat a complaint had been filed by the child to the police. Neither the\npetitioner nor her child was interviewed by the correspondent of the\nanswering respondent nor any information pertaining to the petitioner or the\nchild was disclosed or stated in the telecast. It is further submitted that the\ntelecast did not contain explicit information relating to the episode or the\npetitioner‟s child‟s allegations against her father. No part of the FIR was\ndisclosed or discussed in the telecast. In fact, the answering respondent took\nall precautions of not disclosing the address or block where the petitioner\nresided. Even the office address of the petitioner‟s husband was not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">W.P.(C.)

Nowhere in the story visual shots of the child in question were\nshown nor her name or was any other evidence/fact, which could directly\nestablish her identity, telecast.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">23.     It is further submitted that the telecast was with the prime intention of\nhighlighting the destruction of a pious relationship of a father and a\ndaughter. The telecast was primarily with the aim of initiating a process of\ninfusing values and good education in order to ensure that such episodes are\nnot repeated in future, and not to harm the reputation of the petitioner‟s child\nor to bring her to any disrepute. In view of the same, it is submitted that the\npresent petition is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">24.     Even otherwise, it is submitted that the present case raises disputed\nquestions of fact - which this court in the present jurisdiction cannot decide.\nMr. Salwan submits that in writ jurisdiction this court would not go into the\nquantification of damages and, as such, the present petition seeking\ncompensation is not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">Discussion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">25.

The said observations, therefore, would have to\nbe taken in the context in which they were made, i.e., in the exercise of civil\njurisdiction. The Court was not dealing with a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution of India. The observations cannot be read as a general\nproposition of law applicable in cases of enforceability of fundamental\nrights in writ jurisdiction against a person discharging a public duty owed to\nthe person invoking the Court‟s jurisdiction, or to the person on whose\nbehalf that jurisdiction is invoked.

In de Smith, Woolf and Jowell&#x27;s Judicial Review of\n        Administrative Action, 5th Edn., it is noticed that not all the\n        activities of the private bodies are subject to private law, e.g.,\n        the activities by private bodies may be governed by the\n        standards of public law when its decisions are subject to\n        duties conferred by statute or when, by virtue of the function\n        it is performing or possibly its dominant position in the\n        market, it is under an implied duty to act in the public interest.\n        By way of illustration, it is noticed that a private company\n        selected to run a prison although motivated by commercial\n        profit should be regarded, at least in relation to some of its\n        activities, as subject to public law because of the nature of the\n        function it is performing. This is because the prisoners, for\n        whose custody and care it is responsible, are in the prison in\n        consequence of an order of the court, and the purpose and\n        nature of their detention is a matter of public concern and\n        interest. After detailed discussion, the learned authors have\n        summarised the position with the following propositions:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        (1) The test of whether a body is performing a public function,\n        and is hence amenable to judicial review, may not depend\n        upon the source of its power or whether the body is ostensibly\n        a &quot;public&quot; or a &quot;private&quot; body.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        (2) The principles of judicial review prima facie govern the\n        activities of bodies performing public functions.\n        (3) However, not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of\n        their public functions are the subject-matter of judicial review.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">        In the following two situations judicial review will not normally\n        be appropriate even though the body may be performing a\n        public function:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">W.P.(C.)

In such a case, that\n        branch of the law and its remedies should and normally will be\n        applied; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        (b) Where there is a contract between the litigants. In such a\n        case the express or implied terms of the agreement should\n        normally govern the matter. This reflects the normal approach\n        of English law, namely, that the terms of a contract will\n        normally govern the transaction, or other relationship between\n        the parties, rather than the general law. Thus, where a special\n        method of resolving disputes (such as arbitration or resolution\n        by private or domestic tribunals) has been agreed upon by the\n        parties (expressly or by necessary implication), that regime,\n        and not judicial review, will normally govern the dispute.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                                                    (emphasis supplied)\nClearly, the present case is not covered by the two exceptions carved out in\npara 3(a) and 3(b) in the above extract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"261493\" id=\"span_29\">34.     Similar view was taken by the Supreme Court in a more recent\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/261493/\" id=\"a_41\">Binny Ltd. v. V. Sadasivan</a>, (2005) 6 SCC 657, wherein, while\ntracing the history of the law relating to judicial review of public actions, it\nwas observed as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        &quot;11. Judicial review is designed to prevent the cases of abuse\n        of power and neglect of duty by public authorities. However,\n        under our Constitution, <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 226</a> is couched in such a way\n        that a writ of mandamus could be issued even against a private\n        authority. However, such private authority must be discharging\n        a public function and the decision sought to be corrected or\n        enforced must be in discharge of a public function. The role of\n        the State expanded enormously and attempts have been made to\n        create various agencies to perform the governmental functions.\n        Several corporations and companies have also been formed by\n        the Government to run industries and to carry on trading\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">W.P.(C.)

However, in the interpretation given to <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 12</a>\n        of the Constitution, this Court took the view that many of these\n        companies and corporations could come within the sweep of\n        <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. At the same time, there are\n        private bodies also which may be discharging public\n        functions. It is difficult to draw a line between public\n        functions and private functions when they are being\n        discharged by a purely private authority. A body is performing\n        a &quot;public function&quot; when it seeks to achieve some collective\n        benefit for the public or a section of the public and is accepted\n        by the public or that section of the public as having authority\n        to do so. Bodies therefore exercise public functions when they\n        intervene or participate in social or economic affairs in the\n        public interest...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">35.     The position that emerges from the aforementioned observations is\nthat, an activity/function of a body can be said to be a public function, for\nthe purposes of scrutiny by a writ court, when the same is performed under a\nduty to act in public interest. Such duty may be cast upon the body: by virtue\nof the nature of the function it is performing; by the fact that it is seeking to\nachieve some collective benefit for the public or section of the public or\nwhich is accepted by the public or the concerned section thereof as having\nauthority to do so. What is relevant is that such a body should participate, as\na part of its functions, in social or economic affairs in the public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_45\">36.

In Europe, the media played a\n        major role in the transformation of feudal society to a modern\n        one. Everyone is aware of the great role the print media played\n        in preparing for, and during, the great British, American and\n        French Revolutions. The only media at that time was the print\n        media, and this was used by great writers like Rousseau,\n        Voltaire, Thomas Paine, Junius, John Wilkes, etc. In the fight of\n        the people against feudalism and despotism. Everyone knows\n        of the great stir created by Thomas Paine‟s pamphlet\n        „Commonsense‟ during the American Revolution, or of the\n        letters of Junius during the reign of the despotic George III.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                The media became a powerful tool in the hands of the\n        people at that time because the people could not express\n        themselves through the established organs of power, since these\n        organs were in the hands of feudal and despotic rulers. Hence\n        the people had to create new organs which would serve them.\n        It is for this reason that that that the print media became known\n        as the Fourth Estate.

In his concluding remark, the learned author quotes the following\npassage from the judgment of Mr. Justice Hugo Black of the United States\nSupreme Court in the decision in New York Times Vs. US, 1971 402 US\n4713, (the Pentagon paper‟s case):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        &quot;In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free\n        press the protection it must have to fulfil its essential role in\n        our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the\n        governors. The Government‟s power to censor the press was\n        abolished so that the press would remain forever free to\n        censor the Government. The press was protected so that it\n        could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.\n        Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose\n        deception in government.         And paramount among the\n        responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part\n        of the government from deceiving the people and sending\n        them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign\n        shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation\n        for their courageous reporting, the New York times, the\n        Washington Post, and other newspapers should be commended\n        for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so\n        clearly. In ravelling the workings of government that led to the\n        Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the\n        Founders hoped and trusted they would do.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">39.

It need not be stressed that if the\n        quantity of newsprint available does not permit grant of\n        additional quota for new papers that is a different matter. The\n        restrictions are to be removed.

It is difficult to over-emphasize the importance of\n        Freedom of the Press as one of the pillars of a Government\n        &quot;of the people, by the people, and for the people&quot;. I may quote\n        what Lord Bryce said in American Commonwealth (New and\n        Revised Edition)(pp. 274, 275, and 367):\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              „The more completely popular sovereignty\n              prevails in a country, so much the more\n              important is it that organs of opinion should be\n              adequate to its expression, prompt, full, and\n              unmistakable in their utterances.... The press,\n              and particularly the newspaper press, stands by\n              common consent first among the organs of\n              opinion.... The conscience and common sense of\n              the nation as a whole keep down the evils which\n              have crept into the working of the Constitution,\n              and may in time extinguish them.... That which,\n              carrying a once famous phrase, we may call the\n              genius of universal publicity, has some\n              disagreeable results, but the wholesome ones are\n              greater and more numerous. Selfishness, injustice,\n              cruelty, tricks and jobs of all sorts, shun the light;\n              to expose them is to defeat them. No serious evils,\n              no rankling sore in the body politic, can remain\n              long concealed, and, when disclosed, it is half\n              destroyed.

Champions of human freedom of thought\n        and expression, throughout the ages, have realised that\n        intellectual paralysis creeps over a Society which denies, is\n        however subtle a form, due freedom of thought and expression\n        to its members.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        98.

He observed in\nparagraph 168 of the judgment that the constitutional guarantee of the\nfreedom of speech is not so much for the benefit of the press as it is for the\nbenefit of the public. In this regard, he placed reliance on Time Vs. Hill,\n385 US 374.           In paragraph 174, His Lordship observed that public\ndiscussion of public issues together with the spreading of information and\nany opinion on the issues is supposed to be the main function of newspapers.\nThe highest and the lowest of intelligencia resorts to its volumes for\ninformation.

The right of the press to\nimport newsprint is founded upon, not only the fundamental right of the\npress to impress itself, but also because the community has a right to be\nsupplied with information, and the Government a duty to educate the people\nwithin the limits of its resources.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_38\">43.

Indeed, freedom of expression\n                is the first condition of liberty. It occupies a\n                preferred position in the hierarchy of liberties\n                giving succour and protection to other liberties. It\n                has been truly said that it is the mother of all other\n                liberties. The Press as a medium of\n                communication is a modern phenomenon.

We see no effective answer\n        to it save the stale and sterile objection that the petitioner may,\n        if so advised, file a suit to recover damages from the State\n        Government. Happily, the State&#x27;s counsel has not raised that\n        objection. The petitioner could have been relegated to the\n        ordinary remedy of a suit if his claim to compensation was\n        factually controversial, in the sense that a civil court may or\n        may not have upheld his claim. But we have no doubt that if\n        the petitioner files a suit to recover damages for his illegal\n        detention, a decree for damages would have to be passed in\n        that suit, though it is not possible to predicate, in the absence\n        of evidence, the precise amount which would be decreed in his\n        favour. In these circumstances, the refusal of this Court to\n        pass an order of compensation in favour of the petitioner will\n        be doing mere lip-service to his fundamental right to liberty\n        which the State Government has so grossly violated. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 21</a>\n        which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded\n        of its significant content if the power of this Court were\n        limited to passing orders of release from illegal detention. One\n        of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can\n        reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the\n        mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 21</a> secured, is to mulct its violators in the\n        payment of monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis\n        leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot\n        be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to\n        adopt. The right to compensation is some palliative for the\n        unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of\n        public interest and which present for their protection the\n        powers of the State as a shield. If civilisation is not to perish\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">W.P.(C.)

In general, a disputed question of fact is not investigated in a\nproceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 226.</a> However, this is a rule of discretion and not\nof exclusion of jurisdiction. Therefore, merely because a disputed question\nof fact is raised, the High Court will not be justified in relegating the\napplicant to seek relief by a lengthy, dilatory and expensive process of a\ncivil suit. Mr. Justice Khanna in the case of <a href=\"/doc/522631/\" id=\"a_80\">Babulal Patel v. Nandlal Barot</a>,\n(1974) 2 SCC 706, laid down the position of law in this regard, in the\nfollowing words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_56\">&quot;10. ... The object of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 226</a> is to provide a quick and\n        inexpensive remedy to aggrieved parties. Power has\n        consequently been vested in the High Courts to issue to any\n        person or authority, including in appropriate cases any\n        government, within the jurisdiction of the High Court, orders or\n        writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus,\n        mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. It is plain\n        that if the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the\n        case of writ petitions, the entire purpose of having a quick and\n        inexpensive remedy would be defeated. A writ petition under\n        <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 226</a>, it needs to be emphasised, is essentially different\n        from a suit and it would be incorrect to assimilate and\n        incorporate the procedure of a suit into the proceedings of a\n        petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 226.</a> The High Court is not deprived of\n        its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 226</a> merely\n        because in considering the petitioner&#x27;s right of relief,\n        questions of fact may fall to be determined. In a petition\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 226</a> the High Court has jurisdiction to try issues\n        both of fact and law. Exercise of the jurisdiction is no doubt\n        discretionary, but the discretion must be exercised on sound\n        judicial principles. When the petition raises complex questions\n        of fact, which may for their determination require oral evidence\n        to be taken, and on that account the High Court is of the view\n        that the dispute should not appropriately be tried in a writ\n        petition, the High Court may decline to try a petition (see\n        <a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_86\">Gunwant Kaur v.

If, however, on consideration of the\n        nature of the controversy, the High Court decides, as in the\n        present case, that it should go into a disputed question of fact\n        and the discretion exercised by the High Court appears to be\n        sound and in conformity with judicial principles, this Court\n        would not interfere in appeal with the order made by the High\n        Court in this respect.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">                                                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1297614\" id=\"span_58\">60.     The High Court, in exercise of writ jurisdiction, cannot shirk its\nresponsibility by dismissing a petition on the ground that it raises a disputed\nquestion of fact when the material to determine the said question is on\nrecord. [See <a href=\"/doc/1297614/\" id=\"a_87\">L.G. Chaudhari v. Govt. of Bihar</a>, AIR 1980 SC 383]</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">61.     In the present case, the facts which are not disputed by the parties are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">the registration of the FIR by respondent no. 1 upon complaint by the\npetitioner‟s daughter; publishing of a newspaper article in relation to the said\ncomplaint by respondent no. 2; attempt to interview the petitioner and her\ndaughter by the crew members of respondent no. 3 at the petitioner‟s\nresidence in connection with the aforesaid complaint; reluctance of the\npetitioner to give an interview in relation to the complaint; and telecast of a\nprogramme, in connection with the complaint of the petitioner‟s daughter,\nby respondent no. 3 on its news channel.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">62.     However, at the same time, the respondents have disputed certain\nfacts as alleged by the petitioner herein. Respondent no. 1 has disputed\ngiving information pertaining to the FIR to the other respondents herein.\nRespondent no. 2 has disputed revealing the name of the minor in question\nand/or any particulars or specifics of the minor as would likely make the\nidentity of the minor discoverable.

The newspaper article published by respondent no.2 and the news\nitem telecast by respondent no.3 are a matter of record, and are undisputed.\nAs to whether, or not, the said publication/telecast amount to infringement\nof the fundamental rights of the petitioner‟s daughter, is, therefore, a matter\nwhich can be examined by the Court. The only disputed question of facts is:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">How respondent nos.2 and 3 got the particulars of the FIR registered with\nrespondent no.1? In my view, this aspect would not make any difference to\nthe liability, if any, of respondent nos.2 and/or 3. If at all, the same would\nonly impinge on the liability of respondent no.1.          This objection is,\ntherefore, rejected.

The petitioner herein has alleged breach of the right to privacy and\nconfidentiality, of her daughter, under right to life guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_88\">Article\n21</a> of the constitution of India. The &quot;right to privacy&quot; is recognised as an\nintegral part of the right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">65.

A citizen has a right to\n        safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage,\n        procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among\n        other matters. None can publish anything concerning the\n        above matters without his consent - whether truthful or\n        otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he\n        would be violating the right to privacy of the person\n        concerned and would be liable in an action for damages.\n        Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily\n        thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises\n        a controversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">        (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n        publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\n        unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n        records including court records. This is for the reason that once\n        a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy\n        no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for\n        comment by press and media among others. We are, however,\n        of the opinion that in the interest of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 19(2)]</a> an\n        exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is\n        the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like\n        offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of her\n        name and the incident being publicised in press/media.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">66.     The said right to privacy is subject to certain exceptions, as\nenumerated by the Supreme Court hereinabove, such as where the matter\nbecomes part of a public record- in which case the right to privacy comes to\nan end and the press and the media get a legitimate right to comment upon\nthe same. There are exceptions to this, as recognised by the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">W.P.(C.)

Therefore, even if the matter relating to a case of\nalleged sexual abuse etc. becomes a part of the public record, the\nfundamental right of the victim to be safeguarded from further disclosure of\nidentity and consequent subjection to social indignity does not come to an\nend. Therefore, an act which violates the said right gives cause of action to,\ninter alia, stake a claim of damages.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">67.     The petitioner herein has also alleged commission of an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1696350/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 228A</a>, IPC on the part of the respondents- for disclosing the name of\nthe petitioner‟s daughter. The said submission cannot be considered by this\ncourt in exercise of the present jurisdiction. The commission of the alleged\noffence has to be adjudicated and decided upon by a Criminal Court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.

To the\ncontrary, it is their categorical stand that the contents of the said FIR were\nprovided to them by the officials of respondent no. 1. Secondly, it is also not\nrespondent no. 1‟s case/allegation that the contents of the said FIR were\nprovided by the petitioner and/or her daughter to the other respondents.

As per respondent no. 1‟s own circular, as quoted above, no official\nexcept the concerned DCP or the Joint C.P. Ranges/CAW Cell could have\nbriefed the press about the incident complained of. With no such briefing\nhaving been referred to, or having been brought to the notice of this court by\nrespondent no. 1 herein, I cannot but reject the submission of respondent\nno.1 and, accordingly, hold them liable for the disclosure of the FIR. Such\nconduct of the officials of respondent no. 1 herein is nothing short of gross\nnegligence and dereliction of duty which has, consequently, resulted in\nbreach of the very basic right of privacy and confidentiality of the\npetitioner‟s daughter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">70.

As per the aforementioned norms of journalistic conduct, it is the\nduty of the press to not reveal the particulars of the victim of sexual abuse\nwhich would lead to the disclosure of his/her identity and resultant breach of\nhis/her right to privacy. It is on the anvil of such duty emanating from the\nfundamental right to privacy of the victim of sexual abuse that the alleged\nconduct of the respondent no. 2 and respondent no. 3 has to be evaluated, for\nthe purposes of the present petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">72.     Respondent no. 2 published an article in relation to the incident\ncomplained of by the petitioner‟s daughter, which came to be registered by\nrespondent no. 1. In the said article, respondent no. 2 has revealed the age,\nthe district in which she resides and the class in which she studies. Apart\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">W.P.(C.) No. 12730/2005                                               Page 40 of 48</span>\n from this, the article also mentions- the particulars of the incident reported\nand registered by the respondent no. 1 both in quotes and also otherwise;\nand the figures of the incidents of police cases in the year 2004, wherein the\nrapist was a relative of the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">73.     A perusal of the aforesaid article shows that particulars which would\nidentify the victim of alleged child sexual abuse, have not been disclosed.\nMere reference to the age, academic standard and residential district of the\nvictim cannot be considered as revealing her identity. These particulars are\ntoo general for anyone to identify the petitioner or her daughter as the\nlocality is very large and there could be hundreds of children in the locality\nwho could meet the description given by respondent no.2. The particulars\npertaining to the complaint made by the petitioner‟s daughter, which have\nbeen referred to in the said article, are not such which could lead to the\ninference of the possibility of the identity of the victim being revealed. The\nsame only cites the instances of alleged sexual advances/abuse by the father\nof complainant victim, without any further particulars which could lead to\nthe identification of the victim. I also find merit in the submissions of\nMr.Bhambani that respondent no.2 has exercised discretion and restraint in\nlifting the details and particulars from the FIR lodged by the petitioner‟s\ndaughter. The article also displays a journalistic trait in as much, as, it raises\nthe issue of prevalence of such crimes in the society. The focus of the\narticle is not the particular incident of the petitioner‟s daughter, but the\noccurrence of such crimes in our society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">74.     Consequently, I do not find merit in the submissions of the petitioner\nherein qua respondent no. 2. Accordingly, I do not find the conduct of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">W.P.(C.)

Respondent no. 3, as aforesaid, broadcasted a programme on its news\nchannel, in connection with the complaint made by the petitioner‟s daughter\nto respondent no. 1. Having so done, respondent no. 3 cannot pass the buck\nupon the deleted respondent and try to wash away its hands. The said\nbroadcast, therefore, would have to stand the test of judicial scrutiny as\nmentioned above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">76.     Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has submitted that the\npetitioner herself has brought the information regarding the alleged incident\nexperienced by her daughter in public domain by, firstly, giving an interview\nto the deleted respondent, i.e., Star TV and, secondly, by filing the present\npetition in her own name, i.e., in the name of the victim‟s mother. The\npetitioner has explained that the Star TV reporter had coaxed the\npetitioner/her daughter into making some disclosures to Star TV.           The\nspecific averment made by the petitioner in this regard reads as follows,\nwhich is contained in their legal notice sent to Star TV:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">        &quot;x      x         x   x   x     x     x      x      x   x\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">        3.

That inspite of protests from our client and her family\n        members your representative persisted with her attempts to\n        gain information regarding the FIR lodged.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">W.P.(C.)

We have been informed that your representative by\n        tricking our client and managed to gain information through\n        sheer persistence and emotional blackmail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">        6.     Kindly note that the use of any information gained by\n        you/your representative in the said matter could reveal the\n        identity of the victim which is totally illegal and unethical for\n        which you would be liable to pay damages and suffer other\n        criminal and civil consequences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">        x       x         x   x   x      x     x      x      x      x&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">77.     Pertinently even before the said interview could be publicised or\ntelecast, the petitioner took immediate steps to restrain Star TV from\ntelecasting the same by the above notice sent on the same day, i.e.,\n04.08.2005. Therefore, the giving of the interview to the representative of\nStar TV cannot be said to be a deliberate and conscious decision on the part\nof the petitioner or her daughter to publicise the alleged incidents or the FIR.\nAs regards the filing of the present petition in the name of the petitioner, it is\nto be appreciated that the petition was filed on 04.08.2005, i.e., the same day\non which the representative of the Star TV had taken the interview. It was\nfiled in evident urgency. Obviously, the petitioner could not have intended\nto publicise either her or her daughter‟s identity and the disclosure of the\nname of the petitioner in the petition clearly appears to be on account of the\npetitioner‟s innocence/ignorance and the counsel‟s possible lack of\nexperience and thoughtlessness on account of paucity of time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_115\">78.     The submission of respondent no. 3 - that the telecast only mentioned\nthat a complaint had been filed by the child to the police; that respondent\nno.3 took all precautions of not disclosing the address or block where the\npetitioner resided; that the office address of the petitioner‟s husband was not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">W.P.(C.) No. 12730/2005                                                  Page 43 of 48</span>\n disclosed, and; that the telecast did not contain any information pertaining to\nthe petitioner which could directly establish her identity - appear to be in\nteeth of the material on record, which is self-explanatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_116\">79.     A perusal of the video recording of the said telecast along with its\ntranscript reveals blatant violation and disregard of the petitioner‟s\ndaughter‟s right to privacy and confidentiality as also the duty of respondent\nno. 3 herein to maintain utmost secrecy and confidentiality in the matter of\nthe identity of the victim of alleged child sexual abuse. The said telecast\ndiscloses: the name of the accused father &amp; his place of work along with his\ndesignation - which would not only identify him but also the victim as it is\ndisclosed that the victim is his own daughter; the age of the victim; visual\nshots of the display board of the colony containing particulars regarding the\nSector and Pocket, wherein the petitioner resides with her daughter; visual\nshots of the staircase leading to the house along with the side shot of the\ndoorstep of the house and; the voice of the petitioner. Revelation of\nparticulars of such nature and to such an extent, are patently sufficient for\nthe disclosure of the identity of the petitioner‟s daughter in the petitioner‟s\ncommunity and society. The fact that the petitioner and her daughter came to\nbe identified by their acquaintances and neighbours is also indicated by the\nfact that they had to leave their home and go into hiding and have been\nlocated by their counsel only recently Respondent no. 3 by its conduct, has\nacted in utter disregard and disrespect of the right of the victim of sexual\nabuse to privacy, recognised not only as inherent to the fundamental right to\nlife under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, but also enumerated in the norms of\njournalistic conduct by which respondent no. 3 is governed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.P.(C.) No. 12730/2005                                             Page 44 of 48</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_117\"> 80.     The submission of the respondent no. 3 that the recording mike and\nthe camera, which were put into motion when the correspondent initiated\ntalks with the petitioner, were made fully visible and of which the petitioner\nwas duly informed about and no attempt had been made to hide or conceal\nthe same, is also entirely meritless. There is not an iota of suggestion, from a\nperusal of the telecast, of any such information having being passed onto the\npetitioner by the crew members of respondent no. 3. The crew members on\nthe other hand, chose to remain silent as regards the factum of such\nrecording. Even if this submission of respondent no. 3 were to be accepted,\nthe same is no excuse to justify their conduct. Once the petitioner had\nexpressed her reluctance to speak to the correspondents of respondent no. 3,\nthey should have left without making any further recording and could not\nhave utilised and aired any part of the recording made by them. They cannot\nnow turn around and say that they did not conceal the recording and that the\nsame was within the knowledge of the petitioner who, admittedly, was still\ninside her house while the cameraman of respondent no. 3 was recording\nfrom the side down below the staircase leading to the petitioner‟s house.\nSuch gross misconduct on the part of respondent no. 3 calls for the strongest\ncondemnation. Their act was a display of a prurient or morbid curiosity as\nproscribed in the &#x27;Norms of Journalistic Conduct<a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_98\">&#x27; <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_99\">laid down by</a></a> the PCI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">81.     I therefore, hold respondent no. 3 herein liable for gross negligence\nand, consequent, breach of fundamental right of the petitioner‟s daughter in\ntelecasting the said programme containing particulars, sufficient for the\ndisclosure of the identity of the petitioner‟s daughter.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">W.P.(C.) No. 12730/2005                                              Page 45 of 48</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\"> 82.     Though the exact amount of compensation to which the petitioner and\nher daughter are entitled to on account of the conduct of respondent nos.1 &amp;\n3 cannot be determined with certainty in these proceedings, this Court can\ncertainly grant compensation as a palliative measure, leaving it to the\npetitioner‟s daughter to seek further damages from the said respondents in\nappropriate civil proceedings. I am of the view that the petitioner would be\nentitled to damages of at least Rupees One Lakh from respondent No.1 and\nof at least of Rupees Five Lakhs from respondent No.3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_120\">83.     While arriving at the aforesaid figures of damages awarded against\nrespondent no. 1 &amp; 3, this Court has taken into account the extent of\nnegligent role played by each of them in the serious infraction of the\nfundamental right to life of the petitioner‟s daughter. The main wrongdoer is\nrespondent no. 3 who was obliged not to so explicitly display the details\nregarding the petitioner‟s residence etc. as already discussed above, even if\nrespondent no. 1 provided to it the copy of the FIR in question. Respondent\nno. 1 should have been discreet in its disclosure of the details to respondent\nno. 2 &amp; 3, which it was not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">84.     The award of damages in such cases, of necessity, has to be on the\nbasis of some guess work. The embarrassment caused to the petitioner and\nher daughter by the telecast of the programme by respondent no. 3 in the\nmanner that they did was so great that they had to relocate themselves and\ngo into hiding for several years. The purpose of award of damages in such\ncases is also to set an example for others, so that it acts as a deterrent against\nsuch similar misadventures at the cost of victims of alleged sexual abuse.
