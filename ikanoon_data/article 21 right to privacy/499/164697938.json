The petitioner has sought for quashment of order dated\n\n28.10.2020, dated 28.12.2020 and 17.3.2021 passed by the\n\nSecretary    (Home),      Government                of   Rajasthan        permitting\n\ninterception of Mobile Phones of the petitioner and others in\n\npurported exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\n\nTelegraph Act 1885.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                    (Downloaded on 11/11/2023 at 06:06:18 PM)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">                                      (2 of 15)                       [CRLW-565/2022]\n\n\n     By order dated 28.10.2020 Mobile No. 9829172463 of co-\n\naccused Sunil Sharma was ordered to be intercepted by the Anti\n\nCorruption Bureau on suspicion that the said mobile was possibly\n\nbeing used for illegal activity relating to incitement to the\n\ncommission of an offence affecting public safety.

The challenge is on the ground that right to privacy has been\n\ninfringed by putting the mobile phones of the petitioner and others\n\non surveillance/spying by the State machinery.                    The orders are\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">21</a> of the Constitution of India unless\n\nthe same is consistent with the procedure established by law. In\n\nthe case on hand, no reason for                    making of such orders is\n\ndisclosed, rather are on teeth of the procedural requirement.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3.   It is worth to notice that on the basis of information gathered\n\non interception of mobile calls, FIR No. 20 of 2021 was registered\n\non 12.4.2021 under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_5\">8</a> of the Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act as well as under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_7\">120B</a> of the IPC\n\nwith the Anti Corruption Bureau Police Station, Jaipur.                        After\n\ninvestigation of the case, charge-sheet No. 140/2021 dated\n\n4.5.2021 has already been filed.                 On bare perusal of the call\n\ndetails disclosed in the FIR, it is evident that there is no direct\n\nevidence against the petitioner of being indulged in bribing any\n\npublic servant rather in the purported trap proceeding, no graft\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                      (Downloaded on 11/11/2023 at 06:06:18 PM)</span>\n                                     (3 of 15)                    [CRLW-565/2022]\n\n\nmoney was recovered from possession of any of the accused\n\npersons including the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">4.

In absence of disclosure of such material, no prudent\n\nperson can reach to a conclusion that in fact, it was a case of &quot;in\n\nthe interest of public safety.&quot;           Moreover, no reason has been\n\nrecorded in writing as required by <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\n\nTelegraph Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">8.

Public emergency\nwould mean the prevailing of a sudden condition or\nstate of affairs affecting the people at large calling for\nimmediate action. The expression &quot;public safety&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">means the state or condition of freedom from danger\nor risk for the people at large. When either of these\ntwo conditions are not in existence, the Central\nGovernment or a State Government or the authorised\nofficer cannot resort to telephone tapping even\nthough there is satisfaction that it is necessary or\nexpedient so to do in the interests of sovereignty and\nintegrity of India etc. In other words, even if the\nCentral Government is satisfied that it is necessary or\nexpedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty\nand integrity of India or the security of the State or\nfriendly relations with sovereign States or public\norder or for preventing incitement to the commission\nof an offence, it cannot intercept the messages or\nresort to telephone tapping unless a public\nemergency has occurred or the interest of public\nsafety or the existence of the interest of public safety\nrequires. Neither the occurrence of public emergency\nnor the interest of public safety are secretive\nconditions or situations. Either of the situations would\nbe apparent to a reasonable person.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">29. The first step under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act,\ntherefore, is the occurrence of any public emergency\nof the existence of a public-safety interest. Thereafter\nthe competent authority under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\nAct is empowered to pass an order of interception\nafter recording its satisfaction that it is necessary or\nexpedient so to do in the interest of (i) sovereignty\nand integrity of India, (ii) the security of the State,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">(iii) friendly relations with foreign States, (iv) public\norder or (v) for preventing incitement to the\ncommission of an offence.

The above analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act\nshows that so far the power to intercept\nmessages/conversations is concerned the Section\nclearly lays-down the situations/conditions under\nwhich it can be exercised.

As per Rule (1), only the Secretary to the State Government\n\nin charge of the Home Department was competent to pass the\n\nimpugned orders.    The petitioner has stated on oath that at the\n\nrelevant time, Mr. Abhay Kumar was Secretary in charge of the\n\nHome Department and other Secretaries including Mr. N.L. Meena\n\nwho had passed the impugned orders were not the in-charge of\n\nthe Home Department, as such not competent to pass the\n\nimpugned orders.

Even in that order,\n\nthe nature of the work involved herein was assigned to the Home\n\nSecretary. Moreover, the executive instructions cannot supercede\n\nthe statutory rules.    Therefore,         the only competent person to\n\npass the impugned orders was incharge of the Home Department\n\nof the State who is known as Principal Secretary, Home. As such ,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                    (Downloaded on 11/11/2023 at 06:06:18 PM)</span>\n                                  (13 of 15)                    [CRLW-565/2022]\n\n\nthe impugned orders are not sustainable for being authored by an\n\nincompetent person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">14.   I find force in the submission of learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner that impugned orders were never sent to the Review\n\nCommittee which ought to have been sent within statutory period\n\nand the Review Committee was also expected to take decision on\n\nthe validity of the impugned orders within a specified period. The\n\nstatutory provisions are for some purpose and not for fun.               The\n\naforesaid provision ought to have been strictly followed but has\n\nnot been followed at all. The respondents have not controverted\n\nthat the impugned orders were not sent to the Review Committee\n\nnor any material suggest that the impugned orders were sent to\n\nthe Review Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">15.

The provisions are explicit enough that authority is bound\n\nto disclose in the impugned orders that other means of acquiring\n\nnecessary information was resorted to but was not possible.                In\n\nthe case on hand, merely a bald statement has been recorded that\n\nacquisition of information is not possible by any other means.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                   (Downloaded on 11/11/2023 at 06:06:18 PM)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                                  (14 of 15)                    [CRLW-565/2022]\n\n\nTherefore, the statutory provisions of sub-rule (3) has also not\n\nbeen complied in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_18\">17.
