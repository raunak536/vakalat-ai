The Constitution must evolve\n\n             with the felt necessities of time to meet the challenges thrown\n\n             up in a democratic order governed by the Rule of Law. The\n\n             meaning of the Constitution cannot be frozen on the\n\n             perspectives present when it was adopted. Technological\n\n             change has given rise to concerns which were not present\n\n             seven decades ago and the rapid growth of technology may\n\n             render obsolescent many notions of the present.
