On 28 March 2024 the medical board of the\n\nGrant Government Medical College &amp; Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai\n\nconstituted under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_5\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act</a> 1971 1 opined that\n\n‘X’ was physically and mentally fit for termination of her pregnancy subject to the\n\npermission of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.     The Appellant moved the High Court of Judicature at Bombay under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article\n\n226</a> of the Constitution seeking the termination of pregnancy of her daughter. On\n\n3 April 2024, the medical board issued a ‘clarificatory’ opinion, without re-\n\nexamining ‘X’. The report denied the termination of pregnancy on the ground that\n\nthe gestational age of the fetus was twenty-seven to twenty-eight weeks and that\n\nthere were no congenital abnormalities in the fetus. 2 By the impugned judgment\n\nthe High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that the pregnancy\n\nexceeded the statutory period of twenty-four weeks.\n\n\n\n\n1 <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_7\">MTP Act</a>\n2 There is an inexplicable inconsistency on the gestational age in the report of the medical\n\nboard of the Grant Government Medical College &amp; Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai dated\n28 March 2024.

The Appellant moved this court under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution. The\n\nSpecial Leave Petition was mentioned for urgent orders after the Court had risen\n\non the conclusion of normal working hours at 5:15 pm on 19 April 2024. The Bench\n\nreassembled immediately thereafter and had the benefit of hearing the counsel\n\nfor the Appellant, the Standing Counsel for the State of Maharashtra and Ms\n\nAishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General. While issuing notice, this Court took\n\nnote of the fact that the report of the Medical Board dated 3 April 2024, which\n\nwas relied upon by the High Court had not dealt with the impact of the pregnancy\n\non the physical and emotional well-being of ‘X’. Accordingly, a fresh Medical\n\nBoard was directed to be constituted under the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal\n\nGeneral Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College, Sion, Mumbai.3\n\nThis Court directed that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                  “5.

Moreover, it would be\n                      necessary that this Court is apprised whether the\n                      carrying of the pregnancy to the full term would\n                      impact upon the physical and mental well being of\n                      the minor who is barely fourteen years old.

A report has been submitted by the Sion Hospital. The minor was examined\n\nby a team of six doctors constituted by the Dean.

After examining ‘X’, the medical board of the Sion Hospital opined that the\n\ngestational age of the fetus was 29.6 weeks and continuation of pregnancy will\n\nnegatively impact the physical and mental well-being of ‘X’. Further, it opined that\n\nthe pregnancy can be terminated with a degree of risk not higher than if the\n\npregnancy was taken to term. The medical board reported as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                  “1. Whether carrying of the pregnancy to the full\n                  term would impact upon the physical and mental\n                  well being of the minor who is barely 14 years?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                  Ans.

Also in\n               view of minor being barely 14 years, the chances of\n               surgical intervention (Abdominal Surgery) at term or\n               now may be there.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">7.    While forwarding the report of the Medical Board, the Dean of Sion Hospital\n\nhas noted the opinion of the Board in the following terms:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">               “The opinion of the committee is forwarded herewith\n               for your perusal.

The Psychiatrist also\n               contributed in evaluation of patient and assessing\n               the psychological state of the patient. According to\n               the committee report continuation of pregnancy\n               could cause psychological trauma to the patient.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">8.    On 22 April 2024, this Court granted leave and pronounced its operative\n\norder to set aside the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.

In view of the communication of the Dean at Sion hospital, we had the\n\nbenefit of hearing submissions of counsel again.

Dr Arun H Nayak has indicated that after the order of this Court dated 22\n\nApril 2024, the medical team followed requisite procedures by carrying out\n\nmedical investigations and seeking the consent of the parents. According to the\n\nmedical team, while initially the parents were agreeable to the stoppage of the\n\nfetal heart on 24 April 2024, on 25 April 2024 the appellant stated that she desires\n\nthat the pregnancy be taken to term and that she would thereafter give the child\n\nin adoption. Subsequently, on 26 April 2024, the appellant stated that she desired\n\na termination of pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">14.   The doctors stated that in view of the changing views of the appellant and\n\nher spouse and the above background, they had moved the Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral with a communication dated 26 April 2024 of the Dean of the Sion\n\nhospital, as extracted above. Dr Nayak and Dr Bava have stated that in terms of\n\nthe guidelines of the Union Government dated 14 August 2017, medical steps\n\nwould have to be taken by giving an intracardiac injection, KCL, to end the life of\n\nthe fetus in utero. An SOP has also been issued by the State Government on 18\n\nJanuary 2020. The doctors have stated that the pregnancy of the minor is at an\n\nadvanced stage. In terms of the applicable guidelines, an intracardiac injection\n\nof KCL has to be administered and if the fetal heart is not detected to have\n\nstopped after sonography following the administration of the injection, the\n\nprocedure would have to be repeated. Both the doctors have indicated that this\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                        Page 9 of 22</span>\n\fmay involve a certain degree of risk to the minor which cannot be ruled out\n\nbearing in mind the late stage of the pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">15.   The parents of ‘X’ have conversed with the doctors and with the Court on\n\nthe video conferencing platform in Hindi. Their primary concern was that they\n\nshould have been apprised a week ago by the medical team after the order of\n\nthis Court was passed of the inherent dangers in carrying out the procedure in an\n\nadvanced pregnancy. We appreciate the concerns of the parents and their\n\nanguish, particularly having regard to the backdrop in which the pregnancy is\n\nstated to have arisen. The issue is about the way forward at the present stage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">16.   During the course of the conversation online, the doctors have deliberated\n\non whether a delivery can be induced at this stage. However, both the doctors\n\nruled out such a course of action bearing in mind that inducing a delivery at this\n\nstage may have real risks of a deformed child as a result of the premature birth.\n\nThe situation has been duly explained to the parents of the minor.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">17.   It has emerged during the course of the discussion that both the parents of\n\n‘X’ are averse to undertaking any risk to the life and well-being of their daughter\n\nat this stage and would prefer to take her home and to readmit her to the Sion\n\nhospital in time for her due date of delivery. During the course of the discussion, Dr\n\nBava indicated to the parents that Sion hospital is ready and willing to let ‘X’ be in\n\nthe care of the hospital from now until the date of the delivery. However, the\n\nfather of the minor has specifically stated the he would prefer to take the minor\n\nhome where she would be in more congenial surroundings with the members of\n\nher family. The doctors have indicated to the father and the mother that they\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                         Page 10 of 22</span>\n\fshould bring the minor back to the hospital for regular antenatal checkups.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">18.   This Court by its earlier order had authorized the medical team at the Sion\n\nhospital to carry out the termination of pregnancy. The reasons on the basis of\n\nwhich such a course was adopted have been elaborated upon in the earlier\n\norder, which is extracted above. Even when the Court passed the order on the\n\nprevious occasion, the minor was in the thirtieth week of her pregnancy. She is\n\nnow nearing the end of the thirty first week of pregnancy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">19.   The sole and only consideration which must weigh with the Court at this\n\nstage is the safety and welfare of the minor. We are conscious of the trauma which\n\nthe minor will face in having to continue the pregnancy for approximately five\n\nweeks, if the course of action which has been suggested by her parents is\n\naccepted. The Court has been informed that the minor is ready and willing to\n\naccept the decision of her parents which is in her best interest. Performing a\n\nprocedure for termination of an advanced pregnancy at this stage is subject to\n\nrisks involving the well-being and safety of the minor as explained by the medical\n\nteam at Sion hospital. Bearing in mind the detailed discussion which took place,\n\nthe parents of the minor have chosen not to press ahead with the termination of\n\nthe advanced pregnancy at the present point of time. This decision, should, in our\n\nview, be accepted bearing in mind all that has been set out in the earlier part of\n\nthis order. As a consequence, the earlier order of this Court dated 22 April 2024\n\nshall stand recalled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">20.   Before parting with this judgment we would like to shed light on two issues\n\nwhich have caught our attention in these proceedings. First, the opinion of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                     Page 11 of 22</span>\n\fmedical board constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_10\">MTP Act</a> must reflect the effect of the\n\npregnancy on the pregnant person&#x27;s physical and mental health. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_11\">Second, the MTP\n\nAct</a> and the reproductive right of a pregnant person gives primacy to their\n\nconsent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n\nRole of the RMP and medical board under the MTP Act\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">21.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_12\">X v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>), 4 a three-judge bench of this Court had\n\nrecognised that the fear of prosecution among registered medical practitioners5\n\nis a barrier for pregnant persons6 to access safe and legal abortions. The opinion\n\nof the RMP is decisive in matters of termination of pregnancy under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_13\">MTP Act</a>.\n\nThe purpose of the opinion of the RMP borrows from the legislative intent of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_14\">MTP Act</a> which is to protect the health of a pregnant person and facilitate safe,\n\nhygienic, and legal abortion. The right to abortion is a concomitant right of dignity,\n\nautonomy and reproductive choice. This right is guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution. The decision to terminate pregnancy is deeply personal for any\n\nperson.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_16\">The choice exercised by a pregnant person is not merely about their\n\nreproductive freedom but also about their agency as recognised by this court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_16\">X v.

Moreover, no penalty may be attracted to a RMP merely\n\nfor forming an opinion, in good faith, on whether a pregnancy may be terminated.\n\nThis is because the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">MTP Act</a> requires and empowers the RMP to form such an\n\nopinion. Its bona fide assured, no aspersions may be cast on the RMP. The same\n\napplies to medical boards constituted under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3</a>(2-C) and <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_23\">D) of\n\nthe MTP Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">23.       The opinion of the RMP or the medical board, as the case may be, is\n\nindispensable under the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_24\">MTP Act</a>. This inadvertently gives the power\n\nto the RMP or the medical board to stand in the way of a pregnant person\n\nexercising their choice to terminate the pregnancy. When there is fear or\n\napprehension in the mind of the RMP or the medical board it directly jeopardises\n\nthe fundamental freedoms of pregnant persons guaranteed under the\n\nConstitution. However, the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_25\">MTP Act</a> and the steady line of\n\napplication of the law by the courts has made it clear that the RMP or the medical\n\nboard cannot be prosecuted for any act done under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_26\">MTP Act</a> in good faith.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">24.       In the present case, the medical board of the Grant Government Medical\n\nCollege &amp; Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai had prepared a report dated 28\n\nMarch 2024 stating that the pregnancy may be terminated in view of the physical\n\nand mental health of ‘X’. The report however sought the permission of the High\n\nCourt since the gestational age of the fetus was above twenty four weeks, which\n\n\n\n\n8 “<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">IPC</a>”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                          Page 13 of 22</span>\n\fis the permissible age for termination of pregnancy under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_28\">MTP Act</a>. What is\n\ninexplicable is the diametrically opposite view taken by the medical board in its\n\n‘clarificatory’ opinion dated 3 April 2024. As we have noted above, the medical\n\nboard issued a clarification without re-examining ‘X’. Moreover, the opinion did\n\nnot elaborate on the change in circumstances which prompted the board to issue\n\na clarification on its earlier opinion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_19\">25.    From a perusal of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_29\">MTP Act</a>, its statement of object and reasons as well\n\nas the recommendation of the Shah Committee which examined the issue of\n\nliberalising abortion laws in India, 9 two clear postulates emerge as to the legislative\n\nintent of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_30\">MTP Act</a>. Firstly, the health of the woman is paramount. This includes\n\nthe risk avoided from the woman not availing unsafe and illegal methods of\n\nabortion. Secondly, disallowing termination does not stop abortions, it only stops\n\nsafe and accessible abortions. The opinion of the RMP and the medical board\n\nmust balance the legislative mandate of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_31\">MTP Act</a> and the fundamental right\n\nof the pregnant person seeking a termination of the pregnancy. However, as\n\nnoticed above and by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_32\">X v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>) 10 the fear of\n\nprosecution among RMPs acts as a barrier for pregnant people in accessing safe\n\nabortion. Further, since the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_33\">MTP Act</a> only allows abortion beyond twenty four\n\nweeks if the fetus is diagnosed with substantial abnormalities, the medical board\n\nopines against termination of pregnancy merely by stating that the threshold\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_35\">B) of the MTP Act</a> is not satisfied. The clarificatory report dated\n\n3 April 2024 fell into this error by denying termination on the ground that the\n\n\n\n9 Report of the Committee to Study the Question of Legislation of Abortion, Ministry of Health\n\nand Family Planning, Government of India, dated December 1966.\n10 (2023) 9 SCC 433\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                                Page 14 of 22</span>\n\fgestational age of the fetus is above twenty-four weeks and there are no\n\ncongenital abnormalities in the fetus.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184376178\" id=\"span_21\">26.    The report failed to form an opinion on the impact of the pregnancy on the\n\nphysical and mental health of the pregnant person. If a pregnant person meets\n\nthe condition under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_37\">B) of the MTP Act</a> then there would be no need\n\nfor any permission by the courts. Therefore, whenever a pregnant person\n\napproaches the High Court or this Court, it is imperative for the medical board to\n\nopine on the physical and mental health of the pregnant person. This court in <a href=\"/doc/184376178/\" id=\"a_38\">XYZ\n\nv. State of Gujarat</a>, 11 held that the medical board or the High Court cannot refuse\n\nabortion merely on the ground that the gestational age of the pregnancy is\n\nabove the statutory prescription. In light of the peculiar circumstances of that case\n\nwhere the pregnancy was detrimental to the physical and mental health of the\n\npregnant person, this Court held that:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                “10.

The powers vested under the Constitution in the High Court and this Court\n\nallow them to enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the\n\nConstitution. When a person approaches the court for permission to terminate a\n\npregnancy, the courts apply their mind to the case and make a decision to\n\nprotect the physical and mental health of the pregnant person. In doing so the\n\ncourt relies on the opinion of the medical board constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_40\">MTP Act</a> for\n\ntheir medical expertise. The court would thereafter apply their judicial mind to the\n\nopinion of the medical board. Therefore, the medical board cannot merely state\n\nthat the grounds under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_42\">B) of the MTP Act</a> are not met. The exercise of\n\nthe jurisdiction of the courts would be affected if they did not have the advantage\n\nof the medical opinion of the board as to the risk involved to the physical and\n\nmental health of the pregnant person. Therefore, a medical board must examine\n\nthe pregnant person and opine on the aspect of the risk to their physical and\n\nmental health.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">28.   <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_43\">The MTP Act</a> has removed the restriction on the length of the pregnancy for\n\ntermination in only two instances. <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 5</a> of the MTP Act prescribes that a\n\npregnancy may be terminated, regardless of the gestational age, if the medical\n\npractitioner is of the opinion formed in good faith that the termination is\n\nimmediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant person. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 3</a>(2-B) of\n\nthe Act stipulates that no limit shall apply on the length of the pregnancy for\n\nterminating a fetus with substantial abnormalities.

To deny the same enabling provision of the law\n\nwould appear prima facie unreasonable and arbitrary. The value judgment of the\n\nlegislation does not appear to be based on scientific parameters but rather on a\n\nnotion that a substantially abnormal fetus will inflict the most aggravated form of\n\ninjury to the pregnant person. This formed the basis for this Court to exercise its\n\npowers and allow the termination of pregnancy in its order dated 22 April 2024.\n\nThe provision is arguably suspect on the ground that it unreasonably alters the\n\nautonomy of a person by classifying a substantially abnormal fetus differently than\n\ninstances such as incest or rape.

Moreover, we are conscious of the fact that the decision to terminate\n\npregnancy is one which a person takes seriously. The guidelines to terminate\n\npregnancy as well as the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_47\">MTP Act</a> show the seriousness attached\n\nto the well-being of the pregnant person throughout the process envisaged under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_48\">MTP Act</a>. Change in the opinion of the medical board may cause undue\n\ntrauma and exertion to a pregnant person whose mental health is understandably\n\nunder distress. While we understand the need for a medical board to issue a\n\nclarificatory opinion based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the\n\nboard must explain the reasons for the issuance of the clarification and, in\n\nparticular, if their opinion has changed from the earlier report. Pregnant persons\n\nseeking termination of pregnancy seek predictability for their future. The\n\nuncertainty caused by changing opinions of the medical board must therefore\n\nbalance the distress it would cause to the pregnant person by providing cogent\n\nand sound reasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                      Page 17 of 22</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172163761\" id=\"span_25\">30.    The opinion of the pregnant person must be given primacy in evaluating\n\nthe foreseeable environment of the person under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 3(3)</a> of the MTP Act. 12 In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/172163761/\" id=\"a_50\">Z v. State of Bihar</a>, 13 this Court found that the state authorities had failed in not\n\nterminating the pregnancy before the passage of twenty weeks which was\n\npermissible under the law. While a pregnancy beyond the statutory prescription\n\nwould require the intervention of a constitutional court, the vitality of time\n\nsensitivity was recognised by this Court. ‘X’ was taken for termination of her\n\npregnancy at the gestational age of twenty-five weeks in the present case. The\n\npassage of time in seeking the permission of this Court after being unsuccessful\n\nbefore the High Court matured the gestational age of the fetus to almost twenty-\n\nnine weeks. This increased the risk involved in ending the pregnancy of ‘X’\n\ninducing the voluntary change of opinion by ‘X’ and her parents to take the\n\npregnancy to term.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">31.    This highlights the need for giving primacy to the fundamental rights to\n\nreproductive autonomy, dignity and privacy of the pregnant person by the\n\nmedical board and the courts. The delays caused by a change in the opinion of\n\nthe medical board or the procedures of the court must not frustrate the\n\nfundamental rights of pregnant people. We therefore hold that the medical board\n\nevaluating a pregnant person with a gestational age above twenty-four weeks\n\nmust opine on the physical and mental health of the person by furnishing full\n\ndetails to the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_26\">12 <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_51\">X v.

As noted above, the order of this court allowing ‘X’ to terminate her\n\npregnancy is recalled. This decision is made in light of the decisional and bodily\n\nautonomy of the pregnant person and her parents. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_52\">The MTP Act</a> does not allow\n\nany interference with the personal choice of a pregnant person in terms of\n\nproceeding with the termination. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_53\">The Act</a> or indeed the jurisprudence around\n\nabortion developed by the courts leave no scope for interference by the family\n\nor the partner of a pregnant person in matters of reproductive choice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">33.    As stated above, the role of the RMPs and the medical board must be in a\n\nmanner which allows the pregnant person to freely exercise their choice. In the\n\npresent case, the guardians of ‘X’, namely her parents, have also consented for\n\ntaking the pregnancy to term. This is permissible as ‘X’ is a minor and the consent\n\nof the guardian is prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the MTP Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">34.     In Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Admn. 14, a three-judge Bench of this\n\nCourt has held that the right to make reproductive choices is a facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution. Further, the consent of the pregnant person in matters of\n\nreproductive choices and abortion is paramount. The purport of this Court’s\n\ndecision in Suchita Srivastava (supra) was to protect the right to abortion on a firm\n\nfooting as an intrinsic element of the fundamental rights to privacy, dignity and\n\nbodily integrity as well as to reaffirm that matters of sexual and reproductive\n\nchoices belong to the individual alone. In rejecting the State’s jurisdiction as the\n\nparens patriae of the pregnant person, this Court held that no entity, even if it is\n\n\n14 (2009) 9 SCC 1\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                        Page 19 of 22</span>\n\fthe State, can speak on behalf of a pregnant person and usurp her consent. The\n\nchoice to continue pregnancy to term, regardless of the court having allowed\n\ntermination of the pregnancy, belongs to the individual alone.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">35.     In the present case the view of ‘X’ and her parents to take the pregnancy\n\nto term are in tandem. The right to choose and reproductive freedom is a\n\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, where the\n\nopinion of a minor pregnant person differs from the guardian, the court must\n\nregard the view of the pregnant person as an important factor while deciding the\n\ntermination of the pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">\nConclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">36.
