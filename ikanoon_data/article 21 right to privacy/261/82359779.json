It is\n\nfurther contended that Kathi David Raju is not the son of first\n\npetitioner and brother of petitioners 2 &amp; 3. But, still the Additional\n\nJudicial First Class Magistrate, Bapatla, Guntur District passed\n\norders in CFR No.334 of 2016, dated 22.01.2016 directing the\n\npetitioners herein and Immadabatnuni Veeranjaneyulu (A-1) to\n\nundergo DNA test, which according to the petitioners is illegal and\n\nviolative of fundamental rights of the citizen, guaranteed under the\n\nConstitution of India, as it would bastardize the child.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1864942\" id=\"span_7\">It is also contended that, while passing the order, the\n\nMagistrate did not serve any notice on the petitioners and passing\n\nthe impugned order without giving an opportunity of hearing is\n\nonce again violative of principles of natural justice.

(SC, ST &amp; BC)\n\nRegulation of Issue of Community Certificates Act, 1993 and\n\nissuance of caste certificate by the District Collector is the only\n\nmethod to inquire into the caste of any person. Therefore, ordering\n\nthese petitioners to undergo DNA test along with Immadabatnuni\n\nVeeranjaneyulu      (A-1)   is    a    serious      illegality   and      violates\n\nfundamental      right   guaranteed        under     <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_4\">Article     20(3)</a>     of     the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">       Learned     Public        Prosecutor        also    contended             that\n\nImmadabatnuni Veeranjaneyulu @ Kathi David Raju (A-1) filed\n\nCrl.P.No.886 of 2016 which was dismissed as withdrawn.

Vide\n\norder dated 04.06.2018 this Court held that, ordering to conduct\n\nDNA test is not violative of any of the rights of A-1, including his\n                                                                          MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                            CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   6</span>\n\n\n\nfundamental rights and concluded that the prosecution is entitled\n\nto do so in the course of investigation and held that the Court\n\nbelow did not err in allowing the application and dismissed the\n\ncriminal petition.

The said science established\n\nthe belief that the pattern of chemical signals i.e. the genetic\n\nstructure which may be discovered with the DNA molecule in the\n\ncells of each individual, is unique and different in every individual.\n\nAs such, the chemical structure of the DNA in the cells of each\n\nindividual is the sole determining factor to identify one separately\n\nfrom another except the genetically identical twins. The discovery\n\nof modern genetic science can be used in identification of criminals\n\nin criminal cases by analysing various objects recovered on the\n\ncrime spot like any body fluid, hair root, saliva, fibres etc. which\n\nare associated with the crime and accurately linked to the\n\nperpetrator of the crime. Actually, this technology is utilised as a\n\nnew form of circumstantial evidence, which is placed on a higher\n\nfooting than the direct and ocular evidence because of its\n\nobjectivity, scientific accuracy, infallibility and impartial character.\n\nMoreover, this new technology is also extensively applied in civil\n\ncases in order to determine paternity or maternity disputes, baby-\n\nexchanging cases, succession cases, maintenance proceedings and\n\nmatrimonial disputes etc.\n\n\n      DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in\n\nhumans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a\n\nperson&#x27;s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell\n\nnucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of\n\nDNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called\n\nmitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).

Human DNA consists of about 3\n\nbillion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the\n\nsame in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases\n\ndetermines the information available for building and maintaining\n\nan organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet\n\nappear in a certain order to form words and sentences. DNA bases\n\npair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units\n\ncalled base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule\n\nand a phosphate molecule. Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate\n\nare called a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long\n\nstrands that form a spiral called a double helix. The structure of\n\nthe double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs\n\nforming the ladder&#x27;s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules\n\nforming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder. An important property\n\nof DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself. Each strand\n\nof DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating\n\nthe sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide because\n\neach new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in\n\nthe old cell.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      Mr.Justice R.K.Abichandani, Judge, High Court of Gujarat\n\nSola, Ahmedabad, has written an article on &quot;New biology and\n\ncriminal investigation&quot;.

Forensic DNA Technology has\n           revolutionized the modes of investigation of violent\n                                                                                  MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                    CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                       19</span>\n\n\n\n            crimes as a result of its awesome ability to convict a\n            perpetrator or exonerate a convicted offender. In sexual\n            assault and homicidal cases, the DNA evidence has\n            become a powerful crime fighting tool. The DNA evidence\n            in the form of saliva, blood, skin tissue, hair and semen\n            is often recovered from crime-scenes and is a crucial tool\n            for investigation of violent crimes. Testing methods\n            currently used for analyzing the DNA evidence are\n            considered to be very reliable. Polymerase Chain\n            Reaction (PCR) is the most common form of DNA\n            analysis, because of its capability to amplify very small\n            quantities of DNA. DNA testing can lead to three types of\n            results, namely, inclusion, i.e. when the DNA profile of a\n            known individual (a victim or suspect) matches the DNA\n            profile from the crime-scene evidence; exclusion i.e.\n            when the DNA profile from an individual (a victim or\n            suspect) does not match the DNA profile from the crime-\n            scene evidence; and inconclusive where the DNA testing\n            did not produce information that would allow an\n            individual to be either included or exonerated as the\n            source of the biological evidence. The real investigative\n            power of DNA technology is realized in the context of the\n            cases where a suspect has not yet been identified. (See\n            &#x27;Understanding DNA Evidence: A Guide for Victim\n            Service Providers, By Kathrun M.Turman O.V.C.\n            Bulletin, April 2001, U.S. Department of Justice).\n\n\n\nTHEORY OF CRIMINALISTICS/FORENSICS:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">         The division of matter and the exchange of material between\n\ntwo objects (Locard Exchange Theory), are scientific principles that\n\nrelate to the generation of evidence. These concepts of divisibility of\n\nmatter and transfer of material emerge from the fundamental\n\nnature of matter and they assume significance by way of evidence\n\nwhen division and transfer occur in conjunction with a criminal\n\nevent.     The   theory     that   makes      concepts      of   identification,\n\nclassification and individualization is one attributed Edmund\n\nLocard in the early 20th century. As per this theory, when two\n\nobjects come in contact, traces from one will be transferred to the\n\nother, and in both directions. These traces may not be always\n\ndetectable without scientific aid, but they are always present. This\n\nis known as Locard Transfer Theory, which is a linchpin of all\n\nforensic examination. The other concepts namely, identification,\n                                                                              MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                    20</span>\n\n\n\nassociation through class, individualizing characteristics and re-\n\nconstruction are integral to the practice of forensic science and are\n\nprocesses that are used to answer various investigative questions.\n\nThe transfer of matter requires its prior division. After the crime is\n\ncommitted, the process of recognition of evidence follows during\n\ninvestigation for discovering the evidence. However, even if such\n\nevidence is never detected, the matter is still divided and\n\ntransferred. It is only when answering investigative questions\n\nabout a crime that the processes of association through class and\n\nindividualizing   characteristics    and    of   re-   construction           are\n\nemployed. [Norah Rudin and Keith Inman, &#x27;An Introduction of\n\nForensic DNA Analysis 2nd Edition]. The process of identification\n\nanswers the case investigation question of &#x27;What is it? The process\n\nof   individualization   answers    the    question    of   &#x27;Who      is     it?&#x27;.\n\nClassification of a physical item is done on the basis of class\n\ncharacteristics. For example, an analyst can identify a human hair\n\non the basis of its microscopic characteristics that distinguish it\n\nfrom animal hair. Individualization relies on the acquisition of\n\ntraits that are so rare that it would be unreasonable to think of\n\nthem being duplicated by chance alone (ibid).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       DNA Analysis as Evidence DNA is the fundamental building\n\nblock of a person&#x27;s entire genetic make-up. DNA is found in all\n\nhuman cells and is the same in every cell of the same person.\n\nGenetic identity is unique. Hence, a person&#x27;s DNA profile can\n\ndetermine his identity.[See Maria Corazon A.

L.J. 57 (2001).] DNA analysis is a\n\nprocedure in which DNA extracted from a biological sample\n\nobtained from an individual is examined. The DNA is processed to\n\ngenerate a pattern, or a DNA profile, for the individual from whom\n\nthe sample is taken. This DNA profile is unique for each person,\n\nexcept for identical twins. (See The UP-NSRI DNA Analysis\n\nLaboratory, A Primer on DNA-based Paternity Testing (2001).\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      Everyone is born with a distinct genetic blueprint called DNA\n\n(deoxyribonucleic acid).It is exclusive to an individual (except in\n\nthe rare occurrence of identical twins that share a single, fertilized\n\negg).

DNA is part of every cell\n\nin the human body, change DNA of an individual&#x27;s blood remain in\n\nhis or her skin cells, hair follicles, muscles, semen, samples from\n\nbuccal swabs, saliva, or other body parts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">      Due to the development of theory of chromosomes and due\n\nto use of scientific investigation in criminal justice delivery system,\n\nthe Investigating Agency adopted modern techniques to establish a\n\nparticular fact. The word &#x27;criminalistic&#x27; is one sub-division of\n\nforensic sciences. Criminalistics is one subdivision of forensic\n\nsciences. The terms criminalistics and forensic sciences are often\n\nconfused and used interchangeably. Forensic sciences encompass\n\na variety of scientific disciplines such as medicine, toxicology,\n\nanthropology, entomology, engineering, odontology, and of course,\n\ncriminalistics. It is very difficult to provide an exact definition of\n\ncriminalistics, or the extent of its application, as it varies from one\n                                                                                   MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                                     CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                      22</span>\n\n\n\nlocation or country to another. However, the American Board of\n\nCriminalistics defines criminalistics as &quot;that profession and\n\nscientific discipline directed to the recognition, identification,\n\nindividualization,     and   evaluation        of    physical      evidence         by\n\napplication of the physical and natural sciences to law-sciences\n\nmatters.&quot; The California Association of Criminalistics provides a\n\nslightly   different    definition:    &quot;that        professional     occupation\n\nconcerned with the scientific analysis and examination of physical\n\nevidence, its interpretation, and its presentation in court.&quot; These\n\ndefinitions are very similar to the ones used for forensic sciences,\n\nas both disciplines have as a goal to provide scientific analysis of\n\nevidence for the legal system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      Thus, in view of the accuracy of DNA tests to determine the\n\npaternity or relationship, it is relevant under <a href=\"/doc/1610983/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 50</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, DNA examination of these petitioners and A-1 is\n\nhelpful to the prosecution. Therefore, examination of blood\n\nsamples of these petitioners and A-1 is necessary to resolve the\n\nissue in the present case and such test can be conducted by\n\nvarious DNA profiling methods such as, Restriction Fragment\n\nLength Polymorphism Analysis Method (RFLP Method), Polymerize\n\nChain Reaction (PCR) Method, Short Tandem Repeats (STR)\n\nMethod, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphization (AMPFLP)\n\nMethod,       Y-Chromosome Method, Mitochondrial Method.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">                                                                         MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                                           CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                  23</span>\n\n\n\n      Therefore, the purpose of DNA examination is only to prove\n\nthat A-1 is the son of the first petitioner and brother of petitioners\n\n2 &amp; 3 to determine the complicity of A-1 in the main case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">      The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nSri Metta Chandra Shekara Rao is that, direction issued by the\n\nMagistrate against these petitioners to give blood samples for DNA\n\nexamination is in violation of self-incrimination under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 20(3)</a>\n\nand also violation of Fundamental Right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">      One of the contention urged before this Court by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners is that, the caste of A-1 cannot be\n\ndetermined by directing him and the petitioners herein to undergo\n\nDNA test and it can be decided only by the Collector under the\n\nprovisions of A.P. (SC, ST &amp; BC) Regulation of Issue of Community\n\nCertificates Act, 1993, but it cannot be determined where A-1\n\nconspiring with these petitioners and others, obtained a caste\n\ncertificate, as if, he belongs to ST Community (Yanadi). But, the\n\npurpose of conducting examination is only to establish the fact\n\nthat A-1 is the son of the first petitioner and brothers of petitioners\n\n2 &amp; 3, to establish that, he does not belong to Yanadi community\n\nand he is not the son of Kathi Yedukondalu and he is not the\n\nperson by name Kathi David Raju. Though, it is not a relevant fact,\n\nbut still, it is admissible in evidence in view of <a href=\"/doc/692331/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 293</a> Cr.P.C\n\nand the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_45\">Indian Evidence Act</a> referred in the earlier\n\nparagraphs. Therefore, to determine the caste of A-1, prosecution\n                                                                             MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                                               CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                   24</span>\n\n\n\nis required to prove his paternity, who allegedly belong to Telaga\n\ncaste originally. Therefore, DNA examination is necessary to\n\nestablish the factum that A-1 is not the son of Kathi Yedukondalu\n\nand son of first petitioner by directing these petitioners and A-1 to\n\nundergo DNA examination. Therefore, the contention of the leaned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners is devoid of merits, since it is a question\n\nof impersonation and criminal liability of such person to who\n\nimpersonated cannot be determined by the Collector under the\n\nprovisions of A.P.

Breithaupt v. Morris\n\nAbram13, the legality of the involuntary testing was rejected by the\n\nCourt, and it was observed as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">               &quot;.. there is nothing `brutal&#x27; or `offensive&#x27; in the taking of a\n               blood sample when done as in this case, under the\n               protective eye of a physician. To be sure, the driver here\n               was unconscious when the blood was taken, but the\n               absence of conscious consent, without more, does not\n               necessarily render the taking a violation of a\n               constitutional right and certainly the test administered\n               here would not be considered offensive by even the most\n               delicate. Furthermore, due process is not measured by\n               the yardstick of personal reaction or the sphygmogram of\n               the most sensitive person, but by that whole community\n               sense of `decency and fairness&#x27; that has been woven by\n               common experience into the fabric of acceptable\n               conduct. It is on this bedrock that this Court has\n               established the concept of due process. The blood test\n               procedure has become routine in our everyday life. It is a\n               ritual for those going into the military service as well as\n               those applying for marriage licenses. Many colleges\n               require such tests before permitting entrance and\n               literally millions of us have voluntarily gone through the\n               same, though a longer, routine in becoming blood\n               donors. Likewise, we note that a majority of our States\n               have either enacted statutes in some form authorizing\n               tests of this nature or permit findings so obtained to be\n               admitted in evidence. We therefore conclude that a blood\n               test taken by a skilled technician is not such `conduct\n               that shocks the conscience&#x27; [Rochin v. California, 342 US\n               165, 172 (1952)], nor such a method of obtaining\n               evidence that it offends a `sense of justice&#x27; [Brown v.\n               Mississippi, 297 US 278, 285 (1936)]...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">               Since there clearly was no consent to the blood test, it is\n               the nature of the invasion of the body that should be\n               determinative of the due process question here\n               presented. The Court&#x27;s opinion suggests that an invasion\n               is &quot;brutal&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; only if the police use force to\n               overcome a suspect&#x27;s resistance. By its recital of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">13</span>\n     352 US 432 (1957)\n                                                                                 MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                   CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                     30</span>\n\n\n\n          facts in Rochin-the references to a &quot;considerable\n          struggle&quot; and the fact that the stomach pump was\n          &quot;forcibly used&quot; - the Court finds Rochin distinguishable\n          from this case. I cannot accept an analysis that would\n          make physical resistance by a prisoner a prerequisite to\n          the existence of his constitutional rights. Apart from the\n          irrelevant factor of physical resistance, the techniques\n          used in this case and in Rochin are comparable. In each,\n          the operation was performed by a doctor in a hospital. In\n          each there was an extraction of body fluids. Neither\n          operation normally causes any lasting ill effects. The\n          Court denominates a blood test as a scientific method for\n          detecting crime and cites the frequency of such tests in\n          our everyday life. The stomach pump too is a common\n          and accepted way of making tests and relieving distress.\n          But it does not follow from the fact that a technique is a\n          product of science or is in common, consensual use for\n          other purposes that it can be used to extract evidence\n          from a criminal defendant without his consent. Would\n          the taking of spinal fluid from an unconscious person be\n          condoned because such tests are commonly made and\n          might be used as a scientific aid to law enforcement?\n          Only personal reaction to the stomach pump and the\n          blood test can distinguish them. To base the restriction\n          which the Due Process Clause imposes on state criminal\n          procedures upon such reactions is to build on shifting\n          sands. We should, in my opinion, hold that due process\n          means at least that law-enforcement officers in their\n          efforts to obtain evidence from persons suspected of\n          crime must stop short of bruising the body, breaking\n          skin, puncturing tissue or extracting body fluids,\n          whether they contemplate doing it by force or by stealth&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_87\">(Emphasis supplied)\n\n      The same principles were followed by the Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_66\">Selvi v.

Valsan s/o Kannan Nambiar v. Station House\n\nOfficer [Crl. Misc. No.1629/2008, decided on 16.6.2008), the\n\nKerala High Court has observed, &quot;the right of police to draw the\n\nsamples from an accused person for the purpose of DNA profiling\n\nis accepted by law. There is no question of any infringement of the\n\nright of privacy or right against self- incrimination. It is by now\n\ntrite that in course of investigation, the DNA test can be\n\nconducted.&quot; The privilege of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 20(3)</a> is applicable only to\n\ntestimonial evidence. Obtaining DNA samples from an accused in a\n\ncriminal case or from the respondent in a paternity and sexual\n\nexploitation case, contrary to the belief of respondent in this\n\naction, will not violate his right against self-incrimination. This\n\nprivilege applies only to evidence i.e testimony in essence taken\n\nunder duress. The Courts have ruled that the right against self-\n\nincrimination is just a prohibition on the use of physical or moral\n\ncompulsion to extort testimonial evidence from a respondent, not\n\nan exclusion of evidence taken from his body when it may be\n\nmaterial and thus, the court can compel a person male or female\n\nto submit for DNA test since the gist of the privilege is the\n\nrestriction       on    testimonial        compulsion.

The concerns fall into three\n\nbasic areas: first, if a person has given consent to have his or her\n\nDNA used for a specific purpose, must the DNA be destroyed or\n\ncan it be used for other purposes as well. If a person must give\n\nconsent for a specific purpose, what happens if the person is no\n\nlonger able to give consent. Finally, if the testing of one person&#x27;s\n\nDNA yields information that is likely, or probable, or certain to\n\nimpact another person, does that person have a right to know the\n\ninformation discovered. There are variations on these questions --\n\nas for example does DNA is permitted to be taken without consent\n\n(to test for a crime, perhaps), does that lack of need for consent\n\npermit all uses of DNA that others want. The complexity of these\n\nquestions demonstrates that in the situation of DNA collection and\n\ntesting privacy cannot be protected simply through consent from\n\nan individual. Therefore, it is the duty of the labs to take care to\n\nuse protective measures in misusing DNA test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">                                                                      MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                        CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                  36</span>\n\n\n\n           The use of DNA has raised a number of concerns about\n\nincreased police powers and the unquestioning adoption of a\n\nconservative crime control agenda in the administration of criminal\n\njustice system. International human rights law provides that\n\neveryone has a right to a fair and public hearing by the\n\nindependent and impartial tribunal. It is essential to a fair trial\n\nthat the suspects have the opportunity to challenge the reliability\n\nof the scientific testing. In order to use DNA profiling, it is\n\nnecessary to obtain certain types of body material. The sample may\n\nbe obtained by chance. In a case where the sample is obtained\n\nwithout coercion (for example, by taking a hair follicle from the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s clothing) the sample is lawfully obtained both in India\n\nand many other countries. According to this view, DNA testing as\n\nsuch is an interference with the right to integrity of the body,\n\nresulting from prior interference, caused by the taking of body\n\nmaterials against the suspect&#x27;s will.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_114\">In <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_96\">Gautam Kundu v.

Summary of key guidance on DNA testing to establish\n         family relationships in the refugee context\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">          a) A rights and dignity-based approach to DNA testing in\n         the context of establishing family relationships\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">          16. In light of its intrusive nature and risks of infringing\n         an individual&#x27;s right to privacy, it is reiterated that every\n         step should be taken to ensure that DNA testing to verify\n         claimed family relationships is conducted only as a last\n         resort. At the same time, where there are strong\n         indications of intent to commit fraud on the part of the\n         individuals claiming the existence of family relationships,\n         and DNA testing is considered the only reliable means to\n         prove or disprove fraud, resort to it would help secure\n         important objectives of securing the integrity of the\n         programmes concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">          17. Clear criteria should be established by States in\n         regard to the circumstances in which DNA testing is\n         considered as necessary for the purpose of establishing\n         family relations, including in the context of admission for\n         family reunification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">          18. A rights and dignity-sensitive approach means that\n         DNA testing to establish family relationships should be\n         strictly regulated to ensure that safeguards guaranteeing\n         non-discrimination and the individuals&#x27; right to privacy\n         are provided.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">         19. Explicit and informed consent is necessary from the\n         persons concerned before the test is administered. In the\n         case of minors who are capable of forming their own\n         views, they should also be able to participate in the\n         decision making process, express their views and give\n         their consent.15 Parents of minors should give their\n         consent prior\n\n         to the testing of the child, while, in the case of\n         unaccompanied or separated children, the guardian&#x27;s\n         consent is required. As appropriate, parents who are\n         separated from their children should be assisted to\n         communicate with each other and make the decision\n         jointly. DNA testing on children should only be done\n         based on &quot;best interests considerations&quot;.16\n                                                                        MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                                          CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                            40</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\"> 20. DNA testing should be performed by qualified\npersonnel who should be sensitized to rules of\nconfidentiality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">21. DNA testing to establish family relationships should\nbe preceded by pre-test counseling which should be\nensured by the authority requiring the test. Such pre-\ntest counseling should provide all relevant information to\nthe individuals concerned so that an informed choice can\nbe made. The technicalities of the test, the reasons for it\nas well as implications of refusing to undergo it should\nbe explained. The individuals concerned should also be\ncounseled on the possibility of unexpected results. This\nwould help avert potential protection risks which may\narise due to emotional trauma faced when the results are\nunexpected.17\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\"> 22. As part of the pre-test counseling explained in this\nnote, principal applicants or others concerned should be\nurged to disclose relationships which, although\nculturally treated the same way as blood relationships,\nare, to their knowledge, not so. The option available to\nsuch family members to join the principals in the context\nof family reunification or resettlement in their own right\nshould be explained. They should have a clear\nunderstanding that where the claimed relationship is\ndisproved through DNA testing, unless there are strong\nand clear extenuating circumstances, the application is\nalmost certain to fail.18\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\"> 23. Pre-test counseling should be performed by qualified\npersonnel and should take place on a confidential basis.\nThe individuals concerned should be given time to\nconsider the option.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\"> 24. The authority requiring the test should ensure that\ndisclosure of negative results is undertaken with great\nsensitivity for the emotional and psychological wellbeing\nof persons concerned. Consideration should be given to\nhow the information is to be disclosed, to whom, and in\nwhat order of priority. The situation of the individuals\nshould be monitored closely and post-test counseling\nshould be provided to avert potential protection risks. In\ncase of a negative result, it should be possible for a\nsecond test to be performed so as to ensure utmost\nreliability of the results. In cases where DNA testing\ninvolving persons of concern has been conducted with\nUNHCR&#x27;s knowledge, cooperation or support and the\nresults of the tests are relevant to the propriety or\nintegrity of UNHCR operations, protocols should be\nestablished for the provision to UNHCR of those results\nin the appropriate formal manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\"> 25. Disclosure of the results of DNA testing should\nstrictly respect rules of confidentiality. In regard to the\nentity or personnel performing the test, it should\n\nreveal the outcome of the test only to the authority which\nhas requested it. In regard to disclosure to interested\nparties, the results should be conveyed by the authority\nrequiring the test only to the persons subjected to the\ntest, or, in case of children, their parents or guardians\n                                                                        MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                          CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                            41</span>\n\n\n\nwho have given consent on their behalf.

For purposes of data protection, and in the context\nof verifying family relationships, no data should be\ncollected from the DNA sample except that which is\nnecessary for proving the family relationship. The\ninformation should not be used for any other purpose\n(for instance medical tests or criminal investigations)\nthan the verification of family relationships.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\"> 27. All materials associated with the test should\nnormally be destroyed once a decision has been made. If\nthey are to be stored, the subjects of the test should be\ninformed of the reasons, where this will take place, and\ntheir consent must be obtained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">b) Family unity of refugees and DNA testing\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_93\"> 28. DNA testing can be intrusive and potentially have\nserious negative consequences. On the other hand, it can\nbe the only alternative to meet important operational\nobjectives. Its use to establish family links in the refugee\ncontext should be resorted to carefully and judiciously as\nset out in this note. Documentary proof, registration\nrecords, interviews with the individuals concerned and\nother forms of verification of the claimed family\nrelationship should normally be relied on first. The\nbenefit of the doubt should be given where the evidence\nis overall corroborative of presumed relationships and\nthere are no serious doubts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\"> 29. Even if DNA tests disprove any blood links, this\nshould not be conclusive of fraudulent intent, as there\nmay be other reasons why the individual concerned\nclaims a particular relationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\"> 30. UNHCR promotes a liberal and wide definition of\n&quot;family&quot; to enable refugees to maintain the unity of their\nfamilies as they are accustomed to in their country of\norigin. Regard should be given to social and cultural\nnorms of the society from which the refugees originate,\nas well as emotional dependency and long term\nacceptance of the claimed relationships when\nconsidering family reunification of refugee families.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\"> 31. Where DNA testing is undertaken to establish a\nparent/child relationship, UNHCR recommends that\nconsideration be given to the administration of the test\non only one parent, normally the mother. If the\nmother/child relationship is established, a proven\nmarriage19 between the mother and her spouse should\nsuffice to establish the father/child relationship without\nthe necessity of the purported father having to undergo a\nDNA test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">c) Other considerations\n                                                                                   MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                                                     CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                         42</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">            32. DNA testing should not delay the often already\n           lengthy family reunification process. The cost of a DNA\n           test should be borne by the State requiring the test.\n           Costs associated with DNA testing requested by refugees\n           could be waived on humanitarian grounds, or, at least,\n           the relevant government could consider reimbursing the\n           costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">\n\n\n      By    applying     the    guidelines      of   United     Nations         High\n\nCommissioner for Refugees, issuing directions to give blood\n\nsamples    is   not    violative    of    human      rights   guaranteed            by\n\ninternational covenants of human rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_101\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"673012\" id=\"span_142\">Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that, when\n\ncaste cannot be determined based on the blood samples, what\n\ncannot be done directly, cannot also be done indirectly and\n\ndirecting them to undergo DNA test and examination would\n\namount to determination of paternity of the child, which cannot be\n\npermitted under law directly. Learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nplaced reliance on the judgment of Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/673012/\" id=\"a_112\">Smt. Ujjam\n\nBai v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (referred supra), wherein, in\n\nparagraph 182 of the Judgment, it was held as follows:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">           &quot;One more point needs to be dealt with. It was said that\n           a quasi-judicial tribunal being an instrumentality of the\n           State its action is State action and so it will be under\n           the same disabilities as the State to do a thing which it\n           is incompetent or impermissible for the State to do. &#x27;It is\n           also said that what a State cannot do directly it cannot\n           do indirectly. In so far as the incompetency of the State\n           arises out of a constitutional prohibition or lack of legal\n           authority due to any reason whatsoever, it will attach\n           itself to the action of the quasijudicial tribunal\n           purporting to act as the instrumentality_ of the State.\n           Where, in such a case, any fundamental right of a\n           person is violated by the action of the quasi-judicial\n           tribunal that person is entitled to treat the action as\n           arbitrary or a nullity and come up to this court under.\n           <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_113\">Art. 32</a> because the, action would be one which is not\n           authorised by law. But while an erroneous action of the\n           State in exercise of its administrative functions can be\n           challenged directly under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_114\">Art. 32</a> if it affects a person&#x27;s\n                                                                          MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                            CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                             43</span>\n\n\n\nfundamental right on the ground that it is not\nauthorised by law the action of the tribunal pursuant to\nan erroneous order will not be open to challenge for the\nreason that its action arises out of the exercise of a\njudicial power and is thus authorised by law, State\naction though it be. When, Under the provisions of a\nlaw, the State exercises judicial power, as for instance,\nby entertaining an appeal or revision or assessing or\nlevying a tax it acts as a quasi-judicial tribunal and its\ndecision even though erroneous will not be a nullity and\ncannot be ignored. It can be corrected only under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_115\">Art.\n226</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_116\">Art. 227</a> by the High Court or under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_117\">Art. 136</a> by\nthis Court inasmuch as the State would then be acting\nas a quasi- judicial tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">To summarise, my conclusions are these\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">1. The question of enforcement of a fundamental right\nwill arise if a tax is assessed under a law which is (a)\nvoid under <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_118\">Art. 13</a> or (b) is ultra vires the Constitution\nor (c) where it is subordinate legislation, it is ultra vires\nthe law under which it is made or inconsistent with any\nother law in force.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">2. A similar question will also arise if the tax is assessed\nand/or levied by an authority\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(a) other than the one empowered to do so under the\ntaxing law or (b) in violation of the procedure prescribed\nby the law or (c) in colourable exercise of the powers\nconferred by the law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"673012\" id=\"span_145\">3. No fundamental right is breached and consequently\nno question of enforcing a funda- mental right arises\nwhere a tax is assessed and levied bona fide, by a\ncompetent authority under a valid law by following the\nprocedure <a href=\"/doc/673012/\" id=\"a_119\">laid down by</a> that law, even though it be\nbased upon an erroneous construction of the law except\nwhen by reason of the construction placed upon the law\na tax is assessed and levied which is beyond the\ncompetence of the legislature or is violative of the\nprovisions of Part III or of any other provisions of the\nConstitution.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">4. A mere misconstruction of a provision of law does not\nrender the decision of a quasi- judicial tribunal void (as\nbeing beyond its jurisdiction). It is a good and valid deci-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">sion in law until and unless it is corrected in the\nappropriate manner. So long as that decision stands,\ndespite its being erroneous, it must be regarded as one\nauthorised by law and where, under such a decision a\nperson is held liable to pay a tax that person cannot\ntreat the decision as a nullity and contend that what is\ndemanded of him is something which is not authorised\nby law. The position would be the same even though\nupon a proper construction, the law under which the\ndecision was given did not authorise such a levy.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">                                                    (emphasis supplied)\n                                                                               MSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                                                 CrlP.No.6083 of 2018</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                                     44</span>\n\n\n\n       This principle is not in dispute, but it has no relevance to the\n\npresent facts of the case, for the reason that, the first petitioner is\n\nthe alleged biological mother of A-1 and petitioners 2 &amp; 3 are the\n\nnatural brothers of A-1. When A-1 is claiming to be son of Kathi\n\nYedukondalu, who is the father of Kathi David Raju, a drop out at\n\nVI Standard, the only possible test is DNA test, directing the\n\npetitioners i.e. biological mother (first petitioner) and brothers\n\n(petitioners 2 &amp; 3) and A-1 to undergo DNA test, as scientific\n\nevidence would help in criminal investigation.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_104\">       Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners that permitting the investigating agency indirectly to do\n\nsomething    which     cannot   be    done    directly   is   without         any\n\nsubstance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_106\">       Learned   Public    Prosecutor       contended     Immadabatnuni\n\nVeeranjaneyulu @ Kathi David Raju (A-1) filed Crl.P.No.886 of\n\n2016    which    was   dismissed     as     withdrawn.
