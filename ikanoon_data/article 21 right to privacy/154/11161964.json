This is an application under Section 397 read with <a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 401</a> of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the order dated 26.02.2020, passed by the\nlearned     Special      Judge,     CBI,   Guwahati    in    CBI   Case     No.    RC-\n                                                                       Page No.# 3/33\n\n01(A)/2019/CBI/ACB/Guwahati, whereby the prayer for recording of voice\nsamples of accused/ respondents was rejected by the learned Special Judge,\nCBI.\n\n\n3.     In brief, it is the case of the petitioner/CBI that the CBI-ACB, Guwahati\nBranch has registered a case vide Case No. RC0172019A0001 against Shri\nDibyajyoti Dutta (A1), General Manager (Sales) IOC, (AOD), Guwahati; Shri\nLalchand Choudhary @ Lalaram (A2); Shri Laxmi Narayan Sogani @ LichuBabu\n(A3); Shri Tony @ Ankeet (A4); Ms. Bendangnaro Ao (A5); and some other\nunknown persons under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code read with\nSection 7 (A), 8 &amp; 12 of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018\nbased on source information and accordingly the matter was taken up for\ninvestigation. It is alleged in the F.I.R. that the respondent/ Dibyajyoti Dutta,\nwhile working as General Manager (Sales), Indian Oil Corporation (Assam Lil\nDivision), Guwahati during the year 2018-19, has entered into a criminal\nconspiracy with other accused persons, who were officially dealing with him, by\nabusing his official position and demanded and accepted illegal gratification\nfrequently   from   private   accused   persons   and   other   different   private\nbusinessmen owing Petrol Pump and/or having Kerosene Oil Dealership in\nconnivance with few private firm for showing them official favour in allotment of\nnew Retail Outlets for the places spread all over the Northeast States including\nthe Assam.\n\n\n4.     During investigation, all the 5 (five) numbers of F.I.R. named accused\npersons were arrested and produced before the learned Special Judge, CBI at\nGuwahati and after expiry of the police remand, all the accused persons were\n                                                                       Page No.# 4/33\n\nsent to judicial custody. The recording of the conversations held between the\naccused persons were also collected. The conversations between Dibyajyoti\nDutta (A1) and Laxmi Narayan Sogani @ LichuBabu (A3) and conversation\nbetween Dibyajyoti Dutta (A1) and Tony @ Ankeet (A4), which were recorded\nindicates illegal transaction between the accused persons. During the relevant\nperiod of time, Tony @ Ankeet (A4) was working as Manager under Laxmi\nNarayan Sogani @ LichuBabu (A3) in M/S Danmal Sogani &amp; Sons, Fancy Bazar,\nGuwahati and the recorded conversations of the accused persons and its\ntranscription has already indicated the role of all the accused persons.\n\n\n5.   During investigation, all the accused persons were requested to give their\nvoice sample for the purpose of getting expert opinion on recorded\nconversation, out of which the respondents- Shri Dibyajyoti Dutta (A1), Shri\nLaxmi Narayan Sogani (A3) and Shri Ankeet Jain (A4) have refused to provide\nvoice sample for the said purpose which also caused inordinate delay in the\ninvestigation of this case.\n\n\n6.   In order to obtain voice sample of the accused persons, an application was\nalready preferred by the CBI before the Court of learned Special Judge, CBI,\nGuwahati as the voice samples were needed for fair investigation. But, on\n26.02.2020, the learned Special Judge, CBI had dismissed the application filed\nby the CBI stating that the CBI failed to test to ascertain that the interceptions\nof Tele-conversations so made were carried out in legal way as per the provision\nof <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1988 and Rule 419 of Indian\nTelegraph Rules (Amendment) Rules, 2007.\n                                                                      Page No.# 5/33\n\n7.    The learned Special Judge, CBI, while dismissing the petition, clearly\noverlooked the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 5(5)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act read with\nRule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, which authorize law enforcement\nagencies to seek for legal interceptions of telephonic conversations in\nconnection with offences of serious nature. The Indian Telegraph Amendment\nRules, 2007 further provides that all request for such interceptions would only\nbe considered after due examination/ screening by Review Committee setup\nunder the provision of said Rules headed by the Cabinet Secretary, Government\nof India, consisting of Secretary of Government of India, In-Charge, the legal\naffairs and the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Tele\nCommunications.\n\n\n8.    It is further stated that out of 11 numbers of letters of permission of\ninterception, 9 numbers were granted by the Union Home Secretary to the\nGovernment of India and 2 numbers of permissions were granted by the\nDirector, CBI after due examinations of the request and considering the fact that\ninterceptions were sought for the interest of the public order and safety and to\nprevent incitement to the commission of an offence. All the permissions were\nconsidered under the provision of Indian Telegraph Rules and the original Case\nDiary files with regard to the seizure of original documents relating to the\npermissions issued by the competent authorities, i.e. Union Home Secretary and\nDirector, CBI, placed with CD No. 85, dated 25.09.2019, before the learned\nSpecial Judge, CBI. But the learned Special Judge, CBI erred in law by not\ngiving it due consideration and the petitioner, therefore, craves leave of the\nCourt to produce the same along with original permissions and letters. Thus, the\nCBI duly complied with all the provisions of law while intercepting the telephonic\n                                                                       Page No.# 6/33\n\nconversations of phone numbers of the accused persons.\n\n\n9.    Mr. Haloi, learned Special Public Prosecutor, CBI submitted that the\npurpose of taking the voice sample is not the physical evidence and it is only to\ncompare with the tapped recorded conversations which is a physical characters\nof the accused, but the learned Special Judge, CBI failed to consider this aspect\nof the matter and rejected the prayer of the prosecution and as such, the\nimpugned order is liable to be set aside and quashed. He further submitted that\nthe recording of voice sample of the accused persons is very much necessary for\nproper investigation of the matter and to compare the same with the recorded\nvoice samples of the accused persons which is fair and reasonable having due\nregard to the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of Indian. More so, the\nlearned Special Judge, CBI failed to appreciate the fact that the voice samples is\na vital evidence to prove the case as in such cases, other corroborative\nevidences are rare and as such, the impugned order of rejecting the prayer for\nrecording the voice samples of the accused respondents is liable to be set aside\nand quashed.\n\n\n10.    Mr. Haloi accordingly submitted that for the purpose of proper\ninvestigation of this case, the recording of the voice samples of the accused\nrespondents are very much essential to compare with the recorded voice\nsamples of the accused respondents and therefore prayed for setting aside and\nquashing of the order passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI rejecting the\nprayer of the CBI for recording of the voice samples.\n\n11.   The learned counsels appearing for the respondents, while hearing the\npetition, apart from raising some other issues, raised the issue of limitations and\n                                                                       Page No.# 7/33\n\nit is submitted that the present petition is filed beyond the period of limitation\nwhich cannot be entertained. During the pendency of the present petition, the\npetitioners filed one Interlocutory Application which is registered as I.A.(Crl.)\nNo. 505/2024 under <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act praying for condonation of\ndelay of 22 days in preferring the present revision petition after rejection of\nprayer of recording of voice samples by the learned Special Judge, CBI.\n\n\n12. So, before discussing on the other issues, let us discuss on the issue raised\nby the learned counsels for the respondents in regards to the point of limitation.\n\n\n13. It is submitted by Mr. Haloi, learned Special Public Prosecutor, CBI that the\nimpugned order was passed on 26.02.2020 and thus, the last date of filing of\nthe criminal revision petition expires after 90 days of limitation on 25.05.2020,\nbut the criminal revision petition could be filed on 16.06.2020 and as such,\nthere was a delay of 22 days in filing the same. He further submitted that the\ndelay was only due to obtaining the approval and to comply with some\nprocedure of the Department and hence, it could be filed only with a delay of 22\ndays. There is no intentional laches or negligence on the part of the petitioner\nor on the part of its advocate, but only for observing some official/departmental\nformalities, the petition was filed with a delay of 22 days. In this context, Mr.\nHaloi also relied on a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court reported vide (2021) 7\nSCC 313 [Seshnath Singh &amp; Anr. Vs. Baidyabati Sheoraphuli Co-\noperative Bank Limited &amp; Anr.], wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has\nexpressed the view that there is no bar to exercise by Court/Tribunal of its\ndiscretion to condone the delay even in absence of a formal application. Further,\nMr. Haloi admitted that the petition was not supported with a separate\n                                                                                 Page No.# 8/33\n\napplication for condonation of delay, but the delay was only due to observing\nsome formalities of department/office and there was no laches or negligence on\nthe part of the prosecution to file the petition with a delay of 22 days. He\nbasically emphasized on paragraph Nos. 59, 61 &amp; 100 of the said judgment,\nwhich reads as under:\n\n\n      &quot;59. The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or\n      appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause. Whether the explanation furnished for the\n      delay would constitute &#x27;sufficient cause&#x27; or not would dependent upon facts of each\n      case. There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the\n      explanation furnished by the applicant/appellant for the delay in taking steps.\n      Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when\n      no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party.\n      61. <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not speak of any application. The\n      Section enables the Court to admit an application or appeal if the applicant or the\n      appellant, as the case may be, satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not\n      making the application and/or preferring the appeal, within the time prescribed.\n      Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 5</a> of the\n      Limitation Act, 1963, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency\n      of the cause for the inability of the appellant/applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal\n      within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the\n      Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal\n      application.\n      100. In any case, <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act are not mutually\n      exclusive. Even in a case where <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 14</a> does not strictly apply, the principles of\n      <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 14</a> can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 5</a> of the\n      Limitation Act by purposively construing &#x27;sufficient cause&#x27;. It is well settled that\n      omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order. At the\n      cost of repetition it is reiterated that delay can be condoned irrespective of whether\n      there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing\n      sufficient cause for the delay.&quot;\n\n\n14.   Mr. Haloi further relied on another decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nreported vide (1963) SCC OnLine SC 59 [Manindra Land and Building\n                                                                            Page No.# 9/33\n\nCorporation Ltd. Vs. Bhutnath Banerjee &amp; Ors.] wherein also the Apex\nCourt has expressed the view that <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act empowers the\nCourt to admit an application even if it is presented after expiry of the specified\nperiod of limitation if it is satisfied that the applicant has sufficient cause for not\npresenting it within time.\n\n\n15. Accordingly, Mr. Haloi submitted that inadvertently the separate application\nfor condonation of delay was not presented while preferring the revision\npetition, though it was filed after expiry of the limitation period with a delay of\n22 days, but considering the entire facts and circumstances of this case, the\npresent petition may be entertained condoning the delay of 22 days in\npreferring the present revision petition.\n\n\n16. In this context, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.\n1, by filing his affidavit-in-opposition, submitted that the present criminal\nrevision petition cannot be entertained which is barred by the period of\nlimitation and the petition for condonation of delay under <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5</a> of the\nLimitation Act required to be filed at the time of filing the connected criminal\nrevision petition and at this stage, the separate petition for condonation of delay\ncannot be entertained. The learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 also\nsubmitted in this regard that the period of limitation is continuous and it runs\nfrom the time of filing the criminal revision petition and the actual delay is to be\ncounted till filing of the instant petition. Till the filing of the instant petition, the\ndelay is of 1461 days and thus, after such long gap of period of 4 years, the\ninstant application for condonation of delay is not at all maintainable and the\nsame is liable to be dismissed. More so, in the instant petition, the petitioner\n                                                                                Page No.# 10/33\n\ncould not show sufficient cause explaining the delay to condone the delay of\n1461 days in preferring the present petition for condonation of delay.\n\n\n17.   The learned counsels representing the respondents further relied on the\nfollowing decisions in support of their submissions:\n\n\n      (i)    (1999) 8 SCC 266 [Chandra Kishore Jha Vs. Mahavir\n             Prasad &amp; Ors.], wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has                  expressed\n             the view that if a statute provides for a thing to be done             in    a\n             particular manner, then it has to be done in that            manner and in\n             no other manner.\n      (ii)   Crl. A. No. 1133/2014 (arising out of SLP Crl. No.\n             2531/2014), decided on 08.05.2014, wherein also the\n             Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has expressed the similar view.\n      (iii) SLP Civil No. 31248/2018 [Pathapati Subba Reddy\n             (died) by L.Rs. &amp; Ors. Vs. The Special Deputy Collector (LA),\n             and the learned counsels for the respondents have emphasized on\n             paragraph No. 26 of the judgment, which reads as under:\n\n\n                &quot;26. On a harmonious consideration of the provisions of the law, as\n                aforesaid, and the law laid down by this Court, it is evident that:\n                (i) Law of limitation is based upon public policy that there should be an end\n                to litigation by forfeiting the right to remedy rather than the right itself;\n                (ii) A right or the remedy that has not been exercised or availed of for a long\n                time must come to an end or cease to exist after a fixed period of time;\n                (iii) The provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_16\">Limitation Act</a> have to be construed differently,\n                such as <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 3</a> has to be construed in a strict sense whereas <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n                5</a> has to be construed liberally;\n                                                                               Page No.# 11/33\n\n\n\n               (iv) In order to advance substantial justice, though liberal approach, justice-\n               oriented approach or cause of substantial justice may be kept in mind but\n               the same cannot be used to defeat the substantial law of limitation\n               contained in <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 3</a> of the Limitation Act;\n               (v) Courts are empowered to exercise discretion to condone the delay if\n               sufficient cause had been explained, but that exercise of power is\n               discretionary in nature and may not be exercised even if sufficient cause is\n               established for various factors such as, where there is inordinate delay,\n               negligence and want of due diligence;\n               (vi) Merely some persons obtained relief in similar matter, it does not mean\n               that others are also entitled to the same benefit if the court is not satisfied\n               with the cause shown for the delay in filing the appeal;\n               (vii) Merits of the case are not required to be considered in condoning the\n               delay; and\n               (viii) Delay condonation application has to be decided on the parameters laid\n               down for condoning the delay and condoning the delay for the reason that\n               the conditions have been imposed, tantamounts to disregarding the\n               statutory provision.&quot;\n\n\n\n18. So, it is the case of the petitioner that the present criminal revision petition\nis filed with a delay of 22 days though there is no separate prayer for limitation\nannexed along with the petition. One Interlocutory Application under <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 5</a>\nof the Limitation Act was presented only during the pendency of the present\nrevision petition by the learned Special Public Prosecutor, CBI for condoning the\ndelay of 22 days in preferring the petition.\n\n\n\n19. On the other hand, it is the plea of the respondents that there is a delay of\n4 years in presenting the petition for condonation of delay under <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 5</a> of\nthe Limitation Act and hence, such petition for condonation of delay cannot be\nentertained at this stage. Further it is submitted by the learned counsel for the\n                                                                          Page No.# 12/33\n\nrespondents that there was no condonation petition at time of preferring the\nrevision petition by the petitioner nor there is any whisper in the petition itself in\nregards to delay in preferring the criminal revision petition.\n\n\n20.   In case of Seshnath Singh (supra), as relied by the learned Special\nPublic Prosecutor, CBI, it is the view of the Apex Court that condition precedent\nfor condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of\nsufficient cause. It is to be seen as to whether the explanation furnished by the\npetitioner would constitute &#x27;sufficient cause&#x27; and the &#x27;sufficient cause&#x27; would\ndependent upon the facts of each of the case. Here in the instant case, as\ndiscussed above, the petitioner could not prefer the revision petition within the\nstatutory period of limitation. Criminal revision petition could be filed by the\npetitioner   after   observing   all   necessary    required     formalities   of   the\ndepartment/concerned office and also took some time to get the approval from\nthe higher authority. Thus, the explanation brought by the petitioner can be\nconsidered as reasonable and justified ground for delay in preferring the\nrevision petition. More so, the delay was only for 22 days which can be\ncondoned for the ends of justice. Further, allowing the connected Interlocutory\nApplication by condoning the delay of 22 days will also not cause any prejudice\nto the respondents side. The respondents will get ample opportunity to contest\nthe case and to place their defence at the time of final hearing of the said case.\nThere are catena of judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court wherein it is has been\nexpressed the view that the limitation should not be considered with a liberal\napproach and the petition/appeal may be admitted even if it is presented after\nexpiry of the specified period of limitation if it is satisfied that the application\nhas &#x27;sufficient cause&#x27; for not presenting the petition/appeal within time.\n                                                                         Page No.# 13/33\n\n\n\n21.    The argument placed by the learned counsel for the respondents that\nthere was a delay of 1461 days in preferring the revision petition also cannot be\nadmitted as the facts remain same that the revision petition was preferred with\na delay of 22 days and there was not a delay of 1461 days in preferring the\nrevision petition, though it is a fact that the petition for condonation of delay\nwas filed after a considerable period only at the time of the hearing of the\nrevision petition. Further, it is not a case that the revision petition was filed with\na delay of 4 years. However, it cannot be denied that the petition for\ncondonation of delay was filed only after considerable period at the time of\nhearing of the criminal revision petition. But considering the delay of only 22\ndays in preferring the revision petition and also for the substantial justice, this\nCourt is of the opinion that that the delay can be condoned and the petition\nmay be admitted for hearing.\n\n\n22. Coming to the other issues, the learned counsel for the respondents raised\nthe following issues at the time of hearing:\n\n(i)    That the interceptions were done illegally.\n\n(ii)   There is no question of public safety or public emergency to\n       intercept the telephonic conversation as required under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n       5 (2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act.\n\n\n23. It is submitted by the learned counsels representing the respondents that\nthe telephonic conversations of the accused persons, which have been\nintercepted, do not fall within the ambit of the criteria of public emergency\nand/or the interest of the public safety as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court.\n                                                                               Page No.# 14/33\n\nIn this context, they relied on a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court passed in the\ncase of Peoples Union for Civil Liberty Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. [(1997)\n1 SCC 301], wherein it has been held that no interception of Telegraph can be\ndone beyond the purview of the exceptions provided by <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\nIndian Telegraph Act, 1885 and without adhering to the rules framed thereunder\nand as there were no rules framed by then Central Government and it would\nhave taken some time by the Central Government to frame the rules for\ninterception of Telegraph.\n\n\n24.   It is further submitted by the learned counsels for the respondents that\nthe Central Government by its Notification dated 01.03.2007, GSR 193(E),\nframed the rules for interception of Telegraph under <a href=\"/doc/392398/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 7(2)(b)</a> of the\nIndian Telegraph Rules, 1985 as was mandated by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and\ntherefore, the Mandamus in the case of PUCL (supra) having run its course, the\nsaid Rules which has been incorporated as Rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph\nRules, 1951 to occupy the field.\n\n25. In that context, the relied on a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court passed in\nthe case of Hukam Chand Shyam Lal Vs. UOI &amp; Ors. [(1976) 2 SCC\n1228] and basically emphasised on paragraph No. 13 of the judgment, which\nreads as under:\n\n      &quot;13. <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 5(1)</a>, if properly construed, does not confer unguided &amp; unbridled power\n      on the Central Govt./State Govt./Specially Authorised Officer to take possession of any\n      telegraph. Firstly, the occurrence of a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; is the sine qua non for the\n      exercise of power under this section. As a preliminary step to the exercise of further\n      jurisdiction under this section the Govt. or the authority concerned must record its\n      satisfaction as to the existence of such an emergency. Further, the existence of the\n      emergency which is a pre-requisite for the exercise of power under this section, must\n      be a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; and not any other kind of emergency. The expression &#x27;public\n      emergency&#x27; has not been defined in the statute, but contours broadly delineating its\n      scope and features are discernible from the section which has to read as a whole. In\n                                                                                Page No.# 15/33\n\n      sub- section (1) the phrase &#x27;occurrence of any public emergency&#x27; is connected with\n      and is immediately followed by the phrase &quot;or in the interests of the public safety&#x27;&quot;.\n      These two phrases appear to take colour from each other. In the first part of sub-s. (2)\n      these two phrases again occur in association with each other, &amp; the context further\n      clarifies, with amplification, that a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; within the contemplation of this\n      section is one which raises problems concerning the interest of the public safety, the\n      sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with\n      foreign States or public order or the prevention of incitement to the commission of an\n      offence. It is in the context of these matters that appropriate authority has to form an\n      opinion with regard to the occurrence of a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; with a view to taking\n      further action under this section. Economic emergency is not one of those matters\n      expressly mentioned in the statute. Mere &#x27;economic emergency&#x27; as the High Court calls\n      it-may not necessarily amount to a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; &amp; justify action under this\n      section unless it raises problems relating to the matters indicated in the section.&quot;\n\n\n26. The learned counsels for the respondents further stressed on <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 5</a> of\nThe Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, wherein it is provided that on the occurrence of\npublic emergency, or in the interest of the public safety, the Central Government\nor a State Government or any officers specially authorized in this behalf by the\nCentral Government or a State Government may, if satisfied that it is necessary\nor expedient to do so in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,\nthe security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or\nfor preventing incitement to the commission of an offence, for the reasons to be\nrecorded in writing, by order, direct that any message or class of messages to or\nfrom any person or class of persons, or relating to any particular subject,\nbrought for transmission by or transmitted or received by any telegraph, shall\nnot be transmitted, or shall be intercepted or detained, or shall be disclosed to\nthe Government making the order or an officer thereof mentioned in the order.\nThey further stressed on the point that as per <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 5 (2)</a> of the Indian\nTelegraph Act, 1985, it permits the interception of messages in accordance with\nthe provisions of the said Section in case of occurrence of any public emergency\nor in the interest of public safety. Unless the public emergency has occurred or\n                                                                                 Page No.# 16/33\n\nthe interest of the public safety demands, the authorities have no jurisdiction to\nexercise the powers under the said Section. Public emergency would mean the\nprevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the public at large\ncalling for immediate action. The expression &quot;public safety&quot; means the state or\ncondition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large. When either of\nthese two conditions are not in existence, the Central Government or a State\nGovernment or the authorized officer cannot resort to telephonic tapping even\nthough there is satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient so to do for interest\nof sovereignty and integrity of India etc. [PUCL Vs. U.O.I., (1997) 1 SCC\n301].\n\n\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondents also relied on the decision of\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in Vinit Kumar Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation &amp;\nOrs. [2019 SCC OnLine Bom 3155] which also speaks about the public\nsafety and emergency and paragraph No. 13 of the said judgment reads as\nunder, as emphasized:\n\n      &quot;13. In view of the aforesaid clear and emphatic pronunciation of law on the subject\n      by the Nine Judge Constitution Bench in K. S. Puttaswami (supra), it is no longer res-\n      integra that :-\n              (a) The right to privacy is recognized by the Nine Judge Bench as inherent\n      fundamental right having protection as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal\n      liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> and as a part of the freedom guaranteed by Part III of the\n      Constitution which is subject to specified restrictions;\n             (b) Any infringement of the right to privacy by State Authorities will have to\n      meet the following four tests based on the &quot;Principle of proportionality and\n      legitimacy&quot; :\n             1. The action must be sanctioned by law;\n             2. The proposed action must be necessary in a democratic society for a\n      legitimate aim;\n             3. The extent of such interference must be proportionate to the need for such\n                interference;\n                                                                                  Page No.# 17/33\n\n              4. There must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such interference.\n              (c) All earlier judgments suggesting to the contrary, are no longer binding\n        precedents. The matters of infraction of the fundamental right to privacy would now\n        have to necessarily satisfy the aforesaid tests, and cannot be dealt with on the basis of\n        the overruled judgments in M.P.Sharma (supra) or Kharak Singh (supra) or based\n        thereon or on the same line of reasoning like R. M. Malkani (supra).&quot;\n\n\n28.     It is further submitted by the learned counsels appearing for the\nrespondents that the telephonic conversation is an important facet of a man&#x27;s\nprivate life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone conversation in\nthe privacy of one&#x27;s home or office. Thus, the telephone tapping will infringe the\nright of a person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India unless it is\npermitted under the procedure and established law.\n\n\n29.     They further emphasized on paragraph No. 18 of the of the decision of\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of PUCL (supra) which reads as under:\n\n\n        &quot;18. The right of privacy - by itself - has not been identified under the Constitution.\n        As a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to\n        privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on the\n        facts of the said case. But the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of\n        one&#x27;s home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as &quot;right to privacy&quot;.\n        Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate and confidential character.\n        Telephone conversation is a part of modern man&#x27;s life. It is considered so important\n        that more and more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their\n        pockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to\n        privacy would certainly include telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or\n        office. Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\n        unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law.&quot;\n\n\n(iii)    Order of interception of message was not there while passing\n         the order by the learned Special Judge and subsequently the\n         orders were passed by the Director of Home Ministry.\n                                                                     Page No.# 18/33\n\n30.   The learned counsels representing the respondents submitted that the\nlearned Special Judge, CBI had rightly dismissed the petition of the present\npetitioner/CBI as they failed to place any materials on record before the learned\nCourt below to satisfy that the intercepted telephonic conversation have been\nintercepted in accordance with procedure established by law. By filing the\nsubsequent affidavit, the petitioner side brought on record certain orders\nallegedly passed by the competent authority under Rule 419 (A) of the\nTelegraph Rules, 1951 to argue that the telephonic conversation was tapped as\nper law.\n\n\n31.   The learned counsels for the respondents further submitted that in a\ncriminal trial, the admissibility of intercepted Telegraph as evidence, there are\nspecific rules as being the procedural safeguards which must mandatorily be\ncomplied with (Rule 419 A of Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951) and without which\nthe intercepted Telegraph if done illegally and unlawfully cannot be allowed to\nbe admissible as evidence being hit by the ratio of the Nine Judge Constitution\nBench judgment in case of K.S. Puttaswami &amp; Anr. Vs. Union of India &amp;\nOrs. [(2017) 10 SCC 1], which is squarely applicable and will override the law\nas laid in Pooranmal case and the fundamental rights of the respondents cannot\nbe infringed otherwise than due process of law.\n\n\n32.   Further it is submitted by the learned counsels for the respondents that\nthe law as it is by Rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 mandates\nthat the intercepted material (during the first 7 days) are to be mandatorily\ndestroyed by intercepting agency if permission to intercept the Telegraph as\ngranted under sub-rule 2 of Rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 by\n                                                                     Page No.# 19/33\n\nthe Secretary concerned is not approved by the Standing Review Committee\nunder sub-rules 16 &amp; 17 of rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951. It is\nthe case of the CBI that the permission for interception of Telegraph as was\ngranted by the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India was not\napproved by the Review Committee, and thus the said intercepted material\nstood mandatorily destroyed and is presumed not to be in existence, and\ntherefore, something that is not in existence cannot be led in evidence, or be\nproved before the learned Trial Court by the CBI. In this context, they relied on\na decision of Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in case of Jatinder Pal Singh Vs. CBI\n(Crl. M.C. No. 3118/2012, dated 17.01.2022) has held that illegally\nintercepted Telegraph would not be admissible as evidence, and would have to\nbe mandatorily destroyed.\n\n\n33. Further it is submitted that while passing the order dated 28.02.2020 by\nthe learned Special Judge there was no orders of interception of the telephonic\nconversation of the phone numbers of the accused respondents in the Case\nDiary at the time of passing the order by the learned Special Judge. More so, in\nthe interception order, there is no format and content of all the orders which are\nsame irrespective of whether it was passed by the Director, CBI or Union Home\nSecretary except phone numbers and date. None of the orders bears the official\nseal or signatures nor those were passed in any official letter pads. None of the\norders have been issued in the name of any particular person. All the\ninterception orders are general orders not addressed to any particular person.\n\n\n34.   Further it is submitted that Sub-rule (8) of the Rule 419-A of the Rules\nobligates the Central Government or State Government, as the case may be, to\n                                                                               Page No.# 20/33\n\nconstitute a Review Committee. According to Sub-rule (9) of Rule 419-A of the\nRules, the Review Committee, within a period of sixty days from the issue of\ndirections, shall suo moto make necessary enquiries and investigations and\nrecord its findings as to whether the directions issued under sub-rule (1) are in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of the <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 5</a> of the Act. If\nthe Review Committee is of the opinion that the directions are not in accordance\nwith the provisions referred to above, it may set aside the directions and order\nfor destruction of the copies of the intercepted message or class of messages.\n\n\n35. Reliance is also placed in the case of Kranti Associates Private Limited\n&amp; Anr. Vs. Masood Ahmed Khan &amp; Ors. [(2010) 9 SCC 496], wherein it\nhas been observed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that the principle of natural\njustice by judicial, quasi-judicial and even by administrative bodies must record\nreasons in support of its conclusions. Paragraph No. 47 of the said judgment\nreads as under:\n\n     &quot;47. Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:\n           (a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in\n     administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.\n           (b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.\n             (c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of\n     justice that justice must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.\n            (d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible\n     arbitrary exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.\n            (e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision maker\n     on relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous considerations.\n           (f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision\n     making process as observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial and\n     even by administrative bodies.\n           (g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior Courts.\n           (h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and\n                                                                                  Page No.# 21/33\n\n     constitutional governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts.\n     This is virtually the life blood of judicial decision making justifying the principle that\n     reason is the soul of justice.\n            (i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the\n     judges and authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common\n     purpose which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been\n     objectively considered. This is important for sustaining the litigants&#x27; faith in the justice\n     delivery system.\n           (j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and\n     transparency.\n             (k) If a Judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her\n     decision making process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is\n     faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of incrementalism.\n            (l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A\n     pretence of reasons or `rubber-stamp reasons&#x27; is not to be equated with a valid\n     decision making process.\n            (m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of restraint on\n     abuse of judicial powers. Transparency in decision making not only makes the judges\n     and decision makers less prone to errors but also makes them subject to broader\n     scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor (1987) 100 Harward Law\n     Review 731-737).\n             (n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad doctrine\n     of fairness in decision making, the said requirement is now virtually a component of\n     human rights and was considered part of Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See (1994) 19\n     EHRR 553, at 562 para 29 and Anya vs. University of Oxford, 2001 EWCA Civ 405,\n     wherein the Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 6</a> of European Convention of Human Rights which\n     requires,\n            &quot;adequate and intelligent reasons must be given for judicial decisions&quot;.\n           (o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up\n     precedents for the future. Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving\n     reasons for the decision is of the essence and is virtually a part of &quot;due process&quot;.&quot;\n\n\n36. Relying on the decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court passed in Ritesh Sinha\n(supra), it is submitted by Mr. Srivastava that there was no law to require\naccused to provide Voice Sample and if the accused did not want to give Voice\nSample, he or she cannot be forced by the learned Magistrate to provide the\nsame and to fill the legislative gap, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court abled the Magistrate\n                                                                              Page No.# 22/33\n\nto direct the accused to provide the Voice Sample if so satisfied and thus the\njudgment dealt with only the jurisdiction to direct to provide Voice Sample and\nnot the merits of the case as to whether the Magistrate can exercise the\njurisdiction or not.\n\n\n37. Per contra, it is submitted by Mr. Haloi, learned Special Public Prosecutor,\nCBI that while passing the order by the authority concerned, there is no need of\nelaborate discussion of the reasons while making the order. Rather such an\nelaborate discussion may affect the privacy of the party. In that context, he also\ncited a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court passed in W.P.(CRL) No.\n1147/2020 (Santosh Kumar Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr.) and basically\nrelied on paragraph No. 44 of the said judgment, which reads as under:\n\n      &quot;44. The disclosure of elaborate reasons for interception orders would be against the\n      modified disclosure requirements of procedural fairness which have been universally\n      deemed acceptable for the protection of other facets of public including the source of\n      information leading to the detection of crime or other wrong doing, sensitive\n      intelligence information and other information supplied in confidence for the purpose\n      of government or discharge of certain public functions. Furthermore, the Rule 419 A of\n      the Telegraph Rules provide for extreme secrecy, utmost care and precaution in the\n      matter of interception as it affects privacy.&quot;\n\n\n38. Mr. Haloi further submitted that in the present petition, the matters pertain\nto corruption which is dangerous for public safety since economic crimes\nultimately affect the economic safety of the entire country and it is citizen.\n\n\n39. Mr. Haloi further relied on another decision of Madras High Court passed in\nW.P. Nos. 5466, 5470 of 2020, W.M.P. Nos. 6391, 6394, 6396 and\n6397 of 2020 (Sanjay Bhandari &amp; Ors. Vs. The Secretary of\nGovernment. of India &amp; Ors.), dated 23.11.2020, and emphasized on\n                                                                                 Page No.# 23/33\n\nparagraph No. 14 of the judgment, which reads as under:\n\n\n        &quot;14. That apart, in view of the above discussion the first respondent passed the\n        orders for detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of corrupt activities of\n        the petitioners herein in accordance with the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\n        Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. Thereafter, the Court finds no violation of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 5(2)</a> of\n        the Telegraph Act and also it would not amount to violation of the right to privacy\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> and freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19(1)</a>\n        and <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_37\">19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore, these writ petitions are devoid of\n        merits.&quot;\n\n\n40. Mr. Haloi, learned Standing Counsel, CBI also relied on another decision of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court passed in Crl. M. C. No. 1534/2018, dated\n07.12.2023 (Sanjiv Kumar Vs. The State of Govt. of NCT of Delhi) and\naccordingly submitted that in the instant case, the prosecution has complied\nwith the provision of <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_38\">Telegraph Act</a> and obtained necessary authorization to\nintercept the phone of the respondents and therefore, the judgment of PUCL\n(supra) and Jatinder Pal Singh (supra) will not be applicable in the present\ncase.\n\n\n41.     Accordingly, Mr. Haloi submitted that while dismissing the petition, the\nlearned Special Judge overlooked the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\nTelegraph Act and Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, amended in the\nyear 2007, which authorized the law and the enforcement agencies to seek for\nlegal interception of the telephonic conversations in connection with the offence\nof serious nature and here in the instant case also, out of 13 numbers of letter\nof permission for interception, 8 numbers of permissions were granted by the\nHome Secretary to the Government of India and 5 numbers of permissions\nissued by the Director, CBI after duly examining the request and considering the\n                                                                      Page No.# 24/33\n\nfact that the interceptions were sought in the interest of public order and safety\nand to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. Hence, Mr. Haloi\nsubmitted that in such nature of cases, the voice sample is very vital evidence\nto prove the case and in such type of cases, other corroborative evidence are\nrare and therefore, the order passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI is liable\nto be set aside and quashed.\n\n\n42.   In this context, the learned counsels for the respondents submitted that\nthe cases relied by the CBI are general cases related to <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_40\">P.C. Act</a> and not related\nto phone tapping under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_41\">Indian Telegraph Act</a> except Sanjay Bhandari&#x27;s\ncase and therefore these cases are not relevant in the present case. Further it is\nsubmitted that the case of Ritesh Sinha (supra) is not applicable in this case\nand facts of the case of Ritesh Sinha (supra) is totally different from the\npresent fact of the case.\n\n\n43.   I have considered the rival submissions put forwarded by the learned\ncounsels appearing on behalf of the parties and also perused the materials\navailable on record.\n\n\n44. It is the case of the petitioner/CBI that after the dismissal of the prayer for\nrecording of the voice samples of the present respondents by the learned\nSpecial Judge on 28.02.2020, one revision petition was filed before this Court,\nbut subsequently the same was withdrawn on 07.11.2019 and another\napplication was preferred before the learned Special Judge, CBI for permission\nto obtain voice samples of the accused persons. But the learned Special Judge,\nCBI overlooked the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act read\n                                                                     Page No.# 25/33\n\nwith Section 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules (amended in 2007) which\nauthorizes the law enforcement agency to seek for legal interception of\ntelephonic conversation in connection with the offences of serious in nature. It\nis further the case of the petitioner/CBI that the Indian Telegraph Amendment\nRules provide that all the request for such interception would only be considered\nafter due examination/ screening by the Review Committee as setup under the\nprovision of the said Rules, headed by the Cabinet Secretary, Government of\nIndia, considering of Secretary to Government of India, Department of\nTelecommunications. But, without considering the fact, the learned Special\nJudge arbitrarily rejected the prayer for recording of the voice samples of the\npresent petitioners.\n\n\n45.   On the other hand, it is the case of the respondents that the entire\ninterceptions were done illegally within 05.04.2018 to 09.04.2018. Further it is\nthe case of the respondent that there is no question of public safety or public\nemergency to intercept the telephonic conversation as required under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act. As per the respondents, the telephonic\nconversation of the accused persons, which have been intercepted, do not fall\nwithin the ambit of criteria of public emergency and/or the interest of the public\nsafety as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of PUCL (supra). The\njudgment of the Apex Court in PUCL (supra) was mainly stressed by the\nlearned counsels for the respondents, wherein it has been held that no\ninterception of the telegraph can be done beyond the purview of the exceptions\nprovided by <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and without\nadhering to the rules framed thereunder and as there were no rules framed by\nthen Central Government, it would have taken some time by the Central\n                                                                                  Page No.# 26/33\n\nGovernment to frame the rules for interception of Telegraph.\n\n\n46.     For ready reference, <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 is\nextracted hereinbelow:\n\n      &quot;5. Power for Government to take possession of licensed telegraphs and to order\n      interception of messages.\n      ...\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1\">      (2) On the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of the public safety,\n      the Central Government or a State Government or any officer specially authorized in this\n      behalf by the Central Government or a State Government may, if satisfied that it is\n      necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India,\n      the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for\n      preventing incitement to the commission of an offence, for reasons to be recorded in\n      writing, by order, direct that any message or class of messages to or from any person or\n      class of persons, or relating to any particular subject, brought for transmission by or\n      transmitted or received by any telegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall be\n      intercepted or detained, or shall be disclosed to the Government making the order or an\n      officer thereof mentioned in the order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            Provided that press messages intended to be published in India of correspondents\n      accredited to the Central Government or a State Government shall not be intercepted or\n      detained, unless their transmission has been prohibited under this sub-section.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">47. In connection with the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph\nAct, the learned counsels for the respondents also relied on various decisions, as\nreferred above, wherein it is provided that unless public emergency has\noccurred or the interest of the public safety demands, the authorities have no\njurisdiction to exercise power under the said Section. Public emergency would\nmean the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the public\nat large calling for immediate action. The expression &quot;public safety&quot; means the\nstate or condition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">48. Further it is the case of the respondents that the telephonic conversation\nis an important facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would certainly\n                                                                              Page No.# 27/33\n\ninclude telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office. Thus, the\ntelephone tapping will infringe the right of a person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure and established\nlaw. But, here in the instant case, the order of interception of the messages was\nnot there while passing the order by the learned Special Judge and\nsubsequently the orders were passed by the Director of Home Ministry. Thus, it\nis submitted by the respondents side that the petitioner/CBI failed to place any\nmaterial on record before the learned Court below to satisfy that the intercepted\ntelephonic conversation have been intercepted in accordance with procedure\nestablished by law. More so, it is the claim of the respondents that in the\ninterception order, there is no format and content of all the orders which are\nsame irrespective of whether it was passed by the Director, CBI or Union Home\nSecretary except phone numbers and date. Further, none of the orders bears\nthe official seal or signatures nor those were passed in any official letter pads.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">None of the orders have been issued in the name of any particular person. All\nthe interception orders are general orders not addressed to any particular\nperson. Thus, the orders for interceptions which were produced by the CBI are\nnot the order which were illegally passed in accordance with the established\nlaw. More so, those were not placed before the Review Committee as required\nunder Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 which obligates the\nCentral Government or the State Government as the case may be to constitute a\nReview Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">49.   The amended provision of Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules\nprovides as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      &quot;419-A.

In unavoidable circumstances, such\n     order may be made by an officer, not below the rank of a Joint Secretary to the\n     Government of India, who has been duly authorized by the Union Home Secretary or\n     the State Home Secretary, as the case may be:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     Provided that in emergent cases--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     (i) in remote areas, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of messages or\n     class         of         messages            is         not          feasible;        or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     (ii) for operational reasons, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of\n     message or class of messages is not feasible;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_4\">     the required interception of any message or class of messages shall be carried out\n     with the prior approval of the Head or the second senior most officer of the authorized\n     security i.e. Law Enforcement Agency at the Central Level and the officers authorised\n     in this behalf, not below the rank of Inspector General of Police at the state level but\n     the concerned competent authority shall be informed of such interceptions by the\n     approving authority within three working days and that such interceptions shall be got\n     confirmed by the concerned competent authority within a period of seven working\n     days. If the confirmation from the competent authority is not received within the\n     stipulated seven days, such interception shall cease and the same message or class of\n     messages shall not be intercepted thereafter without the prior approval of the Union\n     Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">50.

Here in the instant case, it is seen that the order of interception was\npassed by the competent authority, i.e. the Director of CBI or Union Home\nSecretary, along with telephone numbers. As per Rule 419A of the Indian\nTelegraph Rules (Amended Rules), it authorizes the law enforcement agency to\nseek for legal interception of telephone conversation in connection with the\noffence of serious in nature. Further, as per the amended Rules, all the request\nfor   such    interceptions    would    only     be        considered    after    due\nexamination/screening by the Reviewing Committee as set up under the\nprovision of said rules, headed by the Cabinet Secretary, Government of India,\nconsidering   of   Secretary   to   Government        of    India,   Department     of\nTelecommunications. Here in the instant case, it is seen that the order of\ninterception, which were produced by the CBI, were passed by the Indian Home\nSecretary to the Government of India and the Director, CBI after due\nexamination of the request for interceptions of the conversations of the present\nrespondents considering the nature of the offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">52. However, it is submitted by the learned counsels for the respondents that\nthe orders were not placed before the learned Special Judge at the time of\npassing the impugned order. But, all the orders of interception were passed\nduring the period of December, 2018 to February, 2019 by the competent\nauthority and the order was passed by the learned Special Judge on\n26.02.2020. There is also mention of orders of interception in the Charge-Sheet\nwhich is filed on 23.12.2022. Thus, the plea of non-production of orders of\ninterception at the time of passing the order cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">53.   Coming to the issue raised by the learned counsel for the respondents\n                                                                                Page No.# 30/33\n\nwith regard to &quot;public safety&quot; and &quot;public emergency&quot; which is mandatorily\nrequired for interception of any telegraph or telephonic conversation as provided\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, it is the case of the respondents\nside that in the present case there is no any such public emergency or public\nsafety for interception of telephonic conversations of the respondent and there\nis no material to show that any public emergency or public safety arises for\nwhich it was necessary for interception of the telephonic messages. But, the\npresent case is a case of corruption and the same are the economic and\norganized crimes and the conspiracy are hatched in most secretive manners.\nThe impact of corruption on public safety cannot be gainsaid in the present\ntimes and considering this aspect of the case, the screening/review committee\nhad passed the order for intercepting the telephonic messages of the present\nrespondents after satisfying all the materials placed before the committee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58898221\" id=\"span_1\">54. In the case as relied by the CBI/petitioner in W.P. Nos. 5466, 5470 of\n2020, W.M.P. Nos. 6391, 6394, 6396 and 6397 of 2020 (<a href=\"/doc/58898221/\" id=\"a_51\">Sanjay\nBhandari &amp; Ors. Vs.

That apart, in view of the above discussion the first respondent passed the orders\n     for detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of corrupt activities of the\n     petitioners herein in accordance with the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\n     Telegraph Act, 1885. Therefore, this Court finds no violation of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\n     Telegraph Act and also it would not amount to violation of the right to privacy under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> and freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19(1)</a> and\n     <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_56\">19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore, these writ petitions are devoid of merits.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">55. Though the present case is not directly involved with the public safety or\n                                                                      Page No.# 31/33\n\npublic emergency, but the nature of the case directly affects the economy of the\nsociety wherein the public money is involved. The plea of prejudice by the\nrespondents will not sustain if they were asked to give voice sample and it\nwould be open for the respondents to take all objections with regard to legality\nof the interceptions at the stage of trial. Furthermore, from the discussions\nmade above, it is seen that the interception orders were passed by the\ncompetent authority for intercepting the messages/telephonic conversations of\nthe respondents and from the nature of the case, it is also seen that it is the\nonly evidence for the petitioner/CBI to substantiate their claim as all the\nconversations were made over telephone amongst the respondents. Further it is\nseen that all the interceptions have been done in accordance with law as\nprovided under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_57\">Telegraph Act</a>. It is also seen that all the interceptions orders\nwere passed by the competent authority who were also the members of the\nreview committee and hence, it cannot be held that there was no compliance of\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">56. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Ritesh Sinha (supra) has held that\nthe fundamental right to privacy is subject to public interest and therefore not\nabsolute. Accordingly, in exercise of his jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 142</a> of the\nConstitution of India, the Supreme Court held that till exclusive provision are\nmade in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_60\">Cr.P.C</a>. by the Parliament, the Magistrate would have the power to\norder the person to give his voice sample for the purpose of investigation of a\ncrime.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">57. It is the admitted position that as per <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph\nAct, an order of interception can be issued either in case of &quot;public emergency&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                                                       Page No.# 32/33\n\nor for the interest of the &quot;public safety&quot; as per law laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in case of PUCL (supra). But, considering the peculiar\ncircumstances and the nature of the case, the interceptions can also be allowed\nin such a nature of case, though it is not directly associated with the public\nemergency or the public safety. But, as discussed above, the money which is\ninvolved and subject matter of this case is the public money and which\notherwise will affect the entire society at large. Further, in any event, it will be\nopen for the respondents to raise objection with regard to non-compliance of\nstatutory proviso for interceptions of the telephonic calls/telephonic messages at\nan appropriate stage or at the time of trial. Allowing the prayer for recording of\nvoice sample cannot be held to be non justifiable, rather not allowing will cause\nprejudice to the prosecution as the voice sample or intercepted messages are\nthe primary evidence for the CBI to substantiate their plea. The respondents\nmay challenge the legality or evidentiary value of the intercepted message at\nthe appropriate stage of trial if such justified reasons appears to them from the\nevidence which may come in their favour at that time.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">58.   So, from the entire discussions made above and also considering the\nnature and gravity of the offence and further considering the fact that the\nrecording of the voice sample may be the only evidence for the CBI to\nsubstantiate its case, this Court is of the opinion that the petitioner/CBI has\nmade out a case calling for the interference by this Court of the impugned order\n26.02.2020, passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI, Guwahati in CBI Case\nNo. RC-01(A)/2019/CBI/ ACB /Guwahati.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">59.
