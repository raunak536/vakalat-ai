A plain reading of the above-quoted provision \n           makes it clear that Indian law allows for abortion only if \n           the specified conditions are met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_30\">When the MTP Act</a> was \n           first   enacted   in   1971   it   was   largely   modelled   on   the \n           Abortion Act of 1967 which had been passed in the United \n           Kingdom. The legislative intent was to provide a qualified \n           &#x27;right   to   abortion&#x27;   and   the   termination   of   pregnancy   has \n           never been recognised as a normal recourse for expecting \n           mothers. There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make \n           reproductive choices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; \n           as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. \n           It is important to recognise that reproductive choices can be \n           exercised   to   procreate   as   well   as   to   abstain   from \n           procreating.   The   crucial   consideration   is   that   a   woman&#x27;s \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                                    13 / 25</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">     ::: Uploaded on - 12/01/2018                             ::: Downloaded on - 13/01/2018 01:31:15 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                   14</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                                                             903.WPST.36727-17-JUDGMENT.doc\n\n\n\n             right   to   privacy,   dignity   and   bodily   integrity   should   be \n             respected. This means that there should be no restriction \n             whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such as \n             a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or \n             alternatively   the   insistence   on   use   of   contraceptive \n             methods.   Furthermore,   women   are   also   free   to   choose \n             birth-control   methods   such   as   undergoing   sterilisation \n             procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion, reproductive \n             rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy \n             to   its   full   term,   to   give   birth   and   to   subsequently   raise \n             children. However, in the case of pregnant women there is \n             also a &#x27;compelling state interest&#x27; in protecting the life of the \n             prospective   child.   Therefore,   the   termination   of   a \n             pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions specified \n             in   the   applicable   statute   have   been   fulfilled.   Hence,   the \n             provisions   of   the   <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_32\">MTP   Act,   1971</a>   can   also   be   viewed   as \n             reasonable   restrictions   that   have   been   placed   on   the \n             exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">13.            It   is   further   observed   that   ordinarily   a   pregnancy   can   be \n\nterminated   only   when   a   medical   practitioner   is   satisfied   that   a \n\n&#x27;continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the \n\npregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health&#x27; [as \n\nper <a href=\"/doc/681103/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 3(2)(b)(i)</a> of the Act of 1971] or when &#x27;there is a substantial \n\nrisk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or \n\nmental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/444500/\" id=\"a_34\">Section \n\n3(2)(b)(ii)</a> of the Act of 1971].

Thus, if continuance of pregnancy is harmful to the \n\nmental   health   of   a   pregnant   woman,   then   that   is   a   good   and   legal \n\nground   to   allow   termination   of   pregnancy   if   all   the   conditions \n\nincorporated     in   legal   provision   are   met.

A section  is to be interpreted  by reading \n\nall of its parts together, and it is not permissible to omit any part thereof. \n\nThe   Court   cannot   proceed   with   the   assumption   that   the   legislature, \n\nwhile enacting the Statute has committed a mistake; it must proceed on \n\nthe footing that the legislature intended what it has said; even if there is \n\nsome defect in the phraseology used by it in framing the statute, it is not \n\nopen to the Court to add and amend, or by construction, make up for \n\nthe deficiencies, which has been left in the Act.   The Court can only \n\niron out the creases but while doing so, it must not alter the fabric, \n\nof   which   an   Act   is   woven.     The   Court,   while   interpreting   statutory \n\nprovisions, cannot add words to a Statute, or read words into it which \n\nare not part of it, especially when a literal reading of the same produces \n\nan intelligible result.

This   formulation \n                   allows the interpreter to inquire not into the \n                   subjective   intent   of   the   author,   but   rather \n                   the intent the author would have had, had \n                   he or she acted reasonably.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">               (Aharon   Barak,   Purposive   Interpretation   in   Law \n               (2007) at pg. 87) \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                                  19 / 25</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">       ::: Uploaded on - 12/01/2018                         ::: Downloaded on - 13/01/2018 01:31:15 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                                20</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">                                                         903.WPST.36727-17-JUDGMENT.doc\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">17.

Interpretation must depend on the text and the \n              context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may \n              well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives \n              the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. \n              That   interpretation   is   best   which   makes   the   textual \n              interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best \n              interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With \n              this   knowledge,   the   statute   must   be   read,   first   as   a \n              whole and then section  by section, clause by clause, \n              phrase   by   phrase   and   word   by   word.   If   a   statute   is \n              looked   at,   in   the   context   of   its   enactment,   with   the \n              glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, \n              its   scheme,   the   sections,   clauses,   phrases   and   words \n              may take colour and appear different than when the \n              statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the \n              context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as \n              a whole and discover what each section, each clause, \n              each phrase and each word is meant and designed to \n              say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part \n              of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed \n              in   isolation.
