CVC&#x27;s 1st stage advice in the cited case contains names of\n            other persons, in respect of whom disciplinary proceedings\n            are still going on. hence the requested information is denied\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         1</span>\n              under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_4\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_5\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI\n             Act. CIC&#x27;s judgement in case No. CIC/AT/A/2006/00039\n             dated 1.1.2006 refers. Para 12 thereof states that\n             &quot;Premature disclosure of investigation related information\n             has the potentiality to tar the employee&#x27;s reputation,\n             permanently, while cannot be undone even by his eventual\n             exoneration.      The balance of advantage thus, lies in\n             exempting investigation/ enquiries in vigilance, misconduct\n             or disciplinary cases etc. from disclosure requirements under\n             the Act, till a decision in given case is reached by the\n             competent authority. This also conforms to the letter and the\n             spirit of <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_6\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">      Para 4.2 to 4.5\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      3.    Since disciplinary proceedings are contemplated/ pending\n            against some officials, disclosure of information as\n            requested by you would impede the process of logical\n            conclusion of disciplinary proceedings. Therefore, the\n            requested information is denied under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_7\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> &amp;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">            (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      Para 4.6\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">      4.

Secretary, CVC submitting as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      &quot;The CPIO of CVC has miserably failed to take into\n      consideration the orders of the Hon&#x27;ble Central Information\n      Commission passed in the case of Shri Kathiresan vs. CBI\n      (CIC/WB/A/2006/01033 dated 10.10.2007) had the CPIO of\n      CVC taken some pains to such decisions of the CIC, he would\n      not have refused to supply me the information sought for.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">      Upon this Shri Vineet K. Gupta, Addl. Secretary in an undated order\nhas found as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;I have perused the relevant record and I find that disciplinary\n      proceedings in the case referred by you have not yet reached to\n      its logical conclusion. I also notice that the Central information\n      Commission in its decision dated 22.8.2007 in the case of &#x27;V. R.\n      Gokhale vs. Central Vigilance Commission&#x27; had held that\n      <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_9\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> covers not only investigation which would imply\n      the enquiry process, but also apprehension and prosecution\n      which will include orders of the final authority on the conclusion\n      of the proceedings. In the light of the decision of the CIC in the\n      aforementioned case, the action of the CPIO in denying\n      information under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_10\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> of the RTI Act, appears\n      justified.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      2</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       The disclosure of information as requested by you at this stage\n      would reveal the names of the officers dealing the case, stage of\n      proceedings etc. The accused officers taking advantage of this\n      information may influence the decision making process, which\n      may also impede the process of disciplinary case to reach its\n      logical conclusion. Accordingly, I uphold the decision of the\n      CPIO denying you information under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_11\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> read with\n      <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_12\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">      Appellant Shri UVL Radhakrishnan&#x27;s prayer before us in his second\nappeal is as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      &quot;a)    set aside the letter No. CVC/RTI/07/615/71755 dated\n             3.11.2007 of the 1st Respondent;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      b)     set aside the letter No. CVC/RTI/APP/07/139/75364\n             dated Nil of the 2nd Respondent;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      c)     direct the Respondents herein to supply me all the\n             information sought for by me vide my RTI Application\n             dated 25.10.1997;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      d)     direct the Respondents to supply me the certified/\n             authenticated copies of the correspondences exchanged\n             between the Railway Board and the CVC regarding the\n             disciplinary proceedings against me.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">      The appeal was heard through videoconference on 3-8-2009.             The\nfollowing are present at CIC chambers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">      Respondents\n      Shri R.C. Arora, Dy. Secretary, CVC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">      Shri S. K. Gwaliya, SO., CVC\n\n      Although   arrangements    had       been   made   for   hearing   through\nvideoconference with Kochi, and appellant was informed of the date of\nhearing through our letter of 21-7-2009 appellant Shri Radhakrishnan opted\nnot to be present. He has however sent written arguments on Internet\ntogether with a request that Thiru Venkataraman represent him through audio-\nconference. Upon calling Shri Venkataraman at 09444494573 however only\nthe response &#x27;outside the coverage area&#x27; was received.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">      Shri R.C. Arora, Dy. Secretary, CVC submitted that whereas CVC has\nindeed sent the first stage advice of the Commission to the Railway Board on\n29-10-2003, it is for the Railway Board to now provide this advice to the\naccused as part of the charge-sheet. The second stage advice is only issued\non receipt of an enquiry report. This advice has not yet been issued nor has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       3</span>\n the CVC received the enquiry report. Shri R.C. Arora also placed before us a\ncopy of the CBI report, which covers 130 pages together with attached\ndocuments.         These are at the request of the CBI treated as confidential\ndocuments and not disclosed by CVC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                                DECISION NOTICE\n\n\n       On the basis of the above it is clear that question No.1 is to be\nanswered not by the CVC but by the Railway Board. If the Railway Board has\nnot yet supplied a copy of this advice to appellant Shri Radhakrishnan the\nreasons for the same will have to be obtained from the Railway Board. Since\nit is not the CVC, which is now conducting investigation that public authority\ncannot be asked to provide a document that has a bearing on that\ninvestigation, since, it is in no position to determine whether such disclosure\nwould impede the process of investigation. On the other hand it would have\nbeen appropriate for the CVC to have transferred this question to the CPIO,\nRailway Board under sub Section (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/666037/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 6 (3)</a>. However it is clear that\nthe investigation on which information has been sought involved a decidedly\npublic activity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">       Since there is no second stage advice given by the CVC it is clear that\nthis cannot be provided to appellant Shri Radhakrishnan. Nevertheless, it\nwas for the CVC to have informed the appellant that there was no such advise\nthat could be provided by the CVC to him.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">       Insofar as the information requested regarding enquiry against three\nofficers, these officers will constitute third parties in this case and information\nregarding them will clearly amount to invasion of privacy. We have no clear\ndefinition of what is meant by &quot;invasion of privacy&quot; within the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_14\">RTI Act</a>. We\nhave no equivalent of UK&#x27;s Date Protection Act, 1998, Sec 2 of which, titled\n&#x27;Sensitive Personal Data&#x27;, reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">       &quot;In this Act &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; means personal data\n       consisting of information as to:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       a)     The racial or ethnic origin of the data subject.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">       b)     His political opinions.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         4</span>\n        c)     His religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature.\n       d)     Whether he is a member of a Trade Union.\n       e)     His physical or mental health or condition.\n       f)     His sexual life.\n       g)     The commission or alleged commission by him of any\n              offence.\n       h)     Any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              have been committed by him, the disposal of such\n              proceedings or the sentence of any court in such\n              proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">       If we were to construe privacy to mean protection of personal data, this\nwould be a suitable starting point to help define the concept. The US\nRestatement of the Law, Second, Torts, 652 on the other hand, defines the\ninvasion of Privacy in the following manner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       One, who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon\n       the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or\n       concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his\n       privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable\n       person.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       Moreover, the Supreme Court in Kharak Singh&#x27;s case (AIR 1963 SC\n1295) held that right to privacy is a guaranteed right under the Constitution of\nIndia. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15059075\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_15\">Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, 1994(6) SCC 632 and in\n<a href=\"/doc/15059075/\" id=\"a_16\">P.U.C.L. v. Union of India</a>, (1997) ISCC 301 Supreme Court reiterated the\nlaw that right to privacy is part of the right to &#x27;life&#x27; and &#x27;personal liberty&#x27;\nenshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. In these decisions, the\nSupreme Court placed reliance on the International Treaties to which India is\nsignatory and came to a conclusion that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> read with relevant Article in\nthe International Treaty/Covenant would lead to a conclusion that right to\nprivacy is part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21.</a></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_7\">The Supreme Court recognized that right to privacy by itself has not\nbeen identified under the Constitution and that as a concept; it may be too\nbroad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether the right to privacy can be\nclaimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on facts of each\ncase. Describing the origin of the right to privacy. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_20\">Rajagopal</a>&#x27;s case cited above observed as follows: -</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       &quot;The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept\n       originated in the field to Tort Law, under which a new cause of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       5</span>\n           action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy\n          was recognised. This right has two aspects which are but two\n          faces of the same coin: (1) the General law of privacy which\n          affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful\n          invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to\n          the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against\n          unlawful governmental invasion..... In recent times, however,\n          this right has acquired a constitutional status.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">          The remaining three questions concern correspondence with the CBI,\nwhich as per the request of the CBI has been protected under the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_21\">Official\nSecrets Act, 1923</a>. Under <a href=\"/doc/1484095/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8 (2)</a> of the RTI Act 2005\n\n          Notwithstanding anything in the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_23\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a> nor\n          any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-\n          section (1), a public authority may allow access to information, if\n          public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected\n          interests.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">          It will, therefore, be open to the CBI to disclose such information and\nnot for the CVC. For this reason this part of the request should have been\ntransferred by CVC to the CBI under Sub Section (i) of <a href=\"/doc/666037/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 6 (3)</a>. In light\nof the above we hereby direct as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">   i)        Question No.1 is transferred to the CPIO, Railway Board for\n             consideration under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">RTI Act</a> 2005 and for providing a\n             response to appellant Shri Radhakrishnan within 15 working\n             days of the date of receipt of this decision notice; in doing so he\n             will bear in mind that the investigation on which information has\n             been sought involves a decidedly public activity. It will be open to\n             him however to take recourse to Sec 8 (1) (h)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">   ii)       The response to question No.2 has been given in the discussion\n             above. This in essence is that there is no information held by the\n             CVC on the subject. No further action is therefore warranted\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">   iii)      Question Nos. 4 and 5 are transferred to the CPIO, CBI who will\n             provide a response to appellant Shri Radhakrishnan after\n             taking into account exemptions allowed under sub section (1)\n             of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> within 15 working days of the date of receipt of this\n             decision notice;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">        This Appeal now stands disposed of.
