The grievance of R-2 in this Appeal is directed against the\n                          dismissal of her application under Order I Rule 10(2) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_20\">of the CPC</a> read\n                          with <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_21\">Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC</a> seeking deletion of her name from\n                          the array of parties in HMA No. 479/2023.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                          7.2.     It is contended that her impleadment in a matrimonial case\n                          between the Husband and Wife was wholly misconceived. She placed\n                          reliance upon Order I Rule 10(2) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_22\">of the CPC</a>, <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_23\">Order VII Rule 11 of the\n                          CPC</a>, Order VI Rules 4 and 6 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_24\">of the CPC</a>, <a href=\"/doc/624514/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 21</a> of the Family\n                          Courts Act, 1984 [hereinafter referred to as ―<a href=\"/doc/1436914/\" id=\"a_26\">FC Act</a>‖], as well as\n                          Rules 12(a) and 7(g)(iii) of the Delhi High Court Hindu Marriage\n                          Rules, 1979. According to her, these provisions make it a condition\n                          precedent for impleadment that there must be clear and specific\n                          pleadings of adultery, namely particulars of time, date, place, and act\n                          of sexual intercourse.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not VerifiedMAT.APP.(F.C.) 251/2025 and connected matters                 Page 6 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Signed By:JAI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">NARAYAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Signing Date:29.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">12:26:22</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                           7.3.   It was argued that the petition filed by the Wife fell woefully\n                          short of this threshold. The Wife had not averred even a single\n                          instance of sexual intimacy, much less sexual intercourse, between the\n                          Husband and R-2. The meetings pleaded in the petition, even if\n                          accepted at face value, were confined to public spaces or professional\n                          settings and could not give rise to a cause of action for impleadment.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">                          R-2 submitted that in the absence of precise particulars, impleading\n                          her amounted to nothing more than a roving and humiliating enquiry,\n                          contrary to settled law that what is not pleaded cannot be proved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                          7.4.   R-2 further argued that the Family Court fell into error by\n                          stretching the inference of ―adulterous relations‖ far beyond the\n                          pleadings. R-2 contended that in the absence of explicit mention of\n                          sexual intercourse, the Court could not infer such acts from vague or\n                          general averments. The Family Court itself was unable to point to a\n                          single paragraph where sexual intimacy could be discerned, and its\n                          reasoning, in effect, substituted speculation for pleadings. Such an\n                          approach, R-2 urged, was inconsistent with the very rules which\n                          permit her impleadment -- the same rules that also mandate specific\n                          particulars. There cannot be one threshold for making a third party a\n                          respondent and another, lower threshold for inferring adultery from\n                          vague assertions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">                          7.5.   It was also submitted that impleadment exposes her to public\n                          stigma and harassment, without any substantive basis. If at all her\n                          testimony is considered necessary, the Wife always has recourse to the\n                          ordinary law of evidence to summon her as a witness, without\n                          arraying her as a party-respondent.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signature Not VerifiedMAT.APP.(F.C.) 251/2025 and connected matters                 Page 7 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Signed By:JAI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">NARAYAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing Date:29.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">12:26:22</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                           7.6.    On these premises, it was prayed that the Impugned Order dated\n                          29.04.2025 rejecting her application under Order I Rule 10(2) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_27\">of the\n                          CPC</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_28\">Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC</a> be set aside, and her\n                          name be struck off from the array of parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">                          8.

R-2 has assailed the Impugned Order whereby the Family Court\n                          allowed the application filed by the Wife under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 151</a> of the\n                          CPC directing disclosure of the tower location details of the mobile\n                          phone used by R-2 from the year 2020 till date.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                          8.2.    It was contended that the order suffers from grave illegality\n                          inasmuch as it violates the R-2&#x27;s fundamental right to privacy\n                          guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, as recognised\n                          in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India1 and subsequent\n                          cases, which mandate that any invasion of privacy must meet the tests\n                          of legality, necessity, and proportionality. It was urged that no prima\n                          facie case of adultery had been made out in the pleadings of the Wife\n                          that could justify such an intrusion. The divorce petition, according to\n                          R-2, does not plead any specific instance of sexual intercourse\n                          between the Husband and R-2, and in the absence of such particulars,\n                          compelling disclosure of years of tower location data amounts to an\n                          impermissible intrusion into her private life.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                          8.3.    It was further contended that the application filed by the Wife is\n                          in the nature of roving and fishing enquiry into the private life of R-2,\n                          lacking precise particulars of time, place, or occurrence.

It was also submitted that the petition has been filed with the\n                          ulterior motive of harassing R-2 and damaging her reputation and\n                          career. The Wife has no locus standi to seek details of R-2&#x27;s private\n                          data, and the Family Court failed to appreciate that her baseless\n                          apprehensions cannot override the Appellant&#x27;s constitutional rights.\n                          The allegations of adultery, even otherwise, do not cross the threshold\n                          required under <a href=\"/doc/1151479/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 13(1)(i)</a> of the HMA. It was urged that\n                          compelling disclosure of several years of tower location data, without\n                          strict necessity, not only violates privacy but also sets a dangerous\n                          precedent in matrimonial disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">                          8.5.   R-2 submits that the Impugned Order constitutes an\n                          unwarranted intrusion into her fundamental rights and should\n                          therefore be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">                          9.

The Wife has assailed the Impugned Order, insofar as it partly\n                          rejected her application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_32\">Order XI Rule 14 of the CPC</a> seeking\n                          discovery and production of certain documents at Serial Nos.(ix), (xi),\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                          (xiv) to (xxiv) which, according to her, are essential for proving her\n                          case of adultery and cruelty against the Husband.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">                          9.2.

Consequently,\n                          circumstantial evidence such as coordinated travel, leave records, and\n                          focused electronic communications assumes particular significance.\n                          The Family Court&#x27;s observation that the request amounted to a\n                          ‗fishing enquiry&#x27; was erroneous, as her application contained specific\n                          particulars--names of hotels, dates of stays, and travel details--fully\n                          satisfying legal thresholds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">                          9.3.   The Wife urged that these documents are necessary not only for\n                          proving adultery under <a href=\"/doc/1151479/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 13(1)(i)</a> of the HMA, 1955 but also for\n                          determining permanent alimony under <a href=\"/doc/95286/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 25</a> of the HMA, as they\n                          reveal the Husband&#x27;s lifestyle and financial capacity.

By compelling such discovery at\n                          an interlocutory stage, the Family Court effectively allowed a fishing\n                          and roving enquiry into his personal affairs, which is impermissible in\n                          law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                          10.4.

The Wife&#x27;s demand for wholesale production of such\n                          records amounted to an unbridled fishing and roving enquiry,\n                          unsupported by specific pleadings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">                          10.5.

No specific\n                          date, place, or incident of alleged adultery has been pleaded in the\n                          Wife&#x27;s petition.

In the context of matrimonial disputes, this discretion is\n                          circumscribed by the statutory framework. <a href=\"/doc/808094/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 13(1)(i)</a> of the\n                          HMA recognises adultery as a distinct ground for divorce. The\n                          procedural framework governing such petitions requires that full\n                          particulars of the alleged matrimonial offence be furnished, including\n                          the identity of the person alleged to be involved. Courts have\n                          consistently required impleadment of such person to ensure fairness in\n                          adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                          14.    This requirement is not one of mere procedural convenience,\n                          but stems from the principles of natural justice as consistently\n                          recognised by judicial precedent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                          15.    The rationale behind this mandate is twofold. First, allegations\n                          of adultery, if proved, entail serious civil consequences and stigma\n                          upon the alleged paramour. To record such findings without affording\n                          them a right of hearing would be contrary to the principle of audi\n                          alteram partem. Second, the Family Court cannot effectively or fairly\n                          adjudicate the ground of adultery without the presence of the alleged\n                          participant. This legislative mandate also underscores a policy choice\n                          that allegations of adultery, by their very nature, touch upon the\n                          reputation and dignity of a third party, and therefore justice requires\n                          that such person be given a fair opportunity to defend themselves.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">                          16.

CDRs and tower location data,\n                          if appropriately circumscribed to a defined period, serve as\n                          corroborative material to either establish or negate the charge of\n                          adulterous association. Such material cannot, therefore, be dismissed\n                          as a roving enquiry; it is directly relevant to the issue in controversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">                          29.     In the present case, the Wife has specifically pleaded that the\n                          Husband maintained an adulterous relationship with R-2, supported by\n                          particulars of travel and communication during the period beginning\n                          January 2020. The Wife obviously does not have any direct evidence\n                          of her husband indulging in acts of adultery. By resort to <a href=\"/doc/1436914/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 14</a> of\n                          the FC Act, she is only trying to seek production of evidence which\n                          she reasonably believes will prove her charge of adultery which by its\n                          very nature can be inferred only from circumstances. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"999818\" id=\"span_105\">In this regard,\n                          reference may be made to the observations of the Coordinate Bench of\n                          this Court in <a href=\"/doc/999818/\" id=\"a_74\">Linda Constance Edwards v.

It is said that the adultery is committed in darkness and secrecy\n                                and, therefore, it is difficult to provide a direct proof. Rather\n                                eyewitness account or photographic account of evidence of\n                                intercourse is taken as offending. A celebrated jurist Raydon in\n                                Raydon on Divorce observes that a direct evidence is rather apt to be\n                                disbelieved as it smacks of manipulation. It is rare that the parties are\n                                surprised in direct act of adultery. In the opinion of Sir William Scott\n                                in Lovedon v.

Further, in <a href=\"/doc/156445466/\" id=\"a_87\">Sachin Arora</a> (supra), this Court emphasized that\n                          the production of records concerning a spouse&#x27;s hotel stays or call\n                          details, sought for the purpose of proving adultery, does not constitute\n                          a ‗roving or fishing inquiry&#x27; when the request is specific and\n                          particularized.

(i) to (viii), (x), (xii) and (xiii) were granted,\n                          while the remainder were rejected. The challenge is whether the Court\n                          correctly exercised its discretion in permitting partial disclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">                          46.   <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_93\">Order XI Rule 14 of the CPC</a>, as discussed above, empowers a\n                          party to seek production of documents in the possession, custody or\n                          power of the opposite party, if such documents relate to matters in\n                          question in the suit. The Court must ensure that this right is exercised\n                          in a manner that is proportionate and does not permit undue fishing or\n                          harassment, while also preventing obstruction of access to genuinely\n                          relevant evidence.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Signature Not VerifiedMAT.APP.(F.C.) 251/2025 and connected matters                    Page 28 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">Signed By:JAI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">NARAYAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">Signing Date:29.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">12:26:22</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">                           47.

The\n                          Court is not bound to grant all requests automatically; it may narrow\n                          or    refuse   requests   which    are   irrelevant,   speculative,    or\n                          disproportionate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">                          48.    In the present case, it is not as if the Wife is seeking\n                          information about any stranger staying in the hotel, her plea is only for\n                          records pertaining to her legally wedded husband, who she has a\n                          reason to believe is indulging in adultery with a particular lady in a\n                          particular room. The Wife has sought details of her husband&#x27;s stay in\n                          a particular hotel during a specific time period and not of his friend or\n                          the friend&#x27;s daughter. Similarly, she has also sought the call details of\n                          her husband alone, whose phone numbers she has provided. Once the\n                          Wife is seeking specific information regarding her husband&#x27;s stay\n                          during a specific period at a specific hotel, it cannot be said that the\n                          Wife is indulging in any roving and fishing inquiry. None of the\n                          Wife&#x27;s prayers, therefore, seek any information about any stranger or\n                          about any vague incident or period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">                          49.
