This Court is vested with the authority to hear this\n           case. Under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 32</a>, this Court has the power to issue\n           directions, orders, or writs for the enforcement of the rights\n           in Part III;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           b.    Queerness is a natural phenomenon known to India\n           since ancient times. It is not urban or elite;\n           c.    There is no universal conception of the institution of\n           marriage, nor is it static. Under <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 245</a> and <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_7\">246</a> of the\n           Constitution read with Entry 5 of List III to the Seventh\n           Schedule, it lies within the domain of Parliament and the\n           state legislatures to enact laws recognizing and regulating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">1</span>\n    (2014) 2 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                              14</span>\n\nqueer marriage;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_260\">d.     Marriage has attained significance as a legal institution\nlargely because of regulation by the state. By recognizing a\nrelationship in the form of marriage, the state grants\nmaterial benefits exclusive to marriage;\ne.     The State has an interest in regulating the ‘intimate\nzone’ to democratize personal relationships;\nf.     The issue of whether the Constitution recognizes the\nright to marry did not arise before this Court in Justice KS\nPuttaswamy (9J) (supra), Shafin Jahan (supra), and\nShakti Vahini (supra);\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_261\">g.     The Constitution does not expressly recognize a\nfundamental right to marry. An institution cannot be\nelevated to the realm of a fundamental right based on the\ncontent accorded to it by law. However, several facets of the\nmarital relationship are reflections of constitutional values\nincluding the right to human dignity and the right to life and\npersonal liberty;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_262\">h.     This Court cannot either strike down the constitutional\nvalidity of SMA or read words into the SMA because of its\ninstitutional limitations. This Court cannot read words into\nthe provisions of the SMA and provisions of other allied laws\nsuch as the ISA and the HSA because that would amount to\njudicial legislation. The Court in the exercise of the power of\njudicial review must steer clear of matters, particularly those\nimpinging on policy, which fall in the legislative domain;\ni.     The freedom of all persons including queer couples to\nenter into a union is protected by Part III of the Constitution.\nThe failure of the state to recognise the bouquet of\nentitlements which flow from a union would result in a\ndisparate impact on queer couples who cannot marry under\nthe current legal regime. The state has an obligation to\nrecognize such unions and grant them benefit under law;\nj.     In <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 15(1)</a>, the word ‘sex’ must be read to include\n‘sexual orientation’ not only because of the causal\nrelationship between homophobia and sexism but also\nbecause the word ‘sex’ is used as a marker of identity which\ncannot be read independent of the social and historical\ncontext;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_263\">k.     The right to enter into a union cannot be restricted\nbased on sexual orientation. Such a restriction will be\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 15.</a> Thus, this freedom is available to all\npersons regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation;\nl.     The decisions in Navtej (supra) and Justice KS\nPuttaswamy (9J) (supra) recognize the right of queer\ncouples to exercise the choice to enter into a union. This\nrelationship is protected from external threat. Discrimination\non the basis of sexual orientation will violate <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 15;</a>\nm.     Transgender persons in heterosexual relationships\nhave the right to marry under existing law including personal\nlaws which regulate marriage;\nn.     Intersex persons who identify as either male or female\nhave the right to marry under existing law including personal\nlaws which regulate marriage;\no.     The state must enable the LGBTQ community to\nexercise its rights under the Constitution. Queer persons\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                           15</span>\n\n            have the right to freedom from coercion from their natal\n            families, agencies of the state including the police, and other\n            persons;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_264\">            p.

Is this the end where we have arrived? The answer must\n                           be an emphatic ‘no’. Legal recognition of non-\n                           heterosexual unions represents a step forward towards\n                           marriage equality. At the same time, marriage is not an\n                           end in itself.

There is no unqualified right to marriage except that\n                       recognised by statute including space left by custom.\n                   ii.

The discussion on discriminatory impacts is in the context\n        of the effects of the existing regimes on queer couples.\n        While a heterosexual couple’s right to live together is not\n        contested, the logic of the discriminatory impact\n        [mentioned in conclusion (vi) above] faced by queer\n        couples      cohabiting    together, would      definitionally,\n        however, not apply to them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\"> ix.

The reasons for arriving at this\n           conclusion are articulated in the opinion of Justice Bhat.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">        b. The rights of LGBTQ+ persons, that have been hitherto recognized by\n           this Court, are the right to gender identity, sexual orientation, the\n           right to choose a partner, cohabit and enjoy physical &amp; mental\n           intimacy. In the exercise of these rights, they have full freedom from\n           physical threat and from coercive action, and the State is bound to\n           afford them full protection of the law in case these rights are in peril.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">5</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">    (2018) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">6</span>\n     (2014) 5 SCC 438\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                           19</span>\n\n\n\n\n        c. There is no unqualified right to marriage guaranteed by the\n           Constitution, that qualifies it as a fundamental freedom. With respect\n           to this, I agree with the opinion of Justice Bhat, but will supplement it\n           with some additional reasons.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92846055\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18303067\" id=\"span_35\">d. The right to marriage is a statutory right, and to the extent it is\n           demonstrable, a right flowing from a legally enforceable customary\n           practice. In the exercise of such a right, statutory or customary, the\n           State is bound to extend the protection of law to individuals, so that\n           they can exercise their choices without fear and coercion. This, in my\n           opinion, is the real import of the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/18303067/\" id=\"a_26\">Shafin Jahan v. Asokan\n           K.M.7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92846055/\" id=\"a_27\">Shakti Vahini v. Union of India8</a>.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_271\">        e. The constitutional challenge to the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_28\">Special Marriage Act, 1954</a> and\n           the <a href=\"/doc/660591/\" id=\"a_29\">Foreign Marriage Act,1969</a> must fail, for the reasons indicated in\n           the opinion of Justice Bhat.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_272\">        f. Similarly, Justice Bhat also rightly finds the semantic impossibilities of\n           gender-neutral constructions of the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_30\">Special Marriage Act, 1954</a> and\n           the <a href=\"/doc/660591/\" id=\"a_31\">Foreign Marriage Act,1969</a>. On both (e) and (f), the opinion of\n           Justice Bhat is exhaustive as to the reasons, and they need not be\n           supplemented.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_273\">        g. I find that a right to a civil union or an abiding cohabitational\n           relationship conferring a legally enforceable status cannot be situated\n           within Part III of the Constitution of India. On this count too, I agree\n           with the conclusions of Justice Bhat, and supplement them with my\n           own reasons.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_274\">        h.
