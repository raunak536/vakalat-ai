According to the State, this will achieve social justice and introduce quality education; and it is for the benefit of the children.  According to the writ petitioners, who are Matriculation Schools, this Act  is  unreasonable and not in the interest of the child.  The most important persons, the children, were not there to express their views and so, with their best interests in mind, we have examined this issue.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\t2. The petitioners in most of the writ petitions are Private Schools Associations from various Districts, while some writ petitions are filed by individuals too.  Only the Matriculation Schools contend that they are aggrieved. There is no challenge from the other two streams, viz. the Anglo-Indian Schools and the Oriental Schools.  The grievance of the writ petitioners was expressed by learned senior counsel Mr. R. Krishnamoorthy, Mr. N.R. Chandran, Mr. K. Doraisami, Mr. R. Muthukumarasamy Mr. M. Venkatachalapathy and Mr. S. Silambanan.  The State was defended by the learned Additional Advocate General, Mr. P. Wilson.  In some of the writ petitions, a third party filed impleading petitions supporting the State, which have been ordered.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">\t3. According to the petitioners, the Act interfered with the right of the children to choose the preferred system of education; it interfered with the right of the parents to choose which system of education was suitable for their children; it interfered with a teacher&#x27;s&#x27; independence, imagination and inventiveness in adapting and adopting teaching methods which were best for her class.  Learned senior counsel submitted that the professed object of the Act, which is to ensure social justice, will not be achieved, as &quot;levelling down&quot; the education pattern by making the system uniform cannot achieve social justice.  If the State was really interested in achieving social justice, it should uplift the ones who are lagging behind instead of dragging down the ones who are superior.  This is exactly what the State will achieve by the Act, and this has also been made clear in the counter affidavit filed by the State, where it is stated that the Act will ensure that the prevailing gaps in quality will be eliminated and there will not be islands of excellence or branded dullards among children, which shows that the islands of excellence will be brought down to a lower level.  It was submitted that in the present days of global competition, when the children of the State are grappling to meet those challenges, it is indeed unfortunate that the State has brought such an arbitrary Act, which will in effect blunt the children&#x27;s skills, as a result of which they will not be in a position to meet the global challenge.  According to them, the Act has made serious inroads in the matter of children&#x27;s education. <a href=\"/doc/143892179/\" id=\"a_2\">The Act</a> does not even give the schools the option to choose textbooks.  The regimentation which the Act seeks to bring in, violates the right of the parent and that of the child, and any attempt on the part of the schools to impart an individualistic type of education will be met with punishment in view of the penal provisions contained in the Act.  The provisions of the Act have no nexus to the objects that it sets out to achieve.  The State had declared that it will use the National Curriculum Framework-2005 (&#x27;NCF&#x27; in short), but many of the provisions of the present Act are contrary to the principles set down in the NCF.  The NCF stresses a &quot;decentralised and participatory manner of education&quot;, which is exactly opposite to what the State has introduced by the Act.  The NCF has suggested that there should be multiple textbooks, the choice of which is left to the teachers, but the Act is contrary to this.  According to the learned senior counsel, these are only some of the examples to show how the Act is contrary to the framework which it professes to fall in line with.  Nowhere in the counter has the State said that there is any major deficiency in the system followed by the schools at present.  It that is so, then there is no justification to interfere with the schools&#x27; autonomy and the schools&#x27; right to decide how they will impart education and transact with the children.  Limiting the choice of systems of education amounts to violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.  According to the learned senior counsel, the popularity and growth of private schools is a clear indicator of the doubtful quality of Government Schools.  If the Government Schools had met with the standards that the parents expect for their children, the Matriculation Schools would not have proliferated.  The reason for doing away with the existing system does not pass the constitutional tests.  There has to be a consultation process before introducing any new system and school children are too precious to be treated as Guinea Pigs and it will really affect the growth of the children.  The system that is sought to be introduced will hinder the development of individuality of the children.  The examination pattern itself shows that it will reduce the quality. Three  Science subjects are now combined into a single Science paper. The schools cannot be treated like factories producing uniform toys.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"261579\" id=\"span_1\">The State must realise that the schools should produce individualistic children capable of rising to the challenges of life.  <a href=\"/doc/143892179/\" id=\"a_4\">The Act</a> will not achieve this.  When even the method of teaching is fixed, as is sought to be done by the Act, the teachers will not have any inclination or inspiration to have a standard of excellence, and with the provisions for punishment looming large, their teaching capacity will be severely curtailed.  According to the learned senior counsel, <a href=\"/doc/104526180/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 4</a> of the Act must be quashed forthwith, since it runs contrary to the Full Bench judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/261579/\" id=\"a_6\">Tamil Nadu Tamil &amp; English Schools Association vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, 2002 (II) C.T.C. 344, and the issues raised in paragraph 25 of the counter are contrary to the Full Bench judgment.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">\t4. All the learned senior counsel submitted that while the State has the power to legislate on this subject, the unconstitutionality springs from the unreasonableness and irrationality.  It was submitted that the attempt to unify the four systems cannot be sustained since unequals cannot be treated as equals and it would run contrary to the promise of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 14.</a>  As per <a href=\"/doc/104526180/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> of the Act, even for adopting English or Tamil as the medium of instruction, approval will be required.  It was submitted that the since both the Civil Procedure Code and the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> are entries in List-III, the State should have obtained the President&#x27;s assent as per <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution, especially when the Act intends to incorporate sections relating to bar of suits or initiation of criminal proceedings and without such assent, it is void.  <a href=\"/doc/143892179/\" id=\"a_11\">The Act</a> is contrary to the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Convention against Discrimination in Education, as our Supreme Court has drawn from such International Conventions while interpreting our Fundamental Rights, as in Vishakha vs. State of Rajasthan, A.I.R. 1997 S.C. 3011.  It was submitted that by <a href=\"/doc/61293127/\" id=\"a_12\">Regulation 7</a> of the Code of Regulations for Matriculation Schools in Tamil Nadu, the State assured that the Matriculation Schools will continue to be free as hitherto, to innovate with regard to their curriculum, and this freedom was a legitimate expectation that they had, which was also affirmed in the Full Bench judgment cited supra and now, the State has transgressed its limits.  The word &quot;norms&quot; used in the Act is vague and when  violation of the norms visits the school with harsh fine, then the penal provisions have to be struck down for vagueness since the norms which have not been clearly specified. <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 45</a> and <a href=\"/doc/854952/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 51</a> of the Constitution are violated by this Act.  Learned senior counsel submitted that it may be contended by the State that ours is the only State which has hitherto prescribed school syllabus for matriculation schools, and the syllabus has been revised as recently as 2005, for which there has been no complaint and therefore, it is not as if the State has suddenly usurped any power.  But the learned senior counsel countered this by submitting that all along, the Regulations had been only recommendatory and not forced down the &quot;throats of the schools&quot;.  The Schools&#x27; right to engage in co-curricular activities is curbed.  When computer education has become a necessity for every individual, the syllabus introduced in the Act does not include computer education.  &quot;The fundamental postulate of personal liberty excludes the power of the State to standardise and socialise its children by forcing them to attend public schools only.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"703393\" id=\"span_2\">A child is not a mere creature of the State&quot; \u0016 vide <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_15\">The Ahmedabad St. Xavier&#x27;s College Society vs. State of Gujarat</a>, (1974) 1 S.C.C. 717. But the State has actually violated this, by standardising the system. The State has misunderstood quality education to mean stultifying educational progress.  It is only at the early age of the child that it is possible for her to assimilate and learn as many subjects as are offered and this Act interferes with that right.  The learned senior counsel also submitted that now that the Central Act, viz. The Right to Education Act (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_16\">RTE Act</a>&#x27; in short) has come into force with effect from 1.4.2010, the impugned State Act would have to give way to the Central Act, in view of <a href=\"/doc/344383/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 254(1)</a> of the Constitution.  Now the entire field of elementary education is occupied by the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_18\">RTE Act</a> and the State cannot lay down the syllabus nor specify  norms nor can it punish schools for not complying with the Act so long as the schools are in conformity with the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_19\">RTE Act</a>. It was submitted that in the Preamble to the Act, it is stated that the four streams of education &quot;are not uniform&quot;.  The fact that they are not uniform does not mean that they do not provide quality education.  Therefore, the fact that they are not uniform cannot justify the introduction of the present system which professes to ensure quality education.  Diverse systems of education can equally provide quality education and therefore, the object has no nexus with the provisions of the Act.  It is very doubtful whether the object sought to be achieved will become a reality merely because the Act has been introduced.  There is also one other factor, i.e., if the Act really intends to achieve a common system of education, then it could not have excluded the other systems which still exist, viz. CBSE, ICSC, Baccalaureate and the children studying under those systems.  If these Boards are also not brought under the scheme, then the object of social justice will remain on paper. It was submitted that the teacher will have to adapt the method of teaching depending on whether the school is in a rural area, or an urban area or  a tribal area so that it is fine tuned to the local needs, but this Act&#x27;s  rigid formula will defeat the prime object, which is educating the child.  The State&#x27;s professed object can be achieved only after due deliberation, research, collaboration and consultation with experts in the field, but without any of these, the Act has been suddenly introduced.  <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_20\">The Act</a> ignores the psychological impact of the child which has been referred to in the Full Bench judgment cited supra.  Though it is stated that there was a consultative process, in actual fact, the invitees to the meeting were only &quot;informed&quot; but not consulted.  Even  the counter affidavit mentions only two dates with regard to the consultation.  Two dates would not be sufficient for such an ambitious enterprise and before really examining the issue from all perspectives, the State has brought the Act in haste.   It was submitted that as children want to pursue higher education, students of Matriculation Schools find it easier to score marks and their performance in competitive examinations is much better than the students who have studied in State Boards.  Now this Act will take away the edge which the Matriculation students enjoyed in the past.  The State ought to have brought the State Board students to the level of Matriculation students, instead of which, they are reducing the Matriculation students to a lower level.  Learned senior counsel relied on several judgments, which will be dealt with later.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t5. In response, the learned Additional Advocate General submitted that none of the objections raised in the writ petitions can be sustained.  The legislative power of the State is found in Entry 25 of List-III of the Constitution.  The object of the Act is to ensure that there is no disparity and division amongst children, so that  a child who had studied in a rural school would feel no inferior to a child who studied in an urban school, since the method of education would be uniform.  He submitted that the objection raised by the schools itself is questionable since at the stage of Public Examination, all the streams coalesce into one.  For Plus One and Plus Two, i.e., XI and XII Standards, it is only the State which decides the syllabus and it is the State which conducts the examination and this position has been so right from 1978.  When the students belonging to the various streams have had no complaints in this regard all along, the bona fides of the present objection itself is to be examined.  He submitted that the petitioners are not really advancing the cause of the child, but their personal interest.  He also submitted that out of the four streams, it was only the Matriculation system which has raised this objection.  No Anglo-Indian School or Oriental School has filed any writ petition.  He submitted that it is not as if this Act has been brought into existence in haste.  Soon after Independence, several Commissions and Committees had deliberated on this issue and they had recommended a common system of education; he referred to the Kothari Commission, the Ramamurthy Report and the Yashpal Committee Report.  He submitted that the Act is in conformity with the NCF.  He submitted that since the disparity in the education and the heavy load that was imposed on the children, both physical and otherwise, came to the attention of the Government, the Government constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Thiru. Muthukumaran, the former Vice Chancellor of the Bharathidasan University, to examine the implementation of the Uniform System of Education.  The Committee examined all the issues and offered its recommendations. Thereafter, a One Man Committee was constituted under Thiru. M.P. Vijayakumar, I.A.S. (Retired). He looked into the Muthukumaran Report and he also submitted his recommendations.  He headed a team of educationalists which visited the States of Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra and reviewed the system that was in vogue in those States and it was after much deliberation that the idea was accepted.  He submitted that it is unfair to suggest that without any consultation, without any research and very casually, the Government has brought this system into vogue.  He submitted that the Matriculation Schools choose their textbooks in an arbitrary manner and the reasons for their choice are not clear.  The Government appointed a Committee to examine the various textbooks which are now used in Matriculation Schools and many of them were found wanting with regard to crucial aspects.  He submitted that, that is why in <a href=\"/doc/101747386/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3</a> of the Act, the Government had laid down the norms for imparting instructions and norms for conducting examinations.  He submitted that the present system of education is a colonial import and by referring to the ancient system of education that prevailed in this country, which was individualistic and which developed the potential of each child, submitted that there can be no complaint when a system of education which has its values based in the Constitution of this country is sought to be introduced.  He submitted that the textbooks have been chosen with great care by a committee of experts whose credentials are beyond question.  He also submitted that there have been various reports regarding the heavy load which a school child bears, both because of the nature of the syllabus and also because of the books the child has to carry. He referred to the negative impact this load has on the child.  Learned Additional Advocate General submitted that in no other State are there so many systems of education.  All the other States  have only two Boards, the State Board and the Central Board and obviously this pattern has not been prejudicial to the interests of the child. The mere fact that historically this State has had four streams of education does not mean that the State, with its avowed object of ensuring social justice and quality education, cannot bring in a uniform, quality based system of education.  He submitted that the Muthukumaran Committee had studied all the different streams and found that they are basically the same and therefore, the uniform system that is now sought to be introduced is only a question of adjustment and modulation of the existing system and not a system where quality is sacrificed.  He referred to the affidavit filed where the textbook for each class has been assessed.  Learned Additional Advocate General submitted that by G.O. Ms. No.159 dated 8.9.2006, the Dr. S. Muthukumaran Committee  was  constituted, which consisted of representatives of Matriculation Schools, Oriental Schools and Anglo-Indian Schools; so it was only after a due consultative process that the recommendations were made. He submitted that therefore there can be no justification for any complaint.  He submitted that this Act is not contrary to the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_22\">RTE Act</a>.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1254258\" id=\"span_3\"><a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_23\">The RTE Act</a> speaks of a curriculum which occupies a larger field, whereas a syllabus only forms a part of it and therefore, both can co-exist.  According to the learned Additional Advocate General,  it is not as if such penal provisions have been introduced for the first time.  Even the Tamil Nadu Private Schools Regulation Act contain a similar provision and there is an in-built statutory safeguard since without sanction, no proceedings can be initiated.  He referred to <a href=\"/doc/1254258/\" id=\"a_24\">K.R. Ramaswamy @ Traffic Ramaswamy vs. State</a>, 2007 (5) C.T.C. 113, where the <a href=\"/doc/19560593/\" id=\"a_25\">Tamil Nadu Tamil Learning Act, 2006</a> was upheld and the power of the State has been clearly stated in <a href=\"/doc/1254258/\" id=\"a_26\">the said judgment</a>, and the definition of &#x27;School&#x27; in that Act and the present Act is the same so the same schools had come under the legislation then.  Learned Additional Advocate General further submitted that <a href=\"/doc/95989119/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 4</a> of the present Act does not speak of prior permission, it only speaks of approval and therefore, it cannot be said to be violative of the Full Bench judgment.  He also submitted that the Act does not forbid the schools from teaching other co-curricular subjects or introducing  co-curricular activities.  <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_28\">The  Act</a> only states that  the State syllabus has to be followed. This does not mean that no extra subject can be taught.  If the penal provisions are not introduced, the Act will be toothless.  He submitted that the right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> is not absolute it is  subject to <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19(6)</a> restrictions.  He submitted that the Act lays down the maximum  number of hours of teaching in a week, out of which the curricular subjects have to be taught in 32 periods and there are eight periods per week where the school has the freedom to teach whichever subject it chooses to.  He submitted that the reason for fixing two different dates for implementation of the Act, i.e., the present academic year for Standards I and VI and the next academic year for Standards II and other standards because of the ground realities of preparing the textbooks for each subject.  By the year 2011, the Act should be implemented in full swing.   He also submitted that merely because a provision for bar of suits is introduced, it does not mean that the President&#x27;s assent for the Act should be obtained.  It is only if that particular provision enters the field which the Central Act already occupies, the President&#x27;s assent should be obtained and he gave a list of the Acts where there is a similar provision and where only the Governor&#x27;s assent has been obtained.  He also referred to various decisions.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1254258\" id=\"span_4\">6. In reply, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Matriculation Schools taught Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Zoology separately, but they are compressed into one in the present Act. So when the children later pursue higher education in a particular branch, they will find it very difficult to cope .  Even the allocation of periods is fixed as per the Act.  It may be that in some schools the students may not need as many subjects for English as is <a href=\"/doc/1254258/\" id=\"a_31\">laid down by</a> the State.  The schools must have the freedom to distribute the teaching hours amongst the various subjects to suit the schools&#x27; needs.  They submitted that the schools and the teachers must be given some &quot;play in the joints&quot;.  Learned senior counsel submitted that it is not necessary for the Central Act and the State Act to be diametrically opposite to each other for the Court to strike down one as bad.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1109491\" id=\"span_5\">In this context, they referred to the observations of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1109491/\" id=\"a_32\">State of Tamil Nadu  vs. Adhiyaman Educational &amp; Research Institute</a>, (1995) 4 S.C.C. 104, which will be dealt with later.  Learned senior counsel further submitted that <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_34\">9</a> of the Act are contrary to each other.  While <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 5</a> provides that the Government will constitute a Board to implement the policy to provide uniform school education, <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 9</a> declares that the duty of the Board is to advise the Government upon the action to be taken for implementing this policy.  Then  <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 14</a>  binds the Board to the directions of the Government on question of policy and the decision of the Government is declared to be final.  Therefore,the  Board&#x27;s stated autonomy in <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_38\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_39\">9</a> is taken away by <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 14</a> and the Board will be merely a spokesperson of the Government.  Further, this is contrary to the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_41\">RTE Act</a> which provides that after the Act comes into force, all the schools would have to abide by the Framework of National Curriculum.  Moreover, <a href=\"/doc/196194544/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 7(5)</a> of the RTE Act provides that the Central Government will develop a framework of national curriculum and <a href=\"/doc/141455941/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_44\">9</a> deal with the duties of the appropriate Government and local authority, and the academic authority which is to be notified by the appropriate Government must bear in consideration the criterion spelt out in <a href=\"/doc/17781695/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 29(2)</a> of the RTE Act.  Therefore, not only should the schools fall in line with the curriculum framed under the Central Act, but this should be <a href=\"/doc/1109491/\" id=\"a_46\">laid down by</a> the academic authority notified under <a href=\"/doc/48858628/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 29</a>.

He quoted Lord Macaulay&#x27;s address to the British Parliament on 2.2.1835 &quot; I propose that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture .....they ill lose their self-esteem...&quot;,to show how by replacing the old and ancient education system, the colonial power took away our national pride and succesfully brought us under their control..

The dilution would have been made but for Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar\u0012s clarity of mind that it is at this age of 11 years that a substantial proportion of children become child labourers. He forcefully argued that the place for children at this age in independent India should be in schools, rather than in farms or factories. This is how an unambiguous commitment to provide free education through regular full-time schools to all children up to 14 years of age (including children below 6 years) by 1960 became an integral component of India\u0012s Constitution. , there was a discussion whether free and compulsory education should be provided to children upto 14 years of age or whether it should be limited to 11 years of age.  Dr. Ambedkar felt that it is at the age of 11 that most of the disadvantaged children become child labourers and he insisted that it is at that age that the children of India should be in schools&quot;. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">\u0016 &quot;Common School System and the future of India&quot; by Prof. Dr. Anil Sadgopal,\nProfessor of Education at the Delhi University\nWe have now made this a child&#x27;s right and this also demonstrates how important the formative years between 11 and 14 are and what could be achieved by a quality education system. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">\t15.

No country in the world has universalised elementary education without promoting a common school system&quot;. Among his recommendations, the following is relevant for our case :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">?\tA common curriculum framework with shared features of curriculum and comparable syllabi with flexibility relating to texts, teaching aids, teaching-learning process, evaluation parameters, assessment procedures and school calendar and an affiliation of a common board of examination for all schools within a State or Union Territory.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">Therefore, the argument that a system which advocates a common syllabus will kill excellence can only be rejected.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">\t16. Gurudev Tagore considered the lack of education as the main hurdle in India&#x27;s race to progress and as the basis of all its problems.  He felt that the colonial education had only one objective and that &quot;was to produce clerks&quot;.  He felt a national system of education in India should discover the truths of its civilization which was neither commercialisation nor imperialism, but rather universalism.  He was against bookish learning.  He felt books came between our minds and lives.  He felt students should gather knowledge and materials &quot;from direct sources and from their own independent efforts&quot;.  In his own words, \n\t&quot;In every nation, education is intimately associated with the life of the people. For us, \u0005.

In the Draft Common Syllabus (DCS) 2009 prepared by the DTERT under the National Curricular Framework 2005, we learn what an ideal primary education should be like.  It has to be a phase of &quot;joyful learning for the child&quot;.  The atmosphere in the classroom should not be stressful.  It should allow learning to take place at an individual pace and permit free interaction among children and the teacher.  The guiding principles should be joyful and non-threatening.  It is to have a textually relevant content.  It should be evocative, sensitive to gender, class, life in a pluralistic society, encourage exploration and be experiential.  The vision takes in quality without compromise and an universal design, which means an inclusive design.  Children come from culturally different backgrounds and therefore, this should be borne in mind while laying down norms for elementary education. And, the DCS-2009 states that &quot;there are multiple intelligences and multiple learning styles.  Multiple modalities of classroom transaction are, therefore, useful&quot;.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">\t18.

Some salient features of the Commission&#x27;s recommendations are enumerated below :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">?\tTeacher Education \u0016 The professional preparedness of teachers being crucial for the qualitative improvement of education, the Commission has urged that this should be treated as a key-area in educational development and adequate financial provision should be made for it.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">?\tEssentials of Curricular Improvement \u0016 For the improvement and upgrading of school curricula, the following measures have been suggested :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">\t\t...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">\t\t(b) Revision of curricula should be based on such research;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">                 \t(c) Basic to the success of any attempt at curriculum improvement is the preparation of text-books and teaching-learning materials; and \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">                \t(d) the orientation of teachers to the revised curricula through in-service be achieved through seminars and refresher courses.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">\t\t(ii) Schools should be given the freedom to devise and experiment with new curricula suited to their needs. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">\t\t(iii) Advanced curricula should be prepared by State Boards of School Education in all subjects and introduced in a phased manner in schools which fulfil certain conditions of staff and facilities. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\tAgain we see that the recommendation is for a national pattern of education and a State Board prepared curricula in all subjects with freedom to the  schools to improvise according to their needs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">\tIII. Ramamoorthy Committee\n\tThereafter, the Government constituted the Ramamoorthy Committee in order to achieve equity and social justice, to remove elitist aberrations, to decentralise educational management at all levels, to inculcate values indispensable for creation of an enlightened and human society.  The Committee&#x27;s recommendations, inter alia, were as follows : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">?\tDecentralised and participative mode of planning and management offers an effective basis for responding to the challenge of regional disparities in education, including girls&#x27; education.  Diverse strategies and disaggregated time-frames, worked out locally, constitute the twin instrumentalities to achieve the goal of universalisation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">?\tIt is recommended that all school text-books, both by NCERT/SCERTs and other publishers, be reviewed to eliminate the invisibility of women and gender stereotypes, and also for the proper incorporation of a women&#x27;s perspective in the teaching of all subjects.  This review should also cover all the supplementary reading material and library books being recommended for schools, particularly those supplied by Operation Black-board.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">?\tThe first step in securing equity and social justice in education is the building up of a Common School System.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">?\tPhased implementation of the Common School System within a ten year timeframe; and essential minimum legislation, particularly to dispense with early selection process, tuition fee, capitation fee etc. \n\tHere the Common school system is described as the first step in securing social justice in education.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">\tIV. Yash Pal Committee (Load of School Bags)\n\tThen came to be constituted by the Government, a National Advisory Committee imder the Chairmanship of Prof. Yash Pal, a former Chairman of the University Grants Commission to suggest ways and means to reduce academic burden on school students.  As regards the curriculum, the Committee felt that when (a) it is too lengthy to be completed in time by an average teacher under normal conditions; (b) there is mismatch between the difficulty level of the concepts of course content with the mental level of the pupils; (c) the language used in the textbooks is incomprehensible and the style of presentation is verbose and rhetorical rather than simple and straight forward; (d) the basic assumptions underlying curriculum development area not fulfilled.  The Committee considered the problem of curriculum load in detail and identified several factors which are manifestation of the existence of the problem, which are highlighted hereunder :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">\t?\tStarting early \n\t? \tSize of school bag\n\t?? \tExamination system\n\t? \tJoyless learning\n\t? \tSyllabi and textbook\nAfter discussing the above indicators or manifestations of the problem of curriculum load, the Committee identified the following as the roots of the problem :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">\t?? \tKnowledge versus information\t\n\t? \tExperts commissioned to write textbooks for school students are isolated\t\tfrom  classroom  realities \u0016  Since  they  are  not  familiar  with   learning\t\tprocess of children, the textbooks prepared by them prove too difficult for\t\tmajority of children.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">\t? \tCentralised character of curriculum\n\t? \tConvention of teaching the &#x27;text&#x27; \u0016 Majority of teachers perceive the\t\tcontent of the textbook as a rigid boundary or a definer of their work in\t\tthe classroom.  Boredom is the inevitable outcome when tersely written\t\ttextbooks is taught in a rigid and mechanical maner. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">\t?\tCompetition based social ethos\n\t? \tAbsence of academic ethos\nFew of the  important recommendations of the Committee are as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">?\tGreater involvement of teachers in framing curriculum and preparation of textbooks at State/UT level.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">?\tThe whole question of curriculum load is a complex question and there are no simple solutions.  It has to be tackled in a comprehensive way, and not through isolated steps.  It may not be possible to enhance overnight the level of competence, motivation and commitment of teachers, provide the facilities required to all the schools, check the growth of commercialisation in education,\n\n\n\tchannelise the parental ambitions and aspirations, and minimise the importance of annual examinations.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">?\tThe measures will naturally include attempts to reform curriculum, raise the level of teachers&#x27; competence, motivation and commitment, strengthen the system of supervision to make teachers responsible for non-performance, provide minimum essential infrastructural facilites to schools and to regulate the system of homework assignment.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">?\tThe Committee was concerned with one major flaw of our system, which is &quot;a lot is taught, but little is learnt or understood&quot;.  This Committee observed the pervasive effect that the examination system had and even the manner in which textbooks are written; it observed that there is a distance between the child&#x27;s everday life and the content of the textbook and had noted the absence of the child&#x27;s viewpoint in the organisation of syllabi in different subjects.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">?\tAs regards textbook writing, the Committee suggested that teaching cannot improve unless there are better textbooks etc.  The Committee was of the opinion that strategies to improve textbook writing and production must work parallel to strategies for improvement in teacher training and for creating an ethos in which teachers would feel motivated to take an academic interest in their work.  The perception that a teacher can do little in the classroom that is different from what the textbook says is part of historical legacy.  This legacy must be transcended and the self-perception rooted in it must be changed.  Teacher training institutions and the mass media, both can assist in making this change possible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">?\tThe process of curriculum-framing and preparation of textbooks should be decentralised so as to increase teachers&#x27; involvement in these tasks.  Decentralisation should mean greater autonomy, within state-level apparatus, to district-level boards or other relevant authority, and to heads of schools and classroom teachers to develop curricular materials on their own, best suited to the needs of local environment.  All the schools be encouraged to innovate in all aspects of curriculum, including choice of textbooks and other materials. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">?\tThe culture of writing textbooks be changed so as to involve a much large number of teachers in the preparation of textbooks.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">?\tThis Committee speaks of the flaws in an exam-driven pattern and advocates decentralisation, innovation by schools in curricular aspects and also the teacher&#x27;s role in preparation and choice of textbooks.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">\tV. Position Paper \n\tThe salient features of the Position Paper presented by the National Focus Group of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) on Aims of Education are as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">?\tEducation must promote and nourish as wide a range of capacities and skills in our children as possible.  The gamut of such skills include the performing arts .... painting and crafts, and literary abilities.... and , skills as diverse as some children&#x27;s special capacity to bond with nature \u0016 with trees, birds and animals \u0016 need to be nurtured.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">?\tThe role of the teacher here is absolutely crucial.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">?\tWith regard to the role of textbooks, the Policy Perspective clearly emphasises that no single textbook should be prescribed for any subject of study, but a reasonable number which satisfy the standards laid down, should be recommended, leaving the choice to the schools concerned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">?\tThe Policy Perspective has commented that,\n\t\t&quot;... At present, there is hardly any common book which all the students in India read and is one of the reasons why our educational system contributes so little in national integration. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">\t\tNo useful purpose is served by having only one textbook in a subject for a given class as this is almost invariably the position under the existing programmes of nationalisation.  It should be an important objective of policy to have at least three or four books in each subject for each class and leave it open to the teachers to choose the book best suited to the school.  This is necessary even if there were to be a common syllabus for all schools.  We have recommended, however, that there should be more than one approved syllabus and that each school should be permitted to adopt the syllabus best suited to its own condition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">?\tContext and the Teaching Learning Material \u0016  No single package, however well and professionally designed, can address all the contextual situations in a country as large as India.  Therefore, a large number of packages should be developed at state and district levels with adequate provision for cluster and school-level modifications and supplementary materials. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">?\tThe availability of a number of alternative Teaching Learning Materials TLM packages, all of approved quality, would certainly increase the choice of the teachers. ...  Each school or teacher should be able to choose the package of her liking, given that she is committed to achieve the required learning levels and all available packages are of proven quality.  Freedom to choose methods and materials is likely to enhance the teacher&#x27;s self-image and responsibility.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">?\tProcess of Development of Teaching Learning Materials Including Textbooks \u0016 State run institutions alone cannot develop a large number of TLM package and involvement of private publishers would become inevitable.  If a large number of TLM packages are to be made available all over the country involving both private and state bodies, it would be important to develop clearly outlined mechanisms of quality control including the establishment of some standards for the very process of development.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">\tVI. Draft Concept Paper on Pedagogy for Common Syllabus 2009\n\tIn this Paper, we find an effort to build a broad consensus among syllabi, by way of Core Content and Competencies, and also keeping in mind the national mandate of Education for All.  <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_66\">The Act</a> is meant for Standards I to X.  In the Concept Paper on Pedagogy, they deal with the role of the text book for a child in the age group of 5 and 10.  In the opinion of psychologists, this is the &quot;concrete operational stage where the child learns by doing and the child grows conscious of learning&quot;.  Schooling is an attempt to build on this consciousness and this is achieved by (a) regulation of time, (b) regulation of focus, and (c) regulation of effort.  This Paper has given importance to child-friendly learning and child-centred pedagogy.  When children become adolescent and they reach this age while in school, the scenario changes and naturally, compared to younger children, the adolescents&#x27; thinking is &quot;more advanced, more efficient and generally more complex&quot;.  The five aspects of this transition affect the conceptualisation of the syllabus \n\n\nand the gradient of the syllabus must accommodate these stages.  The Paper observes that the reality is that in most classrooms, as children reach high school, the atmosphere &quot;is characterised by passivity&quot;.  The rights of the child require that any scheme of centralised education must provide a syllabus for active learning.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\t19. This Draft Concept Paper then takes a look at what a text book can do in this regard.,  how it can create spaces for children to explore and question, support democratic classroom processes etc. The integrated vision of a text book requires that it should be creative, functional, multisensory and structural.  The NCF-2005 clearly states that there should be plurality of text books, widening the teachers&#x27; choice and also providing for incorporation of diversity in relation to children&#x27;s needs and interests.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1095409\" id=\"span_13\">20.

The Court should to try to sustain its validity to the extent possible. It should strike down the enactment only when it is not possible to sustain it. The court should not approach the enactment with a view to pick holes or to search for defects of drafting, much less inexactitude of language employed. Indeed any such defects of drafting should be ironed out as part of the attempt to sustain the validity/constitutionality of the enactment. After all, an act made by the legislature represents the will of the people and that cannot be lightly interfered with. The unconstitutionality must be plainly and clearly established before an enactment is declared as void. The same approach holds good while ascertaining the intent and purpose of an enactment or its scope and application.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">In the same paragraph the Court further observed as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">\t&quot;The Court must recognize the fundamental nature and importance of legislative process and accord due regard and deference to it, just as the legislature and the executive are expected to show due regard and deference to the judiciary.

They categorically emphasised that no private publisher has a right to insist that his textbook shall be published by the Government and they upset the Government&#x27;s textbook not because the respondent publisher had a right to have his books necessarily considered by the Government, but because the syllabi had not been published prior to the prescription of textbooks.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"388295\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/388295/\" id=\"a_94\">Naraindas Indurkhya vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>, (1974) 4 S.C.C. 788, the Supreme Court dealt with the question whether the State Government could prescribe textbooks to the exclusion of other text books on the subject for use in primary and middle school classes.  They held as follows :-</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">\t&quot;19. One thing is clear that in order to achieve a uniform standard of excellence in education in all the schools within the State, it is necessary that there should be uniform courses of instruction which are properly thought out and devised by experts on the subject and for giving proper and adequate training in such courses, there should be standardised text books. That would not only ensure uniformity in standard but also achieve efficiency in instruction. Moreover, it would prevent use of poor quality text books which frequently find way in the schools on account of certain dubious financial arrangements between the management and the printers and publishers of those text books. It is, therefore, in the interest of proper and healthy education of children that scientifically planned courses of instruction should be laid down and text books of high merit and excellence should be prescribed. That can never be regarded as unreasonable. Now when the Legislature decides to adopt this course, the Legislature must necessarily entrust the task of laying down courses of instruction and prescribing text books to some authority fitted and equipped for this purpose. We are concerned here only with prescription of text books and we will, therefore, confine our attention to that subject. The Legislature, when it enacted the Act of 1959, left the task of selecting and prescribing text books to be performed by the Text Books Committee but under <a href=\"/doc/95989119/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 4</a>, sub-section (1) of the Act of 1973 the Legislature has provided that this task shall be performed by the State Government. Now it can hardly be disputed that for the purpose of selection and prescription of text books, the machinery of Text Books Committee would be more efficient and objective, and inspiring of greater confidence as to its fairness and impartiality than that of the State Government, but on that account alone the entrustment of the power of selection and prescription of text books to the State Government cannot be regarded as bad. The Legislature may choose one of several methods available to it for achieving its legislative end and the Court cannot interfere simply because it thinks that another method is better and should have been adopted by the Legislature, for ultimately it is for the Legislature in exercise of its legislative judgment to determine which of many possible methods it should in the circumstances adopt....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">\t20. ...This Court, however, took the view that no fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on their business of preparing, printing, publishing and selling text books was infringed by the notifications issued by the State Government in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of text books for students and the petitioners were, therefore, not entitled to any relief under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.

So, what follows from all these judgments is that we have to presume the constitutionality of the Act.  We should read the Central Act and the State Act harmoniously so that both can be upheld.  The manner in which repugnancy has to be understood has been specified in <a href=\"/doc/1109491/\" id=\"a_121\">Adhiyaman</a>&#x27;s case (infra), where the Supreme Court explained how a State Act could be repugnant to the Central Act without running totally contrary to the Central Act.  The Supreme Court has held that the State has the right to regulate the standard of education, but at the same time, the parents&#x27; right is also a pivotal point in the democratic system.  The State can lay down standards which are higher than the standards <a href=\"/doc/1109491/\" id=\"a_122\">laid down in</a> the Central Act.  <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_123\">The Act</a> has to be reasonable and cannot violate the right of equality; it should be fair.  The decision of academic matters are best left to experts who are familiar with it and Courts may not interfere with it.  The State can prescribe textbooks.  The suitable curriculum based on a general consensus which accords with classroom should be evolved.  If the State, in the interest of proper and healthy education, prescribes textbooks of high merit and excellence, it cannot be regarded as unreasonable and when the legislature decides to adopt this course, it must necessarily entrust this task to some authority.  The State can impose conditions which prescribe syllabus, courses of study, regulations of conditions of employment of teachers etc. and the State can make regulations with a view to achieve the goal of maintenance of excellence.Even the International Conventions uphold the authority&#x27;s right to lay down minimum standards of education while protecting the right of choice of the parent and child.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">\t35. In 2002 (II) C.T.C. 344 (cited supra),  the Tamil and English Schools Association, challenged the Government Order issued by the State prescribing that two out of three subjects in all nursery and elementary schools shall be taught in Tamil medium, apart from teaching Tamil as a subject.  The Full Bench struck down the said G.O. terming it irrational, arbitrary and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  Some of the reasons given by the Full bench for arriving at this conclusion are :- \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">\t&quot;a) A reading of the report of the committee would only show that it has only expressed its view in the matter and there is absolutely nothing to show that it considered the views expressed by others.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">\tb) The statement of, Dr. V.C. Kuzhandhaiswami in his statement issued in the year 1992, when he was the Vice Chancellor of Indira Gandhi Open University, New Delhi that &quot;there should be a realistic approach when dealing with ticklish problem. Tamil should no doubt be made as a compulsory subject of study from LKG class. English medium may be permitted, if that is the choice of the parents..&quot; (vide page Nos.78 and 81 of Annexure E filed by the State)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">\tc) The committee should have called for statistics from each and every school in the State and examined the same in detail to find out if the students are directed to study the subject in Tamil/mother-tongue whether \nit will affect them in any manner which should mean a time consuming process and which is absolutely necessary. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">\td) There are certain annexures to the report. One annexure is to the effect that one Joint Director (Education Department) Tamil Nadu met eleven high officials of the Education Department of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad on a single day i.e. on 27.5.1999, discussed the matter with them and obtained information from them with regard to the administration and functioning of all the Schools. .....We do not understand why the Joint Director should have acted in such a hasty manner. ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">\te)When there is a change of policy, which had been there for over a period of half a century, it should have in all fairness called upon the Board of Matriculation Schools, the Managements&#x27; Association and the Parents&#x27; Association by sending individual communications to them to appear before the committee on a particular day to express their views. This is because of three reasons:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">\t(1) The Government gave recognition to the Schools without any condition and at every stage since 1950 it has been clearly understood that English shall be the medium and in fact it has been so;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">\t(2) Parents opted these schools instead of Anglo Indian or C B. S. E., Schools;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">\t(3) While constituting the committee the Government ignored G.O.Ms. No.1720 (School Education C2 Department), dated 25.7.1977 in which the Government clearly laid down that the Matriculation Board shall advise the Director of School Education which consists of representatives from the Management/Head of the School/public.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">\tf) One has to remember that education policy cannot be changed every now and then. It should be precise and complete. It must be a long term policy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">\tg) The State cannot be heard to say that it will face the situation as and when they come and take remedial measures, particularly when the committee and the State Government have not even applied their mind or taken pains to find out the problems that may arise. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">       h) Even on the date of hearing the State could not place materials before us to demonstrate that there are sufficient number of schools with different mediums in all places and that the G.O. can be implemented without any difficulty. The committee/Government should have conducted a detailed study of each School/area etc., before taking any decision.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">\ti) On a careful examination of the entire matter, we are of the clear view that Government also failed to consider the relevant materials/factors and took into consideration irrelevant materials/factors. In view of this, G.O. has to be quashed as irrational.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">\tj) It may be pointed out that in the cases with which we are concerned there was only a Government Order and the change in the policy is not by any legislation ...... the Matriculation Schools have been teaching in English medium for over fifty years. They have been permitted to continue ever since the date of recognition of all the Schools and that recognition has been granted without any condition. .....In the circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that the managements are perfectly justified in claiming that on the principles of legitimate expectation the impugned order is liable to be quashed which order, we have already found to be irrational, arbitrary and unreasonable.&quot; \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">\tk) Referring to the Convention on The Rights of the child and several Supreme Court decisions, the Full Bench held that, it is almost an accepted proposition of law that the rules of customary international law which are not contrary to the municipal law shall be deemed to be incorporated in the domestic law. &quot;Equally well established is the rule of construction that if there be a conflict between the municipal law on one side and the international law or the provisions of any treaty obligations on the other, the Courts would give effect to municipal law. If, however, two constructions of the municipal law are permissible, the Courts should lean in favour of adopting such construction as would make the provisions of the municipal law to be in harmony with the international law or treaty obligations. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\tl) As to the question  whether the right to education will include the right to choose the medium of instruction and whether the parents can exercise such a right on behalf of the child the Full bench held that  a parent is entitled to direct and education of his son in the manner he considers best suited and to guide thereby his future prospects.

Now the parents are not demanding the State to provide education. They desire and only want to be left alone to decide. It is not as if, they want their children to learn something, which is prohibited under law. All that they want is to educate their children all the subjects of their choice. Certainly, it cannot be said that the nation&#x27;s image and dignity will be affected, as the language English has already been accepted by this nation as an &#x27;associate language. No one can claim to know better than the parents about the child, to decide, as to what the child requires in the sphere of education and such a decision they take keeping their duty in mind to shape the career and destiny of their child. With the nation touching a population of 100 crores and the State of Tamil Nadu with more than 6 crores, may not be able to do much in view of the limitations and constraints on them. First, the State has to endeavour to provide food and shelter to every one and education comes only thereafter. It can safely be said that the only logical conclusion that flows from the various decisions referred to supra and the discussions made above, is that the right to education is a fundamental right, which also includes the right to choose the medium of instruction and it can be exercised by the parents on behalf of their children.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">\to) The stand of the parents is that they have a pivotal/prior right to decide what kind of education their children require and this they have to decide keeping in mind various factors.

The Court, while recognising that the purpose was to promote civic cohesiveness and while acknowledging the State&#x27;s power to prescribe the school curriculum, held that &quot;these were not adequate to support the restriction upon the liberty of teacher and pupil.  In the separate opinion of Justice Stewart, J., who agreed with the result, he observed, &quot;The States are most assuredly free to choose the curriculums for their own schools.  It is one thing for a State to determine that the subject of higher mathematics or astronomy or biology shall or shall not be included in the public school curriculum.  It is quite another thing for a State to make it a criminal offence for a public school teacher so much as to mention the very existence of an entire system of respected human thought.&quot;  Justice Stewart felt that such kind of criminal law definitely impinge upon the guarantees of free speech.  In West Virginia Board of Education vs. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, Justice Jackson observed as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">\t&quot;The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.

In South Africa, the State brought in reforms in the educational policy there had been a history of racial injustice. A law was enacted to remedy the results of the racially discriminatory laws and practices of the past.

A just and equitable order may be made even in instances where the outcome of a constitutional dispute does not hinge on constitutional invalidity of legislation or conduct. This ample and flexible remedial jurisdiction in constitutional disputes permits a court to forge an order that would place substance above mere form by identifying the actual underlying dispute between the parties and by requiring the parties to take steps directed at resolving the dispute in a manner consistent with constitutional requirements. In several cases, this Court has found it fair to fashion orders to facilitate a substantive resolution of the underlying dispute between the parties. Sometimes orders of this class have taken the form of structural interdicts or supervisory orders. This approach is valuable and advances constitutional justice particularly by ensuring that the parties themselves become part of the solution.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">In Christian Education South Africa vs. Minister of Education, 2000 (4) SA 757, the Constitutional Court of South Africa observed as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">\t\u0013In essence, the Court must engage in a balancing exercise and arrive at a global judgment on proportionality and not adhere mechanically to a sequential check-list.

Bel Porto School Governing Body and Others vs. Premier of the Western Cape Province and Another, 2002 (3) SA 265, is a case where the issues  raised are somewhat similar to this case There the South African Government pursued a policy to give effect to the Constitutional imperative to introduce equity into its educational system. Here the State declares that its object is to give effect to the Constitutional imperative of social justice and education to children.  In Bel Porto, the schools did not dispute the validity of the policy&#x27;s goal, nor did they dispute the core aspects of that policy.  But they complained that the rationalisation programme imposes an unfair burden on them and they were neither informed adequately about the programme nor were they consulted.  Here too, the schools do not dispute the power of the State to legislate in this regard, nor do they question the worth of the object, but they do question whether the object will be achieved by this Act.  They complain that this uniform system, if implemented, would impose an unfair restriction and as in the South African case, that they were neither informed adequately nor were they consulted.  In Bel Porto, the question was regarding the norm for determining the total number of staff and the service contracts and conditions for the workers available from the Department and the disparity between the workers from other Education Departments and the appellants schools.  Here the objection is to the imposition of norms regarding the syllabus and textbooks. So, the   issues are different, but some of the observations there throw light on the issue that is before us.  The purpose of the scheme in Bel Porto was to promote equality and the purpose of the policy was to equalise the &quot;education system and to put all schools on the same level&quot;.That purpose is not very different from the purpose of this Act. The following paragraphs in Bel Porto are relevant:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">\t&quot;The approach now adopted by the courts of England to judicial review in public law cases, is that \u0013the intensity of review . . . will depend upon the subject matter in hand\u0014.  Thus, action affecting rights protected under the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_131\">Human Rights Act</a> usually calls for heightened scrutiny and more intensive review than action affecting other rights or interests. As we have heard no argument on whether under our law the intensity of review \n\nin cases involving the infringement of particular rights may require a stricter standard than rationality, I prefer to express no opinion on that issue. The present case is concerned with policy matters relating to attempts to introduce equity into an inherently unequal education system, with all the difficulties attaching to that. The changed policy does not infringe any constitutional or other rights of the appellants. It is a case in which courts should tread warily.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">\tI would add only this. Policy is not written in stone. It can be adapted from time to time to meet the exigencies of particular cases. If the appellants consider that their special needs call for some special consideration in relation to the re-deployment process, or the cost of retrenchment, it remains open to them to continue to press their case for such relief. But it is the Department and not this Court that must decide this question.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">In this case, the policy relates to the education of children.We have to tread warily. We must understand that the attempt to introduce equality in the schools in question to achieve social justice  is fraught with difficulties. The schools had been following different paths till X Std until they merged under the State umbrella for XI and XII Stds The Policy allowed it. But as observed above &quot;policy is not written in stone&quot; so we should see if the change of policy meets the constitutional requirements without offending any fundamental rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">\t40.

So all the schools following different systems have followed the State prescribed syllabus.  Perhaps till now, it was more recommendatory in nature, but now the Act makes it mandatory.  But all the schools have accepted the State&#x27;s power to prescribe syllabus.  Of course, now the State also prescribes the textbooks.  We will examine the legality of that in the latter part of this judgment.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">\t41. There is no dispute that the syllabus is prepared by the State for Anglo-Indian Schools and for Matriculation Schools also.  In fact, in the revised syllabus for matriculation schools which was prepared by the High Level Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. A. Gnanam, the objective did not seem to be very different from the objectives that the State intends to introduce by the &#x27;Samacheer Kalvi Thittam&#x27;.  And, it is clear from the preface that the syllabus that is prepared intends to include a curriculum to facilitate a smooth, seamless transition when the Matriculation students move to the State or Central Board Curriculums in Standards XI and XII.  There is no dispute that in Standards XI and XII, all the four streams merge into one.  Therefore, students belonging to any of the four streams that are included in the Act will either join the State Board Curriculum for Standards XI and XII or the Central Board Curriculum for Standards XI and XII, depending on the students&#x27; choice or the parents&#x27; choice.  Therefore, ultimately the road leads to the same goal post.  The matriculation schools who are the petitioners herein have accepted the Revised syllabus for Matriculation schools without any protest.  Their case is that this syllabus is recommendatory and it is not a strait-jacket formula.  The State has professed that one of the objectives in introducing &#x27;Samacheer Kalivi Thittam&#x27; is to reduce the load on the students.  A chorus of objection is raised by the petitioners stating that reduction of learning load equates to reduction in quality.  According to them, any syllabus prepared by the State will be inferior to the syllabus that the matriculation schools have followed since the State&#x27;s object is to reduce the learning load.  We do not think we can sustain this objection since in the preface to the revised syllabus for Matriculation Schools brought into force from 2005-2008, it is stated that &quot;there has been a conscious effort to reduce the learning load of the students ... any substantial reform in this aspect should be done only with the joint effort of other Boards&quot;.  The preface also indicates that this reduction has been made without lowering the competitiveness of the system and the parents&#x27; attitude and aspirations. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">\tThe State&#x27;s stand is that this Act has also reduced the load without diluting the quality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">\t42. We have already seen that the petitioners had not really challenged the power of the State to legislate.  The petitioner-schools and the two other streams, viz. Oriental and Anglo-Indian Schools, have already subjected themselves to State&#x27;s regulation for Classes XI and XII.  The Tabular column above also shows that even upto Class X, the Oriental Schools follow only the State Board syllabus and textbooks and the change that is effected by the introduction of the Act cannot be attacked as unreasonable.  In the Tamil Nadu Code of Regulations for Matriculation Schools, <a href=\"/doc/12884517/\" id=\"a_132\">Regulation 7</a> provides that the schools will continue to be fee based, that the schools can use English as medium of instruction and they will continue to be free to innovate with regard to curriculum except for the last one year.  For Anglo-Indian Schools, the Government reserves under Regulation 42, both the right to forbid and the right to prescribe the use of books.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\t43. We have already noted that the petitioners contended that the State has the power to legislate in this subject of Education. It is clear from the scheme of the Central Act that the National Curriculum policy must be implemented by the State through either the academic authority or the State Council. So we have to see if both the Acts can coexist. We have condensed the law laid down in the various decisions., and we find that the Supreme court has clearly held that the State can lay down the syllabus and also prescribe the texbooks. The recommendation of the various commitees and the National groups also recommend that in the interest of social justice a common pattern can be evolved, while leaving the space for independence and improvisation of the schools intact. \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_83\">\t44. <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_133\">The Act</a> aims to bring social justice and quality education.  The petitioners are very sceptical about this.  According to them, social justice will not be achieved by this process, and on the other hand, what is likely to happen is, levelling down of the excellent to the mediocre.  According to them, the textbooks prescribed by the Government will not be adequate to equip the students to meet the global challenge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">\t45. As early as in 1964-66, the Education Commission had recommended that a common school system of education would bring together different social classes and would promote equality and integration among people. The Commission was of the opinion that, &quot;education itself is tending to increase social segregation and to perpetuate and widen class distinctions ... this is bad not only for the children of the poor, but also for the children of the rich and the privileged classes&quot; and that, &quot;by segregating their children, such privileged parents prevent them from sharing the life and experiences of the children of the poor and coming into contact with the realities of life .... also render the education of their own children anemic and incomplete&quot;.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">\t46. According to the Commission, if these evils of division and disparity are to be eliminated and if education system is to become a powerful instrument of social and national integration, then we must move towards a common school system of public education.  For example, the affluent child will know that there is life beyond an air-conditioned room.  Even from her early age, she will also learn that there are some of his classmates who may come from homes which are smaller than a single room in her house and she will learn that the divisions are only on the surface, but really they are one.  In the same way, the child who hails from a lower income household will perhaps perceive that by education and effort (hard work), the vistas of his world will be widened.  According to the State, this is their object, viz. to promote social justice and to remove the divisions.  According to the State, the object of the Act is to remove the elitist attitude of children of urban schools, since all the schools would be following a common syllabus as laid down by the State.   &quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">\t47.

The petitioners submitted that there is a huge difference between the concept of a common school system and uniform school system as according to them, the uniform school system would allow no flexibility and it would not be decentralised, which is what the National Curriculum Framework insists, and it will allow no flexibility to the teachers. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">\t49. This submission may be right in that the perception of a common school system differs from the perception of a uniform school system.  But considering the main objects of bringing the Act, viz. social justice and quality education, we will understand uniform school system to mean a common school system which will give a greater academic freedom and reflect the diversity of the country, moving from the present rigidity with flexibility, textuality and plurality as the defining principles.  In the United States of America, when there was a change in policy it was attacked as a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of textbooks.  This dumbing down is what is the main apprehension of the petitioners.  Petitioners submitted that there is a huge difference between the concept of a common school system and uniform school system as according to them, the uniform school system would allow no flexibility and it would not be decentralised, which is what the National Curriculum Framework seems to indicate, and it will allow no flexibility to the teachers. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">\t50. Materials were produced before us giving the names of the Draft Syllabus Committee constituted for &#x27;Samacheer Kalvi&#x27; and we found that apart from Senior Lecturers of D.I.E.T. in various districts, Post-Graduate teachers from across the State from Matriculation Schools, Anglo-Indian Schools and Higher Secondary Schools had been invited to suggest and to prepare the draft syllabus.  A fairly broad based group of people had been invited to prepare the syllabus.  The fears of the petitioners that the textbooks that are prescribed by the State would not match the textbooks that they have been using appears to spring from their comparison of the existing State Board textbooks with the textbooks used by the matriculation schools.  The materials produced before us \u0016 and a sample textbook was also shown \u0016 clearly shows that the State wants to make  a clean break in designing the textbooks bearing in mind broadly the suggestions made by the various committees hitherto and also the suggestions of the education experts whom they had on their team.  Repeatedly, the learned Additional Advocate General submitted that the petitioners shall not base their conclusions on the students who study in the State Board Schools, but what the State has produced now is an effort to improve the education standards and to give quality education. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\tWithout equality in education, to all the children in the State,  there will not be a real democracy.  The children cannot live in water-tight compartments based on class and social divisions.  There should be free interaction and integration.  The State has the right to introduce a legislation with such an object in mind.  We will also, in the later paragraphs of the judgment, consider whether they can use police power to enforce such a system, whether they can lay the schools on &quot;Procrustean beds&quot; and cut them or stretch them to size. We can not ignore that the flower of education can flourish only on the fertile soil of freedom of thought and expression. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_93\">\t51. The petitioners contended that by reduction of exams, the quality of education will be reduced.  We do not think so.  It is clear from the National Curriculum Framework that the State wants to move the children away from a marks-driven/exam-driven regime into a system where learning becomes joyful and therefore, the statistics given regarding the number of papers that a matriculation student writes does not recommend the case of the petitioners to us.  In the counter filed by the respondents, they have refuted the averments that there is no proper infrastructure and they have submitted certain details regarding the improvements done during the year 2006-2007 which relate to provision of computers to Government Higher Secondary Schools, construction of classrooms under the &#x27;Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan&#x27; Scheme, introduction of activity based learning in all schools from Standards I to IV, release of NABARD Bank&#x27;s assistance for building, drinking water facilities, toilets and furniture to Government Higher Secondary Schools and imparting yoga training.  It is also stated that the activity based learning methodology is submitted on the Rishi Valley Experiment on children&#x27;s learning.  By this method of learning, the process of learning is structured and the child can move forward through the ladder system on his own pace without omitting any of the competencies.  According to the respondents, this methodology addresses the multigrade and multilevel teaching.  This ABL methodology has been introduced in Chennai Corporation Schools in the year 2003.  There are certain great advantages of ABL methodology.  Classroom becomes a comfortable zone for children; students&#x27; absenteeism is reduced; there is self-examination; there is scope for peer teaching and peer learning; lessening of burden of homework; teacher-parent relationship gets strengthened; teacher-child relationship becomes more meaningful etc. and the respondents state that the children who study in ABL system perform well in Tamil, Mathematics and Science.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">\t52. One of the great international Tamil scholars, Professor Zvelebil has written,\n\t&quot;If it is true that liberal education should liberate by demonstrating the cultural values and norms foreign to us by revealing the relativity of our own values, then the discovery and enjoyment of Tamil literature and even its teaching ... should find its place in the systems of western training and instruction in the humanities&quot;.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">While this shows his opinion of the greatness of Tamil as a part of universal heritage, it also shows that education in the real sense should not have strict compartments, but rather it should be a discovery of different values and different norms so that we assimilate the best from everywhere.  Therefore, we have to make sure that the Act is construed or understood as acknowledging the freedom of the parents to choose the mode of education for their child rather than restricting it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">\t53. It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that since the Civil Procedure and the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_134\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> are in the Concurrent List, the bar of suits in <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 14</a>  and the penal provisions  in Ss11 and 12of the present Act would amount to an encroachment into a field occupied by the Centre unless the President&#x27;s assent is obtained under <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution.  On the other hand, the learned Additional Advocate General submitted that there are very many Acts where there are such bars and penal provisions and where the Governor&#x27;s assent alone has been obtained.  We do not think the submissions of the petitioners in this regard can be accepted.  There is no central enactment relating to school with which these provisions collide.  It is only then that these two sections will amount to an encroachment.  <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_137\">The Act</a> really is a legislation on the subject covered by Entry 25 of List-III.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665682\" id=\"span_53\">54.

So the  State imposes a disqualification on non-citizens from holding the post.  It cannot be said that it is an unreasonable classification nor that it is totally disconnected to the object sought to be achieved.  The State Legislature can enact laws in respect of a religious institution.  If as a consequence foreigners are disqualified from holding the post, then that cannot be a reason for holding that the Legislature has made an inroad into the field covered by List I.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\">In this case, the writ petitioners concede that the State can enact this law as long as it is not in conflict with <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_142\">RTE Act</a>.  The mere fact that there is a bar of suit with regard to the subjects covered by this Act will not be a reason to hold that, by that provision, the legislation has encroached into the area occupied by the Parliament under Entry 13 of List-III.  So, this objection is rejected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">            The objection that this Act makes and invidious discrimination between the State Board schools and the Central Board schools cannot be accepted.

In this case too, the Act has not prescribed the syllabi or the Act does not contain any schedule which spells out he syllabi.  Moreover, the common syllabus is only meant for the curricular subjects, which are the five subjects, i.e., Mathematics, Science, Social Science, English and Tamil.  The norms have not been specified in the Act either as an annexure or in the schedule or in the definition.  The syllabus has not been laid down sufficiently early. We have already seen in the Full Bench decision that education policy for children must be free from ambiguity and it should have clarity.  We have already held in the paragraphs above that the State has the power to bring in a system of education common to all. But no prejudice will be caused to anyone if we postpone the commencement of the Act for Standards I and VI; on the other hand, there will be better clarity and certainty in the minds of the teachers, the schools and the children. The norms, the syllabus and the textbooks shall be made known to all the stakeholders \u0016 the teachers, the students, the parents and the schools \u0016 before introducing it in the academic year. This shall be done for all classes only from Academic Year 2011-2012 or whenever they are made ready and known to the parties concerned.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">\t(b) Norms for giving instructions :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">\ti.\t<a href=\"/doc/99907733/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 3(2)(a)</a> of the Act states that the schools shall follow the norms fixed by the Board for giving instruction in each subject.  The first step before <a href=\"/doc/99907733/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 3(2)</a> is translated into action is for the State to lay down the norms.  The norms have to be specified with clarity; it should allow flexibility and innovation.  Until the State specifies the norms, no school can be expected to follow it.  When we asked the learned Additional Advocate General what was meant by &#x27;norms&#x27;, he answered that it only means the &#x27;hours of teaching&#x27;.  <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_149\">The Act</a> does not explain what the word &#x27;norms&#x27; indicates.  In fact, in the Yash Pal Committee Report, it was highlighted that one of the problems faced by the curriculum board is the perception of teachers that the content of the textbook is a rigid boundary.  So, if rigid boundaries are laid down for teachers, the Yash Pal Committee says, boredom is the inevitable outcome.  If the children are bored, then the laudable aim for which the Act has been introduced will fail even at the starting point.  The Yash Pal Committee also suggested that there should be greater autonomy to classroom teachers to develop curricular materials best suited to the needs of the local environment.  We saw in Meyer vs. Nebraska (supra) that the State&#x27;s power to prescribe the school curriculum does not extend to restricting the liberty to teacher and pupil, and the United States Supreme Court also declared that while it is one thing for a State to determine that a particular subject shall or shall not be included in the public school curriculum, it is quite another thing to make it a criminal offence to mention the very existence of an entire accepted system of thought.  The Schools Act of South Africa upholds the rights of parents, learners and educators, which means teachers.  A teacher constantly under the scanner as regards norms is not likely to be an inspiring teacher, nor will she promote excellence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">\tii.\tIn NCF-2005, stress is laid on individual teachers exploring new avenues of transacting the curriculum.  It is observed there that these efforts are sometimes creative and ingenious, but largely remain unnoticed.  It also underscores the importance of creating among teachers a sense of their own agency, which in turn, will foster a sense of greater involvement and commitment to their work.  A teacher who is always looking behind her shoulder to see if the State is watching her will subliminally transmit that fear and apprehension to her students.  This will not be in the best interest of the child. Children who are taught by such teachers who are persistently worried about breaking the norms and incurring the State&#x27;s wrath can never meet the global challenges nor will their education be qualitatively excellent.  The State can only indicate the broad syllabus pattern.  It cannot lay down the specifics for adherence.  That would defeat the object of the Act.  It would be an unreasonable restriction on the rights of the teacher.  It is also contrary to the National Curriculum Framework.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_191\">\tiii.\tThe teacher plays an important role especially in the early years of the child.  DCS-2009 states that &quot;the teacher is a facilitator rather than the central figure in such processes.  She/he is not the only learning resource.  Children learn individually, from each other and in large groups ... Children learn to learn while learning&quot;.  For the teacher to be an ideal facilitator, she has to have autonomy, independence and definitely &quot;play in the joints&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_192\">\tiv.\tIn order to achieve social justice, which is proclaimed as the ultimate object of the Act, a teacher will have to modulate the way she transacts with a child who comes from an educated ambience and a child who is probably a first generation scholar.  The State cannot lay down a norm which is a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27;.  We are even doubtful whether the State can exactly specify the number of periods that a teacher shall teach a particular subject.  The school may decide that for a particular class, one more hour of say, Science or Maths, as the case may be, is necessary, then the school should have the flexibility to make the necessary changes.  Realistically speaking though, we have our own doubts whether the majority of the schools in our State devote such thought to the students and adapt or adopt their strategies.  At present the schools are fine tuned only to the examination perspective and they are marks-driven and results-driven.  But the materials placed before us by the State indicate that the State wants to make a clean deviation from the past monotonous practice and to create schools and classrooms where children would find that learning is joyful.  If that is indeed the aim \u0016 and we earnestly hope it is \u0016 then, laying down strict, inviolable norms as regards instructions will defeat its very purpose.  Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/99907733/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 3(2)(a)</a> must be read  thus :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_193\">\tEvery school shall follow, as far as practicable, the norms fixed by the Board for giving instruction in each subject.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_194\">\t(c) Norms for conducting examination :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">\ti.\tAll the schools join the mainstream at the level of Standards XI and XII.  For Standard X again, since that is the threshold at which the students move to the XI and XII Standards, the Board&#x27;s norms are required for conducting the examination.  But, when Section 30(1) of the Central Act lays down that no child shall be required to pass any Board examination till the completion of elementary education, we do not think the Board can specify any norms for any examination at any level.  We do not see how the State can run contrary to Section 30(1) of the Central Act and specify any Board examination or lay down any norms for conducting examinations.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">\tii.\tParagraph 5.3.3 of the National Curriculum Framework, 2005 reads that under no circumstances should Board or State Level Examinations be conducted at other stages of schooling such as Classes V, VIII or IX.  The NCF shows that for Classes I and II, the assessment must be purely qualitative and judgments of children&#x27;s activities based on observations through everyday interactions and that &quot;on no account, they be made to take any form of test, oral or written&quot;.  From Classes III to VIII, it indicates that a variety of methods may be used, including oral and written tests and that children should be aware that they are being assessed, but it should not be seen by them as a threat, but as part of the teaching process.  There could be children&#x27;s own self-evaluation also as part of the report card from Class V onwards.  It suggests that instead of examination, there could be short tests from time to time and term-wise examinations could be commenced from Class VII onwards &quot;when children are more psychologically ready to study large chunks of material&quot;.  For Classes XI and XII alone, it speaks of assessment to be made based more on tests, examinations and project reports for the knowledge based areas of the curriculum along with self-assessment.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">\tiii.\tAccording to the learned counsel for petitioners, it is not possible to segregate syllabus and curriculum into water tight compartments and when the Centre has prescribed the National Curriculum Framework which has to be laid down by an authority notified by the State Government under that Act, any syllabus prescribed by a board notified under the State Act would run counter to the Central Act and to that extent, repugnant.  \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">\tiv.\tFrom the above, it is clear that when the National Curriculum Framework-2005 clearly states that until completion of elementary education, no child should be required to pass any Board examination and more importantly  Section 30(1) of the Central Act also mandates that there can be no board exam till the completion of elementary education. So <a href=\"/doc/99907733/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the present Act cannot stand.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">\tInstead, the Board shall lay down assessment patterns as explained in NCF-2005 which are appropriate for different classes and the schools shall as far as possible, follow them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">\t(d) Syllabus :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">\ti.\tThe State syllabus will be with regard to the curricular subjects, which are English and Tamil, Mathematics, Science and Social Science.  This is accepted by the learned Additional Advocate General.  In the counter, it is stated that the school curriculum will consist of curricular and co-curricular subjects, and out of 40 periods in a week, 32 periods are allotted for curricular subjects and eight periods  are allotted for co-curricular activities.  We have already seen what the curricular subjects are.  As co-curricular activities, they included, the State has mentioned in the counter, (i) Physical Education and Health Education, (ii) Value Education / Moral Instruction, (iii) Computer Education, (iv) Arts and Crafts / Life Oriented Education (Music/Drawing/ Tailoring/Agriculture etc.), (v) Library Activity and the school is at liberty to select the activity under Life Oriented Education on the basis of area and the needs.  The Board will also prescribe the syllabus and textbooks for these co-curricular subjects.  The schools may also have activities like Girl Guides, Junior Red Cross, National Service Scheme, National Cadet Corps, Eco Club etc.  This should be made clear in the Act itself or in a schedule thereto. The schools are afraid that by combining Physics, Chemistry and Biology in one paper, the education of their children will suffer as those who want to specialise in either of these three branches of Science will not be able to cope up with it and match other students when it comes to the Standard XII examinations.  It is difficult for us to accept this submission, since in XI and XII Standards, they are any way, in one single stream.  We are informed that the C.B.S.E. students also write the same five papers at Class X as is now proposed by the State.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">\tii.\tTherefore, if we give this flexibility to the schools, viz. to adhere to the syllabus as far as the curricular subjects are concerned, having a choice in the textbooks if they so desire and introducing co-curricular subjects according to their choice, the individuality that they assert will be intact, while the State&#x27;s object of achieving social justice and quality education can also be attained.  If all the schools adhere to the same sylabus notwithstanding the fact that there are different textbooks, the movement from one school to another will be easier and a child in a rural school run by the Government and a child in a private urban school would be studying in the same pace without sacrificing standards. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">\tiii.\tThe State shall make it clear that the word &quot;syllabus&quot; will mean and include only the five curricular subjects.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">\t(e) Textbooks :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">\ti.\tThe first part of <a href=\"/doc/101747386/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 3</a> relates to syllabus and textbooks.  The Draft Concept Paper on Pedagogy and Common Syllabus refers to multiple divergent exposure and the National Curriculum Framework, 2005 clearly states that there should be plurality of textbooks, widening the teacher&#x27;s choice.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"703393\" id=\"span_57\">In <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_153\">Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College</a> case (supra), the Supreme Court has referred to the parental right as the touchstone of difference between democratic education and cultural totalitarianism, and the tendency in a modern State which starts on the mission of educating its children could be towards State monopoly.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"697794\" id=\"span_58\">While the Supreme Court had also warned in <a href=\"/doc/697794/\" id=\"a_154\">P.M.

Act to produce its own textbooks in tune with the syllabus prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/101747386/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 3</a>&quot;.  In that case, the State Government had exercised its power under <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 5</a> of that Act to prepare, print and distribute textbooks of its own compilation and they observed that certainly this is well within the powers of the Government under <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 5</a>.  The Supreme Court held that the power given to the Government is a responsible power and it may decide either to choose some textbooks available in the field or to compile textbooks on its own, and if the decision is the latter, the Government is perfectly free to undertake preparation, printing and distribution and that while doing so, it must remember the vital constitutional values of our nation and that when prescription of syllabi and textbooks falls within the Governmental function, then the operation of that power must respond to the values of our Constitution and this requirement is also insisted upon in the Central Act.

According to this counter, there is a huge disparity in such textbooks.  A comparative analysis has been made of the text books in the different subjects of various publishers for the different classes of matriculation schools.  These books have been assessed under various heads, including readability, sequence of content, scope of self-evaluation etc.  According to the State, this wide disparity in the quality of text books used by the different schools is not in the interest of the child and introduction of quality text books devised by the Syllabus Committee will only be to the advantage of the child and it is the child&#x27;s interest which is of paramount importance. In Narain das&#x27; case (supra), the Supreme Court has upheld the State&#x27;s role in preventing poor quality text books from finding their way into classrooms because of &quot;dubious financial arrangement&quot; with publishers. So, legal position in this regard is clear.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">\tv.\tA sample textbook was shown to us and according to the learned Additional Advocate General, this has been prepared strictly in accordance with the recommendations in the National Curriculum Framework.

In an earlier paragraph, we have dealt with the difference in the stages of learning that a child goes through as it grows older.  The NCF recommends that the children shall not learn only from textbooks, but from other teaching materials.  In fact, the NCF recommends the availability of multiple textbooks.  The NCF also recommends that the syllabi, textbooks and teaching/learning resources should be produced in a &quot;decentralised and participatory manner involving teachers, experts from Universities, NGOs and teachers&#x27; organisations&quot;.  The NCF also casts a responsibility on the schools to provide &quot;a flexible curriculum that is accessible to all students&quot;.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">\tvii. \tWhile dealing with the children&#x27;s knowledge, the NCF recommends that the child should learn from the community and the local environment and that the printed word and picture are poor replicas of the natural world.  As an example, the NCF visualises a teacher who takes a class on a walk through a field near her school and on returning to the class, asks the child to name ten things she has observed.  A child in Mahabalipuram may include in the list of things, sea-shells, pebbles and fish, while a child in Chhattisgarh would see nests, bee-hives etc.  When the child learns from the local environment, the child automatically learns the importance of environmental values.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">\tviii. \tThe learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners fear that the rigidity of the language of <a href=\"/doc/101747386/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 3</a> makes them apprehensive that they would be punished even if the schools take the children out for an excursion.  While orally the learned Additional Advocate General said that following the syllabus is a must, but in the extra hours, it is for the schools to use their imagination, in view of the language employed in the Act, we must clarify the position.  \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\">\tix.\tThe children must get a holistic education.  For instance, in Tamil Nadu, we have five kinds of terrains, viz. Kurinji, Mullai, Marutham, Neythal and Paalai.  The teachers can teach the children which terrain that particular district is in and ask them to discover places which have a different terrain.  This will link them with the past so that they see the entire experience as a one continuum.  \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">\tx.\tThough the learned Additional Advocate General submitted that we cannot forget our own traditional method of education, and that the present system is a colonial legacy, the fact is we can not shrug this system off totally.  We have also gone through the textbooks.  It appears that the textbook&#x27;s origin was sometime in the fifteenth century in Europe. We had palm leaf instructions, as we can see from what the Sage Tiruvalluvar is depicted as holding in his hands.  The educational instructions in Europe were traditionally under the ministries, so there was greater standardization and uniformity of curriculum, but there was not much variety.  Sometime in the later half of the last century, discipline-centred textbooks were introduced in U.S.A.  They were criticized for giving too much information and therefore incomprehensible to the learners.  Then a counter-reaction set in, in that country and there was, what was termed as &quot;a dumbing-down&quot; of textbooks. The National Commission on Excellence in Education in its 1983 report recommended that textbooks be made more challenging.   The opinion was that &quot;this dumbing-down&quot; was the consequence of curriculum fundamentalism, back-to-basics retrenchment and censorship pressures \u0016\n\t&quot;Good textbooks codify and synthesize knowledge in ways appropriate to the cognitive, affective, and social growth of learners.  The durability and popularity of the textbook reside in its economy and flexibility.  The fact that textbooks have served historically as prime targets for censorship of ideas is testimony that textbooks are powerful media for emergent, and even divergent, learning.  The textbook should not be seen as the syllabus or complete course of study, but should be created as a vehicle for opening up avenues for further inquiry and the use of a range of print materials and other media.  Whether the school textbook is designed to meet the function of general education, exploratory education, enrichment education, or even specialized education, to be successful it must be generative in ideas, concepts, and skills for meaningful applications in the life and growth of the learner.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">\t&quot;In a multicultural society, there will always be divided and special interests that will seek to impinge on the teacher&#x27;s right to teach and the student&#x27;s right to learn.  But an enlightened citizenry requires freedom of inquiry.  Historically, those who would seek to curtail the free currency of ideas in the teaching-learning process have focussed their efforts on print media, especially the school textbook.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_109\">\u0016 &quot;Textbooks : School Textbooks in the United States&quot;,\nEducation Encylopeadia\nThe petitioners apprehension is that by this Act, there will be a dumbing down of standards.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">\txi.\tSince multiple texbooks are recommended, while prescribing the Government textbooks, the State may consider approving certain other textbooks that have been in vogue in Matriculation Schools / Oriental Schools / Anglo-Indian Schools.  Then the State can ensure that only quality books reach the children.  The teachers of the schools may choose either the prescribed textbooks or the approved textbooks.  If as is contended by the learned Additional Advocate General, much thought and widespread discussion as well as consultation has gone into the preparation of the textboks, then quality needs no recommendation nor force, it recommends itself.  Within a year, all the schools will opt to choose the Government prescribed textbooks.  The State need have no apprehension in this regard.  But the State must allow flexibility.

We are heading for a materialistic society disregarding the entire value-based social system. None can also dispute that in a secular society, moral values are of utmost importance. A society where there are no moral values, there would neither be social order nor secularism. Bereft of moral values secular society or democracy may not survive. As observed by the Committee, values are virtues in an individual and if these values deteriorate, it will hasten or accelerate the breakdown of the family, society and the nation as a whole. In a society where there is constant evaporation of social and moral values for getting property, power or post, \u0017 is it not advisable to have a solid social foundation from the base level so that a grown-up person would fight against all kinds of fanaticism, ill will, violence, dishonesty, corruption and exploitation?

The scrutiny of the textbooks to find out whether they conform to the secular thought of the country is also to be undertaken by the experts, academicians and educationists. The members of NCERT should be open to any such dialogue with the academicians and educationists. On the basis of general consensus, suitable curriculum, which accords with secularism as understood in a wide and benevolent sense, has to be evolved.&quot;\t\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">\txvi. \tIn Edward vs. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), the Supreme Court of United States held that the Louisiana law requiring that Creation Science should be taught in public schools along with evolution was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion.  In a 7 : 2 majority opinion, they ruled that the Act infringed the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment based on the Lemon Test which is, (a) The Government&#x27;s action must have a legitimate secular purpose; (b) the Government&#x27;s action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; and (c) the Government&#x27;s action must not result in an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; of the Government and Religion.  Our Supreme Court&#x27;s protection of the minority rights is not far different.  Why we have referred to this decision is that by invoking the power of prescribing textbooks even for value based education and making it mandatory, the State shall not exercise its power either to advance or inhibit religion and therefore, the greater the necessity to give the schools the choice to choose between the prescribed textbook and the approved textbook.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">\txvii.\tIn the context of the present case, we would also like to quote from the article written by Mir Muzaffar Ali, a film maker and painter, in his article &quot;Conquest of Love&quot;, (The Deccan Chronicle dated 26th April, 2010).  His father had gone to meet a neighbouring Raja, a friend of his father, who happened to be a Hindu.  It was the mourning period of Muharram.  The Raja was sleeping on the floor.  His father expressed his surprise at this, to which the&quot; Raja rebuked his father in chaste Awadhi, saying &quot;Tum murkh ho.  Raja ka koi dharm hota hai; jo unki praja ka dharam, wahi unhika dharm&quot;.  (You are an idiot.  Does a King have any religion?  Whatever is the religion of his subjects, is the King&#x27;s religion).  This man was not seeking votes.  It was his own conviction.  This was the Awadh of Nawab Wajid Ali, a great Krishna lover, for whom, when he was made to leave his beloved city Lucknow, the common folk wept and wailed as they bid farewell to their beloved ruler, &quot;Hajrat jaa rahen hain Landan.  Inpe kripa karo Raghunandan&quot; (King is leaving for London, Bless him Our Lord).  And it was this emotion and the disgust against the communal divide and rule policy of the British that on the soil of Lucknow that the bloodiest war for Independence took place in 1857&quot;.   This was the glory that was India.  It is imperative that our children learn to identify those factors which integrate society and &quot;differentiate those which divide&quot;.  This is the secularism to which we committed ourselves when we gave unto ourselves the Constitution, and the Central Act insists that the National Curriculum Framework shall adhere to the values of the Constitution.  Therefore the textbooks prescribed by the State must be in conformity with the Constitutional values and the secular principles.\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">\txviii. \tTherefore, as far as <a href=\"/doc/101747386/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 3</a> is concerned, the adoption of the syllabus and the textbooks will commence for all standards from the Academic Year 2011-2012 or later deending upon when the State sets down the norms, makes known the syllabus and the textbooks to be followed; the schools shall follow the common syllabus which will only be with regard to the five curricular subjects; the State shall prescribe the Government textbooks \u0016 curricular and co-curricular \u0016 and approve other textbooks so that there is a choice of multiple textbooks.

The learned Additional Advocate General submitted that it was only approval and it did not mean prior permission.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">\t(b) The Section provides that all the subjects may be taught either in Tamil or in English.  But if the school decides to teach the subjects in any other language, it will be with the approval of the competent authority.  The competent authority as defined in <a href=\"/doc/27512331/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act is the authority, office or person who is specified in the notification.  The learned Additional Advocate General submitted that the approval is required because State has to be prepared with textbooks in the language which is used as the medium of instruction and this is the only reason why the approval is insisted upon. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">\t(c) We have already extracted in detail the reasonings and the conclusions of the Full Bench.  The Full Bench has also clearly held that the right to education includes the right to choose the medium of instruction and it can be exercised by the parents on behalf of their children.  Therefore, the role of the competent authority with regard to the schools&#x27; decision on the medium of instruction is restricted to the following extent :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">\tThe schools shall inform the competent authority the language of their choice for adopting as medium of instruction and the competent authority shall accord its approval, since the decision of the Full Bench indicates that the right to choose the medium of instruction is with the parents and by the parents on behalf of the child.  Therefore, there is no scope for discretion of the competent authority to decide whether it should approve or not approve of the decision of the school.  The intimation of the language of their choice is only to facilitate the State to provide the required textbooks. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">\tIII.   <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 5</a>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">\t&quot;5. (1) The Government shall, by notification, constitute a Board to be called as the State Common Board of School Education for the purpose of implementing the policy of the Government to provide uniform school education in the State.  The Board shall exercise the powers conferred, and perform the functions assigned to it, under this Act.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_123\">\t(a) We were informed by the counsel for the petitioners that though <a href=\"/doc/117633313/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 5(2)</a> lists the persons who will form the Board, the decisions were taken for framing the syllabus with only the ex officio members.  The other members, who are representatives of the schools and who are academicians, were appointed only after the framing of the syllabus. When this submission was made, there was no rebuttal from the learned Additional Advocate General.  However, we have seen that the State has invited teachers who are representatives of virtually all streams of school systems in the State for preparing the syllabus.  Ideally, there should have been consultation and a decision should have been arrived at only after &quot;the other members&quot; as mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/117633313/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act had also been appointed.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">\t(b) The norms are yet to be specified.  The norms shall be fixed by the Board, i comprising of both the ex officio members and the other members and it shall not be the decision of the ex officio members alone.  We make it clear that in view of  the Central Act providing for an academic authority under <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 5</a> of the Act and a State Advisory Council under <a href=\"/doc/55204139/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 34</a>, the State must decide whether the Board formed under <a href=\"/doc/117633313/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 5(2)</a> will be the same as is  specified by the Government by notification to function as the academic authority under <a href=\"/doc/117633313/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act.  The State must  overlapping of duties which result in confusion and possible conflict with the Central Act.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">\tIV.    <a href=\"/doc/132396812/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 11</a>\n\t&quot;11.  If any person wilfully contravenes the provisions of this Act or any rules made thereunder, he shall be punishable with fine which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees and in the case of continuing contravention, with an additional fine which may extend to one thousand rupees for every day during which such contravention continues after conviction for the first such contravention.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">\t(a) We have already seen that the norms have not been fixed, and we have also held that norms cannot be rigid, but must be flexible.  We have also held that a teacher who is constantly fearing punishment for failing to adhere to the norms is not likely to be a confident teacher.  It was contended on behalf of the State that there are other Acts which contain penal provisions.  It is true that even the <a href=\"/doc/136426717/\" id=\"a_181\">Tamil Nadu Private Schools Regulation Act</a> contains a penal provision.  But there, the penalty is imposed on schools which are run without recognition etc.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">\t(b) As far as the present Act is concerned, the penalty is imposed for violating the norms. This leaves a room for exercise of subjectivity by the authorities who can decide when a teacher has violated the law.  It is possible that the State may introduce disincentives if they find that a child has not been admitted in the school without reasonable cause or that a child has been discriminated from the other children.  There, the violation or the innocence may be easier to prove, but as far as this particular provision is concerned, it would be a very unreasonable provision since it will be difficult for the teacher to establish that she has not violated the norms.  For example, let us assume that the norms require the teacher to teach two chapters in Chemistry in three hours.  If the students have immediately grasped the concept, it is not necessary for her to keep on repeating the same chapter merely because the State has imposed the norms.  The alternative case would be, where the students find the concept difficult to understand, then she may have to teach the same chapter for one more hour.  These are all not matters where norms can be imposed with threat of punishment.The fact that without sanction no proceedings will be initiated , is no protection. We will be making Alices of our teachers   , with the authorities playing Queen of Hearts as in Alice in Wonderland, crying &quot; Off with her head&quot; That will be so blatantly unreasonable.  That would just steal the spontaineity of the teacher and that would be a grave assault on the  freedom of the schools and the freedom of the teachers to impart education in the manner that they think is right and is suitable for the child.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">\t(c) We have already seen in Meyer vs. Nebraska that the State&#x27;s police power with regard to education could not be permitted to override the liberty provided by the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">\ti.\t<a href=\"/doc/132396812/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 11</a> of the present Act is, therefore, unreasonable since we have already held that imposing strict and rigid norms cannot be right and therefore, this Section is quashed. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">\tii.\tConsequent to the quashing of <a href=\"/doc/132396812/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 11</a>, we also strike down <a href=\"/doc/101312166/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 12</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">\tV.    <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 14</a>\n\t&quot;14.

We are afraid, this is contrary not only to <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 9</a> as well as Section   , but also to the Central Act, and it also gives unguided power to the Government.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"703393\" id=\"span_63\">In (1974) 4 <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_188\">S.C.C.</a> 788 (supra), the Supreme Court has held that the power to select and prescribe textbooks is not an unguided or unfettered power, leaving it to the caprice of the State Government; it is a power which must be confined and embanked within limits by the object and purpose for which it is conferred.  In that case, the Supreme Court was dealing with the question as to whether the State Government could prescribe text books to the exclusion of other text books on the subject for use in primary and middle school classes and held as follows :-</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_220\">\t&quot;21. ... But we do not think <a href=\"/doc/95989119/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 4</a>, Sub-section (1) suffers from this lethal infirmity. It does not vest an arbitrary uncontrolled discretion in the State Government to select and prescribe such test books as it likes irrespective of their merit and quality. The object or purpose for which the power to select and prescribe text books is conferred on the State Government is to ensure uniformity of standard and excellence in instruction which can be achieved only if standardised text books of high quality and merit are used in the schools. This object or purpose furnishes guidance to the State Government in exercising its power of selecting and prescribing text books. The power to select and prescribe text books is thus not an unguided and unfettered power which leaves it free to the State Government to select and prescribe such text books as it may want only or capriciously please, but it is a power which is confined and embanked within limits by the object and purpose for which it is conferred. The State Government cannot, therefore, act arbitrarily or capriciously in selecting or prescribing text books but it has to exercise this power in the light of the policy or principle that the best possible text books, possessing the highest degree of merit and quality, should be made available to the students. This standard or criterion, gatherable from the object and purpose of the Statute, controls and regulates the exercise of the power by the State Government and it is by reference to this yard-stick that the exercise of the power by the State Government is canalised and kept within bounds. If the State Government in selecting and prescribing text books does not follow this standard or criterion, the prescription of text books made by the State Government, and not <a href=\"/doc/95989119/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 4</a>, Sub-section (1) would be liable to be condemned as invalid.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"141187345\" id=\"span_64\">(b) It is, no doubt, clear that there can be only one policy and that is to impart quality education and to provide the best possible textbooks possessing the highest degree of merit and quality.  The Board has been given the power to advise the Government upon the action to be taken for the purpose of implementing the system of uniform school education.  If so, <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 14</a> which subjects the Board to the directions on questions of policy, as the Government may give in writing to it from time to time, will an uncanalised and unfettered power. Viewed from another angle, it will be redundant ,since it is the Board which has to advice the State. The learned Additional Advocate General submitted that directions on questions of policy will not be lightly given and in any event it will have to pass through the Cabinet approval.  It is difficult for us to accept this submission.  We cannot expose our children to the risk of change in the policy  by the Government, given in writing to the Board.  In the Full Bench decision, it has been held that education policy cannot be changed every now and then and it must be a long term policy.  The Full Bench, after referring to various Supreme Court judgments with regard to legitimate expectation, observed that in <a href=\"/doc/141187345/\" id=\"a_192\">Madras City Wine Merchants&#x27; Association vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, (1994) 5 S.C.C. 509, the Supreme Court pointed out that as there was change in the policy by legislation, the principle of non-arbitrariness was not invocable.   The Full Bench observed that in the cases with which we are concerned, i.e. the Full Bench, there is only a Government Order and the change in the policy is not by any legislation.</span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"141187345\" id=\"span_65\">(c) The learned Additional Advocate General submitted that <a href=\"/doc/141187345/\" id=\"a_193\">in that case</a>, the Full Bench was dealing with a Government Order, whereas in the present case, the change is brought by an Act.  The distinction made by the learned Additional Advocate General is accepted, but that can only underscore the position that the Government cannot change its policy unilaterally by writing to the Board.  The children&#x27;s right in this regard should be protected.  When the parents&#x27; right and the child&#x27;s right with regard to the manner in which they should be educated has been upheld and it has been reiterated again and again, and the parental right is raised to the level of it being a very pivotal point in a democratic system, the Government cannot unilaterally change the education policy.  Any change in this regard can only be done by consultation with the Board, schools, the teachers and the parents.  We are not saying that the State has no say in what the policy is.  As representatives of the people, it does spell out what the policy is and it is well settled that Courts do not interfere in matters of policy.   But here, we are concerned with children and their rights.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232115\" id=\"span_66\">In <a href=\"/doc/232115/\" id=\"a_194\">Avinash Mehrotra</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the Supreme Court held that the right to education that a child has, places a burden both on the parent and on the State and it is a reciprocal agreement between the State and the family, and it places an affirmative burden on the participants in our civil society.</span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">\t(d) The Right To Education Act, 2010 directs that the State Advisory Council shall advise the State Government to implement the provisions of the Act in an effective manner.  The learned Additional Advocate General submitted that the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_195\">RTE Act</a> operates on a larger space with regard to the national curriculum and the State Act determines syllabus which is a smaller space.  Accepting this, it would mean that it is the State Advisory Council which will determine how the State Government shall implement the national policy regarding the curriculum.  The curriculum would include the syllabus.  If so, Section 14 of the State Act would come directly in conflict with the provision of the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_196\">RTE Act</a>, since the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_197\">RTE Act</a> declares the national policy and directs which body should advise the State.  We have already in the earlier paragraphs given directions that the State must specify who the academic authority is, and if the academic authority is the Board constituted under this Act, then it will be that academic authority which will decide the policy.  There are other reasons too why we cannot accept <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 14</a> as it stands.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255258\" id=\"span_67\">(e) In <a href=\"/doc/255258/\" id=\"a_199\">State of Haryana vs. State of Punjab</a>, (2002) 2 S.C.C. 507, an interesting problem cropped up before the Supreme Court, when the State of Haryana was carved out from the erstwhile State of Punjab, special provisions were made with regard to the rights and liabilities of the successor States with regard to the waters from the Bhakra Nangal Project and the Beas Project.  The State of Haryana filed a suit in the Supreme Court for a direction to the State of Punjab for expeditious digging of the canal, while the Punjab Government filed a suit challenging the competence of the Central Government to make any allocation under Section 78 of the Punjab Re-organisation Act.  During the pendency of the two suits, the two plaintiff-States arrived at an agreement and an order was passed by the Supreme Court on 12.2.1982 recording their prayer for withdrawal.  Then the State of Punjab ran into great trouble leading to a series of law and order problems and in the year 1985, an accord was arrived at called the Punjab Settlement.  Since the construction of the canal was completely stopped by then, the State of Haryana filed the suit before the Supreme Court.  In that case, the question arose, whether the decision of one Government relating to governance of a State or in the matter of execution of a decision taken by a previous government binds the succeeding government.  The Supreme Court held that the decision taken at the Government level should not be so easily nullified by a change of Government and by some other political party assuming power.  Of course<a href=\"/doc/255258/\" id=\"a_200\">, <a href=\"/doc/255258/\" id=\"a_201\">in that case</a></a>, they held that so far as policy is concerned, a political party assuming power is entitled to engraft the political philosophy behind the party ... but in the matter of governance of a State or in the matter of a decision taken by the previous government, on the basis of a consensus arrived at, which does not involve any political philosophy, the succeeding government must be held duty bound to continue and carry on the unfinished job rather than putting a stop to the same.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">\t(f) The Position Paper presented by the National Focus Group of the N.C.T.E. on Curriculum, Syllabus and Textbooks clearly speaks of \u0016\n\t\t&quot;Creating appropriate regulatory mechanisms, with a view to promote decentralised curriculum development, by establishing an independent body at the State level with a federal national structure, to approve different curricular packages, which include textbooks, teacher training and recruitment processes etc. and that the national structure may be answerable to the CABE.  It is recommended that the  regulatory mechanism must be professionally worked out to carefully avoid the attendant distortions and problems that may arise out of bureaucratic and political pressures, vested interests or even corrupt practices, within bodies established to approve the curricular packages.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255258\" id=\"span_68\">(g) In the present case, it is not a matter of execution of a decision taken by an earlier Government as it was in the <a href=\"/doc/255258/\" id=\"a_202\">State of Haryana</a> case (cited supra).  Nonetheless, it involves the education of children and therefore, it cannot be nullified by a change of mind of Government or a change of Government or a change in policy borne out of expediency.  Therefore, if by using the word &quot;policy&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 14</a>, the legislature means that the Government can change the norms, the syllabus and the textbooks at will, then we cannot accept that.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1109491\" id=\"span_69\">In <a href=\"/doc/1109491/\" id=\"a_204\">Adhiyaman</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the Supreme Court observed :-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73344\" id=\"span_70\">&quot;32. ...But as has been aptly pointed out by Justice Rau while dealing with the meaning of repugnancy in <a href=\"/doc/73344/\" id=\"a_205\">G.P.

For reasons which we shall set forth presently, we think that this is too narrow a test; there may well be cases of repugnancy where both laws say &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; but in different ways. For example, one law may say &quot;No person shall sell liquor by retail, that is, in quantities of less than five gallons at a time&quot; and another law may say, &quot;No person shall sell liquor by retail, that is, in quantities of less than ten gallons at a time.&quot; Here, it is obviously possible to obey both laws, by obeying the more stringent of the two, namely the second one; yet it is equally obvious that the two laws are repugnant, for to the extent to which a citizen is compelled to obey one of them, the other, though not actually disobeyed, is nullified. This was the type of repugnancy that arose for consideration in (1896) AC 348&quot;.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1109491\" id=\"span_71\">We cannot allow the schools, the teachers and above all the children to be tossed and buffeted by political vicissitudes.That is why we hold that Section 14 of the State Act runs not only contrary to <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_206\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_207\">9</a> thereof, but also to the Central Act as such.

We find that the <a href=\"/doc/190803/\" id=\"a_215\">Delhi Act</a> has power to regulate education and to specify textbooks, syllabi and courses of study in line with the constitutional values; the power is given to specify co-curricular and extra-curricular activities; there is also a Curriculum Committee.  <a href=\"/doc/55147955/\" id=\"a_216\">In the Karnataka Act</a>, the Government has the power to prescribe curriculi, syllabi, duration of the course and medium of instruction; it lays down the standard to be reached by the child at each class level.

The Supreme Court has <a href=\"/doc/1720792/\" id=\"a_218\">laid down in</a> this case, the course that should be adopted by the Court in such situations.  The Supreme Court observed that by striking down the interim project of the Government with no alternative methodology of selection would result in chaos and throwing out a number of students already undergoing their course in a state of vacuum.  So, the Supreme Court gave directions for equitable distribution of the students amongst the four medical colleges in the State.  Since the Supreme Court observed that after all, the court system belongs to the people and must promote constructive justice. The Supreme Court held that the court canot stop by merely declaring that the Government&#x27;s scheme is ultra vires and that in this context, &quot;comes the play of processual realism in moulding the relief...&quot; and gave certain directions in the interest of justice.

Under the Central Act, the appropriate Government which in relation to a school other than the school referred to in sub-clause 2(a)(i) established within the territory of a State is the State Government and <a href=\"/doc/141455941/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 8</a> lays down the duties of the State Government and <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 9</a>, the duties of the local authority.  Under <a href=\"/doc/141228863/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 9</a>, the local authority is cast with the duty of functioning the schools within this jurisdiction and also to decide the academic calendar.  Under <a href=\"/doc/176686433/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 21</a>, every school will constitute a School Management Committee consisting of the elected representatives of the local authority, parents and guardians and their function is specified in <a href=\"/doc/195647294/\" id=\"a_223\">Section 21(2)</a>, which includes preparation of a school development plan.

No doubt, as contended by the learned Additional Advocate General, it is only the State Government that has the power to lay down the curriculum and evaluation procedure, but the academic authority should be the academic authority specified by the State Government and since the schools shall conform to this curriculum, the State should specify this academic authority by notification before it embarks on its plan of action as per the Act.  The State may decide that the Board constituted under <a href=\"/doc/154784849/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 5</a> of the Act will also be the academic authority, but this shall be specified by notification.  That is clear from the Central Act.  Under <a href=\"/doc/55204139/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 34</a>, the State shall also constitute a State Advisory Council and the function of the State Advisory Council is to advise the State Government on implementation of the provisions of the Act.  Therefore, before the State decides to implement the Act, which we have in the foregoing paragraphs, postponed to the next academic calendar, i.e. 2011-2012,or later it shall ensure that all the requirements of the Central Act are complied with. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\">\t60. At the end of it all, we must look to the quality of teachers.  We have already dealt with the flexibility that should be given to teachers so that they fine tune their classes to suit the children.  In a study conducted by researchers which has been published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, it showed that effective teachers help the kids to read better, while poor teachers brought down all the children in a classroom to the same mediocre level and also that poor teaching impedes the ability of children to reach their potential.  We refer to the portrait of the teacher given by Gurudev Tagore.  He described his ninteen year old teacher Satish Chandra Roy in the following words : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">\t\t&quot;With him boys never felt that they were confined in the limit of a teaching class; they seemed to have their access to everywhere.  They would go with him to the forest when in the spring the sal trees were in full blossom and he would recite to them his favourite poems, frenzied with excitement...  He never had the feeling of distrust for the boys&#x27; capacity of understanding...  He knew that it was not at all necessary for the boys to understand literally and accurately, but that their minds should be roused, and in this he was always successful.  He was not like other teachers, a mere vehicle of textbooks.  He made his teaching personal, he himself was the source of it, and therefore, it was made of life stuff, easily assimiliable by the living human nature.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">\t61. The ambitious effort undertaken on the part of the State to bring in social justice and to have quality education will all come to naught if the selection of teachers is not made properly.  The selection and appointment of teachers cannot be made just like selection and appointment of a clerk.  A teacher must love teaching, she must love children.  We come across horrible news items of physical violence committed by teachers on children.  If the teacher imparts joy and inculcates confidence in the child, the child will willingly go to school.  Therefore, definitely the State will have to look at amendments to the rules relating to recruitment of teachers, if it seriously intends this Act to transform the lives of children across the State, whether they are poor, disabled, living in tribal areas, whether they are girl children, or children from downtrodden sections of society, or any child who does not have certain potential plus points whom the State wants to uplift, and in order to attain a quality of excellence, we hope, therefore, the State will address its attention in this regard also. Recently we read in the newspapers that the findings of an NGO after a survey of schools in the country that our State has a very high percentage of student enrolment, but the quality of teachers is low. This may be  challenged as inaccurate,but we insist that the State shall take steps to ensure that the teachers are of a high quality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_148\">\t62. We would like to extract the following quote of Swami Ranganathananda from &quot;Eternal Values for a Changing Society&quot; under the Chapter &#x27;Education and Traditional Values&#x27; :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">\t&quot;Education so defined should place before itself clear objectives, if it is to find expression in practical measures of implementation.  In the light of all that has been discussed above, we can discern six objectives for our education :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">1. The training of our children to an appreciation of our nation&#x27;s cultural heritage and to equip them with the desire and the capacity to enhance the same and leave to posterity a richer legacy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">2. The training of our children in talents and capacities by which they become productive units of society and the source of its economic strength.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">3. The equipment of our children with the qualities of courage and vision to protect our newly won national freedom, to preserve its demoratic structure, function, and liberties, and to carry the same to ever wider fields and ever higher levels.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">4. The training of our children in virtues and graces that will make them emotionally stable individuals and enable them to live in peace, harmony, and co-operation with their fellow citizens.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">5. The training of our children in virtues and graces that will make them international in their outlook and sympathies, and enable them to live in peace, harmony, and co-operation with the emerging world community.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">6. The training of our children to an awareness of the spiritual and trans-social dimension of the human personality and to a converging life-endeavour in the realization of this fact in and through life and action.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">\t\tIt is only thus that our education will become a fit discipline to help to continue the march of the Indian tradition from an impressive past to a glorious future.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">We hope that the State, while implementing the object of the Act, shall always remember the above principles, only then the dream of social justice will become a reality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">\t63. To conclude \u0016\n?\tWe have upheld the power of the State to bring in a school system common to all in the interest of social justice and quality education.  As an aside, we would like to point out that the phrase &#x27;Uniform School System&#x27; does not bring to the mind the same meaning that the words in Tamil (rkr;rPh; fy;tp ) do, which immediately indicates equity and quality in education.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">?\tImplementation of the syllabus and textbooks is postponed till the Academic Year 2011-201, or until the State makes known the norms and the syllabus and prepares the textbooks in advance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_153\">?\tIn the mean time, the State will bring the provisions of the impugned Act in line with the Central Act, e.g., the State shall specify by notification, the Academic Authority and the State Advisory Council.\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">?\tThe Government shall also indicate what the approved textbooks are. \t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">?\tThe Government shall, by amending the section or by introducing a schedule to the Act, indicate that the syllabus is restricted to curricular subjects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">?\tThe schools are bound to follow the common syllabus only for the curricular subjects and not the co-curricular subjects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">?\tThe schools may choose from multiple textbooks, viz., Government produced textbooks, which are the prescribed text books and the Government approved textbooks, in all subjects \u0016 both curricular and co-curricular. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">?\tThe schools shall follow the norms as far as they are practicable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">?\tThere can be no Board Examinations upto the level of elementary education, but assessment norms may be specified.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">?\tThe schools which teach all the subjects in a language other than Tamil or English shall inform the competent authority of the language of their choice; in view of the Full Bench decision, the approval is automatic.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">?\tThe above intimation is only to facilitate the State to provide appropriate textbooks.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">?\tNorms shall be fixed by the Board which will include both the ex officio members and the other members.  The State may make it clear whether this Board will also be the Academic Authority under the Central Act. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">?\tSince we have held that there cannot be strict and rigid norms, <a href=\"/doc/132396812/\" id=\"a_227\">Section 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/101312166/\" id=\"a_228\">Section 12</a> of the impugned Act are struck down.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">?\t<a href=\"/doc/139390757/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 14</a> of the impugned Act is also struck down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">\t64.
