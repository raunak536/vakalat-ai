Mr. Tarang Srivastava, APP appearing for the appellant State\n       contended that the learned trial court failed to appreciate that the\n       prosecutrix has duly supported the case of the prosecution and she\n       specifically stated the act of the accused which was covered under\n       the provisions in which the accused was facing trial. She clearly and\n       unequivocally deposed that the accused pulled her inside the room\n       while she was going to put the duster in the balcony for drying and\n       forcibly raped her. The learned APP further contended that the\n       contradictions in the deposition of said witnesses are minor and not\n       in material particulars which are bound to occur during the course of\n       trial. In addition to that he contended that the trial court did not\n       appreciate the evidence of PW-13, Smt. Asha Maggo, who stated that\n       her son is aged about 10 years is physically challenged and he would\n       not have intervened in the commission of rape. Further, the\n       deposition of the grandmother-in-law clearly establishes that the keys\n       of the room where the offence was committed were with the accused.\n       The APP further contended that the learned trial court failed to\n       appreciate that there were no material contradictions that have come\n       on record which goes to the root of the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.

She further deposed that apart from her, four other\n       employees were also employed in the same house, one of whom is\n       the accused in the present case. Further, she narrated the entire\n       incident that on 20.08.2018 at about 3.00 pm, when she was\n       working on the second floor of the house, one of the other\n       employees of the house i.e. Jeewan came to the second floor\n       grabbed her and dragged her into the bedroom where he made\n       sexual intercourse with her. The said act of sexual intercourse was\n       without her consent. Further, she deposed that she tried to push\n       him away and kept on shouting but no one came to her rescue. In\n       addition to that, the accused told her not to disclose this to anyone\n       and insisted that he will arrange a ticket for her village. At about\n       3:30 pm, when her employer came back to the house, she told her\n       about the alleged incident. She further deposed that her employer\n       along with her husband took her to the police station where she\n       gave her statement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">9.     Mrs. Archana Maggo was examined as PW-13 and she deposed\n       that on the day of the alleged incident, she was away from home\n       and had gone to a temple in Chattarpur. On returning to her house,\n       she called for the prosecutrix but she did not come. She then sent\n       Jeewan i.e. the accused to check on her who in return informed her\n       that the prosecutrix is sitting on the stairs leading to the servants\n       quarter. She further deposed that she asked the prosecutrix about\n       what had happened but she did not speak a word and it was then\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                               Page 4 of 24</span>\n        that she made a call to the Aunt of the prosecutrix. It was after that\n       when the prosecutrix told her about the alleged incident.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">10.    The Aunt who is also the owner of the placement agency through\n       which the prosecutrix was placed in the house of PW-13 (Archana\n       Maggo) was examined as PW-12 who deposed that the prosecutrix\n       had made a telephonic call to her and she was weeping at that time.\n       On asking as to what has happened, the prosecutrix told her that\n       one of the other servants of the house i.e. Jeewan had committed\n       &#x27;Galat Kaam&#x27; on her. She further deposed that she went to the\n       place of incident and thereafter, she along with Vicky Maggo\n       (Employer), Prosecutrix and Vishal (Cousin of Employer) went to\n       the police station to lodge the report.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">11.    &quot;Rape&quot; or an attempt to rape is a crime not against an individual\n       but a crime which destroys the basic equilibrium of the social\n       atmosphere. &quot;Rape&quot; not only lowers the dignity of a woman but\n       also mars her reputation. The plight of the woman and shock\n       suffered by the victim can be well visualized. The victim of rape\n       grows with traumatic experience and an unforgettable shame\n       haunted by the memory of the disaster forcing her to a state of\n       terrifying melancholia. The torment on the victim has the\n       potentiality to corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilized\n       society. It has been rightly said that whereas a murderer destroys\n       the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the\n       soul of a helpless female. The offence of &quot;Rape&quot; is grave by its\n       nature, which warrants a strong deterrent by judicial hand.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                                Page 5 of 24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1314858\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9578432\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/9578432/\" id=\"a_7\">Shyam Narian Vs.

So, the courts should deal with such cases\n              sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from being a\n              dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the right of\n              privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious blow to her\n              supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity as\n              well. It degrades and humiliates the victim and where the\n              victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves\n              behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes\n              physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar on the most\n              cherished position of a woman, i.e. her dignity, honour,\n              reputation and chastity. Rape is not only an offence against\n              the person of a woman, rather a crime against the entire\n              society. It is a crime against basic human rights and also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                              Page 7 of 24</span>\n               violates the most cherished fundamental right guaranteed\n              under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">13. It is a settled principle of law that conviction can be based on the\n       sole testimony of the victim of sexual assault without\n       corroboration from any other evidence. The statement of the\n       prosecutrix is more reliable than any other witness and if the\n       testimony of victim of sexual assault installs confidence in court,\n       the same can be relied for conviction of the accused. It is also a\n       well settled principle of law that corroboration as a condition for\n       judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a\n       requirement of law but a guidance to prudence under the given\n       circumstances. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732998\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/1732998/\" id=\"a_16\">Vijay @ Chinee v.

In addition to this, further contradictions to the alleged\n       phone call can be found in the testimony of her Aunt i.e. PW-12\n       (Pushpa) who deposed that it was PW-13 (Archana Maggo) who\n       made a call to her and told her about the entire alleged incident.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">18.    During her cross-examination, the prosecutrix admitted use of\n       physical force upon the accused and deposed that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">              &quot;MENE HAATH BHI MAARE THE AUR LEG BHI MARI\n              THI AUR APNE HAATHO SE USE NOCHA BHI THA&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">       But there is no corroboration of the said marks can be found in the\n       MLC which was got conducted by the Investigation Agency.

Major contradictions have arisen in the testimonies of the\n       prosecution witnesses as to whether the police arrived at the place\n       of the alleged incident or was the report lodged in the police\n       station itself. Further contradictions have arisen as to who all were\n       the person that actually went to the police station to lodge the\n       complaint. The prosecutrix in her complaint to the police stated\n       that she along with her employer i.e. PW-19 (Vicky Maggo) and\n       her Aunt i.e. PW-12 (Pushpa) went to the police station to lodge\n       the complaint. Further, in her statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_20\">section 164</a> of the\n       Cr.P.C, she deposed that she told Archana i.e. PW-13 about the\n       incident and then PW-13 told her husband i.e. PW-19 about the\n       incident. It was PW-19 (Vicky Maggo) who told the police about\n       the alleged incident. Again in her examination-in-chief, she\n       deposed that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">              &quot;At about 3:30 pm, Ms. Archana returned and I told her\n              about the incident.

In addition to\n       that, the prosecution witnesses have given different versions as to\n       the aforesaid contention. PW-13 (Archana Maggo) deposed that\n       the police came to the house where the alleged incident took place\n       and the prosecutrix along with the accused, PW-12 (Pushpa) and\n       PW-19 (Vicky Maggo) went to the police station. PW-15(Meena\n       Maggo) deposed that she does not know the exact time as to when\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                                Page 11 of 24</span>\n        but the police came to their house and that the police took the\n       accused as well as Sangeeta and her family members to the Police\n       Station. PW-19 (Vicky Magoo) deposed that the matter was\n       reported to the police at police station and that he along with the\n       Prosecutrix, PW-12 (Pushpa) and the Accused went to the police\n       station. PW-12 (Pushpa) deposed that she along with PW-19\n       (Vicky Maggo), Prosecutrix &amp; the cousin brother of PW-19 went\n       to the police station to lodge the report. The IO who was examined\n       as PW-23 deposed that she was posted at PS Kirti Nagar and at\n       9:30 pm, the Prosecutrix along with PW-19 (Vicky Maggo) came\n       to the police station. There are inherent contradictions in the\n       testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">20.    PW-13 i.e. Archana Maggo deposed in her examination-in-chief\n       that when she was leaving for the Ashram, she had locked the\n       premises of her second floor and asked the prosecutrix to remain\n       on the ground floor where her mother-in-law resided. Further, in\n       her cross examination, she deposed that while leaving, she handed\n       over the keys of the second floor to her mother-in-law on the\n       ground floor. She further deposed that the servants were given the\n       keys only for the sole purpose of transferring the same to some\n       other family member and the keys were not entrusted to the\n       servants. Further, some clarity can be obtained from the\n       examination-in-chief of PW-15 (Meena Maggo) who deposed that\n       when she was leaving for the cremation ground, she locked the\n       ground floor and handed over the keys to the Prosecutrix and also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                             Page 12 of 24</span>\n        asked her to remain on the first floor. It is clear from the aforesaid\n       facts that there is no way that the accused could have got access to\n       the second floor on his own where the incident has been alleged to\n       take place. Further, the situation is elucidated by the deposition of\n       PW-15 (Meena Maggo) who deposed that when she locked her\n       floor, she gave the keys to the prosecutrix and asked her to remain\n       present on the first floor. It is crystal clear from the aforesaid\n       testimonies that the prosecutrix was entrusted with the keys of the\n       second floor and she was the only one having access to the place of\n       the alleged incident. In addition to that, similar contradictions\n       relating to the place of alleged incident can be ascertained from the\n       statement of the prosecutrix under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_21\">section 164</a> Cr.P.C wherein she\n       deposed that the accused took her to 2nd floor by holding her and\n       she kept on protesting but all was in vain. However in her\n       examination-in-chief she deposes that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">              &quot;On 20.08.2012 at about 3:00 pm, I was working on the\n              second floor of the house.

Contradictions like these put the prosecution version\n       under grave doubt and the veracity of the prosecutrix is also\n       shaken due to the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">22.    The prosecutrix was cross-examined by the Learned APP for the\n       state wherein she deposed that the accused was arrested near the\n       Mayapuri Flyover. She affirms the same statement in her\n       cross-examination by the accused. However, contradictory\n       versions to the above said statement can be found in the\n       examination-in-chief of PW-13 (Archana Maggo), PW-15 (Meena\n       Maggo), and PW-19 (Vicky Maggo) all of whom have deposed\n       that the accused was taken by the police from the place of alleged\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                                 Page 14 of 24</span>\n        incident. Interestingly, the aunt of the prosecutrix i.e. PW-12\n       deposed an altogether new picture that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">              &quot;Thereafter, police me as well as Sangeeta and her\n              employer Vicky Maggo went in search of accused.\n              Accused Jeewan Singh today present in the court\n              (correctly   identified) was apprehended by the police on the\n              pointing out of Sangeeta from Mayapuri Flyover.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">       However, in the cross-examination of PW-12 (Pushpa), new\n       variations emerge as to the present issue wherein she deposes that\n       when she reached Mansarovar Garden, she saw the police with\n       Accused and the prosecutrix in the police van at about 6pm.\n       Further, PW-23 (Investigation Officer) deposed that the secret\n       informer informed that accused was present at mayapuri and the\n       accused was found present under Mayapuri flyover from where he\n       was arrested. the inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses can\n       be discarded where the accusations levelled are of a heinous\n       offfence such as rape.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\">23.    The prosecutrix had been confronted with her statements recorded\n       under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_23\">164</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure on\n       several issues/facts contrary to her deposition in court, wherein she\n       admitted the following facts which have not been recorded in her\n       statements under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_25\">164</a> of Code of Criminal\n       Procedure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">24.

Her testimony has to be\n       appreciated on the principle of probabilities just as the testimony\n       of any other witness; a high degree of probability having been\n       shown to exist in view of the subject matter being a criminal\n       charge. However, if the court finds it difficult to accept the version\n       of the prosecutrix on its face value, it may search for evidence,\n       direct or substantial, which may lend assurance to her testimony.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">25.    On careful analysis of the testimony of the prosecutrix, we find a\n       large number of contradictions, inconsistencies, concealment,\n       improvements and exaggerations in her statement which as noted\n       above, casts a shadow of doubt and it is difficult to rely upon her\n       version. Moreover, no corroboration can be found by any other\n       evidence which has been adduced by the prosecution on record to\n       support the version of the prosecutrix.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">26.    The version of the said witness should remain intact on the core\n       spectrum of the crime while all other attendant materials, namely,\n       oral, documentary and material objects should match the said\n       version in material particulars in order to enable the Court trying\n       the offence to rely on the core version to sieve the other supporting\n       materials for holding the offender guilty of the charge alleged. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120726166\" id=\"span_26\">In\n       <a href=\"/doc/120726166/\" id=\"a_26\">Rai Sandeep @ Deepu Vs State of NCT of Delhi</a> : (2012) 8 SCC\n       21, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held that .</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">              &quot;To test the quality of such a witness, the status of the\n              witness would be immaterial and what would be relevant is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                                Page 16 of 24</span>\n               the truthfulness of the statement made by such a witness.\n              What would be more relevant would be the consistency of\n              the statement right from the starting point till the end,\n              namely, at the time when the witness makes the initial\n              statement and ultimately before the Court.

The accused must also\n              be protected against the possibility of false implication,\n              particularly where a large number of accused are involved.\n              It must, further, be borne in mind that the broad principle is\n              that an injured witness was present at the time when the\n              incident happened and that ordinarily such a witness would\n              not tell a lie as to the actual assailants, but there is no\n              presumption or any basis for assuming that the statement of\n              such a witness is always correct or without any\n              embellishment or exaggeration.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">31.    Keeping in mind the above cited judgments, the testimony of\n       prosecutrix has to be consistent and natural in line with the case of\n       the prosecution and free from infirmities which inspire confidence\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                               Page 20 of 24</span>\n        in the Court. It cannot be presumed that the statement of the\n       prosecutrix is always true or without any embellishment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">32.    In the instant case, the testimony of the prosecutrix is not natural\n       and consistent with the case of the prosecution. Her version has no\n       correlation with other supporting material being medical, scientific\n       and expert evidence. After rescanning the entire case in its right\n       perspective, I am of the firm view that if the evidence of the\n       prosecutrix is read and considered in totality of the circumstances\n       alongwith the other evidence on record, in which the offence is\n       alleged to have been committed, I am of the view that her\n       deposition does not inspire confidence. The version of the\n       prosecutrix has not been corroborated with the testimonies of other\n       witnesses as well as the medical evidence and has not disclosed the\n       true genesis of the crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107929320\" id=\"span_36\">33.

Besides the rules regarding appreciation of\n              evidence, the Court has to keep in mind certain\n              significant principles of law under the Indian Criminal\n              Jurisprudence, i.e. right to fair trial and presumption\n              of innocence, which are the twin essentials of\n              administration of criminal justice. A person is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                              Page 21 of 24</span>\n               presumed to be innocent till proven guilty and once\n              held to be not guilty of a criminal charge, he enjoys\n              the benefits of such presumption which could be\n              interfered with by the courts only for compelling\n              reasons and not merely because another view was\n              possible on appreciation of evidence. The element of\n              perversity should be traceable in the findings recorded\n              by the Court, either of law or of appreciation of\n              evidence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">              12. The Legislature in its wisdom, unlike an appeal by\n              an accused in the case of conviction, introduced the\n              concept of leave to appeal in terms of <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_33\">Section\n              378</a> Cr.P.C. This is an indication that appeal from\n              acquittal isplaced at a somewhat different footing than\n              a normal appeal. But once leave is granted, then there\n              is hardly any difference between a normal appeal and\n              an appeal against acquittal. The concept of leave to\n              appeal under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_34\">Section378</a> Cr.P.C. has been introduced\n              as an additional stage between the order of acquittal\n              and consideration of the judgment by the appellate\n              Court on merits as in the case of a regular appeal.\n              Sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 378</a> clearly provides that no\n              appeal to the High Court under sub-sections (1) or (2)\n              shall be entertained except with the leave of the High\n              Court. This legislative intent of attaching a definite\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">CRL.L.P. 153/2019                                              Page 22 of 24</span>\n               value to the judgment of acquittal cannot be ignored\n              by the Courts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">              13. Under the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_36\">Cr.P.C</a>., acquittal confers\n              rights on an accused that of a free citizen. A benefit\n              that has accrued to an accused by the judgment of\n              acquittal can be taken away and he can be convicted\n              on appeal, only when the judgment of the trial court is\n              perverse on facts or law. Upon examination of the\n              evidence before it, the Appellate Court should be fully\n              convinced that the findings returned by the trial court\n              are really erroneous and contrary to the settled\n              principles of criminal law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">34.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"34666777\" id=\"span_39\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/34666777/\" id=\"a_37\">State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.
