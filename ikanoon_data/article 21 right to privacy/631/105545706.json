The petitioner, in the affidavit filed in support of this petition, would aver that he is hailing from a well reputed firm and is married and out of wedlock, begotten two daughters, who are aged about 5 years and 3 years respectively and he is also owning a Tata Sumo Car.  It is further stated by the petitioner that he was implicated as Accused No.13 in S.C.Nos.35 and 36 of 2007 respectively on the file of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu, along with 15 other accused and he was charged for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 120(B)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_3\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">302</a> IPC and both the cases had ended in acquittal, vide judgment dated 08.12.2008 and thereafter, in the year 2012, the fourth respondent has opened History Sheet No.02/2012 on the ground that he was involved in Crime No.282/2004 on the file of the Guduvancherry Police Station for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_6\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">302</a> IPC r/w. 120(B) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a> and in Crime No.286/2012 on the file of the same police station for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1198799/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_10\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_11\">324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_12\">506(ii)</a> IPC and the same is pending trial and since the petitioner is indulging in criminal activities, he may be kept in History Sheet and accordingly, an order was passed on 20.04.2012, keeping the petitioner under the History/Rowdy Sheet. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">\t3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that Crime No.282/2004 pertains to S.C.No.35/2007 on the file of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu, wherein there were 16 accused and the petitioner was charged for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 120(B)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">149</a> r/w. 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> and after full-fledged trial, all the accused were acquitted honourably on 08.12.2008 and no appeal has been preferred either by the State or revision by the witnesses and therefore, it cannot be taken into consideration. Insofar as the second case in Crime No.286/2012 is concerned, it is the submission of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that the matter has been settled as early as during May 2012 and therefore, it cannot be termed as a material to open History/Rowdy Sheet against the petitioner and in this regard, he has submitted a detailed representation to the Director General of Police, Collector of Kancheepuram District, Inspector of Police, Guduvancherry Police Station to remove his name from the History Sheet, but he has not been favoured with any response and hence, constrained to file this writ petition. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\t4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the Police Standing Order 749 and would submit that satisfaction has to be derived by the concerned authority with a person against whom History Sheet is to be opened that he is addicted to crime and in the case on hand, there are absolutely no material available and therefore, in all fairness, the respondents 4 to 6 ought to have removed the name of the petitioner from the History/Rowdy Sheet and hence, prays for appropriate orders. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has also drawn the attention of this Court to the order dated 29.11.2012 made in W.P.No.30320/2012. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">\t5. Per contra, Mr.R.Vijaya Khumar, learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents has drawn the attention of this Court to the counter affidavit filed by the fourth respondent and would submit that the petitioner has involved in two murder cases and both the cases ended in acquittal and subsequently, he got involved in Crime No.286/2012 registered by the fifth respondent for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1198799/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_17\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_18\">324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_19\">506(ii)</a> IPC and it also exhibits his addiction to crime and hence, History/Rowdy Sheet was rightly opened and prays for  dismissal of the writ petition. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\t6. This Court carefully considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t7.  In two sessions cases in S.C.Nos.35 and 36/2007 on the file of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu, the petitioner was arrayed as Accused No.13 and was charged for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 120(B)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_21\">149</a> r/w. 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a> and both the cases ended in acquittal for the reason that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges levelled against the accused and the orders of acquittal came to be passed on 08.12.2008 and no further challenge was made to the said orders of acquittal.  Four years thereafter, the petitioner was said to have been involved in Crime No.286/2012 for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1198799/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_24\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_25\">324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_26\">506(ii)</a> IPC, registered by the fifth respondent and according to the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the matter has been compromised and the said fact is not seriously disputed also. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115135\" id=\"span_1\">8. This Court, in the order dated 29.11.2012 made in W.P.No.30320 of 2012, has considered a similar issue and by placing reliance upon the earlier decision of this Court dated 22.06.2010 made in W.P.No.1199/2006, has ordered removal of the petitioner therein from the History Sheet.   A Division Bench of this Court in the decision in Selvaraj and Others v. The Inspector of Police, Kaliakavilai Police Station, Kaliakavilai, Kanyakumari District and others [2010 Writ L.R. 335] has considered the scope of Police Standing Orders 746, 748, 749(1) &amp; (3), 751 and 758 and also considered the judgment rendered by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/115135/\" id=\"a_27\">Vani v. Superintendent of Police</a> [2008 (3) MLJ 1525] and held that the History Sheets were opened on 09.04.2006 and as per the Police Standing Orders, it should come to an end with December 2007 and in the absence of any information as to the continuance of the same, has found that the keeping of the petitioner&#x27;s name in the History Sheet is unsustainable and therefore, disposed of the writ petition accordingly.   It is relevant to extract the observations of this Court in the above cited judgment [2008 (3) MLJ 1525]:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\u0013In all these Writ Petitions, the petitioners have raised questions of far-reaching importance, namely, the rights of citizens of India to lead a free life subject to social control imposed by valid law.  The question raised in all these writ petitions at the instance of the alleged disreputable characters cannot be allowed to deflect the perspective of this Court.  If the police do what they did to these petitioners, they can also do the same to the honest and law abiding citizens. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t2. The common thread in all these three Writ Petitioners are that the actions taken by the respective Station House Officers in opening History Sheets in the name of the petitioners mechanically counter signed by the respective Superior Police Officers is justified.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">.........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">10.6. For those entries, without any basis, the Deputy Superintendent of Police had been counter signed year after year.  In all those entries, it is noted that she was unmarried and she was having bad conduct.  But she was found working in an Automobile company at Madurai and she was living with her family, who are doing milk business. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">10.7. Even after her acquittal by the Criminal Court as early as on 30.09.2007, the Inspector of Police continued to retain her name in the History Sheets. Shockingly, even on 30.9.2007, a note was put up to continue her name under the surveillance list for one more year. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">10.8. A perusal of the original file clearly shows that there was no basis for opening a History Sheet in the name of the petitioner and for making such entries there was no factual basis.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">.........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">13...... In one case, the petitioner in W.P.No.5378 of 2005 was acquitted.  In the second case, the petitioner was on bail and he was also an elected Panchayat President.  The notings in the files relating to the second and the third petitioners, noting were made periodically by the respondents stating heir conduct was not blameworthy.  In the case of the first petitioner Ms.Vani, an endorsement stating that she is a unmarried woman, living with her parents and working in an Automobile Company, at Madurai but she was having bad character.  There was not even an iota of material to support such remark found in the file.  Either it shows the subjective opinion of the station House Officer or that it shows their clear animus towards the petitioners. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">..........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">16. In the above factual matrix, it is necessary to refer the PSO 746 of Tamil Nadu Police Standing Orders providing power for opening history sheets and it reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\u0013PSO 746, Part-IV \u0016 History Sheets.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(I) Part V (Form No.111) shall contain the History Sheets of the persons resident permanently or temporarily in their Station limits who are known or believed to be addicted to or to aid and abet the commission of crime, whether convicted or not or who are believed to be habitual receivers.\u0014\n.........\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">20. Therefore, in the light of the facts narrated and the legal precedents, it must be held that the actions of the respondents in all the three Writ Petitions are condemnable. Opening of the history sheets in the name of three petitioners are arbitrary, unreasonable and whimsical and it would amount to denial of right of citizens provided under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> of the constitution of India to have the right of privacy. Though opportunities were given to the respondents, they have not shown any credible materials to justify their action before this Court. The superior officer though had considerable responsibility to oversee such records have acted in a mechanical fashion to put their initials periodically without any verification. \u0013\n\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\t9. The above cited decisions are squarely applicable to the facts of this case for the reason that in two murder cases, the petitioner was honourably acquitted even in the year 2008 and in yet another case involved in the commission of minor offences, which said to have taken place in the year 2012, the matter has been compromised and it is also not made clear whether the name of the petitioner in the Rowdy/History sheet has been extended subsequently.  In the light of the materials placed before this Court, it cannot be said that the petitioner is addicted to crime as on today.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">\t10. In the result, this Writ Petition is allowed and the respondents 3 to 6 are directed to delete the name of the petitioner from History Sheet No.02/2012 forthwith.  No costs.  Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">24.07.2014\n\nIndex\t\t: Yes / No\nInternet\t: Yes / No\njvm\n\nTo\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_13\">1.The Home Secretary,\n   Government of Tamil Nadu,\n   Secretariat,\n   Fort St.George,\n   Chennai-600 009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">2.The Director General of Police,\n   Tamil Nadu Police Head Quarters,\n   Kamarajar Salai,\n   Chennai-600 005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">3.The Superintendent of Police,\n   Kancheepuram District,\n   Kancheepuram.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">4.The Deputy Superintendent of Police,\n   Chengalpet Sub-Division,\n   Kancheepuram District.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">5.The Inspector of Police,\n   Guduvancherry Circle,\n   Kancheepuram District.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">M.SATHYANARAYANAN.
