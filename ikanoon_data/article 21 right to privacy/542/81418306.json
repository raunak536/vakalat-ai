Heard learned counsel Sri Rakesh Sanghi for the petitioner and\n\nthe learned counsel Sri Kishore Rai for the respondents.\n\n\n6.1.   Learned counsel Sri Rakesh Sanghi would contend that 1st\n\nrespondent gave false declaration on number of children she gave\n\nbirth. Though she was having nine children she disclosed only two as\n\nher children. Therefore, her election has to be declared as void. He\n\nwould submit that the petitioner came to know that she has one more\n\nchild by name Md.Azhar.      With great difficulty, the petitioner could\n\nsecure Aadhaar Card of the person. Aadhaar Card discloses the name\n\nof husband of 1st respondent and residential address mentioned\n\ntherein belongs to the respondent. In view of this discovery, petitioner\n\nfiled I.A.Nos.4734 and 4736 of 2002. He would submit that the Court\n\nbelow erred in not granting reliefs prayed in the two IAs.\n\n\n6.2.   He would submit that there is no indefeasible right to refuse\n\ngiving blood samples and to undergo DNA test which are required to\n                                                                              PNR,J\n                                                        CRP Nos.2400 &amp; 2401 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      4</span>\ndetermine that Md.Azhar is biological son of 1st respondent. According\n\nto learned counsel, the Aadhaar Card secured by petitioner points out\n\nthat Md.Azhar is son of 1st respondent and, therefore, these tests are\n\nnecessary to elicit information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\n6.3.    He would submit that merely looking at the date of birth shown\n\nin Aadhaar Card, it cannot be presumed that the gap between 5th child\n\nand Md.Azhar is less than five months. It is possible to tamper the\n\ndate of birth entering in Aadhaar Card and, therefore,              it is not\n\nconclusive proof to come to the conclusion that within less than five\n\nmonths another child could not have been born.\n\n\n6.4.

Per contra, learned counsel for 1st respondent would submit that\n\nin paragraph (iv) of the Election Petition, petitioner has shown that 1st\n\nrespondent has nine children with names, date of births and place of\n\nbirth, but is silent on name of Md.Azhar as son of the 1st respondent.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">1</span>\n   AIR 1973 AP 309\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">2</span>\n   2013 (2) ALD 276\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">3</span>\n   (2003) 4 SCC 493\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">4</span>\n  (2002) 3 SCC 496\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">5</span>\n   (2022) 1 SCC 20\n                                                                                  PNR,J\n                                                            CRP Nos.2400 &amp; 2401 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          5</span>\nIt is not stated how he is asserting that Md.Azhar is son of the 1st\n\nrespondent.         By pointing out to entries in Aadhaar Card he would\n\nsubmit that what is shown is &#x27;care of&#x27; of husband of 1st respondent and\n\nnot as son of.            Further, merely because residential address of 1st\n\nrespondent is given in the Aadhaar Card it cannot be presumed that\n\nMd.Azhar is son of 1st respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\n7.2.

He would submit that it is highly improbable to have a child\n\nwithin five months of birth of a child whereas petitioner stated in\n\nElection       Petition    that   Nousheeda   Begum   was   5th     child      born\n\non06.05.2002, whereas date of birth of Md.Azhar is shown as\n\n27.09.2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">\n7.4.

NARENDER SINGH7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/588738/\" id=\"a_11\">BALDEV SINGH\n\nMANN vs. SURJIT SINGH DHIMAN8</a>, Supreme Court held that standard\n\nof proof is high and burden of proof is on the election petitioner to\n\nprove       an     allegation   of    fraud   or    misrepresentation        earning\n\ndisqualification       of   elected    candidate.    Mere   preponderance             of\n\nprobabilities are not enough, as may be the case in a civil dispute.\n\nAllegations should be clear and precise and charge should be proved to\n\nthe hilt as in a criminal trial by clear, cogent and credible evidence. In\n\nSANTOSH YADAV, Supreme Court summarized the principles on\n\nimproper acceptance of nominations. It is held that case has to be\n\nmade out by raising specific pleadings setting out all material facts and\n\nadducing cogent evidence so as to enable a clear finding being arrived\n\nat. The burden of proving such material fact has to be discharged by\n\nthe election petitioner by adducing positive, satisfactory and cogent\n\nevidence. If petitioner is unable to adduce such evidence the burden is\n\nnot discharged and the election must stand. Difficulty of proof cannot\n\nobviate the need of strict proof or relax the rigour of required proof. The\n\nburden of proof placed on the election petitioner is very strict and so\n\ndifficult to discharge as nearing almost impossibility. There is no room\n\nfor any guesswork, speculation, surmises or conjectures i.e., acting on\n\na mere possibility. The law requires proof. How far that proof should go\n\nor what it should contain is not provided by the legislature.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">7</span>\n    (2002) 1 SCC 160\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">8</span>\n    AIR 2009 SC 1045\n                                                                                          PNR,J\n                                                                    CRP Nos.2400 &amp; 2401 of 2022</span></span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                             7</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">10.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80510634\" id=\"span_21\">In <a href=\"/doc/80510634/\" id=\"a_12\">B.RAVI YADAV VS.

There would be a presumption of\n          innocence available to the person charged. The charge shall have to be\n          proved to the hilt, the standard of proof being the same as in a criminal\n          trial. It is further held by the Apex Court that the success of a\n          candidate who has won at an election should not be lightly interfered\n          with. Any petition seeking such interference must strictly conform to\n          the requirements of the law. Though the purity of the election process\n          has to be safeguarded and the Court shall be vigilant to see that people\n          do not get elected by flagrant breaches of law or by committing corrupt\n          practices, the setting aside of an election involves serious consequences\n          not only for the returned candidate and the constituency, but also for\n          the public at large inasmuch as re-election involves an enormous load\n          on the public funds and administration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">11.

From the Aadhaar Card standing in the name of Mohammed\n\nAzhar it is seen that name of Mohd. Shareef is mentioned as &#x27;care of&#x27;\n\nand the residential address is that of 1st respondent. Except these two\n\nentries in the Aadhaar Card no other document is filed to show prima\n\nfacie that Mohammed Azhar is son of 1st respondent. It cannot be said\n\nthat merely because Aadhaar Card contains the residential address of\n\nfirst respondent and name of her husband is shown as &#x27;care of&#x27;, it\n\ncannot be assumed that Mohammed Azhar is her son.

Thus, there cannot be\n\nchild born within five months.          Having realized this discrepancy\n\npetitioner sought to assert that the Aadhaar Card could have been\n\nmanipulated. In the absence of any other material to prima facie point\n\nout that Mohammed Azhar is son of 1st respondent, the Election\n\nTribunal has not accepted the plea of the petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">20.     Right to privacy is implicit in right to life and liberty as enshrined\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. No person&#x27;s privacy can be\n\ninvaded much against the consent and will of that person. Certain\n\nexceptions to this rigid principle are carved out where larger public\n\ninterest is involved and in matters concerning matrimonial disputes. It\n\nis held that a person who is alleged to have been suffering with HIV\n\ndisease can be subjected to medical examination even against his will\n\nas it is necessary to know his medical condition since it is likely to\n\naffect life of others also. Similarly, in personal law concerning\n\nrelationship of husband and wife and the children born to such\n\nwedlock, the right to privacy is invaded to ascertain whether the\n\nmarriage was consumed properly, whether the spouses to the marriage\n\nare suitable to live together or suffering from any disease which\n\ndisentitles them to live as husband and wife. In matters where a\n\nmarriage is sought to be nullified also it may be necessary to ascertain\n\nthe health of one of the spouses of the marriage etc. To ascertain the\n                                                                                         PNR,J\n                                                                   CRP Nos.2400 &amp; 2401 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                          13</span>\nbirth of a child to the couple, DNA test can be ordered. Similarly, when\n\nit comes to the custody of a child, the mental condition of the spouse is\n\nalso necessarily to be ascertained before Court orders the custody of\n\nthe child to one of the parents. In all such circumstances, subjecting a\n\nperson to medical examination does not amount to violating right of\n\nprivacy. These are exceptions to normal rule.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">21.

In certain cases medical examination by the experts in the field may\n      not only be found to be leading to the truth of the matter but may also\n      lead to removal of misunderstanding between the parties.

It was also the view of the Court that the normal rule of evidence is\n      that the burden is on the party that asserts the positive. But in\n      instances where that is challenged, the burden is shifted to the party,\n      that pleads the negative. Keeping in mind the issue of burden of proof, it\n      would be safe to conclude that in a case like the present, the court&#x27;s\n      decision should be rendered only after balancing the interests of the\n      parties i.e. the quest for truth, and the social and cultural implications\n      involved therein. The possibility of stigmatising a person as a bastard,\n      the ignominy that attaches to an adult who, in the mature years of his\n      life is shown to be not the biological son of his parents may not only be a\n      heavy cross to bear but would also intrude upon his right of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      15. DNA is unique to an individual (barring twins) and can be used to\n      identify a person&#x27;s identity, trace familial linkages or even reveal\n      sensitive health information. Whether a person can be compelled to\n      provide a sample for DNA in such matters can also be answered\n      considering the test of proportionality laid down in the unanimous\n      decision of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5 J.) v. Union of India\n      [K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5 J.) v. Union of India, (2019) 1 SCC 1] ,\n      wherein the right to privacy has been declared a constitutionally\n      protected right in India. The Court should therefore examine the\n      proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued i.e. whether the\n      same are not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may have an\n      adverse impact on the person and that they justify the encroachment\n      upon the privacy and personal autonomy of the person, being subjected\n      to the DNA test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      16. It cannot be overlooked that in the present case, the application to\n      subject the plaintiff to a DNA test is in a declaratory suit and the plaintiff\n      has already adduced evidence and is not interested to produce additional\n      evidence (DNA), to prove his case. It is now the turn of the defendants to\n      adduce their evidence. At this stage, they are asking for subjecting the\n      plaintiff to a DNA test. Questioning the timing of the application the trial\n      court dismissed the defendants&#x27; application and we feel that it was the\n      correct order.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">24.    As held by the Supreme Court in SANTOSH YADAV and BALDEV\n\nSINGH MANN and this Court in LAGADAPATI RAJA GOPAL, in election\n\nmatters the standard of proof is high and burden is on the election\n\npetitioner. Mere preponderance of probabilities or presumptions cannot\n\nbe the basis to challenge an election. The election proceedings are akin\n\nto criminal proceedings. In view of the above proposition of law on the\n                                                                             PNR,J\n                                                       CRP Nos.2400 &amp; 2401 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                   15</span>\nsubject, the burden lies on the petitioner to make specific allegation\n\nand lead evidence in support of said allegation. Petitioner in Election\n\nPetition cannot assume that Md.Azhar was born to 1st respondent and\n\nseek to elicit such information by subjecting a non-party to the election\n\ndispute to medical examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">25.   In R.RAJAGOPAL (supra), Supreme Court held that a citizen has\n\na right to safeguard the privacy of procreation, motherhood, child\n\nbearing, parent status and education among others.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">26.   A woman has a right to be silent, not to disclose about giving\n\nbirth to a child. No person can compel a woman to give up this right\n\nmuch against her will. The case on hand does not fall into the\n\nexceptions carved out to the principle on right to privacy.         Further,\n\nthere is no prima facie material to point out with some amount of\n\ncertainty that Mohammed Azhar is son of 1st respondent. As of now, he\n\nis a stranger to the election dispute. A wrong declaration and a\n\nresultant disqualification relates to the first respondent. Mohammed\n\nAzhar is no way concerned. Thus, he cannot be compelled to stand as\n\na witness to give blood samples to ascertain parental status. Certainly\n\nsubjecting Mohammed Azhar to medical examination would offend his\n\npersonal liberty, privacy and dignity. Further, it also offends personal\n\nliberty, privacy and dignity that is bestowed on first respondent as a\n\nwoman. There can be many reasons where a woman would genuinely\n\nwish to keep the issue of giving birth to a child not disclosed assuming\n                                                                            PNR,J\n                                                      CRP Nos.2400 &amp; 2401 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                  16</span>\nthe fact is true. By subjecting 1st respondent and Md.Azhar to medical\n\nexamination at the instance of the petitioner in election petition, the\n\nfactum of giving birth to or otherwise would be in public domain and\n\nwould be against the conscience and will of the person concerned and\n\ncan have deleterious effect on the 1st respondent and also on\n\nMohammed Azhar which cannot be remedied.
