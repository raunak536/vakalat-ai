It arises out\n\nof a judgment and order dated 11.08.2008 passed by a Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court of Bombay in Criminal Writ Petition No.676 of 2008 whereby\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                       2</span>\n\n\nand whereunder the appellant&#x27;s application questioning the validity and/ or\n\nlegality of an order issuing a warrant against the appellant by the Magistrate\n\nCourt, Clayton County, Georgia in case No. 2006/CW/06369 and Case No.\n\n2006/CW/06370 in USA in respect of a complaint filed by the respondent\n\nNo. 6 herein, was dismissed. The appellant in that application had also\n\nsought for a direction restraining the respondents or any other Central\n\nGovernment machinery from arresting the appellant or taking any action\n\npursuant to or in furtherance of the Red Corner Notice issued by INTERPOL\n\nin respect of those arrest warrants.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\nBACKGROUND FACTS\n\n\n      Appellant and the respondent No. 6 are citizens of India. He went to\n\nMichigan to pursue his studies in M.S. (Computer Engineering) between\n\nAugust, 1998 and May, 2000. He also worked as a Software Engineer at\n\nCalifornia in a company named Broadbase Software upto 2001. He was\n\nlater on employed as a Technical Lead in a Government Contract Firm at\n\nCalifornia known as Ancore Corporation between 2001 and 2003.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      Appellant married the respondent No. 6 on 6.04.2002 at Mumbai.\n\nThey moved to California on 19.04.2002 and stayed there till 2005. Out of\n\nthe said wedlock, a daughter Eesha was born on 26.04.2003. Marital life of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                      3</span>\n\n\nthe Appellant and the Respondent No. 6 was however not happy. According\n\nto the respondent No. 6, she was continuously being harassed. She applied\n\nfor grant of permanent asylum on 1.07.2003 allegedly under coercion from\n\nthe appellant. Later on the respondent No. 6 allegedly moved to her sister&#x27;s\n\nhouse at Sharon Massachusetts, USA.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\nPROCEEDINGS IN USA\n\n\n      She filed a complaint with the Sharon Police Department on\n\n26.04.2005. On or about 09.05.2005 an application before the Probate and\n\nFamily Court of Massachusetts for grant of divorce was filed by her. In the\n\nsaid proceeding, she also sought for orders of custody of her daughter.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">      The Probate and Family Court, Massachusetts passed an order of\n\ntemporary custody of the child, restraint and abuse prevention ex parte in\n\nfavour of the respondent No.6 and against the appellant on 10.05.2005.\n\nService of the said order is said to have been effected on the appellant on\n\n20.05.2005. Allegedly, he neither appeared before the Court contesting the\n\nsaid interim custody order nor sought for any modification thereof.\n\nRespondent No.6 took up a job and continued to live with her child in\n\nMassachusetts. She contends that her Indian Passport was stolen by the\n\nappellant from the premises which was being occupied by her.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                       4</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      Admittedly, the appellant came to India with the child on 15.04.2006\n\nin violation of the court custody orders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      The contention of the appellant is that despite the initial marital\n\ndiscord, the parties started living together. It was decided that he should\n\nreturn to India with the child wherefor even a written consent was given by\n\nthe respondent No. 6 by affirming an affidavit before a Notary on or about\n\n14.04.2006, stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">             &quot;I, Hetal G. Thakker ...authorize my child Eesha\n             B. Lakhani to travel with my husband and her\n             father, Bhavesh Lakhani to India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             They will be leaving the United States of America\n             on or about April 14, 2006 and returning on or\n             about (Undecided)...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">      Respondent No. 6, however, contends that the appellant travelled out\n\nof the United States of America with the child by creating false and\n\nfabricated documents including the said affidavit as would also appear from\n\nthe fact that the child already had a passport. On the premise that the child\n\nwas abducted by the appellant, warrants of arrest were issued against him on\n\nthe basis of a complaint made by the respondent No. 6 before the police\n\nauthorities. A decree for divorce as also the custody of the child was passed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                      5</span>\n\n\nby the Norfolk Country Probate and Family Court, Canton, Massachusetts\n\non 2.5.2006.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">\n\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE FAMILY COURT\n\n       Respondent No. 6 thereafter married one Ashwin Matta. Indisputably,\n\nshe filed an application for custody of the child before the Family Court at\n\nMumbai on 11.05.2007. By an order dated 15.05.2007, the Family Court\n\ndirected the appellant to remain present in the Court with Eesha. Pursuant to\n\nthe said notice of the Family Court, his father appeared before the court on\n\n15.05.2007 and stated that the appellant had gone out of Mumbai along with\n\nEesha. The matter, therefore, was adjourned to 18.05.2007. On that day the\n\nappellant&#x27;s father again appeared and informed the Court that the appellant\n\ncould not be contacted. The Family Court, thus issued a warrant of arrest\n\nagainst the appellant and directed grant of custody of the child to the\n\nRespondent No. 6.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">       Appellant indisputably preferred an appeal before the High Court\n\nwhich was marked as Family Court Appeal (Stamp) No. 11724 of 2007. An\n\norder of stay was granted by the High Court of Bombay in the matter, which\n\nis still operative.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                       6</span><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE HIGH COURT\n\n      The Atlanta City Police and the American Court in the meanwhile\n\nissued a warrant of arrest against the Appellant which was transmitted\n\nthrough INTERPOL to the Government of India. Appellant filed a writ\n\npetition questioning the legality and/ or validity of the said warrant, which\n\nby reason of the impugned judgment dated 11.08.2008 has been dismissed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">      The High Court posed unto itself a question as to whether the Red\n\nCorner Notice could be stayed by it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">      Referring to the provisions of the Act it was opined :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      i)     While dealing with a fugitive criminal wanted in a State with\n\n             which India has no treaty, the Magistrate can enquire into the\n\n             case in the same manner as if the case was triable by Court of\n\n             Sessions or High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      ii)    However, while dealing with a fugitive criminal wanted in a\n\n             treaty State, such inquiry and such a trial is not open.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      iii)   The Magistrate neither has the power to take evidence nor can\n\n             he discharge a fugitive criminal.

inquiry into the facts.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">         vi)      Extradition treaty implies mutual obligations.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">         vii)     <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_3\">The Act</a> recognizes the sanctity of an extradition treaty.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">         viii)    The provisions of <a

     ix)      The High Court cannot tinker with the Red Corner Notice.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">         x)       The High Court should not set a precedent which could be used\n\n                  to hamper investigation of crimes which have global\n\n                  dimensions and for the investigation of which, Red Corner\n\n                  Notices are critical

custody of the child granted\n\n               by the Probate and Family Court, Massachusetts being wholly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f

No. 6 having prevaricated her stand from stage to\n\n        stage, no credence thereto could have been placed by the Courts of\n\n        India for the purpose of acting thereupon.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(iii)   The purported order of custody in respect of the child passed by\n\n        the American Courts being in conflict with the order of custody\n\n        passed by the High Court of Bombay, the appellant could not have\n\n        been directed to be extradited.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">(iv)    The order passed

id=\"p_14\">           So far s the judgment of the Bombay High Court is concerned, it was\n\nurged:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">   (i)        It ought to have considered that the so-called offence for which the\n\n              petitioner is charged by the American Court is not an extraditable\n\n              offence either within the meaning of the said Act or under the\n\n              provisions of the Extradition Treaty entered into by and between\n\n              the United States of America and India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">   (ii)       It ought to have been considered that the rights of an Indian citizen\n\n              guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> cannot be compromised\n\n              for enforcing any of the provisions contained in the Act.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">   (iii)      It ought to have been considered that India is not a party or\n\n              signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of\n\n              International Child Abduction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">   (iv)       It ought to have considered that the dispute between the petitioner\n\n              and the Respondent - wife was essentially of a civil nature\n\n              pertaining to the custody of the minor child.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">   (v)        The refusal of the High Court to stay the INTERPOL notices under\n\n              <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is patently erroneous, thus,\n\n              leading to the miscarriage of justice.\n</blockquote><span

considered that the petitioner who is having\n\n         his own standing and reputation in the society cannot be treated\n\n         like a commodity for the sake of any treaty between India and the\n\n         United States.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(vii)    It ought to have considered that before touching the petitioner on\n\n         the basis of a warrant issued by the American Courts proper\n\n         investigation into the allegations against the petitioner was a must.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(viii)   It ought to have considered that the provisions of the Constitution\n\n         of India conferring fundamental rights to its citizens are superior\n\n         and, thus, prevail over the provisions of the said Act or the\n\n         Extradition Treaty executed between the Government of India and\n\n         the United States.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(ix)     That the entire approach of the High Court was

this Court should\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                             11</span>\n\n\n       not interfere with the impugned order at this stage,\n\n       particularly in view

The Ministry of External Affairs works for the administrative\n\nwatching of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">       A Red Corner Notice has large number of consequences, some of\n\nwhich are:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">       (i)     The requesting country may make a deportation request.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">       (ii)    The law enforcement agency in India is required to &quot;take follow\n\n               up action with regard to the arrest of a fugitive criminal&quot;.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">       (iii)   The information emanating from the red corner notice is\n\nrequired to be distributed all over the Interpol website.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">       (iv)    The requesting Embassy would instruct the CBI to carry out its\n\ninstructions for surveillance, arrest and detention.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">       (v)     The requesting Embassy can even contact the Indian police\n\ndirectly.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                      30</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">      (vi)   Thereafter extradition proceedings may follow.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">      Indisputably, therefore, when a proceeding under the Act is initiated,\n\nthe civil liberty of a person would be directly affected. The provisions of the\n\nAct, therefore, should be strictly construed. Any request for extradition\n\ntherefore must undergo the strict scrutiny test. Extradition offence keeping\n\nin view its definition in <a href=\"/doc/330488/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act in relation to a treaty State\n\nmust be one provided for the extradition treaty therewith.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">      Application of the provisions of the Act, thus, in a case of this nature\n\nmust be held to be imperative in character. We have noticed hereinbefore\n\nthat for the purpose of applying the provisions of the Act, existence of a\n\ntreaty between the requesting State and the requested State plays an\n\nimportant role. It makes a distinction between an extraditable offence and\n\nother offences including political offences subject of course to the condition\n\nthat offences relating to illegal tax are not to be treated to be a political\n\noffence. Sections 4-18 provides for the mode and manner in which a request\n\nfor extradition of a person is required to be made by the concerned country.\n\nThe requirements are specific in nature and are required to be accompanied\n\nby a large number of documents.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                        31</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">      It is accepted at the Bar that no request has yet been made to the\n\nExecutive Government of the Government of India for extradition of the\n\nAppellant upon compliance of the provisions of Section 2-18 or otherwise.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">      It is but imperative to note the provisions of the Treaty here vis-a vis\n\nthe implementation of a Red/ Yellow Corner Notice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">      <a href=\"/doc/1406924/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 1</a> of the Treaty provides that the Contracting States agree to\n\nextradite to each other, persons who are accused of, charged with or\n\nconvicted of an extraditable offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">      <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 2</a> provides for the extraditable office. <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 4</a> provides for\n\npolitical offences which are outside the purview of the Treaty. <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 9</a>\n\nprovides for the extradition procedures and required documents.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">      It is beyond any doubt or dispute that no request for extradition has\n\nbeen received by the Government of India. It could act only when a request\n\nis received. It is accepted at the Bar that Red Corner Notice by itself cannot\n\nbe a basis of arrest or transfer of an Indian citizen to a foreign jurisdiction.\n\nThere is furthermore no dispute that the Act cannot be bypassed in red\n\ncorner cases concerning Indian citizens. Hence the Extradition Treaty is\n\nsubject to the provisions of the Act.        It also stands admitted that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                      32</span>\n\n\nAppellant being an Indian citizen is entitled to enforcement of his\n\nfundamental rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">      The legal position that a person cannot be arrested without any\n\nauthority of law again is not denied or disputed. Thus, the arrest of a person\n\nmust be effected in terms of the provisions of the Act. A person wanted for\n\nan offence in a foreign jurisdiction may be arrested on fulfillment of the\n\nfollowing conditions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">      (i)    That the offence should be counted as one by Indian Law as\n\n             well, and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">      (ii)   The person must be liable to be arrested in India - either under\n\n             any law relating to extradition, or otherwise.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">      Such an arrest can be effected only pursuant to a warrant issued by the\n\nMagistrate in view of <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_53\">Sections 6</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_54\">16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_55\">34B</a> of the Act or an arrest warrant\n\nissued by a foreign country and endorsed by the Central Government under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 15</a> of the Act. It is also not in doubt or dispute that in a case where\n\nthere is no treaty, it is only the Magistrate who issues the warrant for arrest\n\nsubject of course to the condition that the Central Government had ordered a\n\nMagisterial Inquiry in terms of <a href=\"/doc/152213/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 5</a> of the Act. Such an order of arrest,\n\nemanating from a Treaty -State, is also permissible under a `Provisional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                      33</span>\n\n\nWarrant&#x27; issued by a Magistrate in exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 16</a> of\n\nthe Act, upon information that the fugitive should be apprehended subject to\n\nthe condition that the detention thereunder may continue only for the time\n\nrequisite for obtaining an endorsed warrant from the Central Government.\n\nAll arrested persons are required to be immediately produced before a\n\nMagistrate whereupon it would have power to grant bail. Section 34B\n\nprovides that the person so arrested would have to be released on bail after a\n\nperiod of 60 days. If actual request for extradition is required within the said\n\nperiod having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 41(g)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nCentral Government cannot direct or effect an urgent arrest in anticipation of\n\nan extradition request without obtaining a warrant issued by a Magistrate.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 12</a> provides that provisions of provisional arrest according to which\n\nin a case of urgency, the Contracting State may request the provisional arrest\n\nof the person sought pending presentation of the request for extradition. It\n\nalso provides that the facilities of International Criminal Police Organization\n\n(Interpol) may be used to transmit such a request.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">      However, when a request for provisional arrest in terms of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 12</a>\n\nis communicated, it must satisfy the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 34B</a> of the Act.\n\nSuch request from a foreign country must be accompanied by the requisite\n\ndocuments and not a communication from INTERPOL alone.

Respondent No.6 herself accepts that she had pursued only\n\ncivil remedies and the order of the custody Court was passed under civil\n\nremedies. <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 29</a> of the Act as indicated hereinbefore provides for\n\npower of Central Government to discharge any fugitive criminal.

It was created in 1923. The\n\nobject of establishing the INTERPOL was `to ensure and promote the widest\n\npossible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities&#x27;.       It\n\nfacilitates cross - border police cooperation and supports as well as assists\n\nall organizations, authorities and services whose mission is to prevent or\n\ncombat international crime. Even in a case where the country concerned\n\ninter se do not have any diplomatic relation, the INTERPOL aims to\n\nfacilitate international police cooperation. Action is taken by it, having\n\nregard to the provisions contained in the Universal Declaration of Human\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                      40</span>\n\n\nRights and keeping in view the limitation of existing municipal laws of the\n\ncountry concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">      It has six departments, namely -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_110\">         i) The General Assembly ;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">         ii) Executive Committee ;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">         iii) General Secretariat ;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">         iv) National Control Bureaus\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">         v) Advisers ; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">         vi) Commission for the Control of Interpol Files.\n\n\n      We are concerned here only with the National Central Bureaus. Each\n\nINTERPOL member country maintains a National Control Bureau (NCB)\n\nstaffed by national law enforcement officers. The NCB is the designated\n\ncontact point for the General Secretariat, Regional Officers and other\n\nmember countries requiring assistance with overseas investigations and the\n\nlocation of fugitives. It serves as operational center and liking platforms\n\nbetween the national and the international level.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_116\">      It is not in dispute that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 32</a> of the INTERPOL\n\nConstitution each member country is to have a NCB responsible for\n\nexchanging information and data for coordination the functioning within its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                     41</span>\n\n\nown country, with other member countries as also with the General\n\nSecretariat of the INTERPOL.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">      The INTERPOL Constitution prohibits any intervention or activities\n\nof a political, military, religious or racial character.   The International\n\npolicing ultimately depends on coordinated action on the part of the Member\n\nState&#x27;s police forces so as to obtain the required information or services as\n\nand when any occasion arises therefor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">      We may furthermore place on record that the Constitution of the\n\nInterpol was adopted by a Resolution of the General Assembly i.e. AG-\n\n2005-Res-05. Initially its status was of an observed as Non Governmental\n\nOrganisation (NGO).     In Public International Law, keeping in view its\n\nstatus, INTERPOL is considered to be an International Organisation with its\n\nown legal personality. The contribution to the financing of the organization\n\nis by the Member States. Member States can have several delegates in the\n\nGeneral Assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_121\">\nINTERPOL NOTICES\n\n\n      The organizational system of issuing International notices forms the\n\nbackbone of its functioning. The Member countries in terms of notices share\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                       42</span>\n\n\ncritical crime related information. They concern individuals wanted for\n\nserious crimes, missing persons, unidentified bodies etc.          Such notices\n\ncontain comprehensive identity particulars of the individuals concerned\n\nincluding the physical description, fingerprinting, occupation and all other\n\nrelevant information including the offence with which the person has been\n\ncharged, reference to the law under which the charge was made or the\n\nconviction was obtained etc. The notices issued by the INTERPOL are of\n\nsix types - Red Notice ; Yellow Notice ; Blue Notice; Green Notice ; Black\n\nNotice and Orange Notice. It also contemplates Interpol-United Nations\n\nSpecial Notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">      We are concerned herein only with Red and Yellow Notices. A Red\n\nCorner notice is issued to seek the provisional arrest of a wanted person.\n\nHowever, it by itself does not have the effect of warrant of arrest. It is\n\nissued for persons, against whom a national or international court has issued\n\na warrant of arrest. It is solely a request of the issuing entity to provisionally\n\nor finally arrest the wanted person for extradition.          A Yellow notice,\n\nhowever, is issued for finding a missing person or to identify people who are\n\nnot capable of identifying themselves.         It is an &quot;International Missing\n\nPerson Notice&quot;. It is issued specially to locate minors.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                      43</span>\n\n\nPROCEDURE FOR ISSUING NOTICE\n\n\n      Notice in terms of <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 10.5</a> of the RPI (Rules governing the\n\nprocessing and communication of police information) of the INTERPOL can\n\nbe issued by the General Secretariat either at the request of an authorized\n\nentity or on its own initiative as is the case in Green and Orange Notices.\n\nUsually, the NCBs are the authors of a Red or Yellow Notice. The General\n\nSecretariat before issuing or distributing Notices, especially to other offices\n\nthan the NCBs, has to evaluate, whether the issue is necessary and advisable\n\nhaving regard to the aims and tasks of the organization, the respect of\n\nHuman Rights and the required security measures against possible menaces\n\nto the police cooperation, to Interpol itself or to the member states. The\n\nGeneral Secretariat has been authorized by the General Assembly to forbid\n\nthe issuing of a Notice, if it does not meet the requirements of a request for\n\nprovisional arrest. However, we must place on record that a reference to the\n\npresumption of innocence of the wanted person is not a part of the published\n\nrules and regulations.     Only the corresponding pages of the internet\n\nappearance of the organization contain explicitly highlighted warnings of\n\nthis kind.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">      It bears repetition to state that the General Secretariat of the Interpol\n\npublishes the notices either on its own initiative, or based on the requests\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                      44</span>\n\n\nfrom the NCB or international organization or entities with whom the\n\nINTERPOL has special agreements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">      It may be of some interest also to notice that in the year 2008 alone\n\nthe INTERPOL issued 3126 Red Corner Notices and around 385 Yellow\n\nCorner Notices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">      At this juncture we may also place on record that <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 12</a> of the\n\nExtradition Treaty dated 14th September, 1999 entered into between the\n\nGovernment of India and the Government of the United States of America\n\ndeals with provisional arrest of the person sought pending presentation of\n\nthe request for extradition providing that the facilities of the INTERPOL\n\nmay be used to transmit such a request.       Furthermore, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nTreaty providing for Consultation also contemplates the use of the\n\nINTERPOL&#x27;S services.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">\nBINDING NATURE OF THE INTERPOL NOTICES:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">      The notices issued by INTERPOL               are   not considered as\n\nadministrative decisions on individual cases with transnational effect. They\n\nare not construed as an &quot;international administrative act.&quot; They lack a\n\ncharacter of regulation. They do not constitute an international arrest warrant\n\nand they are not in any other form binding the individuals concerned legally.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                                       45</span>\n\n\nThey, however, gain de facto with special relevance to the Human Rights\n\nthrough multiplication of its recipients.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">      Infact Interpol&#x27;s &quot;red notices&quot; often function as de facto international\n\narrest warrants and countries issue warrants immediately upon receipt of\n\nsuch a notice. However, they do so with the understanding that a request for\n\nextradition with supporting evidence will follow the red notice, without\n\ndelay. The suspect must then go through the standard extradition process.\n\nThe bottom line is that &quot;warrants to arrest suspects must have legal authority\n\nin the jurisdiction where the suspect is found&quot; and Interpol red notices do not\n\nhave such authority. They are primarily a means of facilitating\n\ncommunication between police agencies and the success of the Interpol\n\nsystem still depends entirely upon voluntary cooperation.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">      They, however, do not entirely lack external effects. A number of\n\nstates recognizes the Red Notices as an official request for the arrest of a\n\nperson. However, such a request does not require the action of national\n\npolice authorities and does not provide a legal basis thereto.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">      The trans-nationalization takes place through the membership in the\n\norganization, through the supervision proviso of the General Secretariat and\n\nthe recognition of the transnational effect of the information.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                       46</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">      A successful search does not result in Interpol&#x27;s further operative\n\ninvolvement, either. Concerned authorities or the public are supposed to\n\ncontact the local police office, which then gets in touch with the issuing\n\nauthority and initiates the necessary steps.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">      Therefore, the member state usually gives the initiative for a Notice,\n\nand cooperates with one or several other member states in order to find and\n\narrest the wanted person. Existing information is just distributed through a\n\nspecial communication channel. Interpol&#x27;s role is limited to that of a service\n\nagency.   {See    Bettina   Schondorf-Haubold,     The   Administration    of\n\nInformation in International Administrative Law - The Example of Interpol,\n\n9 German L.J. 1719}\n\n\nCENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (C.B.I.)\n\n\n      A Special Police Force was constituted in the year 1943 by\n\npromulgation of an Ordinance by the Government of India in terms whereof\n\nthe powers of investigation of certain offences committed in connection with\n\nthe departments of the Central Government committed any where in British\n\nIndia were vested with it.

Location of a missing person\n\nand or tracing the whereabouts of a fugitive criminal is not an easy task.\n\nThe authority within the meaning of the words of the INTERPOL must act\n\nin cooperation with the State police. For the said purpose it may have to\n\nrequest more than one States. A missing person or a fugitive criminal may\n\nmove from one State to another. In such a case it is not possible for one\n\nState to find out the missing person or fugitive criminal.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                      64</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">      C.B.I., although constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_105\">DSPE Act</a> its functions are\n\nmultiple.

The authority specified in the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_110\">DSPE Act</a>,\n\nnamely the Superintendent of Police of C.B.I. is an officer entitled to carry\n\nout any investigation.

By\n\nreason of such an act it does not carry out investigation, although it is\n\nentitled therefor. It functions as an NCB which is to give effect to the\n\nrequest received from INTERPOL and/or foreign country. When it does so,\n\nindisputably it has to apply its mind. It can take any action only because it is\n\nlawful to do so. It does not exercise absolute discretion. It has to act if a\n\ncase therefor has been made out including the question as whether any\n\nextraditable offence has been made out.

The consideration of the question of arrest and\n\n             Extradition would be within the framework of domestic law\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                        71</span>\n\n\n           including Indian Extradition Act and the Extradition Treaty with\n\n           the Requesting Country.

We have been informed that kidnapping\n\nin case of matrimonial dispute per se is not considered to be an extraditable\n\noffence. It was furthermore contended that even violation of an order passed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">\f                                      72</span>\n\n\nby a court of competent jurisdiction in U.S.A. being punishable for\n\nimprisonment for six months only, the Appellant cannot be extradited for\n\ncommission of the said offence also. We may, however, place on record that\n\nUnited States has enacted the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act\n\nof 1993. However, the law in India shall be governed by the provisions of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_131\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n      We have already held above that the Municipal Laws of a country\n\nreign supreme in matters of Extradition. It is thus for the State concerned to\n\ntake a decision in regard to such Notices, keeping in view the Municipal\n\nLaws of the country. The High Court was, therefore, in our opinion, clearly\n\nwrong in holding that a Red Corner Notice should not be tinkered with.\n\nWhen a person complains of a violation of his Fundamental Right and/or\n\notherwise of his fundamental right he is entitled to the right of judicial\n\nreview. It ought not to be forgotten here that the dispute between the\n\nAppellant and the Respondent No. 6, being essentially a Matrimonial\n\ndispute, is a private dispute and no criminal extraditable offence can be\n\nmade out of the same, in the absence of a specific request for extradition.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                                       73</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">       The High Court, thus, in our opinion, committed a serious error\n\ninsofar as it failed to take into consideration the provisions of the Act, in the\n\nabsence of any request having being made by the Govt. of USA to the\n\nExecutive Government of the Union of India or any authourization made by\n\nthe latter on its behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_207\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">       A fundamental Right of a citizen whenever infringes, the High Courts\n\nhaving regard to their extraordinary power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India as also keeping in view that access to justice is a\n\nhuman right would not turn them away only because a Red Corner Notice\n\nwas issued. The Superior Courts in criminal cases, thus are entitled to go\n\ninto the manner in which such Red Corner Notice, if any, is sought to be\n\nenforced and/or whether the local police is threatening a citizen of India with\n\narrest although they are not entitled to do so except in terms of the\n\nprovisions Act as and when applicable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_209\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">       Furthermore, if a violation of any order passed by a civil court is made\n\nthe ground for issuance of a Red Corner Notice, indisputably, the court will\n\nenquire as to whether the same has undergone the tests laid down under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/84779192/\" id=\"a_133\">Sections 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_134\">44A</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">\f                                       74</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">      As regards the question of custody, we have, however noticed,\n\nhereinabove that although the family court at Bombay for all intent and\n\npurposes relying on or on the basis of the order passed by the Massachusetts\n\nCourt directed custody of the girl in favour of her mother, the Bombay High\n\nCourt has stayed the operation thereof. The Appellant therefore, must be\n\nheld to be in lawful custody of his daughter unless any other or further order\n\nis passed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_212\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">      Lastly, it is imperative to note that the State does not seek for\n\nenforcement of the custody and/ or restrain order passed by the Probate and\n\nFamily Court, Massachusetts in view of the rigours contained in <a href=\"/doc/84779192/\" id=\"a_135\">Sections 13</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_136\">44A</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure. Even the Family Court does not\n\nappear to have dealt with this aspect of the matter. In any event, as the\n\nmatter is pending before the High Court, it alone will have a final say\n\ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">      For the aforementioned reasons, the impugned judgment cannot be\n\nsustained.
