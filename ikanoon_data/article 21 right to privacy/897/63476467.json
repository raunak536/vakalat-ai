It is the case of the petitioners that the Trust is also registered\n\nwith the Income Tax authorities and Ministry of Home Affairs,\n\nGovernment of India including under the Foreign Contribution\n\n(Regulation) Act, 19763 for receipt of foreign funds (FCRA No.\n\n010260151 dated 8.12.1998 and renewed on 10.8.2016 under the\n\n2010 Act). Petitioner No. 1 is serving as one of the trustees of the\n\nsaid Trust and petitioner No. 2 (Nigel Mills) is a social worker and\n\none of the trustees of the stated Trust. The Trust is engaged in the\n\nsocial upliftment activity such as helping children below the poverty\n\nline in Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh, India), street children, children\n\nof sex workers, physically challenged kids, shelter orphans,\n\nabandoned            babies     and   assisting   juveniles   detained   in   the\n\n3   for short, “the 1976 Act”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                          3</span>\n\nobservation home (local reformatory). The Trust has built and is\n\nrunning nine schools in different slums. It has rescued over 1000\n\nstreet children, 165 infants, HIV positive and AIDS orphans of\n\nVijayawada. The Trust also engages in daily milk program for 500\n\nkindergarten children since year 2000.

Even this\n\ntrust is registered with Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of\n\nIndia under the 2010 Act for receipt of foreign funds (FCRA\n\nRegistration No. 010230883).

However, with the\n\namendments effected in year 2020 to the provisions of the 2010 Act,\n\na new dispensation has been set forth, which in their opinion, is\n\nmanifestly arbitrary. For, it entails in cancellation of certificate5 of\n\nthe trust permitting receipt of foreign contributions for being utilised\n\ntowards the activities of the concerned trust.

Public notice dated 3.10.2020\n\nissued by the respondent No. 2 after advent of the changed\n\ndispensation owing to the amendment of the provisions of the 2010\n\nAct in the year 2020 is, therefore, excessive and without jurisdiction\n\nand, thus, unenforceable in law. Further, the amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n\n7</a> of the 2010 Act prohibits the registered person from transferring\n\nany foreign contribution irrespective of whether such person is duly\n\nregistered or not, which was otherwise permitted under the\n\nunamended provision.

Common reply of Respondent-Union of India\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">(a)   Respondents have filed a common affidavit in response to the\n\naverments made in the three writ petitions. The thrust of their plea\n\nis that the amendment does not bar any person to transact in foreign\n\ncontribution provided it is compliant with the parameters predicated\n\nin the 2010 Act including concerning FCRA registration or prior\n\npermission.    The amendments were necessitated owing to past\n\nexperience of the executive and is a matter of legislative wisdom. The\n\namendments are intended to ensure effective regulatory measures\n\nregarding inflow and utilisation of foreign funds.               These are\n\nuniformly applicable and do not discriminate any NGO receiving\n\nforeign contribution from foreign donors and its utilisation. It is\n\nstated that the amendments, in no manner, impact the fundamental\n\nrights, much less under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_70\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_71\">, 19(1)(c)</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_72\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, as contended.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">(b)   The 2010 Act lays down a clear legislative policy of strict control\n\nin respect of foreign contributions and its utilisation for specified\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                   15</span>\n\nactivities in the country.     This is so because the inputs from\n\nconcerned stakeholders and duty-holders made it evident that the\n\nforeign contribution owing to its nature and vast expanse was being\n\nabused by some registered organisations. Indisputably, no absolute\n\nright inheres in any one, much less to receive foreign contribution\n\noutside   the   framework     delineated    by   the   Parliament   and\n\nimplemented by the executive.           Every person receiving foreign\n\ncontribution is obliged to comply with the regulatory and procedural\n\npreconditions. The regulatory and procedural preconditions have\n\nbeen specified by law in the form of the 2010 Act and amendments\n\nmade thereto vide the 2020 Act. The same being quintessence are\n\nrequired to be fulfilled for acceptance of foreign contribution and its\n\nutilisation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">(c)   Notably, in these petitions, no challenge is set forth in respect\n\nof amended provisions, as obtained prior to coming into force of the\n\n2020 Act. The same were complied with by all concerned without\n\nany demur.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">(d)   The purpose behind the amendment of 2020, is to make\n\nmeaningful and effective regulatory arrangement and real-time\n\nreporting of utilisation of the foreign contribution for the activity for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                   16</span>\n\nwhich it has been earmarked and permitted to be so used in terms\n\nof the registration certificate or prior permission of the competent\n\nauthority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">(e)   The permission to receive foreign contribution is granted to\n\npersons for a definite cultural, economic, educational or social\n\nprogramme meant for the benefit of the society, as mandated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1100836/\" id=\"a_74\">Sections 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_75\">12</a> of the 2010 Act. The dispensation envisaged in\n\nthe Act is to seek registration or prior permission of the competent\n\nauthority to receive and utilise foreign contribution.       The person\n\nhaving obtained such certificate of registration or prior permission,\n\ncannot   complain    about   the   regulatory   provisions    regarding\n\nutilisation thereof for the prescribed activities. For, the legislative\n\nintent behind enactment of the 2010 Act is that foreign contribution\n\ncannot be allowed unless it is tightly regulated and controlled.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">(f)   The implementation of the 2010 Act increasingly revealed that\n\ncertain NGOs were involved primarily in routing of foreign\n\ncontributions only. They received and utilised foreign contribution\n\nby transferring it to other NGOs, thereby establishing a principal-\n\nclient relationship. To overcome this mischief, it became necessary\n\nto amend the provisions for effective regulatory and control\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                               17</span>\n\nmeasures in respect of receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution.\n\nThese amendments were necessitated because of large-scale\n\ntransfers of foreign contribution and sudden rise in the inflow\n\nthereof in the recent past creating several operational difficulties and\n\nmalpractices, that threatened to defeat the very purpose of the 2010\n\nAct. The regulatory agencies were finding it difficult to monitor the\n\nultimate utilisation of foreign contribution by the transferee. To stop\n\nsuch violations and malpractices and to fix accountability, it was\n\nconsidered necessary to stop the transfer of foreign contribution and\n\nthus ensure that the recipient of the foreign contribution itself\n\nutilises the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">(g)    The need to mandate the utilisation of foreign contribution by\n\nthe recipient NGO itself, is also on account of the purport of <a href=\"/doc/1100836/\" id=\"a_76\">Sections\n\n11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_77\">12</a> of the Act. The same predicate that FCRA registration be\n\noffered to an association28 having definite programme to spend the\n\nforeign contribution on purposes useful to society. The NGOs merely\n\n28The expression “association” as defined in <a href=\"/doc/13795/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 2(1)(a)</a> of the 2010 Act as amended, reads\nthus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      “2. Definitions.—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,—\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      (a) “association” means an association of individuals, whether incorporated\n      or not, having an office in India and includes a society, whether registered\n      under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_79\">Societies Registration Act, 1860</a> (21 of 1860), or not, and any other\n      organisation, by whatever name called;”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                  18</span>\n\nindulging in transfer of foreign contribution to other NGOs albeit\n\nregistered or persons having prior permission, is not the scheme of\n\nthe 2010 Act.     In order to ensure that the purported legitimate\n\nactivities of NGOs do not result in foreign contribution being diverted\n\nfrom one area of activity to other area leading to its misuse including\n\nthreatening the sovereignty and integrity of the country, the\n\nParliament opted the strict dispensation of restricted utilisation of\n\nforeign contribution by the recipient NGOs itself for the permitted\n\nactivities.   The amended provisions are intended to remedy the\n\nmischief of endless chain of transfers of foreign contribution from\n\nthe recipient NGOs to other registered NGOs creating layered trail of\n\nmoney making it difficult to trace the flow and legitimate utilisation\n\nthereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(h)   The successive multiple chain of transfers not only create a\n\nlayered trail of money, but also lead to substantive portion of foreign\n\ncontribution being utilised as administrative expenditure by the\n\nconcerned entity by claiming it as its own allowance for\n\nadministrative expenditure to the extent of 50 per cent of the receipt.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">The aggregate of such administrative expenditure, if reckoned with\n\nthe aggregate quantum of inflow of funds by the original recipient,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                   19</span>\n\nwould, in a given situation, far exceed the statutory bar of\n\n50 per cent of total contribution received by the NGO from abroad.\n\nFurther, the wisdom of the Parliament was also in favour of reducing\n\nthe permissibility of administrative expenditure by limiting it to\n\n20 per cent, so that maximum benefit is reaped by the society at\n\nlarge due to its utilisation for permissible activities of the NGO.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">(i)      The subject amendment became necessary also to obliterate\n\nthe mischief of foreign powers and foreign State and non-State actors\n\nindulging in activities resulting in interference in the internal polity\n\nof the country with ulterior designs. Resultantly, sub-Section (1A)\n\nhas been inserted in <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 12</a> of the 2010 Act, making it essential\n\nto furnish details of FCRA account. This is in consonance with the\n\nmanner specified in <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 17</a> of the Act. In other words, insertion\n\nof sub-Section (1A) was to infuse compatibility with other provisions\n\nof the 2010 Act. To that end, a new section – <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 12A</a> has also\n\nbeen inserted requiring furnishing of Aadhaar card details in lieu of\n\nidentification document.      It is urged that the petitioners have\n\nmisapplied the exposition of the Constitution Bench in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy29. The said decision does not completely rule out the\n\n\n29   supra at Footnote No.7\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                  20</span>\n\npossibility of intrusion into the privacy of a person, which is backed\n\nby a just law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">(j)   The core intent behind the provisions such as <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 12A</a> is to\n\nfacilitate proper identification of person and associations with which\n\nthe persons are connected and also purposeful real-time monitoring\n\nof activities for ensuring that the same are not detrimental to the\n\nnational interest. As a matter of fact, the 2010 Act (unamended)\n\nitself mandates that benami and fictitious activities are prohibited\n\nunder the Act. Thus, proper identification of person at the time of\n\nregistration would ensure proper identification of functionaries of\n\nFCRA/NGOs. Such a provision ought to stand the test of legitimate\n\naim and also proportionality test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">(k)   The amended <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 17(1)</a> specifies receipt of foreign\n\ncontribution in designated FCRA account in the SBI, NDMB.

The stipulation only requires the inflow of foreign\n\ncontribution through designated channel which is to ensure effective\n\nimplementation of proper regulatory and controlled measures.\n\nSufficient time was given to the FCRA account holder to comply with\n\nthe formalities as per the new dispensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1906677\" id=\"span_41\">(l)       Initially, a public notice was issued on 13.10.2020 providing\n\nfor procedure and operation of the designated FCRA account, giving\n\ntime till 31.3.2021, which came to be extended from time to time\n\nuntil December, 2021.

That process involves multiple steps\n\nincluding audit, inspection and filing of annual return and\n\nmonitoring of fund flow. Accordingly, a systematic monitoring of\n\nFCRA bank account is imperative part of the regulatory measures\n\nprovided in the Act and the rules made thereunder. It is elaborated\n\nthat presently there are about 22,600 NGOs holding registration or\n\nprior permission for specific project/programme. These NGOs used\n\nto receive foreign contribution in an exclusive bank account of their\n\nchoice in any bank in India. That resulted in opening of multiple\n\naccounts in hundreds of branches spread across the country. This\n\ninevitably caused enormous difficulty in monitoring of inflow or\n\n\n\n31   (1981) 2 SCC 600\n32   (2009) 11 SCC 726\n33   for short, “the MHA”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                  23</span>\n\noutflow of amount from the respective accounts and also during\n\naudit process. Even though the mandate of law obliges the NGOs to\n\nfile periodical annual return, however, the inflow and outflow details\n\nat a particular point of time or on real-time basis, association-wise,\n\nas well as, cumulatively, for all such organisations was not\n\nforthcoming and monitoring thereof due to scattered distribution of\n\nthe FCRA accounts across the country seriously affected the\n\nmonitoring process. Notably, keeping in mind the convenience of\n\nthe registered associations, they have been given choice to open\n\nanother FCRA account in any scheduled bank/branch of their\n\nchoice after opening of FCRA account in SBI, NDMB, for receiving\n\nforeign contribution from any foreign source. It is urged that the\n\nlegislative intent behind the 2010 Act and the object sought to be\n\nachieved is to curb misuse of foreign contribution threatening the\n\nsovereignty and integrity of the nation including impacting the\n\npolity. As aforesaid, the amendments were necessitated on account\n\nof past experience and to curb the mischief which was prevalent\n\ndespite the tight regulatory measures under the 2010 Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">(n)   The legislative history has also been highlighted in the common\n\nreply filed by respondents.

Certain changes were brought about to that\n\nAct in the year 1985, making it more effective. The 2010 Act had\n\nbeen the outcome of a bill drafted in 2006. The Statement of Objects\n\nand Reasons, as mentioned in the said Bill titled as “Foreign\n\nContribution (Regulation) Bill, 2006” recognised that significant\n\ndevelopments had taken place since 1984, such as change in\n\ninternal security scenario, an increased influence of voluntary\n\norganisations, spread of use of communication and information\n\ntechnology, quantum jump in the amount of foreign contribution\n\nbeing received and large-scale growth in the number of registered\n\norganisations, necessitating comprehensive legislative approach.\n\nThe Bill was referred to the Department–related Parliamentary\n\nStanding Committee on Home Affairs. Eventually, the 2010 Act was\n\nperceived. This legislative history has been taken note of in the case\n\nof INSAF34. The amendments effected in the year 2020 had become\n\nnecessary to ensure that the object of the Act is achieved efficiently.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"150734606\" id=\"span_45\">(o)      It is urged that the 2010 Act cannot be equated with any other\n\ngeneral legislation.

Accordingly, it is urged that the argument\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">\f                                  33</span>\n\nregarding amended provisions being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 14</a>, is devoid\n\nof merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1681994\" id=\"span_90\">(t)   While countering the challenge on the ground of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_134\">19(1)(g)</a>, it is stated that there exists no right to seek a foreign\n\ncontribution without regulation. Further, the 2010 Act does not\n\nprohibit the foreign contributions or the right to form the\n\nassociations itself or the right to practice any profession. Rather, it\n\nmerely seeks to provide efficacious regulatory regime regarding\n\nforeign contributions to be received by such associations.

In that sense, it does not\n\nimpinge upon the fundamental rights of the petitioners, much less\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The regulation and control are directly\n\nrelatable to activities/programmes detrimental to the sovereignty\n\nand integrity of India, public order and interests of general public\n\nand for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. It being\n\na reasonable and proportionate restriction having clear nexus with\n\nthe object of the Principal Act without impacting the right of the\n\nregistered associations to continue to receive foreign contribution\n\nfrom foreign donors and also utilise the same by opening accounts\n\nin different scheduled banks/branches of their choice in the\n\ncountry, by no stretch of imagination, can be said to impinge upon\n\nthe fundamental rights of the registered associations or persons\n\nhaving prior permission of the competent authority.\n\n(z)   As regards the grievance of the writ petitioners being forced to\n\nopen and operate account in the designated bank and branch i.e.,\n\nSBI, NDMB, it is stated in the reply affidavit that for outstation FCRA\n\norganisations located in remote areas and for operational ease of any\n\nFCRA organisation, MHA and SBI have put in place a system to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">\f                                  39</span>\n\nenable the associations/FCRA organisations/NGOs to open main\n\nbank account in SBI, NDMB without any need to physically come to\n\nDelhi. It certainly dispels and redresses the principal grievance of\n\nthe writ petitioners about they being forced to visit Delhi to open\n\naccount in the designated branch coupled with the enabling\n\nprovision allowing the registered associations to utilise and transact\n\nfrom any scheduled bank/branch of their choice in the country. The\n\nfundamental basis of assail to the amended provisions, therefore,\n\nfalls to the ground.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">(aa) The respondents have relied on the Standard Operating\n\nProcedure (SOP) issued by the appropriate authority in regard to the\n\nopening of FCRA account in the designated branch (SBI, NDMB) to\n\nreceive the inflow of foreign contribution including to permit the\n\nregistered associations to open FCRA account in other scheduled\n\nbanks/branches of their choice across the country. Further, it is\n\nasserted that until the filing of the common response in October,\n\n2021, around 19,000 accounts were already opened in the\n\ndesignated branch at New Delhi. That was possible even without\n\nphysical visit of the authorised       persons of the concerned\n\nassociations to New Delhi. This facility of opening account in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">\f                                  40</span>\n\ndesignated bank and branch is provided on free/gratis basis without\n\nany bank charge on real-time basis by the SBI on the instructions\n\nof the recipient organisations through digital or internet banking. As\n\naforesaid, these arrangements are necessitated for the purposes of\n\neffective enforcement and operational angle and to monitor the flow\n\nof foreign contributions and information concerning the same on\n\nreal-time basis from one centralised location. This has reasonable\n\nnexus and proximate relationship with the object sought to be\n\nachieved by the Act and to ensure transparency and accountability\n\nof all concerned. The registered associations/NGOs are not put to\n\nany undue hardship or extra financial costs/compliance burden.\n\nThe challenge to the amended provisions, therefore, is based on\n\ntenuous assertions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">(bb) It is also asserted that application for effecting any change of\n\ndetails furnished while opening the main account in the designated\n\nbranch (i.e., SBI, NDMB) is to be submitted only through online\n\nmode on the FCRA web portal i.e., fcraonline@nic.in.             It is\n\nhighlighted that the assertion made by the writ petitioners that there\n\nare close to 50,000 persons registered under FCRA, is false and\n\nmisleading. In fact, the FCRA website itself would reveal that out of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">\f                                  41</span>\n\nclose to 50,000 persons registered under FCRA, registration\n\ncertificates of less than 23,000 are active. Further, registration of\n\n20,600   non-compliant     persons     has   already   been   cancelled.\n\nFurthermore, following the changed dispensation as per the\n\namended provisions (of 2020 Act), over 19,000 accounts have\n\nalready been opened in the designated branch (i.e., SBI, NDMB) until\n\nOctober, 2021. It is, thus, urged that the amended provisions are\n\nintended to further the object of the Principal Act and are regulatory\n\nin nature concerning the receipt and utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution or foreign hospitality by certain individuals or\n\nassociations or companies and incidental matters; and are\n\nconsistent with the underlying principles expounded in the Principal\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">(cc) After having said as above, the affidavit goes on to highlight\n\nthat none of the amended provisions even remotely permit or\n\nattempt to oversee the banking functions. The amended provisions\n\nof the Act, as well as, the Regulations, are intended to only bring out\n\nclarity on crucial role assigned to the banks in respect of the\n\nimplementation of the Principal Act of 2010. Similarly, the stated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">\f                                               42</span>\n\ncircular         is    only     an     administrative       guidance     for   better\n\nimplementation of the provisions of the 2010 Act.\n\n(dd) The respondents have, thus, prayed for dismissal of the writ\n\npetitions109 filed by the registered associations, consequently leaving\n\nnothing for consideration in the writ petition filed by Vinay Vinayak\n\nJoshi110.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">6.

SBI works in\n\ntandem with the instructions issued by the Government of India in\n\nthat regard.    The Government of India has issued a Standard\n\nOperating Procedure (SOP) with regard to opening and operation of\n\nFCRA account.        The information in that regard has been\n\ndisseminated to account holders and is in public domain, including\n\nby conducting Webinars from time to time. The main Branch of SBI\n\nhas created a dedicated cell having over forty officials to deal with all\n\nthe FCRA accounts at SBI, NDMB.

The entities can avail CINB and may\n\ncustomize    their   authority   matrix   for   making   any   financial\n\ntransactions. It is also open to the entities to open and operate FCRA\n\naccount (utilization account) at one or more branches of scheduled\n\nbanks of their choice.

Further, they are free to\n\noperate their account without physically approaching SBI Branch on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">\f                                  45</span>\n\nregular basis as in the case of any other normal account holder, if\n\nthey intend to access internet banking facility. It is denied that the\n\nregistered associations/concerned entities are required to appoint a\n\ndesignated person in New Delhi and make frequent trips for offline\n\nKYC verification as alleged. Instead, they can approach the nearest\n\nSBI Branch and get the offline verification of document done at the\n\nsaid Branch itself. In other words, the argument of inconvenience\n\nput forth by the writ petitioners and similarly placed persons have\n\nnot only been refuted, but information regarding sufficient logistical\n\narrangements made by the respondent-Bank (SBI) to facilitate\n\nopening as well as operating of FCRA account by authorised persons\n\nhas been delineated in the response filed before this Court. The\n\nsame is indicative of the fact that the services are offered to the\n\nconcerned entities at the local level itself without requiring the FCRA\n\naccount holders to visit the main Branch at New Delhi.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">(e)   This affidavit also reveals that SBI has more than two lakh\n\nemployees working in branches in different parts of the country with\n\nnetwork all over the country as well as abroad. It is stated that for\n\nthe purposes of operating 23,000 FCRA accounts, there is no need\n\nto incur high administrative expenses.       Instead, the Bank has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">\f                                    46</span>\n\naugmented additional infrastructure required for that purpose in the\n\ndesignated Branch at New Delhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_62\">(f)   It is further stated that by the time the affidavit was filed, about\n\n20,000 FCRA accounts have already been opened, out of\n\napproximately 23,000 active organizations, and that the remaining\n\nregistered associations were in the process of getting their accounts\n\nopened by approaching the main Branch at New Delhi. It is urged\n\nthat the respondent-Bank (SBI) is offering all banking facilities as\n\nrequested/demanded by the concerned account holder.             SBI has\n\ndenied that there is any delay in the process of opening of account\n\nand receiving of foreign remittances due to the volume of\n\ntransactions or that it does not have necessary infrastructural\n\ncapacity to handle queries from thousands of organizations, as\n\nalleged by the writ petitioners. At the same time, it has been fairly\n\naccepted that during the second phase of COVID-19, due to\n\nextraordinary situation, there may have been delay in some cases,\n\nbut all the accounts have been made operational and are being\n\naccessed by the concerned FCRA account holders. The affidavit also\n\nmentions about the steps taken to streamline the operational issues\n\nin respect of FCRA accounts. The substance of this affidavit is to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">\f                                                47</span>\n\ndemonstrate that no inconvenience is being caused to the FCRA\n\naccount holders, in any manner; and the Bank is fully equipped to\n\nhandle the logistical issues concerning FCRA accounts in the main\n\nBranch as well as other branches across the country.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_63\">7.        Rejoinder affidavit filed by the writ petitioners\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_64\">(a)       The writ petitioners have filed rejoinder affidavit whereby\n\nassertions made in the writ petitions are reiterated. The emphasis\n\nis essentially in respect of grounds to assail the validity of the\n\namended provisions of the 2010 Act, in particular <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_168\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_169\">12(1A)</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_170\">12A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_171\">17(1)</a>. The rejoinder affidavit also points out the reason for\n\nrejection of application for registration and opening of bank account.\n\nThose matters, however, cannot be the basis to test the validity of\n\nthe provisions. Hence, it is not necessary to elaborate the same.\n\nThey are more in the nature of inconvenience caused in respect of\n\nprocess of registration and of operating the FCRA accounts.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">8.

Thus, it is not open to\n\ncontend that no fundamental right exists to receive foreign\n\ncontribution. The amended provisions are arbitrary and overbroad\n\nrestrictions on the right to receive foreign funding, thus, it is violative\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Further, this Court in the case of\n\nINSAF115 did not examine the effect of the impugned provisions on\n\nthe fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution as there\n\nwas no petitioner in individual capacity before the Court.            The\n\namendments effected vide the 2020 Act are not only hit by the vice\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, but also <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 19(1)(a)</a><a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_177\">, 19(1)(c)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_178\">19(1)(g)</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">(c)       As regards <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 7</a> of the Act, it is submitted that\n\npre-amendment, transfer of foreign contribution to other person\n\n\n113   AIR 1950 SC 27\n114   supra at Footnote No.22 (paras 18 to 22)\n115   supra at Footnote No.22\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">\f                                               49</span>\n\nduly registered and had been granted the certificate or obtained the\n\nprior permission under the 2010 Act was permissible. The proviso\n\npermitted the transfer of foreign contribution by the recipient\n\nregistered association. This has been completely prohibited by the\n\namended provision, which is overbroad restriction.                       For, this\n\nprohibition would inevitably impact the funding of the entities who\n\nwere otherwise allowed to receive foreign contribution. Having so\n\npermitted, the regulatory measures at best can be to ensure that the\n\nforeign contribution is eventually utilised for the purpose for which\n\nit has been so permitted.                The total prohibition in terms of the\n\namended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 7</a> is manifestly arbitrary and has no causal\n\nconnection with the object sought to be achieved by the Principal Act\n\nor the Amendment Act. In support of this contention, reliance is\n\nplaced on K.S. Puttaswamy116.                       In that, being a case of total\n\nprohibition, it impacts the very utilisation of foreign contribution by\n\nany organisation. The expression “person” in <a href=\"/doc/71915198/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 2(1)(m)</a> of the\n\nAct posits an expansive meaning. Thus, post amendment transfer\n\nof foreign contribution to individual or organisation will be affected.\n\nSignificantly, the word “transfer” has not been defined. In other\n\n\n116   supra at Footnote No.7 (paras 105 and 106)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">\f                                  50</span>\n\nwords, there is no clarity about the manner of utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution by the registered entities who had been allowed to\n\nreceive the same for utilisation for specified purposes. The ordinary\n\nmeaning of expression “utilisation” would include transfer of foreign\n\ncontribution to another entity; and, thus, there is apparent conflict\n\nbetween <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1717332/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 8</a> of the Act. As a result, amended\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 7</a> is not only absurd, but defeat the very object of the\n\nPrincipal Act, which allows regulated use of foreign contribution. In\n\nabsence of any definition of expressions “transfer” and “utilisation”,\n\nuse of foreign contribution by the entity would be risking violation of\n\nthe provisions of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_132\">(d)   It is urged that <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 7</a> is overbroad and vague. There is\n\nambiguity as to what constitutes various social or educational or\n\ncultural or economic or religious purpose under <a href=\"/doc/212809/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 11(1)</a> of the\n\nAct and at the same time, <a href=\"/doc/96999220/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 35</a> of the Act invites punishment\n\nfor contravention of any provision of the Act.      For that reason,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 7</a> suffers from the vice of manifest arbitrariness and hit by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. To buttress this argument, reliance\n\nis placed on the enunciation of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/110813550/\" id=\"a_191\">Shreya Singhal vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">\f                                   51</span>\n\nUnion of India117</a>.       Further, the amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 7</a> would not\n\npermit collaboration between registered non-profit organisations to\n\nserve larger social needs across the country with any other entity or\n\nperson. That is bound to hamper work of grassroot organisations\n\nwhich receive sub-grants in India from a consortium lead partner in\n\ninternational development projects. Those projects will be affected\n\nat the grassroot level where the registered organisations may not be\n\nable to cater on its own.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175932521\" id=\"span_134\">(e)      It is then urged that even if the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 7</a> is to\n\nprevent misutilisation of funds, it violates the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 19(1)(a)</a><a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_195\">, 19(1)(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_196\">19(1)(g)</a> under Part III of\n\nthe Constitution, being an unreasonable restriction.             Such\n\nrestriction serves no legitimate Government purpose.        It has no\n\nrational nexus with the object of the enactment, including the\n\nPrincipal Act. The unamended provision was less restrictive and was\n\nworking very well, serving the objective of the Principal Act.\n\nFurthermore, being a case of complete prohibition, the registered\n\norganisations would not be able to continue collaboration with other\n\nentities at the grassroot level, even if those entities are also duly\n\n\n117   (2015) 5 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">\f                                                52</span>\n\nregistered under the Act.                 This is bound to denude the recipient\n\n(registered organisation) of foreign contribution from reaching out\n\nand undertaking specified activities at the grassroot level through\n\nsuch entity. Such onerous restriction does not stand the test of\n\nproportionality or being reasonable restriction as held in the case of\n\nK.S. Puttaswamy118. Reliance is also placed upon a recent decision\n\nof this Court in <a href=\"/doc/175932521/\" id=\"a_197\">Manohar Lal Sharma vs. Union of India &amp;\n\nOrs.119</a>, to contend that the State had failed to specifically establish\n\nnational security issues to justify the amendments to the 2010 Act.\n\nIn absence thereof, no omnibus prohibition can be validated by the\n\nCourt. It is urged that <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 7</a>, being manifestly arbitrary and\n\nlacking any determining principle, is wholly unreasonable and,\n\ntherefore, violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">(f)       On similar lines, <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 12(1A)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 17(1)</a> has\n\nbeen assailed, being manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable. The\n\nchallenge is limited to the stipulation of opening a bank account only\n\nat one specific branch of SBI at New Delhi for all organisations\n\nacross the country receiving foreign contribution.                               Such a\n\n\n\n\n118   supra at Footnote No.7 (paras 157 and 158)\n119   W.P. (Crl.) No.314 of 2021 etc., decided on 27.10.2021 (paras 49 and 50)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">\f                                  53</span>\n\nrequirement is absurd, irrational and serves no legitimate purpose\n\nunder the 2010 Act or any other law. It is urged that the challenge\n\nis not to the amended sub-Section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 17</a> requiring\n\nreporting to the authority. That being a Bank’s obligation can be\n\ntaken forward by the Bank.      No tangible logic is forthcoming to\n\njustify the need for <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 12(1A)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 17(1)</a>, as to how\n\nnational interest would be jeopardised by not adhering to that regime\n\nespecially when all the scheduled banks are regulated by the Reserve\n\nBank of India, including other Government owned public sector\n\nbanks or even local branches of SBI. Each one of them is obliged to\n\nreport all such transactions within 48 hours to the MHA. Such a\n\nprovision, therefore, is simply absurd and irrational.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_72\">(g)   It is argued that the impact of amended provisions is to denude\n\nthe registered associations to have physical access to their primary\n\naccount at Delhi along with a host of other restrictions. It is further\n\nurged that the amended provision does not stand the test of\n\nlegitimate goal for which such dispensation is necessary nor spells\n\nout the causal connection for compelling the persons seeking foreign\n\ncontribution to open bank accounts only in specified branch at New\n\nDelhi and how it would further the cause of the State interests.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">\f                                 54</span>\n\nEven, the principle of necessity has not been substantiated by the\n\nState, especially when there are already existing restrictions and\n\nproper mechanism to achieve the object of the Principal Act\n\nwhereunder each organisation is mandated to open a FCRA account\n\nin a scheduled bank of its choice, which account details were\n\nrequired to be reported to the MHA and linked to the FCRA\n\nregistration number of the organisations.       All the registered\n\norganisations were already complying with that requirement and\n\nhave been registered on an electronic portal known as ‘DARPAN’\n\nhaving unique ID provided to them.         Further, the registered\n\norganisations were also obliged to submit regular returns as\n\nspecified in <a href=\"/doc/1272975/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 18</a> read with Rule 17 of the 2011 Rules. The\n\nsaid dispensation requires furnishing of necessary details and\n\nreporting within 48 hours to the appropriate authority. The specious\n\nplea of national security cannot be countenanced. The same has not\n\nbeen substantiated and there can be no presumption in that regard\n\nin favour of the legislation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">(h)   Further, respondent No.3-SBI has admitted that only 40\n\npersonnel are assigned with the work of operating FCRA accounts at\n\nthe main Branch. It is unfathomable as to how such a low number\n\nof personnel would be able to handle the workload of transaction of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">\f                                    55</span>\n\nthousands of persons for 23,000 registered organisations. Relying\n\non the expositions in Anuradha Bhasin120 and Maneka Gandhi121,\n\nit is urged that <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 12(1A)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 17(1)</a> is\n\nunconstitutional, being manifestly arbitrary and irrational.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">(i)      Even, the provision in the form of <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 12A</a> is violative of\n\nfundamental rights guaranteed to the office bearers of the registered\n\norganisations as it requires mandatory disclosure of Aadhaar\n\nnumber as an identity document for grant of FCRA certificate under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 12</a>, or renewal under <a href=\"/doc/352973/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 16</a> or to open a bank account\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 17</a>. Such a provision clearly falls foul of the test of\n\nproportionality as held in K.S. Puttaswamy122.           Inasmuch as,\n\noverseas citizens of India or foreign nationals serving as office\n\nbearers can provide an identity alternate to the Aadhaar card for the\n\nsame purposes. There is no legitimate goal set forth for inserting\n\n<a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 12A</a> in the Principal Act. It is urged that even this provision\n\nhas no nexus with the object sought to be achieved under the\n\nPrincipal Act and suffers from the vice of violation of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 19</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">\n120   supra at Footnote No.21\n121   supra at Footnote No.12\n122   supra at Footnote No.7\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                                      56</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\">9.

In the first place, we must advert to the legislative history\n\nculminating with the 2010 Act, as amended in 2020. A Bill was\n\nintroduced in the Rajya Sabha in the year 1973 titled as “the Foreign\n\nContribution (Regulation) Bill, 1973”. The Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons appended to the said Bill read thus: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\n        There has been widespread concern about the unregulated\n        receipt of funds from foreign agencies by individuals and\n        organisations in the country. The Bill seeks to regulate the\n        acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution or\n        hospitality with a view to ensuring that our parliamentary\n        institutions, political associations, academic and other\n        voluntary organisations as well as individuals working in\n        important areas of national life may function in a manner\n        consistent with the values of a sovereign democratic republic.”\n\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\nOn 19.2.1974, the House referred the Bill to a Joint Committee of\n\nthe Houses consisting of 60 members, of whom 20 were to be\n\nnominated from Rajya Sabha.             While introducing the Bill, the\n\nMinister outlined the contours of the regulatory measures felt\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">\f                                    57</span>\n\nessential in respect of the foreign contributions. He adverted to three\n\noptions.   The first of outright prohibition; the second being\n\nacceptance subject to prior permission of Government; and the third\n\nof acceptance subject to intimation being given to Government. He\n\nexpressed that the Government felt that it was an important\n\nmeasure and believed that the deliberations in the Joint Committee\n\nof both the Houses would enable formulation of a well-conceived Bill,\n\non the basis of informed representative public opinion desirous of\n\nsecuring the objectives, as stated in the Bill.       There was broad\n\nunanimity between the members that the issue needed in-depth\n\nexamination.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">11. The     then   Minister    of    Home   Affairs    presented   the\n\nrecommendation of the Rajya Sabha before the Lok Sabha on\n\n25.3.1974. The motion was duly adopted by the Lok Sabha and 40\n\nmembers of the said House were nominated to the Joint Committee\n\nof the Houses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">12.

Similarly, the report of the Joint Committee of the Houses\n\non the Bill was presented in the Rajya Sabha on 6.1.1976.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">13. The deliberations regarding the proposed Bill and the report of\n\nthe Joint Committee took place in the Lok Sabha on 29.3.1976.\n\nDuring the discussion, there was unanimity amongst all members\n\ncutting across party lines that the penetration of foreign money into\n\ncountry is a serious threat and danger to the sovereignty of the\n\ncountry.   The members variously expressed concern about the\n\nunregulated inflow of foreign contribution.   It was noted that its\n\npenetration was so widespread that generally, anyone interested in\n\nthe sovereignty of our country and in democracy was bound to feel\n\nconcerned about the same. The experience of other countries was\n\nalso discussed by the members. The members mentioned about the\n\ninflow of foreign contribution from many countries and noted that\n\nsome times it was being received directly and some times indirectly,\n\nthrough other countries. It was coming in many forms including\n\nreceipt by religious organisations. It was agreed that the foreign\n\ncontribution can be permitted in regulated manner without\n\ncompletely prohibiting the inflow thereof. Eventually, to address the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">\f                                         59</span>\n\nmischief of growing foreign influence owing to influx of foreign\n\ndonations in our country, the Bill was passed which took the form\n\nof the Act i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/124743905/\" id=\"a_214\">Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1234174/\" id=\"a_215\">This\n\nAct</a> came into force on 5.8.1976123 as a shield in our legislative\n\narmoury. The preamble of the 1976 Act reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">          “<a href=\"/doc/1234174/\" id=\"a_216\">An Act</a> to regulate the acceptance and utilization of foreign\n          contribution or foreign hospitality by certain persons or\n          associations, with a view to ensuring that parliamentary\n          institutions, political associations and academic and\n          other voluntary organisations as well as individuals\n          working in the important areas of national life may\n          function in a manner consistent with the values of a\n          sovereign democratic republic, and for matters connected\n          therewith or incidental thereto.”\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\nOver the course of time, this Act came to be amended. One such\n\namendment was in 1985. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of\n\nthe stated amendment read thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                    “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n          The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976, seeks to\n          regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution\n          or foreign hospitality by certain categories of persons or\n          associations. To remove certain inadequacies and practical\n          difficulties in the administration of the Act, a Bill to amend\n          the Act was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in May, 1984. The\n          Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha with certain amendments.\n          But it could not be passed by the Lok Sabha before it\n          adjourned at the end of its Monsoon Session and the Bill has\n          now lapsed. As it was considered necessary to give effect to\n          the provisions of the Bill as passed by the Rajya Sabha\n          urgently, the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment\n          Ordinance, 1984, was promulgated by the President on the\n\n123Vide notification No. GSR 755(E), dated 5.8.1976 published in the Gazette of India,\nExtraordinary, Part-II, <a href=\"/doc/1193498/\" id=\"a_217\">section 3(i)</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">\f                             60</span>\n\n20th October, 1984. The said Ordinance, inter alia, made the\nfollowing amendments in the Act, namely:—\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">        (i) The definition of “foreign contribution”, as\n   contained in the Act, included only the donation,\n   delivery or transfer made by any foreign source. It did\n   not include donation or contribution received by an\n   organisation from another organisation from out of\n   foreign    contribution    received   by   the     latter\n   organisation. The definition was enlarged to include\n   such contributions also for the purpose of tracing the\n   utilisation of foreign contribution down the line.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">        (ii) The definition of “political party”, as contained\n   in the Act, did not include political parties in the State\n   of Jammu and Kashmir and political parties which are\n   not covered by the Election Symbols (Reservation and\n   Allotment) Order, 1968. The Ordinance amended this\n   definition to include such political parties also.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">        (iii) <a href=\"/doc/883470/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act provided that every\n   association having a definite cultural, economic,\n   educational, religious or social programmes, may\n   receive foreign contribution, but was required to send\n   intimation regarding such receipt to the Central\n   Government within such time and such manner to be\n   prescribed by the rules made under the Act. It had been\n   observed that a number of associations had not sent\n   such intimation. In order to effectively monitor the\n   receipt of foreign contribution, this sub-section was\n   amended to provide that associations referred to\n   therein shall accept foreign contribution only after\n   they are registered with the Central Government\n   specifically for the purpose and accept such\n   contributions only through a specified branch of a\n   bank. They would, however, be required to give, within\n   such time and in such manner as may be prescribed,\n   intimation to the Central Government as to the\n   amount of foreign contribution received by them, the\n   source from which and the manner in which such\n   foreign contribution was received by them, etc. Where\n   any registered association does not accept foreign\n   contribution through the specified branch of a\n   specified bank or does not submit intimations, etc., in\n   time, the Central Government has been empowered to\n   direct that such association shall not accept foreign\n   contribution without the prior permission of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">\f                                    61</span>\n\n          Central Government. A new sub-section (1A) had also\n          been included in this section to provide that an\n          association not so registered with the Central\n          Government shall obtain prior permission of the\n          Central Government before accepting any foreign\n          contribution and also give intimation to the Central\n          Government as to the amount of contribution received\n          by it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">               (iv) <a href=\"/doc/1234174/\" id=\"a_219\">The Act</a> only enabled the Central Government\n          to inspect the accounts of certain persons or\n          associations. It did not provide for any power to audit\n          the accounts of any organisation if it is considered\n          necessary to do so. The Ordinance amended the Act by\n          inserting a new section 15A, to take specific power to\n          audit the accounts of certain persons, organisations or\n          associations, if the prescribed returns are not\n          furnished in time by such persons, organisations or\n          associations or the returns so furnished by them are\n          not in accordance with law or their scrutiny gives room\n          for suspicion that the provisions of the Act have been\n          contravened.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">          (v) A new section 25A had also been inserted in the Act to\n          provide that where any person is convicted of an offence\n          relating to the acceptance or utilisation of foreign\n          contribution for a second time, he shall be prohibited from\n          accepting any foreign contribution for a period of three\n          years from the date of the second conviction.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">       2.

After the coming into force of the 1976 Act including the\n\nsubsequent amendments thereto, the experience gained and the\n\nsignificant developments having taken place since 1984 such as\n\nchange in internal security scenario, an increased influence of\n\nvoluntary organisations, spread of use of communication and\n\ninformation technology, quantum jump in the amount of foreign\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">\f                                   62</span>\n\ncontribution being received and large-scale growth in the number of\n\nregistered organisations, a Bill known as “the Foreign Contribution\n\n(Regulation) Bill, 2006” came to be introduced. The proposal in the\n\nBill was to repeal the 1976 Act and replace it with the provisions of\n\nthe proposed Bill. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Bill\n\nare as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\n          The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 was\n          enacted to regulate the acceptance and utilisation of\n          foreign contribution or hospitality with a view to\n          ensuring that our parliamentary institutions, political\n          associations,    academic    and     other    voluntary\n          organisations as well as individuals working in\n          important areas of national life may function in a\n          manner consistent with the values of a sovereign\n          democratic republic. <a href=\"/doc/1234174/\" id=\"a_220\">The Act</a> was amended in 1984 to\n          extend the provisions of the Act to cover second and\n          subsequent recipients of foreign contribution and to\n          the members of higher judiciary, besides introducing\n          the system of grant of registration to the associations\n          receiving foreign contribution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">          2. Significant developments have taken place since\n          1984 such as change in internal security scenario, an\n          increased influence of voluntary organisations, spread\n          of use of communication and information technology,\n          quantum jump in the amount of foreign contribution\n          being received, and large scale growth in the number of\n          registered organisations. This has necessitated large\n          scale changes in the existing Act. Therefore, it has\n          been thought appropriate to replace the present Act by\n          a new legislation to regulate the acceptance, utilisation\n          and accounting of foreign contribution and acceptance\n          of foreign hospitality by a person or an association.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">          3.

The members\n\nexpressed that India is an emerging economic power and the Bill, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">\f                                     64</span>\n\npropounded, was a welcome step towards prohibiting organisations\n\nwith political agenda from destabilising the country through foreign\n\nfunding. The members shared their experience and finally accepted\n\nthe Bill which became the 2010 Act. <a href=\"/doc/1234174/\" id=\"a_222\">This Act</a> repealed the 1976 Act.\n\nThe introduction for the 2010 Act recognised that some of the foreign\n\ncountries were funding individuals, associations, political parties,\n\ncandidates for elections, correspondents, columnists, editors,\n\nowners, printers or publishers of newspapers.             They were also\n\nextending hospitality. The introduction of the Act reads thus: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">        “It had been noticed that some of the foreign countries\n        were funding individuals, associations, political parties,\n        candidates for elections, correspondents, columnists,\n        editors, owners, printers or publishers of newspapers.\n        They were also extending hospitality. The effects of such\n        funding and hospitality were quite noticeable and to have\n        some control over such funding and hospitality and to\n        regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign\n        contribution or foreign hospitality by certain persons or\n        associations, with a view to ensuring that Parliamentary\n        institutions, political associations and academic and\n        other voluntary organisations as well as individuals\n        working in the important areas of national life may\n        function in a manner consistent with the values of a\n        sovereign democratic republic the <a href=\"/doc/124743905/\" id=\"a_223\">Foreign Contribution\n        (Regulation) Act, 1976</a> (49 of 1976) was enacted. Since its\n        enactment in 1976 several deficiencies had been found and it\n        was proposed to enact a fresh law on the subject by repealing\n        the Act 49 of 1976. Accordingly the Foreign Contribution\n        (Regulation) Bill was introduced in the Parliament.”\n\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">\f                                       65</span>\n\nIt will be useful to advert to the preamble of the 2010 Act.

Intrinsic in the regulatory provisions\n\nof the 2010 Act is to permit inflow of foreign contribution only in the\n\nmanner specified in the Act including its utilisation; and any activity\n\ninconsistent with the 2010 Act was to visit with penal consequences.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">The preamble of the 2010 Act restates the need to strictly regulate\n\nthe inflow of foreign contribution, as lack of it would inevitably affect\n\nthe national interests including the sovereignty and integrity of the\n\ncountry.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">\f                                 66</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">15.

As aforementioned, the need to amend certain provisions of the\n\n2010 Act was felt necessary, as is discernible from the Statement of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">\f                                      71</span>\n\nObjects and Reasons appended to Bill No. 123/2020, which finally\n\nculminated in the Amendment Act of 2020. The same reads thus: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">                “STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\n       The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 was enacted\n       to regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign\n       contribution or foreign hospitality by certain individuals or\n       associations or companies and to prohibit acceptance and\n       utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality for any\n       activities detrimental to the national interest and for matters\n       connected therewith or incidental thereto.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">         2. The said Act has come into force on the 1st day of May,\n       2011 and has been amended twice. The first amendment was\n       made by <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_253\">section 236</a> of the Finance Act, 2016 and the second\n       amendment was made by <a href=\"/doc/149922030/\" id=\"a_254\">section 220</a> of the Finance Act,\n       2018.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">          3. The annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost\n       doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many\n       recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the\n       same for the purpose for which they were registered or\n       granted prior permission under the said Act. Many of\n       them were also found wanting in ensuring basic statutory\n       compliances such as submission of annual returns and\n       maintenance of proper accounts. This has led to a\n       situation where the Central Government had to cancel\n       certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient\n       organisations,          including       non-Governmental\n       organisations, during the period between 2011 and 2019.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">       The criminal investigations also had to be initiated\n       against dozens of such non-Governmental organisations\n       which indulged in outright misappropriation or mis-\n       utilisation of foreign contribution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">          4. Therefore, there is a need to streamline the\n       provisions of the said Act by strengthening the\n       compliance mechanism, enhancing transparency and\n       accountability in the receipt and utilisation of foreign\n       contribution worth thousands of crores of rupees every\n       year   and     facilitating genuine  non-Governmental\n       organisations or associations who are working for the\n       welfare of the society.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">\f                                      72</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">          5.

It was noted that NGOs\n\nhave been formed, who in turn receive foreign contribution and\n\nspend the funds as per their own desire and the same is being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">\f                                      73</span>\n\nmisused, threatening the security apparatus and sovereignty of the\n\ncountry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">20.

Indisputably, serious concern about the impact of widespread\n\ninflow of foreign contribution on the values of a sovereign democratic\n\nrepublic had been repeatedly expressed at different levels including\n\nin the Parliament.   To that end, the Bill was introduced in the\n\nParliament in 1973. The legislative intent behind the enactment of\n\nthe 1976 Act has remained unchanged even to this day — nay it has\n\nbecome more relevant now. In that, the experience gained aftermath\n\nimplementation of the 1976 Act revealed that more stringent\n\ndispensation was needed to minimise the negative impact owing to\n\nthe surge in the inflow of foreign donation and for upholding the\n\nvalues of a sovereign democratic republic, for which the 2010 Act\n\ncame to be enacted. In that, even the amendment effected in 1985\n\nto the 1976 Act was found to be insufficient to deal with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">\f                                   79</span>\n\nshortcomings in the law in force, for regulating the inflow and\n\nsustained moderate utilisation of foreign contribution.        For that\n\nreason, the Parliament eventually decided to replace the regulatory\n\ndispensation by enacting a new law (the 2010 Act) to address the\n\nmischief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">23. In due course of time, however, it was realised that the\n\ndispensation enunciated in the 2010 Act was also not yielding the\n\ndesired result. This impelled the Parliament to amend the 2010 Act\n\n(vide 2020 Act) to make it more stringent and effective to subserve\n\nthe cause and intent of the Principal Act — not only in regard to the\n\nmodality of acceptance of foreign contribution in the prescribed\n\nmanner but also making it imperative for the recipient of foreign\n\ncontribution to utilise the same “itself” for the designated or specified\n\npurposes for which it was so permitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">24. Philosophically, foreign contribution (donation) is akin to\n\ngratifying intoxicant replete with medicinal properties and may work\n\nlike a nectar.   However, it serves as a medicine so long as it is\n\nconsumed (utilised) moderately and discreetly, for serving the larger\n\ncause of humanity. Otherwise, this artifice has the capability of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">\f                                  80</span>\n\ninflicting pain, suffering and turmoil as being caused by the toxic\n\nsubstance (potent tool) — across the nation.        In that, free and\n\nuncontrolled flow of foreign contribution has the potentials of\n\nimpacting the sovereignty and integrity of the nation, its public order\n\nand also working against the interests of the general public.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">25. To eradicate misuse and abuse of foreign contribution in the\n\npast, despite the firm regime in place in terms of the 2010 Act, the\n\nParliament in its wisdom has now (vide Amendment Act of 2020)\n\nadopted the path of moderation by making it mandatory for all to\n\naccept foreign contribution only through one channel and to utilise\n\nthe same “itself” for the purposes for which permission has been\n\naccorded. Undeniably, the sovereignty and integrity of India ought\n\nto prevail and the rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution\n\nmust give way to the interests of general public much less public\n\norder and the sovereignty and integrity of the nation. It must be\n\nborne in mind that the legislation under consideration must be\n\nunderstood in the context of the underlying intent of insulating the\n\ndemocratic polity from the adverse influence of foreign contribution\n\nremitted by foreign sources.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">\f                                    81</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">26. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Amendment Act\n\nof 2020 makes it amply clear that the annual inflow of foreign\n\ncontribution had almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019\n\nand many recipients of foreign contribution had not utilised the\n\nsame for the purposes for which they were registered or granted prior\n\npermission under the Act. Further, many recipients had also failed\n\nto adhere to and fulfil the statutory compliances — which resulted\n\nin cancellation of as many as 19,000 certificates of concerned\n\npersons/organisations during the stated period, including initiation\n\nof criminal investigation concerning outright misappropriation or\n\nmisutilisation of foreign contribution. It was increasingly reported\n\nthat some of the NGOs were primarily involved in routing of foreign\n\ncontribution accepted by them and not utilising the same itself for\n\nthe purposes for which certificate of registration was issued. Such\n\ntransfer   created    several   operational     issues   bordering     on\n\nmalpractices impacting the very intent of the Principal Act. For,\n\nrouting of foreign contribution entails in diverting it to another area\n\nof activity including misuse thereof.       There had been cases of\n\nsuccessive transfers and creation of a layered trail of money making\n\nit difficult to trace the flow and final utilisation. In this backdrop, to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">\f                                  82</span>\n\nstrengthen the compliance mechanism and enhancing transparency\n\nand accountability in the matter of acceptance and utilisation of\n\nforeign contribution, the Parliament had to once again step in to\n\nrestructure the dispensation, making it more meaningful and\n\neffective, so as to deal with the increasing impact of foreign\n\ncontribution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">27. It is unnecessary to underscore the distinction between foreign\n\ncontribution and foreign investment.     By its very nature, foreign\n\ncontribution is a donation accepted from a foreign source\n\npurportedly for definite cultural, economic, educational, religious or\n\nsocial programme and to serve the cause of humanity.              The\n\nexpression “foreign contribution” has been defined in <a href=\"/doc/706949/\" id=\"a_275\">Section 2(1)(h)</a>\n\nof the 2010 Act to mean donation, which can be in the form of\n\ndelivery or transfer made by any foreign source of any article,\n\ncurrency, security, etc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">28. It is open to a sovereign democratic nation to completely\n\nprohibit acceptance of foreign donation on the ground that it\n\nundermines the constitutional morality of the nation, as it is\n\nindicative of the nation being incapable of looking after its own\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">\f                                  83</span>\n\naffairs and needs of its citizens.     The third world countries may\n\nwelcome foreign donation, but it is open to a nation, which is\n\ncommitted and enduring to be self-reliant and variously capable of\n\nshouldering its own needs, to opt for a policy of complete prohibition\n\nof inflow/acceptance of foreign contribution (donation) from foreign\n\nsource.   This was the first option noted by the Parliament while\n\nconsidering the Bill concerning the 1976 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">29. When the 1976 Act was enacted, the Parliament had discussed\n\nabout three options. The first was of outright prohibition; the second\n\nbeing acceptance subject to prior permission of Government; and the\n\nthird — acceptance subject to intimation being given to Government.\n\nThe Parliament opted for the second option and that continues to\n\nthis day in the form of 2010 Act, as amended in 2020. At the same\n\ntime, from the experience gained aftermath implementation of the\n\ndispensation predicated for regulating the inflow of foreign\n\ncontribution from foreign source and its utilisation, the need to\n\nmake it more stringent was felt. The amendments vide the 2020 Act,\n\nare the product of that experience and the Parliament, for\n\naccomplishing the objectives of the Principal Act and to uphold the\n\nsovereignty and integrity of the nation as well as public order and in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">\f                                   84</span>\n\nthe interests of the general public, introduced the regime requiring\n\nacceptance of foreign contribution from foreign source only through\n\none channel and utilising the same by the recipient itself for the\n\nactivities for which prior permission has been granted to him in that\n\nregard. The permission to be granted by the Central Government\n\ncan be a general permission for definite cultural, economic,\n\neducational, religious or social programme or a special permission\n\nin respect of particular activity in that regard. In either case, it has\n\nto be a prior permission in the form of obtaining certificate of\n\nregistration from the Central Government or obtaining prior\n\npermission of the Central Government for the specific purpose by\n\nperson not so registered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">30. Suffice it to observe that considering the legislative history and\n\nthe need for the Parliament to periodically intervene to arrest the\n\nincreasing influence on the polity of the nation due to the high\n\nvolume of inflow of foreign contribution and large-scale improper\n\nutilisation and misappropriation thereof, as noticed by the\n\nauthorities and keeping in mind the objective of the principal\n\nenactment being to uphold the values of sovereign democratic\n\nrepublic, the dispensation as altered to make it more strict\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">\f                                   85</span>\n\ncompliance mechanism for ensuring that the foreign funds are\n\naccepted in the prescribed manner and utilised by the recipient itself\n\nand more so, for the purposes for which it was allowed to be received\n\nby that person, the amended provisions ought to pass the muster of\n\nreasonable restriction. Certainly, such a change cannot be labelled\n\nas irrational much less manifestly arbitrary, especially when it\n\napplies uniformly to a class of persons without any discrimination.\n\nWe need to remind ourselves the dictum of this Court in Rustom\n\nCavasjee Cooper124 and also R.K. Garg125 – that it is not for the\n\nCourt to consider relative merits of the different political theories or\n\neconomic policies including that an economic legislation may be\n\ntroubled with crudities, inequities, uncertainties or the possibility of\n\nabuse cannot be the basis for striking it down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">31. It must follow that acceptance of foreign contribution is\n\notherwise prohibited by law and violation of such restriction has\n\nbeen made an offence under Chapter VIII of the 2010 Act. Nothing\n\nprevents the organisations interested in doing charitable work in\n\nraising contribution within the country. In that sense, the 2010 Act\n\n\n\n124   supra at Footnote No.48\n125   supra at Footnote No.49\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">\f                                                86</span>\n\ndeals with a class of persons accepting foreign contribution from\n\nforeign source. All such persons are treated equally and without any\n\ndiscrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">\nRelevant provisions of the 2010 Act as amended\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">32.

As aforesaid, the 2010 Act is to regulate foreign contribution as\n\ndefined in <a href=\"/doc/706949/\" id=\"a_308\">Section 2(1)(h)</a>. As the petitioners are desirous of engaging\n\nin definite cultural, economic, educational, religious or social\n\nprogramme and for doing so accept foreign contribution, they had to\n\nseek certificate of registration from the Central Government in terms\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1100836/\" id=\"a_309\">Section 11</a>. The certificate of registration refers to definite activities\n\nwhich will be undertaken by the concerned organisation/trust for\n\nutilisation of foreign contribution.      Having shown interest in\n\nobtaining such certificate of registration or for renewal thereof, it is\n\nobligatory for the organisation to comply with the formalities,\n\nincluding as specified in <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_310\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_311\">12(1A)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_312\">Section 17</a> or\n\n<a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_313\">Section 12A</a>.

Besides complying with the formalities for registration under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1100836/\" id=\"a_314\">Section 11</a>, the persons interested in receipt/acceptance of foreign\n\ncontribution from foreign source after grant of such certificate of\n\nregistration, are obliged to do so only through the FCRA account\n\nwhich is required to be opened under <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_315\">Section 17</a> being a\n\nprecondition for grant of certificate of registration or renewal thereof,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">\f                                  94</span>\n\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_316\">Section 12(1A)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 17</a> of the 2010 Act.

It is\n\nurged that the unamended provision though restricted the transfer\n\nof foreign contribution, yet it did not completely prohibit the same\n\nunlike the amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_321\">Section 7</a>. The amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_322\">Section 7</a> postulates\n\ncomplete prohibition on the transfer of foreign contribution to other\n\nperson — not even to a person having certificate of registration under\n\nthe Act.

A person desirous of receiving/accepting foreign contribution\n\nfor such definite purposes had to seek a certificate of registration\n\nfrom the Central Government even under the unamended provision.\n\nAfter obtaining such certificate of registration, the recipient of\n\nforeign contribution could transfer it to another person who is also\n\nregistered and had been granted a certificate or obtained prior\n\npermission under the 2010 Act. However, that is not permissible\n\nunder the new dispensation (amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_337\">Section 7</a>). For, the legislative\n\nintent is now one of complete prohibition regarding transfer of\n\nforeign contribution to third party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">44. Significantly, as per the scheme of the 2010 Act, a certificate of\n\nregistration is not granted for acting as an intermediary between the\n\ndonor (foreign source) and the grassroot level organisation.      The\n\namended provision, therefore, completely rules out such transfer of\n\nforeign contribution by the person who has received/accepted the\n\nsame in the first place. That does not prevent the recipient from\n\nutilising the foreign contribution “itself” for the purposes for which\n\nhe has been granted a certificate of registration or obtained prior\n\npermission under the Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">\f                                   99</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_230\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_231\">45. The expression “transfer” has not been defined in the Act. The\n\nmeaning of expression “transfer” in the subject enactment would\n\npresuppose giving away of the foreign contribution in whole or in\n\npart to third person without retaining any control thereon; and such\n\nchange of hands is obviously without offering any services in return,\n\nnamely, free of costs. The third person would then be free to deal\n\nwith such transferred foreign contribution in the manner he chooses\n\nto do so, whilst adhering to the conditions specified in his certificate\n\nof registration or the conditions specified in the prior permission\n\nunder the Act, as the case may be.       In this scenario, it had been\n\npossible that the transferor (who had accepted the foreign\n\ncontribution) may have persuaded the foreign source to donate for\n\none permitted purpose, but without consulting the donor (foreign\n\nsource) could transfer the whole or part amount (foreign donation)\n\nto third person (transferee) for being utilised for altogether another\n\npurpose, which in a given case may not be acceptable to the donor.\n\nIt, thus, paved way for misutilisation of foreign contribution and the\n\npossibility of abuse thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_232\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_233\">46. There is no restriction regarding utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution, leave alone complete prohibition.       The rationale of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">\f                                                   100</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_338\">Section 7</a> as amended, inter alia, is that the donor (foreign source) is\n\nmade fully aware of the definite purposes already declared by the\n\nrecipient        and       permitted          by     the      competent           authority          and\n\ncorresponding obligation upon the recipient regarding utilisation of\n\nthe funds itself for stated purposes and none else.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">47. Indeed, even the expression “utilisation” has not been defined\n\nin the Act. The ordinary meaning of expression “utilisation” must be\n\nunderstood in the context of the purpose for which a certificate of\n\nregistration or prior permission under the Act has been granted by\n\nthe Central Government.

On this interpretation, it must follow that the\n\nargument regarding amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_343\">Section 7</a>, being ultra vires, must fail.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">48. Concededly, <a href=\"/doc/1717332/\" id=\"a_344\">Section 8</a> permits the recipient of foreign\n\ncontribution    to   utilise   only     specified   portion   thereof   for\n\nadministrative purposes, to the extent permissible.

Additionally, <a href=\"/doc/73520343/\" id=\"a_350\">Sections 12(4)(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272975/\" id=\"a_351\">18</a> of the 2010\n\nAct also reinforce such a view — which predicates that the person\n\nwho has been granted certificate of registration or given prior\n\napproval under the Act, is obliged to give intimation to the Central\n\nGovernment and such other authorities as may be specified by the\n\nCentral Government as to the amount of each foreign contribution\n\nreceived by it, the source from which and the manner in which such\n\nforeign contribution was received, and the purposes for which, and\n\nthe manner in which such foreign contribution was utilised by him.\n\nThis information may facilitate inquiry mechanism and to reassure\n\nthat the foreign contribution accepted by the person has been\n\nutilised for definite purposes permitted by the competent authority.\n\nAny breach of this stipulation may entail in penal action under the\n\nAct.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">\f                                   104</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_240\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_241\">50. It was vehemently urged before us that since the transferee\n\nwould also possess certificate of registration and bound by the\n\nprovisions of the 2010 Act, it would serve no legitimate purpose by\n\nprohibiting transfer of foreign contribution to such person.\n\nAccepting this argument would be completely glossing over the\n\nlegislative intent for which the amendment has been effected. The\n\nlegislative intent is to introduce strict dispensation qua the recipient\n\nof foreign contribution to utilise the same “itself” for the purposes for\n\nwhich it has been permitted as per the certificate of registration or\n\npermission granted under the Act by the Central Government. In\n\naddition, by the same Amendment Act, utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution for administrative purpose by the recipient has been\n\nlowered to twenty per cent only with a view to ensure maximum\n\nspending on the purposes for which the foreign contribution has\n\nbeen accepted by the recipient having certificate of registration.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_242\">51. Absent such stringent provision, some of the recipient\n\norganisations were reportedly indulging in successive chain of\n\ntransfers to other organisations, thereby creating a layered trail of\n\nmoney and also utilisation of funds towards administrative costs of\n\nsuccessive transfers upto fifty per cent leaving very little funds for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">\f                                 105</span>\n\nspending on the purposes for which it was permitted.           Hence,\n\nproviding complete restriction on transfer simplicitor, was the just\n\noption to fix accountability of the recipient organisation and\n\nmaximise utilisation for the permitted purposes. Such being the\n\navowed objective and purpose of the amendment, the challenge to\n\nthe amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_352\">Section 7</a> must fail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_243\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_244\">52. Be that as it may, the fact that earlier transfer of foreign\n\ncontribution was permitted as per the unamended provision, that by\n\nitself cannot be the basis to challenge the validity of the amended\n\nprovision. For, it is open to the Parliament to change the benchmark\n\nof restriction from higher standard to lower standard or vice versa\n\non the basis of the exigencies and experience gained during the\n\nimplementation of the applicable provision at the relevant time.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_245\">53. Indubitably, foreign contribution is qualitatively different from\n\nforeign investment.    Receiving foreign donation cannot be an\n\nabsolute or even a vested right.       By its very expression, it is a\n\nreflection on the constitutional morality of the nation as a whole\n\nbeing incapable of looking after its own needs and problems. The\n\nquestion to be asked is: “in normal times”, why developing or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">\f                                  106</span>\n\ndeveloped countries would need foreign contribution to cater to their\n\nown needs and aspirations? Indisputably, the aspirations of any\n\ncountry cannot be fulfilled on the hope (basis) of foreign donation,\n\nbut by firm and resolute approach of its own citizens to achieve the\n\ngoal by sheer dint of their hard work and industry.            Indeed,\n\ncharitable activity is a business. Receiving contribution within India\n\nto do charitable activity can be and is being regulated differently. It\n\nis not possible to have a similar approach relating to foreign\n\ncontribution from foreign source. In short, no one can be heard to\n\nclaim a vested right to accept foreign donation, much less an\n\nabsolute right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_246\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_247\">54. We say so because the theory of possibility of national polity\n\nbeing influenced by foreign contribution is globally recognised. For,\n\nforeign contribution can have material impact in the matter of socio-\n\neconomic structure and polity of the country. The foreign aid can\n\ncreate presence of a foreign contributor and influence the policies of\n\nthe country. It may tend to influence or impose political ideology.\n\nSuch being the expanse of the effect of foreign contribution coupled\n\nwith the tenet of constitutional morality of the nation, the\n\npresence/inflow of foreign contribution in the country ought to be at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">\f                                  107</span>\n\nthe minimum level, if not completely eschewed. The influence may\n\nmanifest in different ways, including in destabilising the social order\n\nwithin the country. The charitable associations may instead focus\n\non donors within the country, to obviate influence of foreign country\n\nowing to foreign contribution. There is no dearth of donors within\n\nour country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_248\">55. Pertinently, the 1976 Act came to be repealed by the 2010 Act,\n\nas it had become necessary to do so because of the experience gained\n\nthat in the name of foreign contribution, attempts were made by\n\nunscrupulous entities to disturb the economy and sovereignty of our\n\ncountry. That being the underlying reason, it must follow that the\n\nlegislative intent behind the Act and constant effort of the\n\nGovernment and of the Parliament is to discourage foreign\n\ncontribution generally, but allow it for specific definite purposes\n\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1100836/\" id=\"a_353\">Section 11</a> of the Act; and for which, the person\n\nreceiving or accepting foreign contribution is obliged to obtain a\n\ncertificate of registration under the Act or prior permission, as the\n\ncase may be. Further, such person is obligated to comply all the\n\nstipulations attached to the certificate of registration or prior\n\npermission, without any exception.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">\f                                   108</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_249\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_250\">56. Apparently, receiving “foreign exchange” is itself completely\n\nprohibited and made subject to exceptions provided for in terms of\n\nthe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999137.             On conjoint\n\nreading of the provisions of the 1999 Act and the regulatory\n\nmechanism provided for in the 2010 Act, it is a clear pointer to the\n\nstrict regime to be followed by all concerned for allowing inflow of\n\n“foreign contribution” (donation) in the manner prescribed and its\n\nutilisation only for definite purposes permitted by the competent\n\nauthority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_251\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_252\">57. We fail to understand as to how such a provision (amended\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_354\">Section 7</a>) can be regarded as discriminatory or so to say vague or\n\nirrational much less manifestly arbitrary. The restriction therein\n\napplies to a class of persons who are permitted to accept foreign\n\ndonation for being utilised by themselves for the definite purposes,\n\nwithout any discrimination and it is so done to uphold the objective\n\nof the Principal Act. Thus, there is clear intelligible differentia with\n\na direct nexus sought to be achieved with the intent of the Principal\n\nAct.        Such strict regime had become inevitable because of the\n\n\n\n\n137   for short, “the 1999 Act”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">\f                                  109</span>\n\nexperience gained by the concerned authorities over a period of time,\n\nincluding about the abuse of the earlier dispensation under the\n\nunamended provision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_253\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_254\">58. The change not only completely prohibits transfer, but also\n\nenhances the efficacy of the foreign contribution by mandating\n\nutilisation thereof by the person granted certificate of registration\n\nitself, for the purposes for which it had been accepted in terms of the\n\ncertificate of registration or prior permission granted under the Act,\n\nas the case may be, including upto prescribed administrative\n\nexpenses. This restriction inevitably fixes the accountability of the\n\nrecipient organisation and mandating maximum utilisation by itself\n\nfor permitted purposes. This is the procedure established by law. It\n\ncan neither be said to be arbitrary nor discriminatory much less\n\nmanifestly arbitrary — within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_355\">Article 14</a> or impinging\n\nupon <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_356\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. As a matter of law, since the\n\nsubject   Act    deals   with    a      distinct   class   of   persons\n\n(accepting/receiving foreign contribution) and it is founded on an\n\nintelligible differentia having object sought to be achieved by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">\f                                            110</span>\n\nPrincipal Act, it fulfils the test predicated in Shayara Bano138. For\n\nthe same reason, the amended provision under challenge is neither\n\ncapricious, irrational or lacking determining principle, nor suffers\n\nfrom the vice of excessiveness and being disproportionate.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"156532\" id=\"span_205\">59. We need to bear in mind that there is presumption that the\n\nParliament understands and reacts to the needs of its own people as\n\nper the exigencies and experience gained in the implementation of\n\nthe law. Mere plea of inconvenience is not enough to attract the\n\nconstitutional inhibition.              The Courts ought not to adopt a\n\ndoctrinaire approach in construing the amended provisions and\n\nundermine the legislative intent of strengthening the regulatory\n\nmechanism concerning foreign contribution. The legislature enjoys\n\nconsiderable latitude while exercising its wisdom on the basis of\n\ninputs collated from different quarters139. There is intrinsic evidence\n\nto indicate that the change effected by the amendments is to serve\n\nthe legitimate Government purpose and has a rational nexus to the\n\nobject of the Principal Act and the amendments, and that the pre-\n\namendment dispensation (unamended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 7</a>) was not sufficient\n\n\n\n138   supra at Footnote No.18\n139   see <a href=\"/doc/156532/\" id=\"a_358\">Ombalika Das vs. Hulisa Shaw</a> (supra at Footnote No.79)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">\f                                              111</span>\n\nto effectively regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution as predicated by the Principal Act.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_256\">60. Reliance placed by the petitioners on the dictum in Shreya\n\nSinghal140 and K.S. Puttaswamy141 to urge that it is open to the\n\nCourt to test the amendment on the touchstone of manifestly\n\narbitrary, need not detain us in light of the conclusion noted\n\nhitherto, keeping in mind the legislative history and the compelling\n\nnecessity to adopt strict regime for prohibiting “transfer” of foreign\n\ncontribution and insistence of “utilisation” thereof by the recipient\n\nhimself/itself.       For the same reasons, the dictum in Anuradha\n\nBhasin142 that the underlying consideration of appropriateness,\n\nnecessity and the least restrictive measure compliant law, will also\n\nbe of no avail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_257\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_258\">61. The argument that this Court in the case of INSAF143, while\n\ndealing with the provisions of the 1976 Act had recognised the\n\nabsolute right to receive foreign contribution is misplaced and\n\nmisreading of that decision. For<a href=\"/doc/156532/\" id=\"a_359\">, <a href=\"/doc/156532/\" id=\"a_360\">the said decision</a></a> examined the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">140</span>\n    supra at Footnote No.117\n141 supra at Footnote No.7\n142 supra at Footnote No.21 (paras 154-159)\n143 supra at Footnote No.22\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">\f                                   112</span>\n\narguments pursued before the Court in the context of challenge to\n\nthe validity of <a href=\"/doc/690691/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 5(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/87431489/\" id=\"a_362\">5(4)</a> of the 2010 Act and Rule 3(i), 3(v)\n\nand 3(vi) of the 2011 Rules as being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_363\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_364\">, 19(1)(a)</a><a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_365\">,\n\n19(1)(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_366\">21</a> of the Constitution. The provisions in Rule 3(v) and\n\n3(vi) were read down to mean that the expression “political interests”\n\noccurring therein be construed to mean that it would apply only to\n\nthose organisations which have connection with active politics or\n\ntake part in party politics. Strikingly, even in this decision the Court\n\nnoted the object sought to be achieved by the 2010 Act. To wit, to\n\nensure that Parliamentary institutions, political associations and\n\nacademic and other voluntary organisations as well as individuals\n\nworking in the important areas of national life should function in a\n\nmanner consistent with the values of a sovereign democratic\n\nrepublic without being influenced by foreign contributions or foreign\n\nhospitality. The Court went on to observe that long title of the Act\n\nmakes it clear that the regulation of acceptance and utilisation of\n\nforeign contribution is for the purpose of protecting “national\n\ninterests” and to prohibit organisations of a political nature from\n\nreceiving foreign contributions.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">\f                                  113</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_259\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_260\">62. That being the underlying purpose for which the Act has been\n\nenacted, whilst interpretating the amended provisions, we cannot be\n\noblivious to the concern expressed by the Parliament, about the state\n\nof affairs and the fallout of the implementation of the dispensation\n\nenunciated under the unamended Act. As the Parliament took a well\n\ninformed and conscious decision to alter that position — to make it\n\na strict regulatory regime of not permitting the recipient of foreign\n\ncontribution to transfer the funds to third party for the reasons\n\nweighed with it, it must follow that the provision is in the interests\n\nof the sovereignty and integrity of the country, public order and in\n\nthe interests of the general public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_261\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_262\">63. The question posed to us was: whether such restriction can be\n\nsaid to be reasonable restriction or impinges upon the right of any\n\nperson?   While examining the issue as to whether the amended\n\nprovision is a reasonable restriction, the Court cannot be oblivious\n\nto the concern of the Parliament/Legislature backed by the past\n\nexperiences including cancellation of registration of substantial\n\nnumber of registration certificates after due inquiry and for tangible\n\nreasons owing to abuse and misutilisation of foreign contribution\n\n(donation); and especially when receipt or acceptance of foreign\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">\f                                 114</span>\n\nexchange or be it foreign contribution, is otherwise understood to be\n\nordinarily prohibited.   For, the “foreign exchange” and more so\n\n“foreign contribution” can be received or brought within the territory\n\nof India only as per the dispensation provided for in the municipal\n\nlaw. There can be no absolute right in that regard. The fact that\n\ntransfer was permitted under the unamended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_367\">Section 7</a>, it does not\n\nfollow that the Parliament is not competent to amend that\n\ndispensation to make it more stringent, including to completely\n\nprohibit the inflow of foreign contribution. The amended provision\n\nis not to completely prohibit inflow of foreign contribution, but is a\n\nregulatory measure to permit acceptance by registered persons or\n\npersons having prior permission to do so with condition that they\n\nmust themselves utilise the entire contribution including for\n\nadministrative expenses within the limits provided under <a href=\"/doc/1717332/\" id=\"a_368\">Section 8</a>\n\nof the Act. The subject enactment is essentially conceived in the\n\ninterests of public order and also general public as the intent is to\n\nprevent misuse and misutilisation of foreign contribution coming\n\nfrom foreign sources to safeguard the values of a sovereign\n\ndemocratic republic.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">\f                                     115</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_263\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_264\">64. Thus understood, it is a reasonable restriction as it does not\n\nhinder with the right of forming associations as well as to engage in\n\nbusiness of charity.       Being a regulatory measure necessitated\n\nbecause of past experience and to uphold the intent of the Principal\n\nAct, insisting for utilisation, spending of foreign contribution by the\n\nrecipient   itself    cannot   be   said   to   be   irrational,   arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory, or unreasonable restriction as such.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_265\">65. The restriction or complete prohibition on transfer to third\n\nparty, by no standards deprive acceptance of foreign contribution\n\nand utilisation thereof in the manner permitted for definite\n\npurposes, such as cultural, economic, educational or social\n\nprogramme.       Such a provision must be understood as being\n\nprocedure established by law in the interests of the general public\n\nand in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of the country,\n\nincluding public order. Resultantly, there is no infraction even of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_369\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> or 19(1)(g) of the Constitution as urged by the writ\n\npetitioners before us, including <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_370\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_371\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.        Consistent with this view, we must reject the\n\nchallenge to the amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_372\">Section 7</a> on all counts.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">\f                                   116</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_266\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_267\">66. For the same reason, the argument of the writ petitioners about\n\nlack of rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the\n\nPrincipal Act much less the Amendment Act, must also fail. The\n\nrationale is of larger public interests and more particularly to obviate\n\nadverse impact on the economy, public order, sovereignty and\n\nintegrity of the country. Such amendment has been necessitated\n\nbecause of the past experience consequent to implementation of the\n\nunamended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_373\">Section 7</a> of the 2010 Act. It is so highlighted in the\n\nobjects and reasons and the introduction of the Amendment Act. It\n\ncan also be culled out from the debates in the Parliament whilst\n\nconsidering the Amendment Bill in the respective Houses.             To\n\novercome    the   mischief   and    to   enhance   transparency    and\n\naccountability regarding acceptance and also utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution which is quite substantial every financial year having\n\nproliferating effect on the economy of the nation, it had become\n\nnecessary to enact amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_374\">Section 7</a>. In other words, there is a\n\nclear rationale behind the amendment which is consistent with the\n\npurpose of the Principal Act and the object sought to be achieved\n\nunder the enactments. The fact that unamended provision was less\n\nrestrictive, cannot be the basis to test the constitutional validity of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">\f                                  117</span>\n\nthe provision on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_375\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> or 19(1)(g) or\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_376\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_377\">21</a> of the Constitution. The amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_378\">Section 7</a>,\n\nbeing plain and clear and having nexus with the object sought to be\n\nachieved and is necessitated because of sovereignty and integrity of\n\nIndia or security of the State, public order and in the interests of the\n\ngeneral public. It is unfathomable as to how the amended provision\n\ncan be regarded as unconstitutional on any parameter.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_268\">67. It is urged that Rule 24 of the 2011 Rules came to be deleted\n\nwith effect from 10.11.2020.       This rule enabled the registered\n\norganisations to transfer foreign contribution to any unregistered\n\nperson in the manner provided therein.          However, in light of\n\namendment to <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_379\">Section 7</a> prohibiting transfer of foreign contribution\n\nto any person, the need for the dispensation predicated in Rule 24\n\nhad become non-existent. In other words, as per amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_380\">Section\n\n7</a>, there is no need to continue Rule 24 on the statute book and its\n\ncontinuance for some time would also make no difference in the\n\nwake of express prohibition in amended <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_381\">Section 7</a> of the 2010 Act.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">\f                                 118</span>\n\nValidity of <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_382\">Section 12(1A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_383\">Section 17(1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_269\">68. <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_384\">Section 12(1A)</a> has been inserted by Act 33 of 2020, which\n\nenvisages that every person who makes an application under sub-\n\nSection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_385\">Section 12</a> is obliged/required to open FCRA account\n\nin the manner specified in <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_386\">Section 17</a> and mention details of such\n\naccount in his application. <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_387\">Section 17</a>, in particular sub-Section (1)\n\nas amended, mandates that every person who had been granted\n\ncertificate or prior permission under <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_388\">Section 12</a> shall receive foreign\n\ncontribution only in an account designated as FCRA account in the\n\nspecified bank. The unamended <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_389\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_390\">17</a> did not impose\n\nsuch restriction. Notably, as per the new regime foreign remittances\n\nare being received through SWIFT platform by international banking\n\nwherein certain mandatory fields are required to be captured apart\n\nfrom other details transaction wise. Further, foreign remittances do\n\nnot have structured framework, including disclosures regarding\n\npurposes.     All these deficiencies will stand resolved thereby\n\nenhancing the monitoring mechanism in real-time basis, remittance\n\nwise by adopting the new dispensation predicated in the amended\n\nprovisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_270\">69. Once again, the need to strictly regulate the inflow of foreign\n\nfunds and to oversee utilisation thereof for the purposes for which it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">\f                                 119</span>\n\nhas been received having been recognised and being the rationale\n\nbehind the Amendment Act, including owing to the experience\n\nregarding abuse of the regime under the unamended provision, the\n\nchallenge to such amendment cannot be taken forward.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_271\">70. There is force in the argument of the respondents that <a href=\"/doc/770600/\" id=\"a_391\">Section\n\n17</a> came to be amended aftermath realisation of clear and discernible\n\nlacunae had cropped in due to the presence of FCRA accounts of\n\nscores of registered organisations, in different scheduled banks\n\nacross the country. The challenge became more pronounced due to\n\ndoubling of foreign contribution inflow in the last decade which had\n\nimpacted the efficiency of monitoring and achieving the object of the\n\nPrincipal Act.   The amended provision now mandates that FCRA\n\naccounts of all the registered persons/organisations are required to\n\nbe opened in one particular branch in the country providing for\n\nessential information and fields, thereby ensuring a complete and\n\ntransparent check on the inflow and utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution towards a single point source on real-time basis.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_272\">71. The fact that earlier FCRA account could be opened in any\n\nscheduled bank, cannot preclude the Parliament from legislating a\n\nlaw which requires inflow of foreign contribution in some other\n\nmanner specified by law.       Merely because the framework of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">\f                                   120</span>\n\nacceptance of foreign contribution had been changed cannot be the\n\nbasis to question the validity of the amended provisions. Introducing\n\nchange for the betterment of governance is the prerogative and\n\nwisdom of the Parliament.      The FCRA account operators cannot\n\nclaim right of continuity of a deficient and flawed framework.\n\nOrdinarily, convenience of business and persons engaged in doing\n\nbusiness    must     be    uppermost      in    the    mind     of   the\n\nParliament/Legislature — to effectuate the goal of ease of doing\n\nbusiness. However, the strict regime had become essential because\n\nof the past experience of abuse and misutilisation of the “foreign\n\ncontribution” and cancellation of certificates of as many as 19,000\n\nregistered organisations on the ground of being grossly non-\n\ncompliant. Despite such cancellation of large number of certificates\n\nof registration, until December 2021 there were reportedly 22,762\n\nFCRA registered organisations presumably compliant with new\n\ndispensation.    Further, as many as 12,989 organisations have\n\napplied for the renewal of the FCRA licence between 30.09.2020 and\n\n31.12.2021. And as many as 5,789 organisations had not applied\n\nfor renewal of FCRA licence, whose FCRA licence has ceased to be\n\nvalid. A fortiori, it would certainly justify the need to have a holistic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">\f                                            121</span>\n\napproach to ensure that the objective of the Principal Act is fulfilled,\n\nnamely, of strict regulation of the inflow and utilisation of foreign\n\ncontribution for the purposes for which it is so permitted, such as\n\nonly cultural, economic, educational or social programme.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80568969\" id=\"span_218\">72. In fact, the Parliament must be credited with for having taken\n\nrecourse to corrective dispensation for eradicating the mischief,\n\nwhich any sovereign country can ill-afford.         The Parliament is\n\nsupreme and has a final say in matters of legislation when it reflects\n\non alternatives and choices with inputs from different quarters, with\n\na check in the form of democratic accountability and a further check\n\nby the Courts which exercise the power of judicial review144. We find\n\nforce in the argument that it had become necessary for the\n\nParliament to step in and provide a stringent regime for effectively\n\nregulating the inflow and utilisation of foreign contribution. Hence,\n\nthere had been legitimate goal for amending the subject provisions\n\nof acceptance of funds through one channel. Concededly, despite\n\nthe requirement of opening FCRA account in the designated bank, it\n\nis open to the organisation to utilise the amount so received in the\n\n\n\n144   <a href=\"/doc/80568969/\" id=\"a_392\">Dr. Ashwani Kumar</a> (supra at Footnote No.47)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">\f                                             122</span>\n\nFCRA account through multiple accounts in the scheduled\n\nbranches.

A priori, opening of main FCRA account in the designated bank\n\nas per the law made by the Parliament in that regard, cannot be\n\nbrushed aside on the specious argument of some inconvenience\n\nbeing caused to the registered associations145. Assuming that some\n\ninconvenience is likely to be caused to few applicants, but the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute cannot be assailed on the basis of\n\nfortuitous circumstances and more so when it being only a one-time\n\nexercise to ensure inflow of foreign contribution through one channel\n\nonly, being a precondition for grant of permission.                          There is no\n\nrestriction regarding utilisation of the funds only through that\n\n(primary) FCRA account.

Such persons are a separate\n\nclass and engage in specified activity.      It cannot be a usual or\n\nordinary business for everyone and anyone wanting to accept foreign\n\ncontribution. Permitting inflow of foreign contribution, which is a\n\ndonation, is a matter of policy of the State backed by law. In this\n\ncase, it is governed by the 2010 Act as amended. It is open to the\n\nState to have a regime which may completely prohibit receipt of\n\nforeign donation, as no right inheres in the citizen to receive foreign\n\ncontribution (donation).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_277\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_278\">75. The provision such as <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_397\">Section 12(1A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_398\">Section 17(1)</a>\n\nintroduced by the Amendment Act, is a holistic approach adopted by\n\nthe Parliament to provide for strict regulatory measure and for\n\nensuring transparency and accountability in the matter of foreign\n\ncontribution. Notably, there was unanimity amongst the members\n\nof both the Houses cutting across party lines to have such a strict\n\nregime as indiscriminate receipt/inflow and more so utilisation of\n\nforeign contribution had been threatening the sovereignty and\n\nintegrity of the country itself. Being a matter of security of the State,\n\npublic order and in the interests of the general public, it is not open\n\nto question the validity of such a law on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_399\">Article\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">\f                                 124</span>\n\n19(1)(c)</a> or 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.   It is not a provision to\n\ncompletely prohibit forming of the associations or engaging in\n\nbusiness of charity as such.    It is a provision for regulating the\n\nmanner of doing business more importantly, concerning foreign\n\ncontribution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_279\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_280\">76. Opening of main FCRA account in the designated bank, as has\n\nbeen rightly contended by the respondents, is only a one-time\n\nexercise and for which instructions and protocols have been issued\n\nby the competent authority, not to insist for physical presence for\n\ncomplying with the formalities. It can be organised even at the local\n\nbranches of the designated bank in the manner specified in the\n\ninstructions issued in that regard. Moreover, the provision does not\n\nprohibit the person/registered association from opening multiple\n\naccounts in other scheduled banks, wherein the amount received in\n\n(primary) FCRA account in NDMB can be transferred; and from\n\nwhere day-to-day activities can be then carried on by them. In any\n\ncase, the designated bank being conscious of its banking obligations\n\nand to provide best services to the registered associations, have\n\nissued instructions (Standard Operating Procedure) for making it\n\nconvenient to open FCRA account in NDMB as also to operate the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_223\">\f                                  125</span>\n\nforeign contribution received in such an account.       If any further\n\nimprovement in the operational convenience is required, it is open\n\nto the petitioners and all other interested persons to request the\n\ndesignated bank to improve upon such facility. However, merely\n\nbecause the registered association has been compelled to open FCRA\n\naccount in the designated bank at the centralised location for\n\nreceipt/inflow of foreign contribution from foreign source, it does not\n\nfollow that such a requirement would be manifestly arbitrary or\n\nunreasonable. It is only a one-time exercise to be complied with for\n\navailing the permission accorded by the Central Government under\n\nthe Act to be a certified association or person given permission to\n\nreceive foreign contribution as a precondition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_281\">77. The need to have only one entry point for the inflow of foreign\n\ncontribution had been viewed by the Parliament as the best option\n\nfor regulating the inflow of foreign contribution.    This process is\n\nexpected to increase the efficiency in continual supervision of the\n\ninflow of foreign contribution on real-time basis by the concerned\n\nAuthorities and to enable them to take immediate corrective\n\nmeasures to deal with and pre-empt the impending threat perceived\n\nbecause of its volume including undesirable source of remittance. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">\f                                 126</span>\n\nis not open to the Court to have a second-guess approach in that\n\nregard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_282\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_283\">78. In the context of the law made by the Parliament in the\n\ninterests of the sovereignty and integrity of the country and security\n\nof the State, public order, as also in the interests of the general\n\npublic, such a provision cannot be lightly viewed much less on the\n\nspecious plea of manifestly arbitrary. The Parliament in its wisdom\n\nhad deemed it essential to have such a provision because of the\n\nprevalent discernible circumstances referred to in the introduction\n\nof the Bill.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_284\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_285\">79. It was vehemently urged that there is lack of infrastructure at\n\nthe designated bank and that the bank branch is manned only by\n\n40 odd personnel.    To buttress this plea, reference is made to the\n\nobservation made by the Reserve Bank of India — that voluminous\n\ndata on Foreign Remittances will put an extra financial burden on\n\nthe Bank and increase its costs including divert focus on monitoring\n\nof suspicious transactions. This argument does not commend to us\n\nat all.   In digital banking operations, it is not the head count\n\ndispensing physical services that would matter, but the effectiveness\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">\f                                     127</span>\n\nof the software is important. We are also not impressed by the plea\n\nthat for organisations located in remote parts of the country, there\n\nwould be impediments and for that reason, <a href=\"/doc/1653135/\" id=\"a_400\">Section 7</a> violates test of\n\nfairness and reasonableness. In any case, respondent No.3 (SBI) has\n\non affidavit explained as to the extent of measures taken for ensuring\n\nefficient    servicing   of   FCRA   accounts   of   all   the   registered\n\nassociations/account holders. Respondent No.3 has also assured\n\nthat if need arises, suitable corrective measures including to\n\nupgrade the facilities/services would be taken at its end. Suffice it\n\nto observe that the argument under consideration cannot be the\n\nbasis to doubt the constitutional validity of the provisions in the form\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/66886089/\" id=\"a_401\">Section 12(1A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153361834/\" id=\"a_402\">Section 17(1)</a>, as amended vide the\n\nAmendment Act. Needless to underscore that respondent No.3 has\n\nstated on affidavit before this Court that FCRA accounts opened in\n\nits designated branch can be operated online on real-time basis\n\nwithout the need for physical presence of the account holder or its\n\nofficials.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_286\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_287\">80. Having noted that the provision became necessary for efficient\n\nregulation of foreign contribution on real-time basis, it can neither\n\nbe said to be manifestly arbitrary nor irrational much less without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">\f                                  128</span>\n\nlegitimate objective of the State. Accordingly, we have no hesitation\n\nin negating the challenge to these provisions as being violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_403\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_404\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_405\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_288\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_289\">81. The fact that the registered associations were already\n\ncomplying with the statutory formalities of furnishing of accounts,\n\nintimation, audit and disposal of assets to the satisfaction of the\n\nconcerned    Authorities,    it   would    not    follow   that   the\n\nParliament/Legislature is denuded of its power of changing the\n\nregulatory mechanism or framework to make it more effective and to\n\nmake it real-time regarding the inflow or receipt of foreign\n\ncontribution and utilisation thereof for the purposes for which it has\n\nbeen so permitted.     Accepting the argument of the registered\n\nassociations would not only be undermining the legislative intent,\n\nbut also disregarding the object sought to be achieved by the\n\nPrincipal Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_290\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_291\">82. The argument of compelling necessity may have arisen for our\n\nconsideration only if we were to find that the dispensation provided\n\nin the amended provisions is in the nature of complete prohibition\n\nto form association or to engage in business. As mentioned earlier,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_227\">\f                                 129</span>\n\nthese provisions are only for effective regulatory measures\n\nconcerning and limited to foreign contribution, in the larger public\n\ninterests, public order, and more particularly for safeguarding the\n\nsovereignty and integrity of the country.    Taking any other view\n\nwould entail in undermining the legislative intent and cannot be\n\ncountenanced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_292\">\nValidity of <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_406\">Section 12A</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_293\">83. Reverting to the challenge to the insertion of <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_407\">Section 12A</a> vide\n\nthe Amendment Act of 2020, it mandates that the person concerned\n\nwho seeks prior permission or prior approval under <a href=\"/doc/1100836/\" id=\"a_408\">Section 11</a>, or\n\nmakes an application for grant of certificate under <a href=\"/doc/196724/\" id=\"a_409\">Section 12</a>,\n\nincluding for renewal of certificate under <a href=\"/doc/352973/\" id=\"a_410\">Section 16</a>, to provide as\n\nidentification document, the Aadhaar number of all its office bearers\n\nor Directors or other key functionaries. The Statement of Objects\n\nand Reasons of the Amendment Act are testimony about the past\n\nexperience of abuse of foreign contribution receipts and spending on\n\nactivities not connected with the purposes for which it was so\n\npermitted. It had been noticed that the inflow of foreign contribution\n\nhad almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019 and many of\n\nthe registered associations had failed to comply with basic statutory\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_228\">\f                                   130</span>\n\nformalities necessitating cancellation of certificates of registration of\n\nmore than 19,000 registered organisations.        This is a staggering\n\n(substantial) number indicative of gross violations by large number\n\nof registered associations.    More so, this amendment had been\n\nnecessitated to safeguard the sovereignty and integrity of the\n\ncountry, and public order, including in the interests of the security\n\nof the State and of the general public.      It is a law made by the\n\nParliament which is competent to make such a law concerning the\n\nactivities related to foreign donations and more particularly about\n\nits acceptance in prescribed manner and utilisation for the purposes\n\ndefined in the certificate/permission granted by the competent\n\nauthority.   It has a legitimate purpose and nexus sought to be\n\nachieved with the objective underlying the Principal Act and the\n\nsubject amendment.       It is not open to argue that associations\n\ndesirous of obtaining certificate of registration under this Act need\n\nnot furnish official identification document pertaining to its key\n\nfunctionaries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_294\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_295\">84. Regardless of the above, the provision (<a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_411\">Section 12A</a>) envisages\n\nthat a copy of the Passport can also be provided as identification\n\ndocument of all its office bearers or Directors or other key\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">\f                                   131</span>\n\nfunctionaries or Overseas Citizen of India Card, in case of a\n\nforeigner.   The underlying purpose of this provision is merely to\n\nidentify the key functionaries of the registered association so that\n\nthey can be made accountable for violations, if any. We are of the\n\nview that as the Passport in case of a foreigner is accepted as\n\nsufficient identification document, there is no reason why such\n\nPassport of Indian national cannot be relied upon for the same\n\npurpose. Thus understood, the challenge to this provision being\n\nunreasonable need not detain us nor is required to be taken any\n\nfurther. Whereas, we hold that the provision needs to be construed\n\nas permitting furnishing of the Indian Passport of the key\n\nfunctionaries of the applicant who are Indian nationals, for the\n\npurpose of their identification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_296\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_297\">85. Having said this, it is not necessary to dilate on other\n\narguments pressed into service dealing with matters of privacy or\n\nthe provisions under consideration being manifestly arbitrary.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_298\">86. For the view that we have taken, we do not wish to dilate on\n\nevery single authority cited across the Bar as the view taken by us\n\nis in no way different than the principle expounded therein.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">\f                                  132</span>\n\nConclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_299\">87.

As regards <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_416\">Section 12A</a>, we have read down the said\n\nprovision and construed it as permitting the key functionaries/office\n\nbearers of the applicant (associations/NGOs) who are Indian\n\nnationals, to produce Indian Passport for the purpose of their\n\nidentification. That shall be regarded as substantial compliance of\n\nthe mandate in <a href=\"/doc/72682668/\" id=\"a_417\">Section 12A</a> concerning identification.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_300\">88.
