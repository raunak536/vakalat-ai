On 09.09.2020,\nduring early hours i.e. at 5:00 A.M, while the respondent along\nwith his staff and mediators were inspecting the vehicles near\nAppapuram canal situated on the main road of Chebrole Village,\nGuntur District, they found two lorries bearing Nos. AP 07 TH\n1278 and AP 07 TJ 2339 loaded with Public Distribution System\n(PDS) Rice meant for public distribution by the Government. When\nthe respondent/authorities stopped the said lorries and enquired,\nconcerned lorry drivers and cleaners about the illegal\ntransportation of PDS rice. On enquiry, Accused Nos. 1 to 4 replied\nthat the owners of Sri Venkata Shiva Rice Traders Mill and MSR\nRice Mill have loaded the said rice bags and offered higher pay for\nits transportation from Ponnuru to Kakinada. The said rice bags\nwere seized under the cover of mediator&#x27;s report, registered a crime\n\nagainst the petitioners and other lorry drivers and cleaners, issued\n\nFirst Information Report.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">ASHE een\n\nsomaxnarsteen&#x27;\n \n\nMSMJ\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">CriP No.4033 of 2020</span>\n\nThe main contention of the petitioners is that, the petitioners\nare innocent of any offence and that they possessed valid permits\nfor transportation of rice, being rice mill owners. Further, Accused\nNo.7 has got valid licence for his two lorries, but based on the false\nconfession of co-accused Nos. 1 to 4, the police falsely implicated\n\nthese petitioners without verifying the records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">_The petitioners are not having any criminal background and\nthey are ready to produce the valid permits for transportation of\nrice etc and coming to conclusion even without examining the rice\nfound in the lorries to determine whether it is a PDS rice or not,\nthe police registered crime erroneously and requested to grant pre-\narrest bail to these petitioners, as there is every possibility of arrest\n\nof these petitioners in connection with the above crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">During hearing, Sri P.S.P.

Act, on the ground that the rice being transported in two\nlorries is PDS rice. Normally, it is difficult for any ordinary person\nto decide whether the rice is PDS rice or rice being sold in open\nmarket, at a glance. But, the police for one reason or the other,\nregistered crime even before sending the samples of the stocks to\nthe concerned authority i.e. Food Corporation of India for physical\n\nand chemical analysis, to determine whether the rice seized while\n\n \n \n\n \n\nMSM,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CriP No.4033 of 2020</span>\n\ntransporting the same is PDS rice or rice being sold in general or\nnot.
