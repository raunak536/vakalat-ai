SIKRI, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1.    This Intra-Court appeal impugns the order dated 27th January, 2012 of\nthe learned Single Judge dismissing W.P.(C) No. 554/2012 preferred by the\nappellant. The said writ petition was preferred assailing the order dated 14 th\nSeptember, 2011 of the Central Information Commission (CIC) dismissing\nthe appeal preferred by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The appellant had sought the following information under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">Right\nto Information Act, 2005</a> with respect to his father-in-law:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      a.     Name of the Office/Battalion/Regiment from where he retired?\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">      b.     On which date he was retired?\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">LPA No.253/2012                                                   Page 1 of 6</span>\n       c.     What is his pension?\n\n      d.     As per records, of which caste he belongs?\n\n      e.     Please provide me the photocopy of his caste certificate?\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">3.    At this stage, it may be stated that there are disputes between the\nappellant and his wife.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">4.    The Central Public Information Officer (PIO) vide order dated 3 rd\nDecember, 2010 informed the appellant that the information sought was a\nthird party personal information, disclosure whereof was likely to cause\nundue invasion into the privacy of the individual concerned and the\ninformation also did not serve any public activity or interest and was\ntherefore exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the Act. The\nappellant was further informed that the information could be provided to the\nappellant subject to consent of third party i.e. his father-in-law and after\nfollowing the procedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 11(1)</a> of the Act. The\nappellant was thus requested to provide postal address of his father-in-law,\nfor the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 11(1)</a> to be followed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">5.    The appellant however instead of providing address of his father-in-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">law, preferred an appeal. The said appeal was dismissed vide order dated\n18th January, 2011 directing third party procedure under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 11(1)</a> to be\nfollowed, upon compliance by the appellant of the requisite formalities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">6.    The appellant however was not wanting the said third party procedure\nto be followed and wanted the information, though pertaining to his father-\nin-law, but without his father-in-law having any chance to object to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">LPA No.253/2012                                                 Page 2 of 6</span>\n disclosure of the said information. The appellant with the said intent\npreferred the second appeal to the CIC. The CIC however dismissed the said\nappeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">7.    The learned Single Judge has dismissed the writ petition observing\nthat the information sought was of personal nature and the appellant was\nunable to disclose any public interest in the disclosure thereof and disclosure\nof information sought by the appellant was to wreck vengeance on account\nof his matrimonial dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">8.    The counsel for the appellant before us has argued that the learned\nSingle Judge has erred in observing that there was no public interest in the\ndisclosure sought by the appellant. It is argued that the same is irrelevant\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">9.    What we find in the present case is that the PIO had not refused the\ninformation. All that the PIO required the appellant to do was, to follow\nthird party procedure. No error can be found in the said reasoning of the\nPIO. Under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the Act, the PIO if called upon to disclose any\ninformation relating to or supplied by a third party and which is to be treated\nas confidential, is required to give a notice to such third party and is to give\nan opportunity to such third party to object to such disclosure and to take a\ndecision only thereafter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">10.   There can be no dispute that the information sought by the appellant\nwas relating to a third party and supplied by a third party. We may highlight\nthat the appellant also wanted to know the caste as disclosed by his father-\nin-law in his service record. The PIO was thus absolutely right in, response\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">LPA No.253/2012                                                   Page 3 of 6</span>\n to the application for information of the appellant, calling upon the appellant\nto follow the third party procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11</a>. Reliance by the PIO on\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> which exempts from disclosure of personal information and\nthe disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest\nand which would cause unwanted invasion of the privacy of the individual\nwas also apposite. Our constitutional aim is for a casteless society and it\ncan safely be assumed that the disclosure made by a person of his or her\ncaste is intended by such person to be kept confidential. The appellant\nhowever as aforesaid, wanted to steal a march over his father-in-law by\naccessing information, though relating to and supplied by the father-in-law,\nwithout allowing his father-in-law to oppose to such request.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"109068313\" id=\"span_4\">11.

It was further\nheld that when any personal information sought has no nexus with any\npublic activity or interest, the same is not to be provided. Finding the\ninformation sought <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_15\">in that case</a> to be even remotely having no relationship\nwith any public activity or interest and rather being a direct invasion in\nprivate life of another, information was denied.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_7\">The full bench of this Court\nalso in Secretary General, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_16\">India Vs.

It was further observed that personal information including tax\nreturns, medical records etc. cannot be disclosed unless the bar against\ndisclosure is lifted by establishing sufficient public interest in disclosure and\ndisclosure even then can be made only after duly notifying the third party\nand after considering his views. It was yet further held that the nature of\nrestriction on right to privacy is of different order; in the case of private\nindividuals, the degree of protection afforded is greater; in the case of public\nservants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending upon what is at\nstake; this is so because a public servant is expected to act for public good in\nthe discharge of his duties and is accountable for them.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_9\">This Court in <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_18\">Vijay\nPrakash Vs.

Ghosh\nVs. Ex. Joseph MANU/SC/0362/1962 it was held that an individual does\nnot forfeit his fundamental rights by becoming a public servant; that a\ndistinction has to be drawn between official information and private\ninformation and private details of date of birth, Personal Identification\nNumber etc. are to be disclosed only if such disclosure is necessary for\nproviding knowledge of proper performance of the duties and tasks assigned\nto the public servant; not finding any public interest in the disclosure of\ninformation sought, the order of the CIC denying the information was\nupheld.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">LPA No.253/2012                                                    Page 5 of 6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\"> 12.
