The Maharashtra State Legislature enacted a State legislation under the\n\n   name of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_24\">Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999</a> which\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    5</span>\n\fcame into force on 24th February, 1999.    The Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons for enacting the said Act reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">   &quot;Organised crime has for quite some years now come up as a\n   very serious threat to our society. It knows no national\n   boundaries and is fueled by illegal wealth generated by contract\n   killings, extortion, smuggling in contrabands, illegal trade in\n   narcotics, kidnapping for ransom, collection of protection\n   money and money laundering, etc. The illegal wealth and\n   black money generated by the organised crime is very huge and\n   has serious adverse effect on our economy. It is seen that the\n   organised criminal syndicates make a common cause with\n   terrorist gangs and foster narco terrorism which extend beyond\n   the national boundaries. There is reason to believe that\n   organised criminal gangs are operating in the State and thus,\n   there is immediate need to curb their activities.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">   It is also noticed that the organised criminals make extensive\n   use of wire and oral communications in their criminal\n   activities. The interception of such communications to obtain\n   evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their\n   commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the\n   administration of justice.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">   2.     The existing legal framework i.e. the penal and\n   procedural laws and the adjudicatory system are found to be\n   rather inadequate to curb or control the menace of organised\n   crime. Government has, therefore, decided to enact a special\n   law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain\n   circumstances power to intercept wire, electronic or oral\n   communication to control the menace of the organised crime.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\f      According to its preamble, the said Act was enacted to make specific\n\nprovisions for prevention and control of, and for coping with, criminal\n\nactivity by organised crime syndicate or gang and for matters connected\n\ntherewith or incidental thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">8. <a href=\"/doc/1171238/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 2</a> of the MCOCA contains the definitions.

Since such issues were not specifically\n\n   raised by filing an appeal and since only a passing reference is made on\n\n   the said issue in the short three page affidavit filed by the respondent No.\n\n   3, it is not necessary for us to examine the said issue as it was sought to\n\n   be raised more specifically in the argument stage only.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">19.Even otherwise when the said definitions as existing in <a href=\"/doc/1171238/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 2 (d)</a>, (e)\n\n   and (f) of the MCOCA are read and understood with the object and\n\n   purpose of the Act which is to make special provisions for prevention\n\n   and control of organised crime it is clear that they are worded to\n\n   subserve and achieve the said object and purpose of the Act.

It is\n\na well settled position of law insofar as criminal law is concerned that in\n\nsuch provisions mens rea is always presumed as integral part of penal\n\noffence or section unless it is specifically and expressly or by necessary\n\nintendment excluded by the legislature.

Bihar Distillaries Limited reported in (1997) 2 SCC\n\n453, about the nature of approach which the court should adopt while\n\nexamining the constitutional validity of a provision (vide para 85) :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">   &quot;The approach of the court, while examining the challenge to\n   the constitutionality of an enactment, is to start with the\n   presumption of constitutionality. The court should try to\n   sustain its validity to the extent possible. It should strike down\n   the enactment only when it is not possible to sustain it. The\n   court should not approach the enactment with a view to pick\n   holes or to search for defects of drafting, much less\n   inexactitude of language employed. Indeed, any such defects of\n   drafting should be ignored out as part of the attempt to sustain\n   the validity/ constitutionality of the enactment. After all, an Act\n   made by the legislature represents the will of the people and\n   that cannot be lightly interfered with. The unconstitutionality\n   must be plainly and clearly established before an enactment is\n   declared as void. The same approach holds good while\n   ascertaining the intent and purpose of an enactment or its scope\n   and application.......&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">   &quot;The court must recognise the fundamental nature and\n   importance of legislative process and accord due regard and\n   deference to it, just as the legislature and the executive are\n   expected to show due regard and deference to the judiciary. It\n   cannot also be forgotten that our Constitution recognises and\n   gives effect to the concept of equality between the three wings\n   of the State and the concept of `checks and balances&#x27; inherent\n   in such scheme.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                  24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\f28.One of the proven methods of examining the legislative competence of\n\n  an enactment is by the application of doctrine of pith and substance. This\n\n  doctrine is applied when the legislative competence of the legislature\n\n  with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the\n\n  entries in various lists. If there is a challenge to the legislative\n\n  competence the courts will try to ascertain the pith and substance of such\n\n  enactment on a scrutiny of the Act in question. In this process, it is\n\n  necessary for the courts to go into and examine the true character of the\n\n  enactment, its object, its scope and effect to find out whether the\n\n  enactment in question is genuinely referable to the field of legislation\n\n  allotted to the respective Legislature under the constitutional scheme.\n\n  The said doctrine has come to be established in India and is recognized\n\n  in various pronouncements of this Court as also of the High Courts.\n\n  Where a challenge is made to the constitutional validity of a particular\n\n  State Act with reference to a subject mentioned in any entry in List I, the\n\n  court has to look to the substance of the State Act and on such analysis\n\n  and examination, if it is found that in the pith and substance, it falls\n\n  under an entry in the State List but there is only an incidental\n\n  encroachment on topics in the Union List, the State Act would not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                   25</span>\n\f   become invalid merely because there is incidental encroachment on any\n\n   of the topics in the Union List.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1057797\" id=\"span_31\">29.A five Judges&#x27; Bench of this court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1057797/\" id=\"a_96\">A.S.

It is of the essence of such a\n      Constitution that there should be a distribution of the\n      legislative powers of the Federation between the Centre and the\n      Provinces. The scheme of distribution has varied with different\n      Constitutions, but even when the Constitution enumerates\n      elaborately the topics on which the Centre and the States could\n      legislate, some overlapping of the fields of legislation is\n      inevitable. The British North America Act, 1867, which\n      established a federal Constitution for Canada, enumerated in\n      Sections 91 and 92 the topics on which the Dominion and the\n      Provinces could respectively legislate. Notwithstanding that the\n      lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive, it\n      was not long before it was found that the topics enumerated in\n      the two sections overlapped, and the Privy Council had time\n      and again to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the\n      Dominion and Provincial legislatures. It was in this situation\n      that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine, that for deciding\n      whether an impugned legislation was intra vires, regard must\n      be had to its pith and substance. That is to say, if a statute is\n      found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of\n      the legislature, it should be held to be intra vires, even though\n      it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative\n      competence. The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond\n      its competence may be an element in determining whether the\n      legislation is colourable, that is, whether in the guise of making\n      a law on a matter within it competence, the legislature is, in\n      truth, making a law on a subject beyond its competence. But\n      where that is not the position, then the fact of encroachment\n      does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of\n      encroachment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                      26</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\f            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_33\">Again a five Judges&#x27; bench of this court while discussing the said\n\ndoctrine in <a href=\"/doc/1813801/\" id=\"a_97\">Kartar Singh v.

It is likely to happen from time to time that enactment\n     though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also\n     on a subject in another list and prima facie looks as if one\n     legislature is impinging on the legislative field of another\n     legislature. This may result in a large number of statutes being\n     declared unconstitutional because the legislature enacting law\n     may appear to have legislated in a field reserved for the other\n     legislature. To examine whether a legislation has impinged on\n     the field of other legislatures, in fact or in substance, or is\n     incidental, keeping in view the true nature of the enactment, the\n     courts have evolved the doctrine of &quot;pith and substance&quot; for the\n     purpose of determining whether it is legislation with respect to\n     matters in one list or the other. Where the question for\n     determination is whether a particular law relates to a particular\n     subject mentioned in one list or the other, the courts look into\n     the substance of the enactment. Thus, if the substance of the\n     enactment falls within the Union List then the incidental\n     encroachment by the enactment on the State List would not\n     make it invalid. This principle came to be established by the\n     Privy Council when it determined appeals from Canada or\n     Australia involving the question of legislative competence of\n     the federation or the States in those countries. This doctrine\n     came to be established in India and derives its genesis from the\n     approach adopted by the courts including the Privy Council in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                    28</span>\n\f      dealing with controversies arising in other federations.

In other\n\n   words, the question of repugnancy arises only in connection with\n\n   subjects enumerated in Concurrent List. In such situation the provisions\n\n   enacted by Parliament and State Legislature cannot unitedly stand and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                    29</span>\n\f   the State law will have to make the way for the Union Law. Once it is\n\n   proved and established that the State law is repugnant to the Union law,\n\n   the State law would become void but only to the extent of repugnancy.\n\n   At the same time it is to be noted that mere possibility of repugnancy\n\n   will not make a State law invalid, for repugnancy has to exist in fact and\n\n   it must be shown clearly and sufficiently that State law is repugnant to\n\n   Union law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">33.In the background of the aforesaid legal position we may now proceed to\n\n   examine the question of competence of the State Legislature to enact a\n\n   law of the nature of MCOCA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">34.

Interception of wire, electronic\n\n   and oral communication with the said intent in case of urgency is also\n\n   permitted under the State Act in which case it is to be approved by an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                    30</span>\n\f  officer not below the rank of Additional Director General of Police\n\n  within 48 hours of occurrence of interception.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">35.The provisions of the MCOCA when read with the Statement of Objects\n\n  and Reasons, which are already dealt with and referred to hereinbefore,\n\n  would make it apparent and establish that the grounds for interception of\n\n  the communication under MCOCA are distinct and different from the\n\n  ground covered by <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act. A comparative\n\n  reading of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_104\">Telegraph Act</a> as also of the MCOCA\n\n  would establish that both the Acts deal with the subjects and areas which\n\n  cannot be said to be identical and common.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">36.In paragraph 48 of the impugned judgment, the High Court has\n\n  reproduced a comparative chart, which was filed before the High court\n\n  by the respondents herein, to show that MCOCA had made inroads on\n\n  the legislative power of the Parliament. Our attention was also drawn to\n\n  the said chart and we find that the conclusion of the High Court that\n\n  there is repugnancy in view of the statutory provisions contained therein\n\n  do not appear to be sound. The High Court has recorded that under the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                   31</span>\n\fCentral Law the communication can be intercepted only if there was\n\npublic emergency and interest of public safety was involved. The High\n\nCourt did not find any such provision in MCOCA because the grounds\n\nfor interception in the State law are totally different from the grounds\n\ncovered under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_105\">Telegraph Act</a>. State law authorizes interception only\n\nif it is intended to prevent the commission of an organized crime and/or\n\nif it is intended to collect evidence of such organized crime. The High\n\nCourt thereafter proceeded to compare Rule 419A (1) and (5) of the\n\nTelegraph Rules with <a href=\"/doc/1517150/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 14(4)</a>, (8) and (10) of MCOCA. On the\n\nbasis of the aforesaid comparison it cannot be held that MCOCA had\n\nencroached upon the legislative power of the Parliament. The proviso to\n\nRule 419A(1) deals with cases of emergency and provides that in cases\n\nof emergency the communication may be intercepted without the prior\n\napproval of the competent authority and the approval may be obtained\n\nwithin a period of 15 days. It was held by the High Court that no time\n\nlimit is provided under <a href=\"/doc/1517150/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 14(4)</a> of the Act. But, the said finding\n\nappears to be erroneous as <a href=\"/doc/1517150/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 14(10)</a> and (11) deal with emergency\n\nsituations and provide appropriate safeguards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                32</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\f37.It is now well settled that though the Statement of Objects and Reasons\n\n   accompanying a legislative Bill cannot be used to determine the true\n\n   meaning and effect of the substantive provisions of a statute, but it is\n\n   permissible to refer to the Statement of Objects and Reasons\n\n   accompanying a Bill for the purpose of understanding the background,\n\n   the antecedent state of affairs, the surrounding circumstances in relation\n\n   to the statute, and the evil which the statute sought to remedy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"101278772\" id=\"span_44\">In this\n\n   regard we may refer to the majority view (6:1) in the case of <a href=\"/doc/101278772/\" id=\"a_109\">Gujarat v.\n\n   Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat</a>, reported in (2005) 8 SCC 534,\n\n   wherein it was observed as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      &quot;Question 4.

The\n      telephonic conversation of an innocent citizen will be protected\n      by Courts against wrongful or highhanded interference by\n      tapping the conversation. The protection is not for the guilty\n      citizen against the efforts of the police to vindicate the law and\n      prevent corruption of public servants. It must not be understood\n      that the Courts will tolerate safeguards for the protection of the\n      citizen to be imperilled by permitting the police to proceed by\n      unlawful or irregular methods. In the present case there is no\n      unlawful or even irregular method in obtaining the tape-\n      recording of the conversation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"25310\" id=\"span_55\">43.The question posed above was considered again in detail by this Court in\n\n   the case of <a href=\"/doc/25310/\" id=\"a_126\">People&#x27;s Union</a> (supra), wherein it was held as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      &quot;17.

Once the facts\n      in a given case constitute a right to privacy, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 21</a> is\n      attracted. The said right cannot be curtailed &quot;except according\n      to procedure established by law&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">      18. The right to privacy -- by itself -- has not been identified\n      under the Constitution. As a concept it may be too broad and\n      moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy can\n      be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend\n      on the facts of the said case. But the right to hold a telephone\n      conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office without\n      interference can certainly be claimed as &quot;right to privacy&quot;.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                    38</span>\n\f      Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate and\n      confidential character. Telephone conversation is a part of\n      modern man&#x27;s life. It is considered so important that more and\n      more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their\n      pockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a\n      man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would certainly include\n      telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office.\n      Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 21</a> of the\n      Constitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure\n      established by law.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">44.The interception of conversation though constitutes an invasion of an\n\n   individual right to privacy but the said right can be curtailed in\n\n   accordance to procedure validly established by law. Thus what the Court\n\n   is required to see is that the procedure itself must be fair, just and\n\n   reasonable and non arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">45.The object of the MCOCA is to prevent the organised crime and a\n\n   perusal of the provisions of Act under challenge would indicate that the\n\n   said law authorizes the interception of wire, electronic or oral\n\n   communication only if it is intended to prevent the commission of an\n\n   organised crime or if it is intended to collect the evidence to the\n\n   commission of such an organized crime. The procedures authorizing\n\n   such interception are also provided therein with enough procedural safe\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                    39</span>\n\f   guards, some of which are indicated and discussed hereinbefore. In\n\n   addition under <a href=\"/doc/100648/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 16</a> of the MCOCA, provision for prohibiting and\n\n   punishing the unauthorized user of information acquired by interception\n\n   of wire, electronic or oral communication has been made. Thus as the\n\n   Act under challenge contains sufficient safeguards and also satisfies the\n\n   aforementioned mandate the contention of the respondents that\n\n   provisions of <a href=\"/doc/537666/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 13</a> to <a href=\"/doc/100648/\" id=\"a_132\">16</a> are violative of the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n   Constitution cannot also be accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">46.Having recorded our finding in the aforesaid manner, we now proceed to\n\n   decide the issue as to whether a person accused of an offence under\n\n   MCOCA should be denied bail if on the date of the offence he is on bail\n\n   for an offence under MCOCA or any other Act. <a href=\"/doc/1871937/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 21 (5)</a> of\n\n   MCOCA reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      &quot;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, the accused\n      shall not be granted bail if it is noticed by the Court that he was\n      on bail in an offence under this Act, or under any other Act, on\n      the date of the offence in question&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">47.As discussed above the object of the MCOCA is to prevent the organised\n\n   crime and, therefore, there could be reason to deny consideration of grant\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                     40</span>\n\f  of bail if one has committed a similar offence once again after being\n\n  released on bail but the same consideration cannot be extended to a\n\n  person who commits an offence under some other Act, for commission\n\n  of an offence under some other act would not be in any case in\n\n  consonance with the object of the act which is enacted in order to\n\n  prevent only organised crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">48.We consider that a person who is on bail after being arrested for\n\n  violation of law unconnected with MCOCA, should not be denied his\n\n  right to seek bail if he is arrested under the MCOCA, for it cannot be\n\n  said that he is a habitual offender. The provision of denying his right to\n\n  seek bail, if he was arrested earlier and was on bail for commission of an\n\n  offence under any other Act, suffers from the vice of unreasonable\n\n  classification by placing in the same class, offences which may have\n\n  nothing in common with those under MCOCA, for the purpose of\n\n  denying consideration of bail. The aforesaid expression and restriction\n\n  on the right of seeking bail is not even in consonance with the object\n\n  sought to be achieved by the Act and, therefore, on the face of the\n\n  provisions this is an excessive restriction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                    41</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">\f49.The High Court found that the expression &quot;or under any other Act&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">   appearing in the section is arbitrary and discriminatory and accordingly\n\n   struck down the said words from sub-Section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1871937/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 21</a> as being\n\n   violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_137\">21</a> of the Constitution.
