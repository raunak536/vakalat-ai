Every once in a while, citizens going about their usual and ordinary\nbusiness, get entangled with the State apparatus; sometimes for good reason\nand at times unjustifiably so. In such a situation, an aggrieved citizen&#x27;s\nremedy, quite naturally, is to approach the courts of law for appropriate\nrelief. These remedies at most times are financially debilitating and not\nwithin the means of every aggrieved party.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">1.1    The instant matter is a case in point.

Resultantly, Ms Pillai dispatched yet\nanother letter dated 12.01.2015 to the same officer, seeking to know, inter\nalia, as to whether, what was being bandied about, in the press, was factually\ncorrect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">1.3    Ms. Pillai&#x27;s communications received no response.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">2.     Being aggrieved, Ms. Pillai has moved this court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">2.1    The broad plank of her challenge is pivoted on the assertion that these\nactions of the respondents are violative of her fundamental rights. <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_2\">Article\n19(1) (a)</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_3\">, 19(1) (g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">21</a> have been invoked by Ms. Pillai, to assail the\nactions of the respondents, which she categorises, if one were to sum her\nsubmissions, as egregiously illegal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">3.     Ms. Pillai&#x27;s curriculum vitae, broadly, reads as follows :- She avers\nthat she is a civil rights activist, who works in public spaces. Her core area\nof work relates to environmental issues. She is a lawyer by profession; and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 2 of 39</span>\n is currently employed with Greenpeace India Society, as a Policy Officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.     It appears of late she has been working in Mahan in the Singrauli Coal\nbelt, in the State of Madhya Pradesh. As an activist working in Mahan, it\nappears, she has associated herself with the local tribal communities, which\naccording to her, seek to resist the possibility of a coal mine being operated\nin the area. The opposition, evidently, albeit non-violent, appears to be\nfocussed against the proponent of the proposal; a company by the name of\nMahan Coal Ltd, which seeks to open a coal mine in the concerned area.\n4.1    Mahan Coal Ltd., apparently, is a joint venture company, formed and\nincorporated at the behest of two entities by the name of Hindalco and\nESSAR Power Ltd. It is averred that ESSAR Power Ltd. is a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of ESSAR Energy; a company incorporated and registered in\nUnited Kingdom (in short, U.K.).       It is claimed that till very recently,\nESSAR Energy, was also listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n4.2    It is asserted that Mahan, is home to the oldest and largest surviving\nSal forest in Asia. The assertion made in the writ petition is that opening of\na mine in Mahan had the potentiality of displacing the forest / tribal\ncommunities, which in turn, could impact lives of thousands of people who,\ndepend on forest produce. There is also an assertion that such an activity\ncould, also degrade, the existing wild life found in the area and lead to water\nand air pollution in the region.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.3    It is to talk on these aspects with British Parliamentarians that, Ms.\nPillai was invited by Greenpeace U.K. Accordingly, a request for visa was\nsent by Greenpeace U.K., on 27.11.2014, on behalf of Ms. Pillai. In its\ncommunication, Greenpeace U.K., indicated that all expenses would be met\nby it, which included expenses qua travel, insurance and medical insurance.\n4.4    Consequent thereto, Ms. Pillai was issued a visa by the British High\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 3 of 39</span>\n Commission, for a period of 6 months.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">4.5    Based on the above, Ms. Pillai&#x27;s air ticket was booked with Air India.\nHer seat was confirmed by the Airline, on flight no.AI 115, which was to fly\nout of Delhi on Sunday, 11.01.2015, at 06.50 a.m.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">5.     As indicated at the very outset, Ms. Pillai was detained at the airport,\njust before she was to board her flight. She was accosted by Mr. V.K. Ojha,\nan Immigration Officer employed with respondent no.2 i.e., Bureau of\nImmigration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">5.1    It is averred that Mr. Ojha after consultations with the officers at the\nSpecial Assistance Counter asked Ms. Pillai to accompany him to another\nplace for further confabulations; albeit within the airport complex. It is at\nthis point in time that Ms. Pillai was informed that she could not travel out\nof India. Resultantly, her baggage was retrieved from the aircraft and an\nendorsement to the effect, &quot;off load&quot; was made on her passport.\n5.2    On Ms. Pillai seeking information as to why she had been detained,\nshe was asked to speak to Mr. V.K. Ojha&#x27;s superior, one, Ms. Sushma\nSharma. It is averred that Ms. Sushma Sharma received a fax from an\nunknown source, whereupon she confirmed that Ms. Pillai had been\ndetained since her name stood included in the &quot;data base&quot; of individuals,\nwho are not allowed to leave the country.            Apparently, no further\ninformation was supplied to Ms. Pillai as to why and how her name got\nincluded in the said data base.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">5.3    Being unhappy with her situation, Ms. Pillai, as indicated above,\nwrote a letter on that very date i.e., 11.01.2015 to the Secretary, Ministry of\nHome Affairs wherein, she recounted her ordeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">5.4    The said communication was followed by a letter dated 12.01.2015\nwhereby, she sought clarification from Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">WP(C)774/2015                                                     Page 4 of 39</span>\n as to whether an LOC had been issued in her name. This clarification was\nsought as media reports were suggestive of the fact that this was the precise\nreason which the &quot;official sources&quot; had trotted out, for her detention at the\nairport.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">5.5    In addition, Ms. Pillai, by this very communication, most\nemphatically sought the details of the LOC, if any, issued, along with\ninformation, as to the authority which had directed its issuance and, the\nreasons, which had led to its issuance. Ms. Pillai, briefly, also touched upon\nthe fact that she had not been convicted in any criminal case, and all that she\nproposed to do, was to give a speech to the Members of the British\nParliament.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">5.6    None of the aforementioned communications of Ms. Pillai received a\nresponse.       Resultantly, the captioned petition came to be moved on\n28.01.2015 when, notice was issued in the matter. Since respondents had\nreceived, advance notice, they were represented by counsels. Respondents&#x27;\ncounsels accepted notice and were accordingly given a week&#x27;s time to file a\ncounter affidavit. The returnable date fixed in the matter was 06.02.2015.\nDespite opportunity, no counter affidavit was filed.\n5.7    However, on 06.02.2015, respondents were represented by Mr. Sanjay\nJain, learned ASG who requested for further time being granted till\n10.02.2015, to enable filing of a counter affidavit in the matter. The request\nwas acceded to. Liberty was consequently granted to the petitioner to file a\nrejoinder before the next date of hearing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">5.8    Since the counter affidavit was not filed within the prescribed time,\ncounsels for the petitioner pleaded that they could only bring the rejoinder to\nthe court. Counsels were agreed though, that both, counter affidavit and\nrejoinder could be taken on record. Accordingly, the needful was done.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">WP(C)774/2015                                                     Page 5 of 39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\"> Submissions in the matter were heard on 18.02.2015 and 19.02.2015.\nWritten submissions on behalf of the petitioner were placed on record on\n19.02.2015. The respondents as requested were given two days to file\nwritten submissions in the matter. This did not happen. Upon a request\nbeing made, on mentioning, written submissions of respondents were taken\non record on 23.02.2015, in the presence of counsels for the opposite side.\nSUBMISSION OF COUNSELS\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">6.      On behalf of Ms Pillai, arguments were advanced by Ms. Indira\nJaising, learned senior counsel, assisted by Ms. Vrinda Grover, Ms. Amrita\nChakravorty, Mr. Bhavook Chauhan, Ms. Sonakshi Malhan and Mr. Ratna\nAppanendra, Advocates. Respondents were represented by Mr. Sanjay Jain,\nlearned ASG, who was assisted by Mr. Neeraj Jain and Mr. Anirudh Shukla,\nAdvocates.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">7.      Ms. Jaising&#x27;s submissions can be briefly paraphrased as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(i).    The LOC issued in the matter which, as per the counter affidavit, is\ndated 10.01.2015, has been issued without due authority of law. There\nbeing no restriction imposed upon Ms. Pillai to travel outside India by any\ncourt, she could not be prevented from travelling outside the country for the\nstated purpose, which was to meet the British Parliamentarians with respect\nto work carried out by her with tribal communities, in Mahan.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(ii).   The detention of Ms. Pillai, on 11.01.2015, had violated her\nfundamental right to travel, free speech and expression and to practice her\nprofession and / or occupation. Consequently, the action of the respondents\ncontravened her fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_6\">, 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_7\">19(1)(g)</a>\nof the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(iii). The only legal recourse open to the respondents whereby, if at all,\nthey could have lawfully prevented Ms. Pillai from exercising                   her\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 6 of 39</span>\n constitutional right of free travel, was to exercise powers conferred under\nthe provisions of: <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_8\">The Passports Act, 1967</a> (in short the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_9\">Passports Act</a>).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(iii)(a) This power could if, at all, be exercised by the constituted authority\nor the Central Government or the designated officer perhaps only in terms of\nand in consonance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/827607/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 10</a> of the Passports Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(iii)(b) Apart from the powers contained in the aforementioned Section,\nwhich includes the power to vary, impound or revoke the passport, emergent\npower is found in Section 10A of the Passports Act to suspend the passport\nor travel documents, which are otherwise likely to be impounded or caused\nto be impounded or revoked under the provisions of clause (c) of sub-section\n(3) of Section 10, provided it is deemed necessary in public interest to do so.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">Such a suspension shall run for a period of four (4) weeks. The suspension\ncan thus, be carried out by the Passport Authority, only if it deems it\nnecessary to do so in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,\nsecurity of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in\nthe interest of the general public.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">(iii)(c) Even in such situations, the affected party has to be given an\nopportunity of hearing within a period not exceeding eight (8) weeks,\nreckoned from the date of passing of such an order. In other words, fetter,\nif any, on the constitutional right of a citizen to travel abroad can be imposed\nby a duly constituted authority and, that too, only in accordance with the\naforementioned provisions1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_7\">(iv). The ostensible basis on which LOCs generally and, in particular, in\nthis case, have been issued by the respondents, is sourced in O.M. dated\n27.10.2010 (in short 2010 O.M.) which, in turn, is said to be based on the\ndirections issued by this Court in the following judgments: Vikram Sharma\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">1</span>\n    See <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_11\">Hukam Chand Shyam Lal Vs. Union of India</a>, (1976) 2 SCC 128\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">WP(C)774/2015                                                        Page 7 of 39</span>\n Vs. Union of India, [171 (2010) DLT 671] and Sumer Singh Malkan Vs.\nAssistant Director &amp; Ors. [II (2010) DM 666].</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">(iv)(a) A perusal of the said judgments would show that while they discuss\nas to the appropriate authority which can issue an LOC and, the entity,\nwhich can make a request for issuance of an LOC, they do not, address the\nquestion as to the legal basis for issuance of an LOC. The power to issue an\nLOC should be rooted in a substantive law, such as, the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 41</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the Cr. PC).\nIn other words, the 2010 O.M. is not backed by authority of law. The said\nO.M. which is in the nature of an executive instruction is not law &quot;within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/15421639/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 13(3)(a)</a> of the Constitution&quot;2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">(v).      The respondents by their own admission have invoked the provisions\nof clause 8(j) of the 2010 O.M. which, empowers them to issue an LOC;\nalbeit in exceptional cases, &quot;without complete&quot; or even in cases where no\ndetails are available, only against persons falling in the following categories:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;counter intelligence suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc. in\nlarger public interest&quot;.              Therefore, in such like cases, the safeguards\ncontained in the 2010 O.M., can, in a sense, be side-stepped provided the\nperson against whom an LOC is issued, falls in the categories prescribed\ntherein.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(v)(a) Ms. Pillai has been categorized as one indulging in anti-national\nactivities. The recourse to clause 8(j) of the 2010 O.M. is flawed as the\nexpression, &#x27;anti- national&#x27; has to be interpreted in the context of those\nexpressions preceding it, that is, in consonance with, the principle of\nejusdem generis.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508089\" id=\"span_10\">(vi). Expression of opinion on economic activities of the Government or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">2</span>\n    See <a href=\"/doc/1508089/\" id=\"a_14\">Bijoe Emmanuel and Ors. Vs. State of Kerala and Ors.</a>, (1986) 3 SCC 615\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">WP(C)774/2015                                                                    Page 8 of 39</span>\n investment decisions of a particular multinational corporation qua coal\nmines in India to the extent it impacts tribal communities of the area or, the\nenvironment cannot be construed as an anti-national activity, if read, in the\ncontext of the preceding expressions; obtaining in clause 8(j). The logical\ncorollary of which, is that, anti-national activities can only be construed as\nthose activities which impinge upon sovereignty or integrity of India. The\ntwo examples given in clause 8(j) of the 2010 O.M., such as, counter\nintelligence suspects and terrorists, fall in this category.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(vi)(a) This argument was, however, advanced dehors the submission that an\nLOC is an administrative instruction not backed by authority of law, and\nthat, the grounds set out therein, whereby restrictions on travel could\nperhaps be imposed, had to abide by the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\nConstitution. Since the expression, &#x27;anti-national&#x27; or &#x27;national interest&#x27; does\nnot find mention in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution, the last category in\nclause 8(j) of 2010 O.M. being: &quot;anti-national elements, etc. in larger\nnational interest&quot; - does not qualify as a &quot;reasonable restriction&quot; within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution3.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(vii). The respondents had failed to show as to how the purpose of Ms.\nPillai&#x27;s visit which, involved speaking with British Parliamentarians qua\nrights of tribal communities, in Mahan, would constitute a threat to the\nsovereignty and integrity of India. Espousing a cause of particular section of\npeople could not be considered as anti-national or creating disaffection\namongst people at large4.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_13\">(viii). The right to travel abroad is a fundamental right which, stands\nsubsumed in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution. No citizen of the country can be deprived of this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">3</span>\n    See <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_19\">S. Rangarajan Vs. P.

Ms. Pillai has a fundamental right to express her opinion on crucial\neconomic policies of the Government which may differ from the dominant\nopinion and would include the right to propagate an alternative opinion.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">This opinion can be expressed at seminars, by publishing articles and\nincluding, in the manner, sought to be done in the instant case by meeting\nwith parliamentarians of foreign countries. Ms. Pillai had proposed to travel\nto the U.K. to highlight the role of a British company, i.e., Essar Energy.\nSuch a meeting could, by no stretch of imagination, have had an impact on\nthe friendly relations between India and Britain as it pertained to a\ncontestation between a British Company and the local population situate in\nMahan; none of which impinged upon the relationship between Britain and\nIndia. A State cannot impose travel restrictions on its citizens without due\nauthority of law6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"90106439\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_17\">(x).    The respondents had failed to provide any material which would\nsubstantiate their claim that Ms. Pillai&#x27;s association with Greenpeace India\nSociety, as an employee posed a threat to India&#x27;s sovereignty and integrity.\nThe respondents have not imposed a ban on Greenpeace India Society and,\nis thus, not an unlawful association whose activities can be prohibited under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_20\">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967</a>.

On the other hand, Mr Sanjay Jain, learned ASG, defended the stand\nof the respondents and made submissions, in line with the stand taken in the\ncounter affidavit.           Mr Jain&#x27;s submissions thus, broadly, alluded to the\nfollowing:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(i)        The respondents&#x27; action of issuing LOCs in general, as also in this\nparticular case, is backed by the necessary authority, which is contained in\nthe 2010 O.M. The said O.M. has its genesis in the Ministry of Home\nAffairs, Government of India letter dated 05.09.1979, followed by O.M.\ndated 27.12.2000. The 2010 O.M., in that sense, refined the guidelines in\nthe light of directions issued by this court in Vikram Sharma&#x27;s case and\nthose issued by the Division bench of this court in Sumer Singh Malkan&#x27;s\ncase.        The contention advanced on behalf of the petitioner is, therefore,\nwithout basis.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"703393\" id=\"span_30\">(ii)       In so far as Ms Pillai was concerned, she was already an LOC subject\nand, accordingly, an LOC dated 10.10.2014 had been issued qua her on an\nearlier occasion. As regards the recent incident, whereby she was detained\nat the airport on 11.01.2015, a numbered LOC was opened by the Assistant\nDirector of I.B., on 10.01.2015. The purpose with which the said LOC was\nissued, was to prevent Ms Pillai from leaving India since, she proposed to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">9</span>\n    See <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_36\">St. Xavier Education Society, Ahmedabad vs. State of Gujarat</a>, (1974) 1 SCC 717\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">WP(C)774/2015                                                                            Page 13 of 39</span>\n testify before the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Tribal People,\ncomprising of British Parliamentarians, which without doubt, would have\n&quot;negatively&quot; projected the image of the Government of India.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(iii)      The investigating agencies have, from time to time, issued LOCs\neither against persons who are involved in crime, or against those, whose\nactivities are found to be prejudicial in national interest. Though Ms Pillai,\nhas been permitted to travel out of India, on at least eight occasions, between\nJanuary, 2007 and June, 2012, this time around she was detained, as the\npurpose of her visit was to depose before a formal committee of the British\nParliament, with a defined motive of impacting India&#x27;s image abroad, at a\ntime, when it was looking to attract FDI, in infrastructure and manufacturing\nsector.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(iv)       Greenpeace International U.K. office, has taken keen interest in\nfomenting ground level protest via Greenpeace India, because of which at\nleast 13 foreign activists working for Greenpeace International have been\nblacklisted, as they were found to have acted in violation of Visa rules, in\nview of their involvement in training, motivating and organizing Greenpeace\nIndia&#x27;s activists at field level, to protest, in close proximity to thermal plants\nand coal mine locations. These protests have marred India&#x27;s energy security\ninterest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1082001\" id=\"span_33\">(v)        The main objective of the foreign and Indian activists associated with\nGreenpeace International and Greenpeace India, is to step up agitations in\ncoal producing regions, such as Mahan, in Singrauli district, in the State of\nMadhya Pradesh. For this purpose, a front, in the form of an entity by the\nname of, Mahan Sangharsh Samiti (MSS) was created, which is funded by\nGreenpeace India and that Ms Pillai has been posted there to organize the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">10</span>\n     See <a href=\"/doc/1082001/\" id=\"a_37\">Amar Singh Vs.

The inputs received\nshow that Greenpeace India plans to &quot;take-down&quot; nearly 40000 MW thermal\nprojects. These protests are funded through foreign sources. In this behalf\nspecific reference was made to paragraph 22 of the counter affidavit, which\nset out the possible locations in which thermal plants are likely to come up.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">Reference was also made to protests organized at two nuclear sites, located\nat Kundakulam, in Tamil Nadu and Fatehbad, in Haryana. There is also a\ngeneric reference qua protests organized in respect of genetically modified\nfood trials and with regard to India&#x27;s tea export industry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">(vii) The funding pattern of Greenpeace International is opaque, as it\nclaims that it collected donation in small amounts from persons of different\nnationalities located all over the world.   It is because of this reason, and its\nactivities, that it has been placed in the proscribed list of donors under\nSection 46 of the FCRA; in other words, in respect of each foreign donation,\nGreenpeace International would have to seek permission of MHA. It is thus,\nplaced in a category which is known as &quot;Prior Reference Category&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">(viii) The Indian arm of Greenpeace International, i.e., Greenpeace India\nand Greenpeace Environment Trust, having violated Indian income tax laws,\nhave been issued notices by the authorities under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_38\">Income Tax Act</a>, which\ninvolve amounts equivalent to Rs. 3.8 crores.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">(ix)   Since, Greenpeace India&#x27;s funding had been curtailed, and prior\nclearance is required for donations received by Greenpeace International,\nGreenpeace, UK has been used to engineer protests in Mahan. As a part of\nthis plan, in the first instance, steps were taken to garner funds and organize\nvisits of Ms Pillai and, one, Mr Akshay Gupta, along with five (5) activists\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">WP(C)774/2015                                                      Page 15 of 39</span>\n of MSS, to meet-up with British Parliamentarians. Because others were not\nable to obtain visas in time, Ms Pillai, attempted to embark alone on a trip to\nU.K. Based on specific intelligence input, as to the purpose of her visit, she\nwas detained at the airport.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">(x)    APPG is headed by, one, Mr Martin Horwood and co-chaired by a\nperson of Indian origin, by the name of Virendra Sharma, who is the chair of\nAPPG, on Indo-British relations. Both persons are the members of the\nBritish Parliament. Mr Martin Horwood is a liberal democrat, whereas Mr\nVirendra Sharma is from the Labour Party. As would be evident, APPG is a\nformal committee of a foreign Parliament. The decision of Ms Pillai to\ndepose before such a committee, with respect to the concerns of tribal\ncommunities, in Mahan, would only damage the country&#x27;s image and\nconsequently hamper its economic interest. Unlike other prominent civil\nrights activists, Ms Pillai has taken a decision to vent her ire and/or\narticulate her views against State policy before a Committee, comprising of\nBritish Parliamentarians; an act which can only be construed as an anti-\nnational activity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">(xi)   It has been a core foreign policy objective of countries, such as, the\nUSA, UK and other European countries to issue annual reports, of their\nassessments, of specific human rights violation in other countries.              In\npreparation of these reports, the testimonies of global NGOs and think-tank\nexperts are recorded, including testimonies of human rights activists,\noriginating from the country concerned.         Reports, incorporating such\ntestimonies, are prepared on religious freedom, as well as tribal and\nindigenous people.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">(xi)(a) The United States has in place, a statute, titled as: International\nReligious Freedom Act, 1998, which empowers its government to impose\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 16 of 39</span>\n sanctions against a Country of Particular Concerns (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_39\">CPC</a>). India has come\nperilously close to being declared a <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_40\">CPC</a>, in the reports generated by the US\nCommission on International Religious Freedom and the US State\nDepartment, of April and July, 2014 respectively. These reports have in fact\nrated India one notch above <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_41\">the CPC</a> level.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">(xi)(b) Similarly, the APPGs of the British Parliament have directed their\nfocus on tribal people since, 2012. As a matter of fact, the UK APPG report\non religious freedom, issued in 2014, alleges a violation of religious freedom\nin India. Similarly, the European Parliaments&#x27; Working Group Report on\nReligious Freedom of February, 2014, places India in the lowest category as\na <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_42\">CPC</a> alongside Pakistan. Within <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_43\">the CPC</a>, India has been labelled as, a\nserious violator of religion and belief.     There are indications that UK\nParliament&#x27;s APPG report will use Ms Pillai&#x27;s testimony to rate India, at a\nlow level, exposing it to the potentiality of being governed by a sanction\nregime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">(xi)(c) Similarly, the US President is empowered under the law obtaining in\nthat country to issue, trade, arms and investment sanction against <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_44\">CPC</a>\ncountries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">(xi)(d) These reports on religious freedom, tribal people, indigenous people,\nhuman trafficking and dalit rights generated by various Commissions and\nCountries feed on each other, and thereby, create a circular documentation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">(xi)(e) In 2006, European Parliament has already passed six (6) resolutions\nagainst India on dalit rights and one on violence against women. The\ncontent of these resolutions is suggestive of the fact that Government of\nIndia and the Parliament of India have not been able to protect dalits and\nwomen, and therefore, a call is made to European Union to factor in these\naspects in their trade negotiation with India and Indian companies.

The respondents are handicapped,\nin as much as, while reports generated under the aegis of United Nation can\nbe contested, such like reports, created by formal committees of countries,\nlike, US, UK and the European Parliament, cannot be contested as no\nopportunity is provided to the Government of India, or its Embassies/High\nCommissions, to record their opinion in the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">(xii) The testimony of Ms Pillai, before a formal Committee of British\nParliament, would have a cascading effect, globally, which would only serve\nthe foreign policy interest of other nations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">(xii)(a) Ms Pillai&#x27;s deposition would thus, be prejudicial to &quot;national\ninterest&quot;.

As a matter of fact, she had no notice of an LOC having being\nissued vis-à-vis her till she was detained at the airport on 11.01.2015, at a\npoint in time when she intended to board Air India flight AI-115.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(ii)    The resultant events led to her passport being endorsed with the\nannotation &quot;off-load&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(iii)   The respondents have claimed that the LOC is a secret document and,\nhence, cannot be handed over to Ms Pillai, or for that matter, to any person\nagainst whom the same has been issued.

It safeguards the right\n           to go abroad against executive interference which is not\n           supported by law; and law here means &#x27;enacted law&#x27; or &#x27;State\n           Law&#x27;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_51\"><a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_72\">Vide A. K. Gopalan</a>&#x27;s case. Thus, no person can be\n           deprived of his right to, go abroad unless there is a law made\n           by the State prescribing the procedure for so depriving him\n           and the deprivation is effected strictly in accordance with\n           such procedure. It was for this reason, in order to comply\n           with the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a>, that Parliament enacted\n           the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_74\">Passports Act, 1967</a> for regulating the right to go abroad.\n           It is clear from the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_75\">Passports, Act, 1967</a> that\n           is lays down the circumstances under which a passport may\n           be issued or refused or cancelled or impounded and also\n           prescribes a procedure for doing so, but the question is\n           whether that is sufficient compliance with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 21.</a> Is the\n           prescription of some sort of procedure enough or must the\n           procedure comply with any particular requirements ?\n           Obviously, procedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair or\n           unreasonable.

In order to answer these issues, I would for a moment assume that the\nissuance of an LOC is rooted in the power of the executive to take action\ndehors a statutory enactment, as long as the power enacted by the State (in\nthis case the Union of India), falls within one of the legislative entries,\nincluded in the Constitution; provided it does not contravene the provisions\nof the Constitution, in particular, Part III of the Constitution or takes away\nrights of citizens under existing law.

This submission,\nI must confess, has much merit in view of the decisions of the Supreme\nCourt both in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_81\">Maneka Gandhi</a> case as well as in the case of A.K. Gopalan.\nBoth judgements take the view that &quot;law&quot; referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21</a>, would\nmean &quot;enacted law&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 24 of 39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_66\"> 12.2 The reason I do not wish to elaborate on this issue any further, is that,\nwhile this submission was advanced by Ms Indira Jaising (both during the\ncourse of hearing, as well as in the form of written submission), in the\npetition, there is no relief sought to strike down the 2010 O.M. One of the\nreasons, perhaps for this would be that Ms Pillai was never furnished a copy\nof the LOC. The factum of issuance of an LOC got officially known to her\nonly when she approached this court by way of the instant petition.\nNevertheless, during the course of the proceedings, no leave was sought to\nseek an amendment in the writ petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">12.3 Be that as it may, as indicated above, while Ms Jaising&#x27;s point is\ntaken that an LOC can be issued, if at all, in circumstances, delineated in\n<a href=\"/doc/182765/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 10(3)(h)</a> of the Passports Act, there may arise certain situations,\noutside the scope of the said Act, which may require, the executive of the\nday, to take recourse to an LOC, under circumstances which are not covered\nby a statutory enactment. As adverted above, the State, is not denuded of its\nexecutive powers only because there is no statute to back the exercise of\nsuch a power. The caveat being, if a challenge is laid to the exercise of such\npower, on the anvil of the Constitution, say under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_85\">19</a>, the\nState would have to make good its case that the exercise of power was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">a valid law and, in doing so, it did not violate any constitutional provisions.\nAt that stage, the court may have to enquire and rule whether the kind of\nimpediment that issuance of an LOC envisage requires enactment of law.\n12.4 As an illustration, I may only advert to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 41</a> of\nthe Cr.P.C., which, inter alia, empowers a police officer to arrest a person,\nwithout the order of a Magistrate and arrest warrant, upon receipt of a\nreasonable complaint or credible information or even reasonable suspicion\nthat he has committed a cognizable offence. Whether an LOC issued to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 25 of 39</span>\n effectuate such a purpose, would require a further support of an enactment\nwould require consideration as it could be argued that it is only in aid of the\npower contained in the statute, i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_87\">Cr.P.C</a>. I would thus leave the\ndiscussion on this issue to a better and more evolved wisdom of another\ncourt.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">12.5 Suffice it to state that in this particular case, a decision on the\naforesaid aspect may not be necessary, in view of the circumstances which\nhave obtained in the instant matter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">12.6 The stand of the respondents that they had prevented Ms Pillai from\nleaving the country as she intended to testify before an APPG of British\nParliamentarians, which in turn, would have &quot;negatively&quot; impacted the\nimage of India - in my view, is a stand, which is completely untenable.\n12.7 The reasons for the same are as follows: First and foremost, Ms Pillai\nhas clearly contested this attribution vis-à-vis her, which is that, she intended\nto testify before a formal Committee of British Parliamentarians. It is her\nstated stand that she intended to meet a Group of British Parliamentarians, in\nLondon, to speak about violations of environmental laws, in Mahan Coal\nblock; in particular, with respect to the provisions of the Environment\nProtection Act, the Forest Protection Act, the Forest Rights Act, the Wild\nLife Protection Act, which amongst other areas, are operable, in that area as\nwell.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">12.8 This conversation, Ms Pillai says she needed to have with the British\nParliamentarians, so that they could call upon Essar Energy, a British\ncompany, having a major financial stake in Mahan Coal Ltd., to fall in line\nwith the legal regime of our country.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">12.9     There is nothing on record to show that Ms Pillai intended to do\nanything more than this. The argument of the respondents that Greenpeace\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">WP(C)774/2015                                                      Page 26 of 39</span>\n U.K. and Greenpeace International were fomenting protests in the country\nwith respect to various public projects, especially, in the field of thermal and\nnuclear power generation, is not backed with actionable material.            The\nrecord would show that while the respondents may have regulated the inflow\nof funds to Greenpeace International, by having it put in the &quot;prior approval&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">category, there is no such directive issued either qua Greenpeace U.K., or\nGreenpeace India. Ms Pillai, is admittedly, employed with Greenpeace\nIndia.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">12.10 The only violation which is brought to fore, in the counter affidavit,\nqua Greenpeace India, is one concerning certain notices issued by the\nIncome Tax Authorities; which have clearly, some revenue implications.\nHowever, the alleged violation of tax laws, which I am informed is\ncontested, would not, in my opinion by itself, be demonstrative of the fact\nthat the activities carried out by Greenpeace India, via its employees, agents\nand servants, is inimical to the economic interest of the country. While there\nis no gainsaying that economic security, as against physical security of a\nnation in today&#x27;s time and space, is equally vital, if not more - nothing,\nwhich is placed before me, in the form of affidavit, or is found in the record,\nwhich was shown to me in court, would have me, presently, come to a\nconclusion that the activities of Ms Pillai, in particular, or those of the\norganizations, with which she is associated, are activities, which have the\npotentiality of degrading the economic interest of the country.\n12.11 The sense that I get, upon perusal of the stand taken by the\nrespondents in their pleadings, is that, they do not approve of the view\nexpressed by civil right activists, in forums outside the country, which tend\nto portray, according to them, an inaccurate picture of the state of human\nrights in the country. In other words, the respondents are concerned by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">WP(C)774/2015                                                     Page 27 of 39</span>\n fact that such portrayal generates an atmosphere, which retards investment\nof foreign funds, in vital infrastructural projects.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">13.    Whether this concern of the respondents is valid or not, in my\nopinion, is not the issue. The reason for the same is, that, developmental\nactivities, not now, but for ages have always had a counter point. The\nadvancement in knowledge base, and the ability of common citizen to access\ninformation vis-à-vis public projects, has only made dissent more strident\nand vigorous. Whether one model of development has to be rolled out as\nagainst the other, is an on-going debate. This debate impinges upon all\nkinds of developmental projects, which includes project, such as, mining,\nsetting up of nuclear plants, construction of roads through forests,\nacquisition of land for housing projects/ industries, construction of\nhighways, roads, dams and bridges etc. - none of which have stopped if, the\nexecutive of the day, is convinced of their need and necessity.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">13.1 The mere fact that such debates obtain, or such debates metamorphose\ninto peaceful protests, cannot be the reason for curtailing a citizen&#x27;s\nfundamental rights. In this case, Ms Pillai&#x27;s right to travel abroad and\ninteract with relevant stake holders (i.e., the British Parliamentarians), to\npersuade them, to have entities incorporated in their country, to fall in line,\nwith the developmental ethos, which is close to her ideology and belief,\ncannot be impeded only because it is not in sync with policy perspective of\nthe executive.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">13.2 Ms Pillai, as the facts in this case would reveal, believes that the\nrights of tribal communities residing in Mahan would get impacted if, a coal\nmine, were to be opened in that area. This, is a view, which the executive\nmay or may not agree with. That by itself, cannot be a reason to prevent Ms\nPillai from exercising her fundamental right to travel abroad and, thereby, in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">WP(C)774/2015                                                     Page 28 of 39</span>\n effect, disable her from expressing her views on the subject. In today&#x27;s time\nand space, because of advent of technology, and especially, the internet, the\nuniverse has been reduced to a global-village. What occurs in a remote part\nof any country, gets immediately known the world over, either via television\nor through social media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">13.3 Therefore, the argument of the respondents that they would not permit\nMs Pillai to travel out of India, for the stated purpose, but otherwise, would\nplace no impediment in her travel, is clearly flawed. Ms Pillai, need not\ntravel abroad to express her view point. She can transmit her views via\ntechnological devices available to her, without having to move out of the\ncountry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">13.4 But that is not the point in issue. The point in issue is, why must the\nState interfere with the freedom of an individual, as long as the individual\nconcerned operates within the ambit of laws framed by the legislature.\n13.5 The core aspect of democracy is the freedom of an individual to be\nable to freely operate, within the framework of the laws enacted by the\nParliament. The individual should be able to order his or her life any way he\nor she pleases, as long as it is not violative of the law or constitutes an\ninfraction of any order or direction of a duly constituted court, tribunal or\nany statutory authority for that matter.      Amongst the varied freedoms\nconferred on an individual (i.e., the citizen), is the right of free speech and\nexpression, which necessarily includes the right to criticise and dissent.\nCriticism, by an individual, may not be palatable; even so, it cannot be\nmuzzled. Many civil right activists believe that they have the right, as\ncitizens, to bring to the notice of the State the incongruity in the\ndevelopmental policies of the State. The State may not accept the views of\nthe civil right activists, but that by itself, cannot be a good enough reason to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">WP(C)774/2015                                                     Page 29 of 39</span>\n do away with dissent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">13.6 The argument advanced before me by the learned ASG that reports\ngenerated by APPG, which include inputs of civil right activists (I have\ndeliberately not used the word &quot;testimony&quot; as Ms Pillai has denied that she\nintended to depose before any Committee of British Parliamentarians),\ncannot be contradicted as the response of the State is not sought by these\nbodies; does not impress me. The State has at its command a posse of\nsophisticated foreign service officers, who are skilled in the art of diplomacy\nand foreign affairs. They are trained to deal with negative connotations or,\nfall out of any discussion, that any individual or entity, may have with\nanother State actor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">13.7 Therefore, the learned ASG&#x27;s attempt to draw a distinction between\nthe reports which are generated under the aegis of the United Nations and\nthose which are generated by Committees and Commissions of countries,\nsuch as, U.S., U.K. and the European Parliament, is really a distinction\nwithout a substantial difference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">13.8 Therefore, having regard to the aforesaid discussion, in my view,\nthere was no basis for the respondents to issue an LOC qua the petitioner.\nThat being so, the decision taken to detain the petitioner at the airport on\n11.01.2015, in my opinion, was illegal being violative of the Ms Pillai&#x27;s\nright under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_89\">19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.\n13.9 The actions of the respondents do not fall within the ambit of\nreasonable restriction, as articulated in Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 19.</a> Clause (2)\nof <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 19</a> protects a &quot;law&quot; which imposes reasonable restrictions on the\nexercise of rights conferred upon a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, in the\ninterest of: sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of State, friendly\nrelations with foreign States, public order, decency, morality or in relation to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">WP(C)774/2015                                                     Page 30 of 39</span>\n contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. As indicated\nabove, even if I were to assume that 2010 O.M. has the status of law, qua\nwhich I have a serious doubt, the action of the respondents in issuing an\nLOC vis-a-vis Ms Pillai cannot be categorized as a reasonable restriction, as\nit is not a restriction which falls in any of the limitations articulated in clause\n(2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 19.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">14.    In order to understand the scope and amplitude of the expression\n&quot;reasonable restriction&quot;, it would be relevant to briefly advert to the\ncircumstances in which the amendments were made in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_94\">Article\n19</a> of the Constitution. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 19</a>, as found in its present form\nhas its roots in the 1st (first) and the 16th (sixteenth) Amendment to the\nConstitution carried out in 1951 and 1963. Prior to these amendments, the\nfreedom of speech and expression was subject to, only, the following\nqualifications: i.e., the government&#x27;s authority to legislate in respect of\naspects concerning, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of court, or any\nmatter offending decency and morality, or that which undermines the\nsecurity or tends to overthrow the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">14.1 Evidently, taking a cue from the above, the three State Governments,\nthat is, the Government of Bihar, East Punjab and Madras (as they were then\nconstituted) took recourse to these qualifications in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 19</a> to enact laws,\nwhich were challenged in court in three separate cases, on the ground, that\nthey put, a fetter, on the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the\nConstitution11.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">14.2 In the first, case, the Bihar Government exercised its power under the\nPress (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, to demand, financial security qua a\npamphlet issued by an entity by the name of Bharti Press, which contained\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">WP(C)774/2015                                                        Page 31 of 39</span>\n (according to the Patna High Court), a clear invitation to the readers to join\ntotal and deadly struggle, to bring about revolution, by violence, resulting in\ncomplete annihilation of those, whom the author of the pamphlet considered,\nas oppressors12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">14.3 The Patna High Court rejected the Bihar Government&#x27;s contention\nthat the pamphlet incited violence; a decision which was unanimously\nupheld by the Supreme Court in State of Bihar vs Shaila Bala Devi, 1952\n(3) SCR 65413.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">14.4 In the second case, the Government in East Punjab had imposed pre-\ncensorship on an English language weekly in the guise of maintaining public\nsafety and order by taking recourse to the provisions of the East Punjab\nPublic Safety Act, 195014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">14.5 In the third case, the Madras Government, likewise, had banned entry\ninto the State of a journal entitled: &quot;Crossroads&quot; with the aid of the Madras\nMaintenance of Public Safety Act, 194915.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43023\" id=\"span_65\">14.6 The Supreme Court struck down the provisions of the East Punjab\nPublic Safety Act, 1950, and the Madras Maintenance of Public Safety Act,\n1940 vide two separate judgements titled: <a href=\"/doc/43023/\" id=\"a_97\">Brij Bhushan vs State of Delhi</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_98\">AIR 1950 SC 129 and Romesh Thappar vs State of Madras</a>, (1950) 1 SCR\n60216.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">14.7 Because of the observations made by the Court (which incidentally\nwere judgements delivered by the same Bench), the Parliament moved to\nintroduce the expression &quot;reasonable restriction&quot; in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 19.</a>\nThe Parliament thus carried out the First Amendment which permitted the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 32 of 39</span>\n Government to impose reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and\nexpression both retroactively and prospectively17.\n14.8 The 16th Amendment Act was passed, similarly, in the background of\nseries of events, which included the Chinese incursion in North-east,\nbeginning in 1960, the assertion of a separate Sikh State by Master Tara\nSingh, in mid-1961, and the call by DMK, for an entity, separate from India,\nwhich was referred to as Dravidanad18.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_67\">14.9 What is of relevance though is the interpretation that the Supreme\nCourt gave to the expression &quot;security of the State&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_100\">Romesh Thappar Vs.\nState of Madras</a>. In the said case, the Supreme Court observed that the\nexpression &quot;security of the State&quot; is one which has reference to &quot;those\naggravated forms of prejudicial activities&quot; which tend to endanger the very\nexistence of the State. The Madras maintenance of Public Safety Act, 1949,\nwhich had as its object public safety and order, was declared\nunconstitutional, as it did not fall within the scope and ambit of the\nexpression &quot;Security of the State&quot;. This led, inter alia, to the insertion of the\nexpression &quot;public order&quot; in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 19.</a></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">15.         In the context of the above, let me examine the submissions of Mr\nJain, the learned ASG, which is pivoted on the rationale (albeit an erroneous\none) that Ms Pillai&#x27;s interface with British Parliamentarians, will impinge\nupon security interest (read economic Interest) of the State; as it has anti-\nnational connotation. The power to impose such a fetter on Ms Pillai&#x27;s right\nto travel abroad, and the consequent impediment on her exchange of views\nwith British Parliamentarians, was traced by Mr Jain to clause 8(j) of the\n2010 O.M. Clause 8(j) of the 2010 O.M. reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">            &quot;(j) In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued without complete\n\n11-18\n        Working a Democratic Constitution, The Indian Experience: Granville Austin\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">WP(C)774/2015                                                                        Page 33 of 39</span>\n       parameters and/or case details against CI suspects, terrorists,\n      anti-national elements etc. in larger national interest....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">15.1 It was therefore asserted before me that Ms. Pillai could be\ncategorized as an &quot;anti-national element&quot; in the larger national interest.\nAccording to Mr Jain, since the intended activity of Ms Pillai had the\npotentiality of degrading the image of India in the eyes of foreign nations,\nleading to a regression in the country&#x27;s economic activities and endeavours,\nher journey out of the country could legitimately be interdicted to prevent\nher from espousing views which were against national interest or, in other\nwords, views which impinged upon the security of the State.                    The\nsubmission, therefore, was that, since the respondents considered Ms Pillai&#x27;s\nintended conversation/ speech with the British Parliamentarians against the\nnational interest, it necessarily, was grounded, in larger public interest.\n15.2 The difficulty in accepting this argument is three-fold.                 First,\nreasonable restrictions spoken of in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 19</a> do not advert to\nanti-national activities.   Pertinently, the word anti-national does not find a\nplace in most dictionaries; it is in effect a combination of two words. If one\nwere to deconstruct the meaning of the word anti-national, one would\nperhaps have to look to the meaning of the word, &quot;Nationalism&quot;. The\nnearest equivalent to the word &#x27;Nationalism&#x27; would be patriotism.\nPatriotism as a concept would be linked to nationhood.          Nationhood has\nseveral attributes which are, inter alia, inextricably connected with symbols,\nsuch as : the National Flag; the National Anthem; the National Song; and\nperhaps, the common history, culture, tradition and heritage that people of\nan organized State share amongst themselves.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_69\">15.3 In respect of each of these attributes of nationhood, there may be\ndisparate views amongst persons who form the nation. The diversity of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">WP(C)774/2015                                                       Page 34 of 39</span>\n views may relate to, not only, the static symbols, such as, the National Flag\nand National anthem, etc. but may also pertain to the tradition and heritage\nof the Nation and the manner in which they are to be taken forward.\nContrarian views held by a section of people on these aspects cannot be used\nto describe such section or class of people as anti-national. Belligerence of\nviews on nationalism can often lead to jingoism. There is a fine but distinct\nline dividing the two. Either way, views held, by any section or class of\npeople, by itself, cannot be characterized as anti-national activities.\n15.4 For anti-national activities to be brought within the limitation of\nclause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 19</a>, it would have to have a close nexus with the\nsecurity of the State.     Security of the State as indicated in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_104\">Romesh\nThappar</a>&#x27;s case can only be an &quot;aggravated form of prejudicial activities&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">which endangers the very existence of the State or in the very least, I would\nthink, threatens the life and limb of its citizens. Therefore, if the expression,\n&quot;anti-national elements&quot; found in clause 8(j) of the 2010 O.M. is to be\nbrought within the four corners of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 19</a>, its meaning will\nhave to be confined to activities of persons who fall in the category of\n&quot;counter intelligence suspects&quot; and/ or terrorists. The endeavour of Ms.\nPillai to engage with British Parliamentarians on the issues relating to\ndevelopmental activities in the Mahan coal block area, cannot be construed\nas an anti-national activity of the kind envisaged under clause 8(j) of the\n2010 O.M.\n15.5 Therefore, the action of the respondents, in issuing an LOC qua Ms.\nPillai with the object of preventing her from propagating and disseminating\nher views on developmental activities in the Mahan coal block area, cannot\nbe construed as a reasonable restriction, which would pass muster of the\nprovisions of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. That the right to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">WP(C)774/2015                                                      Page 35 of 39</span>\n freedom of speech and expression includes the right to propagate ones\nviews, which cannot be stifled or impeded, except on grounds alluded to in\nclause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 19</a>, is a constitutional principle recognized by our courts\nin a long line of judgements19. It is a right so well entrenched in our\nConstitution that, it cannot be dislodged, at this point in time of our nation&#x27;s\nhistory.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">15.6 Second, even if I were to accept that respondents could have issued an\nLOC for the stated purpose, by sourcing its power under clause 8(j) of 2010\nO.M., the exercise of the power in Ms Pillai&#x27;s case was fatally flawed. A\nplain reading of clause 8(j) would show that the expression &quot;anti-national&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">takes colour from the preceding term and/or expressions found in clause\n8(j). The clause by itself shows that it is a power which is exercisable by the\nState in exceptional cases, where it is entitled to side-step even the\nguidelines and parameters laid down in the O.M. itself. The power vested\non respondents being rare and exceptional it, necessarily, is required to be\nconfined to persons falling in specific categories, such as counter\nintelligence suspects, terrorists, and anti-national elements. The expression\nanti-national is followed by the abbreviated form of the word etcetera.\nTherefore, quite clearly the word anti-national, contextually can only take\ncolour from the words preceding it. To rule otherwise would result in\nallowing for a situation where any and every activity could be brought\nwithin the purview of clause 8(j).                     This being an exceptional power\nconferred on the State, which is to be exercised in the larger national\ninterest, it cannot be given a meaning wider than the purpose for which the\npower is vested in the State functionaries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">15.7 Therefore, to my mind, a person falling in the category of an anti-\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">19</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"304068\" id=\"span_73\">See <a href=\"/doc/304068/\" id=\"a_108\">Life Insurance Corporation of India vs Prof. Manubhai D.

Travelling abroad and espousing views, without any\ncriminal intent of the kind adverted to above, cannot, in my opinion, put Ms\nPillai in the category of an anti-national element.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">15.8 Third, what inhibits me from accepting the submission advanced on\nbehalf of the ASG, is that, if the view advanced on behalf of the respondents\nis accepted, it would result in conferring un-canalised and arbitrary power in\nthe executive, which could, based on its subjective view, portray any activity\nas anti-national. Such a situation, in a truly democratic country, which is\ngoverned by rule of law, is best avoided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_92\">15.9 I must indicate herein that in the writ petition there is a disclosure of\nthe fact that in respect of the protest led by Ms Pillai, in the Mahan coal\nblock area, a criminal case has been lodged in Mumbai, in which she has\nbeen enlarged on bail. The order granting bail has not put any condition in\nplace. There is no condition put by court with regard to restraint on travel.\nThese facts have not been disputed by the respondents in their counter-\naffidavit. There is also no case set up by the respondents that recourse to\nany provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_109\">Passports Act</a> has been taken vis-a-vis Ms Pillai.\nQuite clearly, therefore, there is no impediment put in place by any court or\nstatutory authority on Ms Pillai&#x27;s right to travel abroad and propagate her\nviews, on issues <a href=\"/doc/304068/\" id=\"a_110\">referred to above</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">15.10 The attempt of the respondents to link Greenpeace India with\nGreenpeace U.K. and Greenpeace International, by adverting to the screen\nshots of the latter&#x27;s website, in my opinion, cannot carry their case any\nfurther.   According to the respondents, the website of the Greenpeace\nInternational shows Greenpeace India and Greenpeace U.K. as its affiliates.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">WP(C)774/2015                                                    Page 37 of 39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\"> It is sought to be suggested that since Greenpeace India is affiliated to\nGreenpeace International, the illegality attached to the conduct of the latter,\nshould apply to the former as well as Greenpeace U.K.               In my view,\nmonitoring and regulation of funds received by Greenpeace International by\nitself cannot lead to any conclusion, at least at this stage, of alleged illegality\nhaving been committed by the said organization. Therefore, one cannot\nconclude that Greenpeace India has committed any illegality. Thus the\nattempt to inveigle Ms Pillai, in the illegality argument, via this route, must\nfail. The submission that Greenpeace International had intended to incur\nexpenses qua Ms Pillai&#x27;s travel and accommodation, is clearly unsustainable\nas there is no bar in Ms Pillai receiving &quot;foreign hospitality&quot; as against\n&quot;foreign contribution&quot;. This is clear on a conjoint reading of the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/748597/\" id=\"a_111\">Sections 9(e)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/652529/\" id=\"a_112\">6</a>, <a href=\"/doc/936597/\" id=\"a_113\">2(1)(h)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/936597/\" id=\"a_114\">2(1)(i)</a> of the FCRA.             Therefore, the\nsubmission made in this behalf is, in my view, being misconceived is,\naccordingly, rejected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">16.    Therefore, having regard to the aforesaid discussion, in my opinion,\nthe prayer made in the writ petition for quashing and setting aside the LOC\nissued qua Ms Pillai, is liable to be granted.         It is ordered accordingly.\nAccordingly, the following consequential prayers are also granted.\nRespondent no.2 shall expunge the endorsement &quot;off-load&quot; made on Ms\nPillai&#x27;s passport. Furthermore, respondents shall also remove Ms Pillai&#x27;s\nname from the &quot;data base&quot; maintained by them, pertaining to those\nindividuals, who are not allowed to leave the country. This is, in so far as\nprayers made in clause A (i) to (iii) are concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">16.1 As regards prayer clause B, no submissions were made during the\ncourse of the arguments, nor are any specifics alluded to in the instant case.\nThe prayer is, accordingly, declined.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">WP(C)774/2015                                                        Page 38 of 39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\"> 16.2 As regards prayer clause C, while Ms Jaising had in the passing,\nargued that respondents by their action had tarnished the reputation of Ms\nPillai by bracketing her as anti-national, the necessary ingredients for grant\nof compensation have not been adverted to with, specificity, in the body of\nthe writ petition. Even if I were to take a broad view of the pleadings, it\nmay not be appropriate to embark upon an exercise of ascertaining damages\nclaimed by Ms Pillai, while exercising writ jurisdiction. It would, however,\nbe open to Ms Pillai to take recourse to an appropriate civil remedy to\nagitate her rights in that behalf. Needless to say, if such an action is taken\nrecourse to, the respondents will have a right to defend the same, in\naccordance with law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">17.
