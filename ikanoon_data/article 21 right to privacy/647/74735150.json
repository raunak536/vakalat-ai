It must be\n      worthy of that confidence. A candidate wishing to join\n      the police force must be a person of utmost rectitude.\n      He must have impeccable character in integrity.

However, prosecution of\n               juveniles is in a separate class. Using criminal\n               prosecution faced by a candidate as a juvenile to form\n               an opinion about his suitability for appointment, is\n               arbitrary illegal and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 14</a> of the\n               Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">               II.

This was an offence, which the petitioner\n               allegedly committed, in or about 1995, when he was\n               about sixteen years of age.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                 25</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                        OA Nos.158/2019, 4333/2018, 3270/2019, 4118/2016, 271/2019 and 4363/2018\n\n\n\n\n5.2. Undoubtedly, on the date, when the offence was\nsaid to have been committed by the petitioner, he was\na &quot;juvenile&quot;, as defined under the <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_23\">Juvenile Justice\n(Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015</a> [in short\n&quot;the 2015 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_24\">JJ Act</a>&quot;]. <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 3(xiv)</a> of the 2015 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_26\">JJ Act</a>\nmandates [as one of the guiding principles] that a\nfresh start should be afforded to a child, who passes\nthrough the juvenile justice system by erasing all past\nrecords,    save    and     except,   where    special\ncircumstances demand otherwise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"51928266\" id=\"span_31\">5.3. This aspect was emphasized by the Supreme\nCourt in a judgment rendered in <a href=\"/doc/51928266/\" id=\"a_27\">Union of India and\nothers versus Ramesh Bishnoi</a> (2019) 19 SCC 710,\nwhere the appointment of the concerned persons, i.e.,\none Ramesh Bishnoi was cancelled on the ground\nthat a criminal case had been lodged against him\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 354</a>, <a href=\"/doc/162506/\" id=\"a_29\">447</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_30\">509</a> of\nthe IPC. In this case as well, at the time when the\nalleged offence was committed, Ramesh Bishnoi was\nwell below eighteen years of age.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">5.3(a). In the trial that ensued, Ramesh Bishnoi was\nacquitted. The Supreme Court, while noting that the\noffence could not be proved as neither the girl against\nwhom the alleged offence had been committed nor her\nparents stepped into the witness box, which resulted\nin acquittal of Ramesh Bishnoi, made the following\nobservations, having regard to the principle of fresh\nstart engrafted in <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 3(xiv)</a> of the 2015 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_32\">JJ Act</a>:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      &quot;8. From the facts, it is clear that at the time\n      when the charges were framed against the\n      respondent, on 30-6-2009, the respondent was\n      well under the age of 18 years as his date of\n      birth is 5-9-1991. Firstly, it was not disputed\n      that the charges were never proved against the\n      respondent as the girl and her parents did not\n      depose against the respondent, resulting in his\n      acquittal on 24-11-2011. Even if the allegations\n      were found to be true, then too, the respondent\n      could not have been deprived of getting a job on\n      the basis of such charges as the same had\n      been committed while the respondent was\n      juvenile. The thrust of the legislation i.e.\n      the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_33\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection\n      of Children) Act, 2000</a> as well as the\n      <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_34\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of\n      Children) Act, 2015</a> is that even if a\n      juvenile is convicted, the same should be\n      obliterated, so that there is no stigma with\n      regard to any crime committed by such\n      person as a juvenile. This is with the clear\n      object to reintegrate such juvenile back in\n      the society as a normal person, without\n      any stigma. <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 3</a> of the Juvenile\n      Justice (Care and Protection of Children)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                               26</span>\n                                     OA Nos.158/2019, 4333/2018, 3270/2019, 4118/2016, 271/2019 and 4363/2018\n\n\n\n\n                    Act, 2015 lays down guidelines for the\n                    Central Government, State Governments,\n                    the Board and other agencies while\n                    implementing the provisions of the said\n                    Act. In clause (xiv) of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 3</a>, it is clearly\n                    provided as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                    &quot;3.

In the present case, it is an admitted\n                    fact that the respondent was a minor\n                    when the charges had been framed\n                    against him of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_37\">Sections\n                    354</a>, <a href=\"/doc/162506/\" id=\"a_38\">447</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_39\">509</a> IPC. It is also not\n                    disputed that he was acquitted of the\n                    charges. However, even if he had been\n                    convicted, the same could not have been\n                    held against him for getting a job, as\n                    admittedly, he was a minor when the\n                    alleged offences were committed and the\n                    charges had been framed against him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">                    <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 3(xiv)</a> provides for the same and\n                    the exception of special circumstances\n                    does not apply to the facts of the present\n                    case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">                    10. Further, the case against the\n                    respondent is not with regard to the\n                    suppression of any conviction or charges\n                    having been framed against him. The\n                    respondent had very fairly disclosed about\n                    the charges which had been framed and\n                    his acquittal on the basis of no evidence\n                    having been adduced by the complainant\n                    against the respondent. In our considered\n                    view, the same can also not be said to be a\n                    suppression by the respondent, on the\n                    basis of which he could be deprived of a\n                    job, for which he was duly selected after\n                    following     the  due     process     and\n                    appointment having been offered to him.&quot;\n                    [emphasis is ours]\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_84\">16.

The suitability of a person\n\n     is to be adjudged for the post for which he has been\n\n     selected   and    the    candidate        has          to        fulfill         the\n\n     requirement of the job irrespective of his hailing from\n\n     rural or urban background. Moreover, the post of\n\n     Constable may be at the lowest rung of the hierarchy\n\n     but it is the first and direct interface of the police with\n\n     the general public and is of critical importance for the\n\n     reporting and investigation of criminal matters.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">18.
