Consumption of drug attracts\n\n<a href=\"/doc/894790/\" id=\"a_62\">section 27(b)</a> of NDPS Act, the punishment prescribed is 6\n\nmonths imprisonment or fine up to Rs.10,000/- or both. He\n\nfurther argued that so far as the offence under <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_63\">section 27(A)</a>\n\nof NDPS Act is concerned, there is no material that accused\n\nNo.2 financed for, or harboured those who are involved in\n\nillicit traffic of drugs. There is no material for conspiracy or\n\nabatement. The remand applications do not disclose reasons\n\nthat necessitate her detention in the custody.       Therefore,\n\naccused No.2 is entitled to be released on bail.\n\n\n4.4. By Sri Tomy Sebastian representing accused No.1 -\n\nShivaprakash\n\n\n      The statement of Ravishankar shows that he was\n\nintroduced to accused No.2 by Shivaprakash. Except this,\n\nthere is nothing to show that he participated in the parties\n\nand also that he consumed drugs.          In the statement of\n\nobjections filed by V.G.Tigadi, it is clearly stated that\n\nmaterials can be collected only after interrogation; that\n\nmeans there is no evidence against accused No.1. Accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                              14</span>\n\n\nNo.1 assures of his cooperation to the police for completing\n\nthe investigation and therefore he is entitled to anticipatory\n\nbail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\n4.5. By Sri C.H.Hanumantharaya representing accused-\n\n10 (Abhiswamy)\n\n\n        Unnecessarily, Abhiswamy is arraigned as accused No.\n\n10, but he could be considered as a witness for prosecution.\n\nStatement of Ravishankar shows that accused No.10 did not\n\nintroduce a peddler from Nigeria, rather it was one Ashwin\n\nBoogi i.e., accused 9.       Referring to the confessional\n\nstatement of Loom Pepper, i.e., accused 7, he argued that\n\nRavishankar did not come to know him for the first time\n\nthrough accused No.10, rather Ravishankar was in contact\n\nwith Loom Pepper since a year prior to 4.9.2020 and if\n\nRavishankar took the name of accused 10 by chance, it\n\ncannot be said that he was involved in drug racketing.\n\nTherefore accused No.10 appears to have been falsely\n\nimplicated. He is a petrol bunk owner as also a landlord. He\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    15</span>\n\n\nis always available for investigation. Hence he needs to be\n\nenlarged on anticipatory bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\n4.6.   By Sri Satyanarayana Chalke for accused No. 8\n\n       Statement of Ravishankar shows that a birthday party\n\nof accused No.8 was arranged on 28.6.2020 at 6.30 PM, but\n\nhis birthday falls on 18th July, therefore very participation of\n\naccused     No.8   in    the       birthday   party   is   doubtful.\n\nRavishankar&#x27;s statement also does not indicate consumption\n\nof drug by accused No.8. There was no recovery from him,\n\ntherefore no presumption can be drawn under <a href=\"/doc/852142/\" id=\"a_64\">section 35</a> of\n\nNDPS Act.     Absolutely there are no materials, chances of\n\nfalse inculpation cannot be ruled out.             Accused No.8 is\n\ntherefore entitled to anticipatory bail.\n\n\n4.7.      Argument      of   Sri     V.G.Tigadi,   Special   Public\n\nProsecutor\n\n\n       FIR need not be an encyclopedia, it is just a first\n\ninformation with regard to happening of a crime. The case\n\non hand is still under investigation. According to NDPS Act,\n\ncharge sheet can be filed within 180 days from the date of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    16</span>\n\n\nremand of accused to custody.                Still there is time to file\n\ncharge sheet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">       Statement made by B.K.Ravishankar shows a kind of\n\nconspiracy for promoting the consumption of drugs and\n\nparties were being arranged only for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating   the   sale    and    consumption            of   the    drugs.\n\nWhenever       parties      are    arranged          for   this    purpose,\n\nmanufacturers, financiers, peddlers and facilitators involve.\n\nTherefore, the prosecution case is that there is conspiracy,\n\nabout which the investigating officer is collecting materials.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">      The very purpose of participation of accused Nos. 2\n\nand 14 was to attract large number of consumers as they are\n\ncelebrities.     The     materials      so     far     collected      by     the\n\ninvestigating officer show that accused Nos. 2 and 14 are not\n\nonly consumers but also sellers and facilitators.                          Since\n\nparties were being arranged very frequently for promoting\n\nthe sale and the consumption, the total quantity of the drugs\n\nsold, distributed and consumed cannot be dissected. Each\n\nindividual might consume a very small quantity of drug, but\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               17</span>\n\n\nsale and consumption put together exceeds commercial\n\nquantity.   It is not as though any drug was not seized; some\n\nseized drug may indicate that      it is a small quantity; and\n\nseizure of drugs might be from the possession of some of the\n\naccused, but it does not necessarily mean that commercial\n\nquantity is not involved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      Scope of remand application is limited, it is only for\n\nthe purpose of seeking remand of the accused to custody.\n\nNames of witnesses are not disclosed for maintaining secrecy\n\nof investigation. There is threat to the witnesses.   Merely for\n\nthe reason that names of the witnesses are not disclosed, it\n\ncannot be a ground for granting bail. In a case of this type,\n\nwhat is essential is to go beyond the complaint or the\n\nremand application for understanding the seriousness of the\n\noffences. These offences are perpetrated against the society,\n\nno individual is a target. The youth of this country are being\n\nlured for promoting the consumption of drugs. In this view,\n\nquantity of the drug does not assume significance.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                               18</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">      There is compliance of <a href=\"/doc/1158106/\" id=\"a_65\">section 42 (2)</a> of NDPS Act. In\n\nfact in the report made by the ACP, Sri Goutham, there is\n\nreference to compliance of <a href=\"/doc/1158106/\" id=\"a_66\">section 42 (2)</a> of NDPS Act, and\n\ntherefore this ground is not available to the petitioners.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">      It is the duty of the accused to cooperate with the\n\ninvestigating officer.   A person against whom there are\n\nallegations of committing crime cannot claim immunity\n\nunder the garb of &quot;Right to Privacy&quot;. The arrested accused\n\nhave not been compelled to share their passwords, in fact\n\nthey have given passwords in respect of e-mail IDs in which\n\nthere are no incriminating materials, but they are not ready\n\nto share the passwords of other e-mail IDs, and for this\n\nreason, adverse inference may be drawn that those e-mail\n\nIDs contain materials helpful for prosecution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      It is true that B.K.Ravishankar is also one of the\n\naccused in Crime No. 588/2018, his statement which led to\n\nregistration of FIR in Crime No. 109/2020, was actually\n\nrecorded before his arrest in Crime No. 588/2018.            The\n\ndisclosure that he made in his statement is not hit by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               19</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_67\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, rather it is admissible\n\naccording to <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_68\">section 27</a> of the Evidence Act. He argued that\n\nif an accused reveals involvement of another accused in\n\ncommission of a crime, it also amounts to disclosure within\n\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_69\">section 27</a> of the Evidence Act.            This\n\nstatement is also relevant according to <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_70\">section 10</a> of\n\nEvidence Act. Therefore Ravishankar&#x27;s statement cannot be\n\ndiscarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">      It was his further argument that Crime No. 588/2018\n\nwas altogether a different crime, merely for the reason that\n\nin the charge sheet, it is mentioned that further investigation\n\nunder section 173 (8) of the Code is required, it does not\n\nmean that there was no need to register another FIR in\n\nCrime No. 109/2020. The first FIR was in respect of seizure\n\nof cocaine, the second one, i.e.      Cr. No.109/2020 is in\n\nrespect of an organized drug racket, hence both are different.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">      Regarding sample collection, he submitted that there\n\nwas no discrepancy actually. In respect of packing the scalp\n\nhairs, separate guidelines were issued. The CFSL returned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 20</span>\n\n\nthe hair samples to follow the guidelines, the same has been\n\nset right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">        He further argued that accused No. 2 tried to mislead\n\nthe investigation by filling water in the bottle when she was\n\nasked to give her urine sample.          And in regard to those\n\naccused who have sought anticipatory bail, he submitted\n\nthat the traces of drug remain in the hairs for quite long\n\ntime, and being aware of this they are avoiding arrest; and\n\nthey are waiting for traces of drug to vanish. For all these\n\nreasons, the petitions deserve to be dismissed.\n\n\n4.8.    Reply of Sri Hasmath Pasha and Sri Jayakumar S\n\nPatil\n\n\n        Conspiracy   requires   strict   proof,   there   must   be\n\nevidence indicating conspiracy prior to commission of\n\noffence.     <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act is not applicable\n\nonce a person is arrested, and therefore with the arrest of\n\nB.K.Ravishankar, his statement under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_72\">section 67</a> of the\n\nNDPS Act cannot be used for proving conspiracy.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                               21</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">      Crime   No.   588/2018     is   misused   for   entangling\n\naccused 2 and 14, who have earned good name in the film\n\nindustry. The police wanted media attraction, they foisted a\n\nfalse story of drug racketing. Post arrest statements of the\n\naccused cannot be made use of.        <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 37</a> of NDPS Act\n\ncannot be stretched too far to deny bail. Section 439 of the\n\nCode confers special powers on the High Court to grant bail\n\nin spite of rigors of <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_74\">section 37</a> of NDPS Act.\n\n\n4.9. Reply of Sri Bharat Kumar\n\n\n      In the remand application it is not stated that\n\npasswords are not shared, this aspect therefore cannot be a\n\nreason for declining bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">5. Discussion\n\n\n      The first aspect to be borne in mind is that while\n\ndeciding application for bail, the Courts cannot undertake\n\nthe task of assessing the evidence, this is well established\n\nprinciple. If bail is sought after completion of investigation,\n\nthe examination of the charge sheet is limited to finding out\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 22</span>\n\n\nthe existence of prima facie materials against the accused;\n\nnot more than that.          But when bail is sought when\n\ninvestigation is underway, the whole endevour becomes\n\ncircumscribed for the materials are scanty and the discretion\n\nmust be exercised with great circumspection.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">      6. Now before examining whether there are grounds\n\nfor granting the petitions, some points canvassed by Sri\n\nHasmath Pasha require to be dealt with. His argument was\n\nwith reference to personal liberty and protection against self\n\nincrimination enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_76\">20 (3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.      Indeed the law relating to bail is\n\nconcerned with personal liberty of a person, which is very\n\nsacrosanct. But the question is whether it is absolute, can a\n\nperson involved in a criminal case as an accused forcefully\n\nurge for his liberty.     In my opinion, the answer to this\n\nquestion lies in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 21</a> itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">             &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 21.</a> No person shall be deprived of\n      his life or personal liberty except according to\n      procedure established by law&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               23</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"234105\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1563495\" id=\"span_19\">The expression, &quot;except according to procedure established\n\nby law&quot; connotes a meaning inter alia that whenever law is\n\nset into motion for taking punitive action against a person\n\nfor having violated law, such person, until found by courts of\n\nlaw to be not guilty, renders himself disentitled to claim\n\nabsolute liberty. If the offences alleged are lethal to society\n\nand detrimental to the interest of the nation, personal liberty\n\nrecedes to background.     The interest of the nation or the\n\nsociety is always paramount. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court,\n\nhas, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1563495/\" id=\"a_79\">Sanjay Chandra vs CBI</a> [(2012) 1 SCC\n\n40] (a decision cited by Sri Hasmath Pasha), referred to its\n\nearlier decision in <a href=\"/doc/234105/\" id=\"a_80\">Vaman Narain Ghiya vs State of\n\nRajasthan</a> [(2009) 2 SCC 281], where it is held as below :</span></span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"234105\" id=\"span_20\">&quot;33.

State of Rajasthan</a>, (2009) 2 SCC 281, thus:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">         &quot;6. &quot;Bail&quot; remains an undefined term in\n         <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_82\">CrPC</a>. Nowhere else has the term been\n         statutorily   defined.    Conceptually,    it\n         continues to be understood as a right for\n         assertion of freedom against the State\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                          24</span>\n\n\n   imposing     restraints.    Since   the   UN\n   Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, to\n   which India is a signatory, the concept of\n   bail has found a place within the scope of\n   human rights. The dictionary meaning of\n   the expression &quot;bail&quot; denotes a security for\n   appearance of a prisoner for his release.\n   Etymologically, the word is derived from an\n   old French verb &quot;bailer&quot; which means to\n   &quot;give&quot; or &quot;to deliver&quot;, although another view\n   is that its derivation is from the Latin term\n   &quot;baiulare&quot;, meaning &quot;to bear a burden&quot;. Bail\n   is a conditional liberty. Stroud&#x27;s Judicial\n   Dictionary (4th Edn., 1971) spells out\n   certain other details. It states:\n&quot;... when a man is taken or arrested for felony,\nsuspicion of felony, indicted of felony, or any such\ncase, so that he is restrained of his liberty. And,\nbeing by law bailable, offereth surety to those\nwhich have authority to bail him, which sureties\nare bound for him to the King&#x27;s use in a certain\nsums of money, or body for body, that he shall\nappear before the justices of goal delivery at the\nnext sessions, etc. Then upon the bonds of these\nsureties, as is aforesaid, he is bailed--that is to\nsay, set at liberty until the day appointed for his\nappearance.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                           25</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">Bail may thus be regarded as a mechanism\nwhereby the State devolutes upon the community\nthe function of securing the presence of the\nprisoners,    and   at   the   same   time     involves\nparticipation of the community in administration\nof justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">7.

It has to\ndovetail two conflicting demands, namely, on the\none hand the requirements of the society for being\nshielded from the hazards of being exposed to the\nmisadventures of a person alleged to have\ncommitted a crime; and on the other, the\nfundamental canon of criminal jurisprudence viz.\nthe presumption of innocence of an accused till he\nis found guilty.

We will be failing in our duty if we do\n      not take note of the concept of liberty and its\n      curtailment by law. It is an established fact that a\n      crime though committed against an individual, in\n      all cases   it does not retain an individual\n      character. It, on occasions and in certain offences,\n      accentuates and causes harm to the society. The\n      victim may be an individual, but in the ultimate\n      eventuate, it is the society which is the victim. A\n      crime, as is understood, creates a dent in the law\n      and order situation. In a civilised society, a crime\n      disturbs orderliness. It affects the peaceful life of\n      the society. An individual can enjoy his liberty\n      which is definitely of paramount value but he\n      cannot be a law unto himself. He cannot cause\n      harm to others. He cannot be a nuisance to the\n      collective. He cannot be a terror to the society;\n      and that is why Edmund Burke, the great English\n      thinker, almost two centuries and a decade back\n      eloquently spoke thus:-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                   28</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                 &quot;Men are qualified for civil liberty, in\n         exact proportion to their disposition to put\n         moral chains upon their own appetites; in\n         proportion as their love to justice is above\n         their   rapacity;   in    proportion   as   their\n         soundness and sobriety of understanding\n         is above their vanity and presumption; in\n         proportion as they are more disposed to\n         listen to the counsel of the wise and good,\n         in preference to the flattery of knaves.\n         Society cannot exist unless a controlling\n         power upon will and appetite be placed\n         somewhere and the less of it there is\n         within, the more there must be without.

Confession is\n      a potency to make crime conclusive. The taint of\n      tendency, under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_95\">Art. 20(3)</a> and section 161 (1), is\n      more or less the same.

But this Article does not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                  31</span>\n\n\ncome in the way of volunteering to disclose the information,\n\neven though it is inculpatory. Whether such a disclosure is\n\nvoluntary or compulsive, is a question that a court has to\n\ndecide during trial, not at the stage of deciding an\n\napplication for bail.     What if an accused is reluctant to\n\ndisclose any information?        In such an event, sometimes,\n\nespecially    a   case   based   on   circumstantial   evidence,\n\ninvestigation never sees progress. In many a case, speaking\n\nfrom experience, voluntary disclosure made by an accused\n\nwhich is relevant according to <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 27</a> of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, has led to chain of circumstances being\n\ncompleted.          Therefore reluctance of the accused to\n\nvoluntarily share the passwords, as rightly argued by Sri.\n\nV.G. Tigadi, may lead to draw an adverse inference against\n\nthem.       To this extent the hands of the Courts are not\n\nfettered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">        13.

The\n\nprosecution has suspected conspiracy in organizing parties\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                               32</span>\n\n\nin the hotels and the home stay resorts for facilitating the\n\ntrafficking of drugs.

Mohammed Atik and Others</a> [(1998)\n\n4 SCC 351] wherein it is held that post arrest statement\n\nmade by a person before the police, whether by way of\n\nconfession or otherwise, relating to his involvement in the\n\nconspiracy, would not fall within the ambit of conspiracy.\n\nThis point can be better appreciated after conclusion of trial,\n\nit is too early to urge this point now.

That information became\n     relevant in a subsequent case, but the accused\n     contended that the said information is not\n     admissible in evidence in the subsequent case.\n     This High Court over-ruled the objection on the\n     ground that there is no such prohibition in <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_102\">Section\n     27</a> of the Evidence Act. It was observed that\n           &quot;it is immaterial whether the information\n     was supplied in connection with the same crime\n     or a different crime.&quot; The same principle applies to\n     a confession recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1046310/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 15</a> of the\n     TADA&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"80478198\" id=\"span_40\">15. The above observation makes it amply clear that\n\nthe statement of B.K.Ravishankar cannot be warded off for\n\nregistration of FIR in respect of suspected drug racketing.\n\nHis statement discloses altogether a different crime not\n\nconnected with Crime No.588/2018.            The argument that\n\nB.K. Ravishankar&#x27;s statement was taken after his arrest in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 34</span>\n\n\nthe earlier case and therefore hit by <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 25</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act is a question to be answered by the trial court,\n\nas any observation made now may come in the way of\n\ndrawing inferences by the trial court. However, at this stage\n\nthere is no impediment for considering his statement as it\n\ndiscloses involvement of many persons.              The question\n\nwhether such a disclosure falls within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_105\">Section\n\n27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act or not is made clear by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/80478198/\" id=\"a_106\">Mehboob Ali and\n\nAnother Vs. State of Rajasthan</a> [(2016) 14 SCC 640] a\n\ncase law cited by Sri. V.G. Tigadi. In paras 7 and 15, it is\n\nheld:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">               &quot;7.

It is apparent that on the basis of the\ninformation furnished by accused Mehboob Ali\nand Firoz and other accused, Anju Ali was\narrested. The fact that Anju Ali was dealing with\nforged currency notes was not to the knowledge\nof the Police. The statement of both accused has\nled to discovery of fact and arrest of co-accused\nnot known to police. They identified him and\nultimately statements have led to unearthing the\nracket of use of fake currency notes. Thus the\ninformation furnished by the aforesaid accused\npersons   vide   information   memos   is   clearly\nadmissible which has led to the identification and\narrest of accused Anju Ali and as already stated\nfrom possession of Anju Ali fake currency notes\nhad been recovered. As per information furnished\nby accused Mehboob and Firoz vide memos Exts.\nP41 and P42, the fact has been discovered by\nPolice as to the involvement of accused Anju Ali\nwhich was not to the knowledge of the Police.\nPolice was not aware of accused Anju Ali as well\nas the fact that he was dealing with fake\ncurrency notes which were recovered from him.\nThus the statement of the aforesaid accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                36</span>\n\n\n       Mehboob and Firoz is clearly saved by <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_108\">section 27</a>\n       of the Evidence Act. The embargo put by <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_109\">section\n       27</a> of the Evidence Act was clearly lifted in the\n       instant case. The statement of the accused\n       persons has led to the discovery of fact proving\n       complicity of other accused persons and the entire\n       chain of circumstances clearly makes out that\n       accused acted in conspiracy as found by the trial\n       court as well as the High Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">       16.

Sri.\n\nHasmath Pasha has placed reliance on several rulings viz.,\n\n(1).   <a href=\"/doc/3840417/\" id=\"a_112\">Kishan Chand vs State of Haryana</a> [2013(2) SCC\n\n502] and (2).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1036527\" id=\"span_45\"><a href=\"/doc/1036527/\" id=\"a_113\">Karnail Singh vs State of Haryana</a> [2009\n\n(8) SCC 539].</span>    He has referred to another judgment of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                37</span>\n\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Sarija Banu @ Janarthani @\n\nJanani and Another vs State Through Inspector of\n\nPolice [2004 (12) SCC 266],         in support of his argument\n\nthat even while deciding application for bail, compliance of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1158106/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 42(2)</a> assumes importance.         <a href=\"/doc/1158106/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 42(2)</a> has its\n\nown significance; though being very technical provision, it is\n\nfound to be essential in the light of rigors of punishment.\n\nBut Sri. V.G. Tigadi has produced a document which shows\n\na report being made by Sri. K.C. Goutham to his next higher\n\nofficer.    Whether     this   document     establishes   actual\n\ncompliance or not, is a question to be decided by the trial\n\ncourt, not at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">       18. The next point of argument was with respect to\n\nquantity of the contraband substance. It is true that <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_116\">NDPS\n\nAct</a> provides for graded punishments depending upon the\n\nquantity of the substance seized during raid, and in case of\n\nconsumption, the punishment is not so severe.               Sri.\n\nJayakumar S. Patil, Sri. Hasmath Pasha and Sri. Bharat\n\nKumar have referred to a judgment of the Bombay High\n\nCourt in the case of Rhea Chakraborty Vs. The Union of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                               38</span>\n\n\nIndia [Criminal Bail Application (Stamp) No.2386/2020].\n\nAccording to them, bail was granted to accused in that case\n\nas it was a case of mere consumption and the material on\n\nrecord did not indicate involvement of commercial quantity\n\nof   contraband.   Their   argument   was    whenever   seized\n\nsubstance is small quantity and if it is case of mere\n\nconsumption, the offence is bailable in accordance with\n\nSchedule II of the Code, and in this background the Bombay\n\nHigh Court granted bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">      19.    The learned counsel have referred to that\n\nparagraph of the judgment which is convenient to them.\n\nThere is no denial of the fact that bail was granted to\n\naccused in that      case, but it was       based on factual\n\ncircumstances.     In fact what the Bombay High Court has\n\nheld is quite contrary to the point urged by learned counsel.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259796\" id=\"span_48\">Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_117\">State of Punjab Vs. Baldev Singh</a> [(1999) 6 SCC 172], it\n\nhas been held by the Bombay High Court that irrespective of\n\nquantity of the contraband substance and the length of the\n\nperiod of imprisonment, all the offences enumerated in NDPS\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                              39</span>\n\n\nAct are non-bailable.   The offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_118\">Section\n\n27(A)</a> of NDPS Act is not quantity specific.     Therefore the\n\nargument of the learned counsel cannot be accepted.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">      20. Sri. V.G.Tigadi has made available the Case Diary.\n\nSince investigation is not yet completed, it may not be proper\n\nto disclose the names of witnesses; suffice it to state here\n\nthat it discloses many facets, not only of consumption but\n\nalso the purpose of arranging the parties with a view to\n\nfacilitating the supply and sale of drugs. It is there in the\n\ndiary that accused No.2 on the day of her birthday party,\n\nconsumed cocaine with Ravishankar and offered to sell it to\n\na witness for Rs.5,000/- for a gram.    Another witness has\n\nstated to have paid Rs.3,00,000/- to accused no.14 towards\n\npurchase of drug from her. Regular contact with peddlers by\n\nsome of the accused is diagrammatically depicted.         The\n\ninvestigating officer has also seized certain quantities of\n\ndrugs and electronic gadgets from the accused during\n\ninvestigation.   I find it irrelevant to mention here the\n\nquantity seized in view of observation made above.       It is\n\nmentioned that accused no.2 filled water in the bottle when\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                               40</span>\n\n\nshe was asked to give her urine sample. If this is true, it\n\nshows her intention to mislead the investigation. This much\n\nof evidence so far collected by the investigating officer rules\n\nout the argument that a false case has been registered. In\n\nregard to allegation of conspiracy is concerned, it is better\n\nnot to express any opinion,        as even after completion of\n\ninvestigation, no opinion can be given as it is a matter of\n\nstrict proof.   If according to prosecution the parties were\n\nbeing arranged for facilitating the sale of drug and it would\n\namount to conspiracy, it should be proved.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">      21.   Two lacunae that Sri. Hasmath Pasha and Sri\n\nBharat Kumar pointed out were about not obtaining FSL\n\nreport and improper collection of scalp hair samples. It is\n\ntrue that according to the guidelines, the report must be\n\nobtained within 15 days, and if the report is obtained at the\n\nearliest, it rules out manipulation.       The hair samples\n\nforwarded to Central Forensic Science Laboratory were sent\n\nback and this is not disputed by Sri. V.G. Tigadi. But what\n\nhe submitted was that hair samples were collected prior to\n\nreceiving the guidelines, and for this reason CFSL sent back\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                               41</span>\n\n\nthe samples to be resent to it after following the guidelines.\n\nCase diary contains a letter written by CFSL to this effect.\n\nUnless it is established as to how the interest of accused is\n\nsubstantially prejudiced, no importance can be given to\n\nprocedural infractions.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"247108\" id=\"span_52\">In a situation akin to this the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/247108/\" id=\"a_119\">Superintendent, Narcotics\n\nVs.

As regards accused no.10, what is stated by\n\nRavishankar is that he gave telephone number of accused\n\nno.7 to accused no.9.     Then with regard to accused no.8,\n\nRavishankar has stated that he (accused no.8) had arranged\n\na birthday party in a resort near Yelahanka and that he\n\nattended that party with accused no.2.       Ravishankar has\n\nalso stated that accused no.8 made a telephone call to him\n\nand told that his friend namely Santosh wanted drugs.\n\nTherefore it was argued by all three learned counsel for\n\naccused no.1, 8 and 10 that the statement of Ravishankar\n\ndoes not implicate the said accused of committing any\n\noffence. But the case diary discloses the active participation\n\nof these three accused in the parties where drug was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                    45</span>\n\n\nrampantly consumed.

The applicant for anticipatory bail must make\n\nout a case that his arrest is unreasonable; is intended to fix\n\nhim in a false case; and that the allegations against him are\n\nunfounded. If anticipatory bail is sought in the background\n\nof   accusation     of   committing      offences   having     adverse\n\nimplication on the society, the discretion must be exercised\n\nwith great circumspection to strike balance between personal\n\nliberty of a person and the interest of society.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"90251163\" id=\"span_63\">In the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/90251163/\" id=\"a_132\">P.

The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1438183/\" id=\"a_135\">State of\n\nPunjab Vs.

Drug abuse is a social malady.      While     drug\n      addiction eats into the vitals of the society, drug\n      trafficking   not only eats into the vitals of the\n      economy of a country, but illicit money generated\n      by drug trafficking is often     used      for    illicit\n      activities including encouragement of terrorism.\n      There is no doubt that drug trafficking, trading\n      and    its use, which is a global phenomena and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                     47</span>\n\n\n      has acquired            the dimensions of an epidemic,\n      affects the economic policies of the State, corrupts\n      the system and is detrimental to the future of               a\n      country. It has the effect of producing a sick\n      society         and harmful culture. Anti-drug justice\n      is a criminal dimension of social justice. The\n      United        Nations   Conventions         Against     Illicit\n      Trafficking In Narcotic Drugs &amp; Psychotropic\n      Substances which was held in Vienna, Austria in\n      1988 was perhaps one of the first efforts, at an\n      international           level, to tackle the menace of\n      drug trafficking throughout the comity of nations.\n      The   Government         of   India   has    ratified    this\n      convention&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">      28.       I    opine:   Youth,     the   most    precious         and\n\nindescribable phase of life.        The youth are the epitome of\n\nidealism,   enthusiasm and courage.               Swami Vivekananda\n\nsaid, &quot;My child, what I want is muscle of iron and nerve of\n\nsteel, inside which dwells a mind of the same material as\n\nthat of which the thunderbolt is made&quot;. Muscles of iron and\n\nnerves of steel simply refer to the physical strength one\n\nshould possess.         And mind as thunderbolt implies the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                               48</span>\n\n\nmental or psychological ability a Man should have.            Such\n\nphysic and psyche are not only the embodiments of\n\nyouthfulness, but also the representation of productive\n\nfuture.     Bothersome brutality dangerously affecting the\n\nyoung is substance abuse. The ill effect of this substance\n\nnot just costs the physical and psychological abilities of an\n\nindividual but spreads a dark shadow on the future of the\n\nsociety.    The courts should not remain oblivious of this\n\nmalady even while deciding application for bail.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">      29.     Then, as argued by Sri. V.G. Tigadi, if the\n\npetitioners   have   remained      away     from      interrogation\n\npurposefully to see that traces of drug should vanish from\n\ntheir scalp hair, it only shows their ulterior motive.        It is\n\nrecorded in the case diary that accused no.10 - Abhiswamy\n\n@ Abhijit Rangaswamy is likely to fly off India. These being\n\nthe   circumstances,    if   anticipatory      bail   is   granted,\n\ninvestigation may hamper.       Of course conditions may be\n\nimposed, but their custodial interrogation to unearth the\n\nhidden evidence appears to be very much essential. Hence I\n\nfind no case for granting anticipatory bail.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                           49</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">     From the foregoing discussion, all the petitions are\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">                                    Sd/-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">                                   JUDGE\n\n\n\n\nckl/sd\n </p>","numcites":46,"numcitedby":2,"docsource":"Karnataka High Court","citetid":194928649,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"c h hanumantharaya ","formInput":"c%20h%20hanumantharaya%20"},{"value":"anticipatory bail","formInput":"anticipatory%20bail"},{"value":"siddharam satlingappa mhetre ","formInput":"siddharam%20satlingappa%20mhetre%20"},{"value":"sec.27 of evidence act","formInput":"sec.27%20of%20evidence%20act"},{"value":"tomy sebastian","formInput":"tomy%20sebastian"},{"value":"Hasmath pasha","formInput":"Hasmath%20pasha"},{"value":"grant of bail","formInput":"grant%20of%20bail"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"section 27 of ndps","formInput":"section%2027%20of%20ndps"},{"value":"Ragini Dwivedi","formInput":"Ragini%20Dwivedi"},{"value":"ndps act","formInput":"ndps%20act"},{"value":"article 20(3)","formInput":"article%2020%283%29"},{"value":"section 438 of crpc","formInput":"section%20438%20of%20crpc"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"drug trafficking","formInput":"drug%20trafficking"},{"value":"Veeranna Tigadi","formInput":"Veeranna%20Tigadi"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"adverse inference","formInput":"adverse%20inference"},{"value":"\" anticipatory bail\"","formInput":"%22%20anticipatory%20bail%22"},{"value":"sec.27 of ndps act","formInput":"sec.27%20of%20ndps%20act"}],"cats":[{"value":"admissibility-of-information-provided-by-accused","formInput":"tag:admissibility-of-information-provided-by-accused"},{"value":"punishment-for-production-of-manufactured-drugs,sell-or-purchase-drugs","formInput":"tag:punishment-for-production-of-manufactured-drugs,sell-or-purchase-drugs"},{"value":"punishment-for-abetment, criminal-conspiracy","formInput":"tag:punishment-for-abetment, criminal-conspiracy"},{"value":"non-bailable-offences","formInput":"tag:non-bailable-offences"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
