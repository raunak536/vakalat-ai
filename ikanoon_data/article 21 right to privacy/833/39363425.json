He joined\n\nthe ruling National Conference in the year 1985-86 and served as Zonal\n\nSecretary of the Youth National Conference. He is stated to have contested\n\nAssembly Election from Akhnoor Constituency as an independent candidate\n\nsupported by Shiv Sena. Later, he joined Indian National Congress in 2002 and\n\nserved as General Secretary DCCI, Jammu. He is also stated to be a Committee\n\nMember of Government Girls High School, Akhnoor and Government Boys\n\nHigh School Akhnoor. He is also stated to have founded a &quot;Youth Action\n\nCommittee&quot; and led various agitations for the poor and needy. According to the\n\npetitioner, his selfless social service earned him commendation certificate along\n\nwith cash reward issued by the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Jammu\n\nfollowed by an identity card issued in his favour recognizing him as a social\n\nworker.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                        2                       OWP No. 511/2005</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The case of the petitioner is that in the year 1994, he led a strong agitation\n\nagainst illegal manufacturing of country liquor in Akhnoor and exposed the\n\nnexus of police and liquor manufacturers. The police got annoyed and\n\nmanufactured false, frivolous and fabricated record against him whereby he was\n\ndeclared as a history sheeter, however, he has neither been involved in any\n\ncriminal activity nor punished by any court of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.    Allegation of the petitioner is that on 24.07.2005 he was telephonically\n\ncalled by respondent No. 5-Station House Officer (SHO), Police Station,\n\nAkhnoor informing him that he was called by respondent No. 4-Superintendent\n\nof Police (SP) (Rural) Jammu. On 25.07.2005, he was carried by respondent\n\nNo.6-Havaldar Durga Dass, deputed by respondent No. 5, to the office of\n\nrespondent No.4, where he was surprised to see himself amongst hardcore\n\ncriminals and history-sheeters of the State. He produced relevant record\n\npertaining to his being a social worker and a leader of repute, however, he was\n\nnot only abused and manhandled, but was subjected to third degree treatment.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, he was summoned by respondent No. 4 as a history-\n\nsheeter on the basis of some eleven years old file, manufactured and manipulated\n\nat his back without issuance of prior show cause notice which is repugnant to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">4.    Petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India read with Section 103 of the Constitution of erstwhile\n\nState of J&amp;K for quashment/deletion of his name from the history sheet and\n\nfurther directing the respondents to pay damages of Rs. 10.00 lacs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                         3                        OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.    Countervailing the stand of the petitioner, respondents are affront with the\n\ncontention that in the year 1989, there were communal riots among the members\n\nof Hindu and Sikh community. Petitioner delivered provocative speeches in the\n\ngathering in Tehsil Akhnoor, as a result fundamentalists led by him instigated the\n\npublic at large against the followers of Sant Kabir Ji and Ashrams of the said\n\nSect at fifteen places were set ablaze. It is alleged that petitioner continued his\n\nparticipation in creating communal riots between different groups and races, with\n\nthe modus operandi to project himself as a leader. Citing another instance, it is\n\ncontended by the respondents that a piece of land was allotted in the name of\n\nMst. Sakina Bibi in Akhnoor. In 1994, when her husband, namely, Khuda Baksh\n\nraised construction of shop on the said land, petitioner along with his associates\n\nforcibly installed a statute of Lord Shiva on the said piece of land and made an\n\nattempt to give communal tinge to the issue and created communal tension\n\nleading to law and order problem. Therefore, Surveillance Register of the\n\npetitioner was opened on 20.04.1994 by SHO, P/S, Akhnoor and right from 1989\n\nto 2008, nine cases came to be registered against him, wherefrom it surfaced that\n\npetitioner has been instrumental in making provocative speeches which flared the\n\ncommunal tension, instigated the mob to indulge in arson and looting, with\n\nrespect to which, a history sheet in Form No. 185 came to be opened against the\n\npetitioner. It is further contention of the respondents that petitioner is involved in\n\nas many as 09 criminal cases w.e.f. 1989 to 2008, out of which, two FIRs No.\n\n1134/1994 and 41/1995 have been challaned against him and FIR No. 171/2008\n\nis under investigation and remaining six FIRs including FIRs No. 4/1989,\n\n16/1994, 214/1993, 170/1998, 171/1988 &amp; 177/2008 have been closed untraced.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        4                        OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.    According to the respondents, history sheet of an individual, whose\n\nantecedents are of criminal nature and who is often found indulging in criminal\n\nand anti social activities, is permitted under Police Rules, where an officer of the\n\nrank of Inspector or above is competent to open a history sheet. It is duty of the\n\npolice to keep an eye on such elements and take preventive measures to curb the\n\nactivities of such persons in time. As per records maintained in the Police\n\nStation, history sheet of the petitioner contains the grounds for opening the\n\nhistory sheet and it was approved by Senior Officers of the time. It is further\n\nsubmission of the respondents that it is a confidential and privileged document\n\nand action by the police was on the basis of cases registered and reports and\n\ninputs received from CID and other sources.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">7.    It is also contention of the respondents that an alternative remedy is\n\navailable to the petitioner to approach and make a representation to Senior Police\n\nOfficers, who are competent to verify the entries made in the history sheet and\n\nclose the same in case they are satisfied that now petitioner is not indulging in\n\nsame activities and has mend himself. Respondents have prayed for dismissal of\n\nthe writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">8.    Petitioner in his rejoinder affidavit, at the outset, has questioned\n\njurisdiction of the respondents and the procedure followed to prepare\n\nSurveillance Register No. 10 against him. It is submission of the petitioner that in\n\nview of Sub Rule 3(a) of Rule 43 of J&amp;K Police Manual, it is only the\n\nSuperintendent of Police, who is vested with the power to enter the name of a\n\nperson in the Surveillance Register No. 10 and SHO has no jurisdiction to do so.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                             5                           OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">9.    It is further contention of the petitioner that history sheet against him was\n\nopened on 20.04.1994 whereby his name was entered in the Surveillance\n\nRegister and therefore, any FIR registered after the said date, could not be taken\n\ninto consideration. Denying his involvement in the instance of 1989 pertaining to\n\nSant Kabir Ji Ashram, Baba Amarnath Ji agitation of 2008 and regarding\n\ninstallation of statute of Lord Shiva on the land of Khuda Baksh, petitioner has\n\nsubmitted that no FIR was lodged against him pertaining to the said instances\n\nand, therefore, allegations of the respondents are absurd and vague. He further\n\nsubmits that Baba Amarnath Ji agitation took place in the year 2008 after he was\n\ndeclared habitual offender in 1994. He further submits that FIR No. 4/1989 was\n\nnot challaned in any court of law, he has been acquitted in FIRs No. 14/1994 &amp;\n\n42/1995 and his name does not figure in FIRs No. 214/1993, 170/1998 and\n\n177/2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">10.

Rule 699 provides for surveillance register to be written up by the officer\n\nin charge of a police station personally or by an Assistant Sub-inspector in a clear\n\nand neat script and no entry can be made in Part I except by an order of a\n\ngazetted officer and sub Rule (2) provides that &quot;ordinarily, before the name of\n\nany person is entered in Part II of the surveillance register, a history sheet\n\nshall be opened for such person&quot; and it is pertinent to mention that entry in Part\n\nII of the Register can be made only at the discretion of the Superintendent of\n\nPolice. Rule 700 contemplates a notice to Lambardars and the surveilles after the\n\nname of a person is entered in the surveillance register in Form No. 182. Rule\n\n701 lays down mode of surveillance by providing an element of surprise as an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                        7                        OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\nessential ingredient for affecting surveillance. Rule 702 lays down a procedure\n\nfor preparation of history sheets and as per this Rule, initial preparation of a\n\nhistory sheet requires great care and is required to be prepared by the officer in\n\ncharge of a police station himself or through an experienced Assistant Sub-\n\nInspector under specific orders. Finally, Rule 703 postulates the opening of\n\nhistory sheets and provides that history sheet, if does not already exist, shall be\n\nopened in Form No. 183 for every person whose name is entered in the\n\nsurveillance register, except conditionally released convicts. It is pertinent to\n\nmention that Rule 721 of the Police Rules specifically lays down that all records\n\nconnected with police surveillance are confidential and nothing contained therein\n\nmay be communicated to any person. It also provides that neither inspection of\n\nthe surveillance records can be allowed nor copies can be given, save as provided\n\nin the rules. However, it protects the rights of district and Illaqa Magistrates to\n\nexamine such records in accordance with Rules 23 and 24 of the Police Rules\n\nregarding their production in the court under Chapter XXI of the rules. It is\n\nevident from the perusal of the aforementioned rules that a detailed provision has\n\nbeen made in the Police Rules with respect to preparation, maintenance of the\n\nsurveillance register as also the history sheets and confidentiality of the\n\nsurveillance records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">14.   Petitioner has questioned the impugned entry in the surveillance register\n\ninter alia on the grounds; that he has been declared habitual offender and a\n\nhistory-sheeter without issuance of prior show cause notice, his name was\n\nentered in the surveillance register on the basis of some eleven years old file, and\n\nany FIR registered after opening of the history sheet against him on 24.04.1994,\n\ncannot be taken into consideration. Petitioner has also questioned jurisdiction of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                           8                          OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe respondents as also the procedure followed to prepare the surveillance\n\nregister against him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_10\">15.   In so far as issuance of prior notice is concerned, Rules 721 of the Police\n\nRules, as already stated, specifically provides that all records connected with\n\npolice surveillance are confidential and nothing contained therein can be\n\ncommunicated to any person. It also provides that neither inspection of the\n\nsurveillance record can be allowed nor copies can be provided to anybody, save\n\nofcourse, as provided in the Rules. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/971635/\" id=\"a_9\">Malak Singh</a>\n\n(Supra) has also held that as surveillance is contemplated to be discreet and\n\nconfidential, observance of the principles of natural justice may defeat the very\n\nobject of surveillance. Relevant except of the judgment for the facility of\n\nreference reads as below:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">               &quot;7. As we said, discreet surveillance of suspects, habitual and\n               potential offenders, may be necessary and so the maintenance of\n               history sheet and surveillance register may be necessary too, for the\n               purpose of prevention of crime. History sheets and surveillance\n               registers have to be and are confidential documents. Neither the\n               person whose name is entered in the register nor any other member\n               of the public can have access to the surveillance register. The\n               nature and character of the function involved in the making of an\n               entry in the surveillance register is so utterly administrative and\n               non-judicial, that it is difficult to conceive of the application of the\n               rule of audi alteram partem. Such enquiry as may be made has\n               necessarily to be confidential and it appears to us to necessarily\n               exclude the application of that principle. In fact observance of the\n               principles of natural justice may defeat the very object of the rule\n               providing for surveillance.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">16.   It is evident from the afore-quoted observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n\nthat issuance of prior notice and principles of natural justice are not attracted in\n\nsuch cases, as it may defeat the very purpose of surveillance.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">17.   Be that as it may, it is stand of the respondents that surveillance register of\n\nthe petitioner was opened on 20.04.1994 by SHO Police Station Akhnoor and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                        9                        OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\nright from 1989 to 2008, nine cases came to be registered against him with\n\nrespect to which a history sheet in Form No. 185 came to be opened against him.\n\nTherefore, the entire stand of the respondents is based on the surveillance register\n\nstated to have been opened against the petitioner on 20.04.1994. Be it noted that\n\nrespondents have failed to produce any surveillance register against the petitioner\n\nin the present case. It is only history sheet of the petitioner which has been\n\nproduced and as a matter of fact, Mrs. Monika Kohli, learned Sr. AAG appearing\n\nfor the respondents has placed on record a letter bearing No. 925/5-1/PSA dated\n\n15.07.2023 of SHO, Police Station, Akhnoor, to the effect that apart from the\n\nhistory sheet already produced in this Court, there is no surveillance record of the\n\npetitioner available in the police station. As already discussed, Rule 699 of the\n\nPolice Rules provides for surveillance register to be written by the Officer\n\nIncharge of a police station personally or by an Assistant Sub Inspector in a clear\n\nand neat script. Sub Rule (2) provides that &quot;ordinarily, before the name of any\n\nperson is entered in Part II of the surveillance register, a history sheet shall be\n\nopened for such person.&quot; It implies that entry in a surveillance register can be\n\nmade on the basis of material provided by the history sheet. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_12\">Ordinarily the names\n\nof persons with previous criminal record including proclaimed offenders,\n\nprevious convicts or persons having already been placed on security for good\n\nbehavior, are entered in the surveillance register. Aside, the names of persons\n\nreasonably believed to be habitual offenders or receivers of stolen property\n\nwhether convicted or regardless of conviction, may also be entered in the\n\nsurveillance register, subject to the caveat that such an entry can only be made by\n\nan order of Superintendent of Police, who is prohibited from delegating his\n\nauthority. The scheme of surveillance register No. 10 under Rule 698 of Police\n\nRules is sufficient to indicate that vigil on a history sheeted person cannot be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                         10                       OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\nmade permanent and that too in perfunctory fashion, as it involves the freedom of\n\nlife and liberty of an individual. There is no quarrel to the settled position of law\n\nas held by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/971635/\" id=\"a_10\">Malak Singh</a> (supra) that discrete\n\nsurveillance of suspects, habitual and potential offenders may be imperative,\n\nnecessitating maintenance of history sheet and surveillance register for the\n\npurpose of prevention of crime. The police is indeed vested with the discretion to\n\nmaintain a history sheet and surveillance register of the suspects, habitual and\n\npotential offenders as the case may be. However, this discretion conferred on the\n\npolice has both objective and subjective attributes. The object sought to be\n\nachieved by maintenance of surveillance register and history sheet is the\n\nprevention of crime, however, the subjective satisfaction of a police officer must\n\nbe informed of valid and cogent reasons.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">18.   True it is that police is vested with the power and obligation to maintain\n\nlaw and order and keep vigil and surveillance not only on the accused but also on\n\nthe suspects in the larger interest of public. However, before entering the name of\n\nan individual in the history sheet or surveillance register, the action of the police\n\nmust be supported by sufficient material and cannot be left on the whims and\n\ncaprice of the police. It is a matter of common knowledge that while history sheet\n\nof a person for surveillance and observance is opened, such person is frequently\n\nasked to appear before Law Enforcement Agencies for questioning, whenever a\n\ncrime is committed in a particular area. It certainly restricts the movement of said\n\nindividual and he is undermined in the estimation of general public and it is an\n\ninfringement of right of an individual for free movement. It is in this context that\n\nconcerned Police Officer is obliged to examine the materials and then decide\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                          11                      OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\nobjectively and rationally before opening the history sheet or entering the name\n\nof the individual in the surveillance register.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">19.   Reverting to the present case, it appears that history sheet of the petitioner\n\nwas opened on 24.04.1994 and not the surveillance register, as respondents have\n\nfailed to produce any surveillance register in the case. The respondents in their\n\ncounter affidavit have contended that from 1989 to 2008, nine cases came to be\n\nregistered against the petitioner wherefrom it came to the fore that he was\n\ninstrumental in making provocative speeches which flared the communal tension,\n\ninstigated the mob to indulge in arson and looting, therefore, history sheet of the\n\npetitioner came to be opened. There is admission on the part of respondents that\n\nsix FIRs against the petitioner were closed untraced. Petitioner has been\n\nchallaned in two FIRs and one FIR was under investigation. Learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner in the rejoinder affidavit has placed on record copies of judgments\n\nto indicate that petitioner has since been acquitted in two FIRs No. 114/1994 and\n\n42/1995 by learned Munsiff (JMIC), Akhnoor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">20.   Allegation against the petitioner is that during communal riots between the\n\nmembers of the Hindu and Sikh community, petitioner delivered provocative\n\nspeeches and fundamentalists led by him instigated the public against the\n\nfollowers of Sant Kabir Ji and the Ashrams of the said Sect at different places\n\nwere set ablaze. Petitioner is also alleged to have forcibly installed statute of\n\nLord Shiva when one Khuda Baksh attempted to raise construction of a shop on\n\nhis land. Petitioner is also alleged to have played a role during Baba Amarnath\n\nagitation of 2008. However, respondents have failed to produce any FIR against\n\nthe petitioner with respect to these incidents and apparently Baba Amarnath\n\nagitation took place in the year 2008 i.e. after opening of history sheet against the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                        12                       OWP No. 511/2005</span>\n\n\n\n\npetitioner in the year 1994. On basis of record produced by the respondents,\n\npetitioner is not found involved in any incident on the basis of which history\n\nsheet against him was opened in 1994. Most of the FIRs, made basis for action\n\nagainst the petitioner pertained to the period after history sheet against him was\n\nopened.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_16\">21.   Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/971635/\" id=\"a_11\">Malak Singh</a> (supra), while dwelling upon\n\nvarious provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_12\">Punjab Police Act, 1861</a> (PPA) and the rules framed\n\nthereunder has made various observations with respect to duties of the police\n\nofficers to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace etc.,\n\nmaintenance of surveillance register, discreet surveillance and the nature and\n\ncharacter of the function involved in making of an entry in the surveillance\n\nregister, but with a caveat, that all this does not mean that Police have license to\n\nenter the name of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance register and\n\nsqueeze the fundamental freedom guaranteed to the citizens.

Back to the case, it is manifest from the contents of the history sheet that\n\nFIRs lodged against the petitioner were either closed untraced or he has been\n\nacquitted by the competent court of law. Even in the FIRs registered against the\n\npetitioner after history sheet against him was opened on 24.04.1994, petitioner is\n\nnot found involved in any case. The respondent authorities have failed to enter\n\nthe name of petitioner in surveillance register, despite lapse of about three\n\ndecades after history sheet was opened against him in the year 1994, probably for\n\nthe reason that cases against him were either closed untraced, or he was acquitted\n\nin couple of cases by the competent Court of Law. Be that as it may, petitioner\n\ncannot be put to permanent surveillance or vigil as a history sheeter in absence of\n\nsurveillance register duly maintained in accordance with law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">23.   The facts and circumstances attending the present case, indeed do not\n\nreflect the adherence to the exercise of discretion of the respondent authorities in\n\na fair and dispassionate manner in accordance with the principle of law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">24.   In the context of what has been discussed and observed hereinabove, what\n\ncomes to the fore is that since surveillance of an individual is contemplated to be\n\ndiscreet and confidential, observance of the principles of natural justice are not\n\nattracted in such cases as same may defeat the very object of surveillance.\n\nHowever, an accused or a suspect cannot be put to permanent surveillance or\n\nvigil as a history sheeter in absence of surveillance register duly maintained in\n\naccordance with law.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                         14                      OWP No. 511/2005</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">25.    Having regard to what has been discussed above, I am of the considered\n\nview that continuous retention of the petitioner in the history sheet in absence of\n\nany surveillance register, and that too in a perfunctory manner, without\n\napplication of mind, is not only illegal, but unconstitutional. Viewed thus,\n\npresent petition is allowed and respondents are directed to remove name of\n\npetitioner from the history sheet within a period of four weeks from the date copy\n\nof this judgment is made available to them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">26.
