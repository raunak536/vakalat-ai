The information sought (RBI inspection reports of more than 08 entities for 3\nyears) by the applicant is voluminous in nature and is spread across various\nlocations/ offices/ departments. The exercise of collating, compiling,\nexamining/scrutinizing and redacting RBI inspection reports as sought would\ndisproportionately divert the resources of Public Authority and hence we regret\nour inability to provide the requested information in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 7(9)</a> of RTI\nAct, 2005.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">       Moreover, RBI inspection reports are based on facts and figures furnished\nby supervised entities (third parties) and are treated as confidential. For disclosure\nof RBI inspection reports, we have to examine whether disclosure of entire\ninformation could be considered as premature in terms of para 77 of Supreme\nCourt judgement dated 16.12.2015 in RBI vs. Jayantilal Mistry &amp; Ors.&quot; In that\nevent it is exempt under <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8 (1)(a)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005. In case of intended\ndisclosure of RBI Inspection Reports, we are also required to ascertain whether\npart of information falls within any of the exempted items under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_5\">9</a>\nof the RTI Act. If any part of requested information qualifies for exemption, CPIO is\nrequired to sever/blackout such part.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                          2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\"> 2. The cases where the inspection / RAR was conducted within 3 years of the date\nof application are considered. We have issued show cause notices to the regulated\nentities mentioned in the application based on IR/RAR where processing of the\nreport is completed. As the documents sought by the applicant are related to\nother banks, i.e third party, we have issued notice under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11(1)</a> read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_7\">section 11(2)</a> of the RTI Act, to the following entities for making submission as to\nwhether the information may be disclosed or not. Copies of the notices are\nenclosed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">Being dissatisfied, the Appellant filed a First Appeal dated 02.04.2022. FAA&#x27;s\norder, dated 20.05.2022, upheld the reply of the CPIO.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied, the appellant approached the Commission with\nthe instant Second Appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">The following were present:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">Appellant: Present through Video-Conference.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">Respondent: Shri Vinod Kumar, DGM and Shri Abhijeet Kaushal, Legal Officer\npresent through Video-Conference.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">The written submissions of the Appellant and the Respondent are taken on\nrecord.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">The Appellant, during the hearing, reiterated the contents of his RTI application\nand instant appeal and submitted that the Respondent has wrongly not provided\ninformation to him on his RTI application. He further submitted that the\ninformation denied is been covered in the directions of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nJayantilal Mistry case as well as the contempt petition in Girish Mittal case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147621712\" id=\"span_2\">Also,\nHon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/147621712/\" id=\"a_8\">Commr. Of Police v. D.K. Sharma, WP (C) No.</a> 12428 of\n2009, dated 15-12-2010, wherein it was held that: &quot;...Court is inclined to concur\nwith the view expressed by the CIC that in order to deny the information under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                         3</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI Act</a> the authority concerned would have to show a justification reference to\none of the specific clauses under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8 (1)</a> of the RTI Act.&quot; No justification has\nbeen showed by the CPIO under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_11\">section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">The Appellant further reiterated his written submissions, which states as under:\n&quot;In the judgment under review, this Court has also held after examining the\nprovisions of the Act that the Information Commission decides matters which may\naffect the rights of third parties and hence there is requirement of judicial mind.\nFor example, under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, there is no obligation to furnish\ninformation including commercial confidence, trade secrets, or intellectual\nproperty, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of the third\nparty, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest\nwarrants the disclosure of such information. Similarly, the right to privacy of a\nthird party, which is part of his personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution, may be breached if a particular kind of information, purely of\npersonal nature may be directed to be furnished by the concerned authority. To\nprotect the rights of third parties, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11</a> of the Act provides that where a\nCentral Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case\nmay be, intends to disclose any information or record or part thereof, may on a\nrequest made under the Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party\nand has been treated as confidential by that third party, a written notice will have\nto be given to such third party inviting such party to make a submission in writing\nor orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such\nsubmission of the third party can be kept in view while taking a decision about\ndisclosure of the information. The decision taken by the Central Public Information\nOfficer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n11</a> of the Act is appealable under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 19</a> of the Act before the Information\nCommission and when the Information Commission decides such an appeal, it\ndecides only whether or not the information should be furnished to the citizen in\nview of the objection of the third party. Here also the Information Commission\ndoes not decide the rights of a third party but only whether the information which\nis held by or under the control of a public authority in relation to or supplied by\nthat third party could be furnished to a citizen under the provisions of the Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">Hence, the Information Commission discharges administrative functions, not\njudicial functions.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">The Respondent, during the hearing, reiterated the contents of their written\nsubmissions, which states as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_4\">&quot;It is humbly submitted that the CPIO has already provided point-wise reply to the\nqueries against the RTI application filed by the appellant in accordance with the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         4</span>\n provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_17\">RTI Act</a> within the statutory time limit of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">RTI Act</a>. It is also\nsubmitted that the specific Information sought for by the appellant is spread\nacross various files, and hence, culling out the Information and compiling the\nsame in the form sought by the appellant will disproportionately divert the\nresources of the Reserve Bank in an unreasonable way in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 7(9)</a> of\nthe RTI Act, 2005. Further, disclosure of certain information in the reports may be\nsubject to exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_20\">sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_21\">9</a> of the RTI Act. Therefore, FAA has\nobserved that even if the CPIO is to allow the Appellant to inspect the records, the\nCPIO would be required to peruse all the documents and sever/ blackout the\nexempt information beforehand. At the same time, it is also incumbent upon the\nCPIO to examine each point in the reports and consider whether the disclosure of\ninformation would be premature in terms of para 77 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\njudgement in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_22\">Reserve Bank of India v. Jayantilal Mistry</a>, 2016 (3) SCC 525. This\nwould heavily encumber the resources of the public authority. Therefore, FAA has\nconsidered it appropriate not to direct the CPIO to allow inspection of the files.\nFurther, the FAA has also passed a reasoned order in the first appeal preferred by\nthe appellant. Therefore, the contention of the appellant that CPIO &amp; Appellate\nAuthority have denied information with malafide intention is incorrect and denied.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">8. It is submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1156532/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 21</a> of the RTI Act provides protection of action taken\nin good faith. The CPIO has considered the application of the appellant within the\npurview of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_24\">RTI Act</a>. There is no procedural lacuna or any mala- fide intention\non part of the CPIO in replying to the RTI application filed by the appellant and\nhence, initiation of any penal proceedings against the CPIO is not warranted and\njustified as sought by the appellant.&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">Decision:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">In the facts of the instant case, it is pertinent to note that a decision of a\ncoordinate bench of the Commission in the matter of various third-party banks vs.\nRBI vide File No. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 + Ors. dated 05.05.2022 covers a\ndetailed discussion inter alia on the same nature of information sought for from\nthe RBI and the reliance placed by RBI on the Jayantilal Mistry case. Suffice to say\nthat the issues raised in the instant case are encapsulated in that same discussion\nof the coordinate bench in the following manner:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       &quot;39. A comprehensive view has to be taken on the objection filed by the\ninstitutions. These objectives has to be deliberated and adjudicated in the light of\nJayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and other judicial pronouncements relevant in such\nmatter, some of which have been referred by the Commission in the above parts\nas well. The Commission while examining various objections realize that the Writ\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                         5</span>\n Petitions filed before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India is seeking directions of\nthe Supreme Court for non-disclosure of certain aspects of these audit/inspection\nreport and any such guidance in these Writ Petitions will have direct bearing and\nprovide further clarity to the CPIO/FAA in adjudicating various aspects of\ndisclosure/non-disclosure of reports or the information/data which are part of\nthese reports under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">RTI Act</a>. The Commission takes note that\nall the cases/second appeals filed herein are based on interpretations of RBI Vs.\nJayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judicial pronouncements requesting for\nfull disclosure vis-à-vis with exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act for non-\ndisclosure of full or parts of these reports.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">        40. In view of the above observations, the Commission is of the view that\nthe reports generated in the hands of regulatory public authority in discharge of\nits statutory obligations are information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the RTI Act, as the\nregulator and the regulated entities are not governed by fiduciary relationship.\nThe orders of the Commission to their effect has been upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and the position is unchanged even\ntoday. Various objections filed by banks/financial institutions, to be examined,\nanalyzed and adjudicated upon, are related to various data and information\nsubmitted to the Reserve Bank of India by these financial institutions explaining\ntheir operations, commercial decisions, clients data etc. under statutory\nobligations can be disclosed as such. There are apparently two set of such\ninformation which have been shared by the institutions with the regulator under\nstatutory obligation. First is the information/data of clients relating to their\nbusiness/commercial operations, financial transactions, business and commercial\nstrategy which is shared by clients with financial institutions in full trust and\nconfidence and is held by them in fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_28\">RTI Act</a> in their hands. Second set is the information relating to business\nstrategy, decisions, transactions, other operational data etc. of financial\ninstitutions have been bearing on their competitive position which also enjoys the\nexemption from disclosure in their hands, if it is a public authority or otherwise,\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_29\">RTI Act</a>. Some of such data, on case to case basis be sensitive enough for\nprotection of national interest. The Commission is of the view that the protection\nof disclosure of information under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of\nfinancial institutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in\ngood faith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligation. Various\nobservations of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case also does not\nindicate so and decision of the regulator to consider redacting such\ndata/information while disclosing the reports is aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                         6</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        41. The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of\nthe CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and later\nin the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be required to\nadjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of the Commission\nafresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take view on various\nobjections filed by the Banks and Financial Institutions and submissions made by\napplicant to reach the decision in favour or against redaction of various parts of\nthe report on case to case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judgments, some of\nwhich have been referred in this order as well. Hence, with these observations the\norders passed by the CPIO and FAA in these matters are set aside and the cases\nare being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh. (Emphasis Supplied)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       42. It is amply clear that Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nothers tagged are admitted in Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court wherein guidance and\ndirection has been sought on non-disclosure of certain type of information which\nare essentially the part of the Annual Inspection Report/RAR, etc. These petitions\nalso seek protection of interim communication between regulator and the\nregulated entity in the process of finalization of these reports or otherwise. It is\nobvious that decision in these Writ Petitions will provide clarity and guidance to\nthe Public Authority on redaction/non-disclosure of a set of information inspite of\nbeing part of these reports which are open to disclosure. At this stage, any\ndecision by the Public Authority will amount to pre-judging the issues pending\nadmitted Writ Petitions before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Various banks,\nfinancial institutions, respondent public authority and the RTI applicant have\nalready impleaded party and are presenting their arguments before the Apex\nCourt.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       43. Hence, any decision of redaction or disclosure of information, without\nwaiting for decision in the Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged may cause irrevocable damage against right of privacy and protection of\ncommercial interest. Hence, the respondent public authority if expedient may\nwait for the outcome in Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged or seek clarification from the Hon&#x27;ble Court and accordingly decide these\nRTI applications by following process as enumerated in the earlier paras by the\nCommission in the interest of principles of natural justice. While disclosing the\ninformation they should be cautious in taking a considerate view balancing right\nto privacy, protection of national and commercial interest on one hand vis-à-vis\nlarger public interest. (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                         7</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38822192\" id=\"span_9\">44. It is further observed that similar view has also been taken by the\nDivision Bench of the Commission in file bearing nos. CIC/VS/A/2013/001488 and\nCIC/VS/A/2013/001805 dated 11.05.2017 wherein the Commission observed that\n&#x27;Having considered the submissions of both the parties, the Commission observes\nthat since a similar issue is pending adjudication before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in the matter of Central for <a href=\"/doc/38822192/\" id=\"a_31\">Public Interest Litigation Vs. Housing &amp; Urban\nDevelopment Corporation Ltd. &amp;Ors.</a>, it would be judicious to await the final\noutcome from the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.
