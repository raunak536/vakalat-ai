The plaintiff is the father of Sushant Singh Rajput (―SSR‖,\n                  hereinafter), an actor who debuted in Bollywood in 2009 and met an\n                  untimely end on 14 June 2020. The circumstances in which SSR\n                  breathed his last remain murky, and the dust is still to settle.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">                  2.      In or around 19 March 2021, the plaintiff instituted the present\n                  suit by way of a quia timet action.          The suit was predicated on\n                  information stated to have been received by the plaintiff to the effect\n                  that Defendants 1 and 2 were in the process of producing, and\n                  Defendant 3 in the process of directing, a movie based on the life of\n                  SSR, without taking the permission of any of his legal representatives,\n                  including the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that SSR did not leave,\n                  behind him, any Class I heir and that the plaintiff was the sole\n                  surviving legal heir in Category I of the Class 2 legal heirs of SSR.\n                  The suit sought a decree of permanent injunction, restraining the\n                  defendants and all others from using SSR&#x27;s name, caricature or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                    Page 2 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">10:10:24</span>\n                   lifestyle in any projects or films without the prior permission of the\n                  plaintiff, alleging that any such effort would infringe the personality\n                  rights of SSR and also cause deception in the minds of the public,\n                  which would amount to passing off. Additionally, costs and damages\n                  were also sought.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">                  3.     Along with the suit, the plaintiff filed IA 5697/2021, seeking an\n                  interlocutory injunction against the defendants using SSR&#x27;s name,\n                  caricature, lifestyle or likeness in any films or other ventures, pending\n                  disposal of the suit.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">                  4.     IA 5697/2021 was dismissed by a coordinate bench of Sanjeev\n                  Narula, J., vide judgment dated 10 June 2021. Para 43 of the said\n                  judgment, which is of relevance, reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                         ―43. On the aspect of irreparable loss, we may note that the suit\n                         is not premised as a tortious action for defamation. It is founded on\n                         the basis of breach of celebrity/publicity rights inhering to the\n                         Plaintiff. It is thus opined that if an interim order is granted, it\n                         would be difficult to compensate the Defendants in the event\n                         Plaintiff ultimately does not succeed in the suit. Whereas, the\n                         Plaintiff can always re-apply at a later juncture for injunction, if\n                         there is a change in circumstances after the release of the said film,\n                         and has an adequate remedy of being compensated by award of\n                         damages, if the Plaintiff proves in trial that the celebrity/publicity\n                         rights were inheritable and inured to him exclusively. To ensure\n                         that, the Defendants are directed to render complete and true\n                         accounts of the revenue earned from the films by way of\n                         sale/licensing of all rights relating to the films.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">                  5.     Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the plaintiff appealed to\n                  the Division Bench of this Court by way of FAO (OS) (COMM)\n                  88/2021, which was disposed of, by the Division Bench, vide the\n                  following order dated 26 July 2021:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                         Page 3 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">10:10:24</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                          ―1.      Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel, who appears on\n                         behalf of the appellant, on instructions, says that the statement\n                         made on behalf of respondent no. 3, on 23.06.2021, that the subject\n                         film, i.e. ―Nyay: The Justice‖ [hereafter referred to as the ―subject\n                         film‖] has been released, is not correct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                         1.1.    Mr. Singh says that the subsequent order, i.e., order dated\n                         25.06.2021 would show that an impression was given, to the\n                         predecessor bench, that the duration of the film was 2 hours and 23\n                         minutes, as appearing on http://lapalaporiginal.com/ [hereafter\n                         referred to as the &quot;subject OTT platform&quot;].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                         1.2.

On the other hand, Mr. Chander M. Lall, learned senior\n                         counsel, who appears on behalf of respondent no. 3, says that the\n                         content of the subject film has not changed, from the date it was\n                         released, on the subject OTT platform, i.e., 11.06.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">                         2.1.    It is Mr. Lall&#x27;s submission that although, at the given point\n                         of time, gaps were incorporated, whereby, the duration of the\n                         subject film, stood increased to 2 hours 41 minutes, the content has\n                         not changed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">                         2.2.    It is also Mr. Lall&#x27;s submission, that the duration of the\n                         subject film, as recorded in the order dated 25.06.2021, i.e. 2 hours\n                         and 23 minutes, is, in fact, a typographical error. The duration of\n                         the subject film, according to Mr. Lall, was 2 hours 32 minutes,\n                         even at that juncture, which, with the gaps, stood increased to 2\n                         hours 41 minutes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">                         3.     We are informed that gaps were inserted, at a particular\n                         juncture, to merge advertisements, with the contents of the subject\n                         film. Mr. Lall also informs us that some advertisements were,\n                         indeed, incorporated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">                         4.     At this stage, Mr. Singh points out that first 9 minutes of\n                         the subject film, as appearing on the subject OTT platform, are\n                         blank.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">                         5.     We may also point out that Mr. Lall has taken instructions,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Signature Not Verified   in the matter, and he says that, presently, the gaps have been</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                        Page 4 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">10:10:24</span>\n                      removed; and the duration of the subject film is, now, 2 bours 41\n                     minutes, with advertisements included in between.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">                     6.     Given this position, both the counsel submit, that the best\n                     course forward would be to remit the matter to the leamed Single\n                     Judge, where the parties can, then, press their respective claims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                     7.     Given the aforesaid submissions, made on behalf of Mr.\n                     Singh and Mr. Lall, counsel for the parties say, that the appeal and\n                     the pending applications can be disposed of accordingly.

The contentions of the\n                     appellant will be examined, by the learned Single Judge, in the\n                     context of the subject film, which is, presently, available on the\n                     subject OTT platform.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">                     9.

Needless to add, since we have not examined the matter on\n                     merits, and given the fact that, the stage, at which the impugned\n                     decision was rendered, the subject film had not been released, all\n                     the parties will at liberty to advance their respective stands, before\n                     the leamed Single, in view of the changed circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">                     11.

A plain reading of the aforesaid order dated 26 July 2021\n             reveals that, by the time the Division Bench came to pass the said\n             order, something in the nature of a completed film, titled ―Nyay : The\n             Justice‖, produced by Defendants 1 and 2, directed by Defendant 3\n             and outlined by Defendant 4, was in existence and could be viewed on\n             the OTT Platform http://lapalaporiginal.com/ (hereinafter referred to\n             as ―the Lapalap platform‖). The Division Bench, therefore, granted\n                  liberty, to the plaintiff, to press his claims, in terms of para 43 of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                     Page 5 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">10:10:24</span>\n                   judgment dated 10 June 2021 supra of the learned Single Judge. At\n                  the same time, the Division Bench also clarified that it had not\n                  examined the matter on merits and reserved liberty with the parties to\n                  advance their respective stands before the Single Judge, while\n                  pressing their claims in the light of the film as released.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">                  7.     As such, the lis, in the present application, is between the\n                  plaintiff on the one hand and Defendants 1 to 4 on the other. For the\n                  sake of convenience, Defendants 1 to 4 would be referred to,\n                  hereinafter, collectively, as ―the defendants‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">                  8.

I am called upon to decide the said application, in terms\n                  of para 8 of the order dated 26 July 2021 of the Division Bench in\n                  FAO (OS) (COMM) 88/2021.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">                  11.    I have heard learned Counsel for the parties at length on IA\n                  10551/2021. Mr. Varun Singh argued on behalf of the plaintiff and\n                  Mr. Chander M.

I may note, here, that there was some confusion regarding the\n             exact nature of the film which was being streamed on the Lapalap\n             platform and in respect of which the plaintiff was seeking an\n             injunction. Mr. Varun Singh also sought to submit that, despite a\n             proscription to that effect contained in the order dated 26 July 2021 of\n             the Division Bench, the defendants had carried out changes in the film\n             even after the passing of the said order. That eventuality, however,\n             stands recognized, and addressed, in para 9 of the order dated 26 July\n             2021 of the Division Bench. In the said paragraph, the Division Bench\n             has observed that, in the event Defendant 3 were to make changes in\n             the film, as it existed on that date, i.e. on 26 July 2021, information in\n             that regard would be given to the plaintiff who would, then, have\n             liberty to move the Single Judge, i.e. this Bench.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">             13.     As things stand today, learned Counsel for both sides are ad\n             idem that there is one existing final print of the film which runs into 2\n             hours 30 minutes 33 seconds. A copy of the film has been provided to\n             the Court on a pen drive. It is this print that has formed subject matter\n             of argument before me. Mr. Varun Singh seeks an injunction against\n             streaming of the said print - or any other film showcasing the life of\n             SSR - on the Lapalap platform or elsewhere, whereas Mr. Lall\n             contends that, by streaming the film, his clients have not infracted any\n             right of the plaintiff, as would entitle the plaintiff to seek an injunction\n             from this Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">                  14. Extent to which the judgment dated 10 June 2021 of the learned\n                  Single Judge in IA 5697/2021 is required to be taken into account\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                            Page 9 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">10:10:24</span>\n                   14.1 I may now advert to the aspect to which I had eluded earlier,\n                  viz, whether the judgment dated 10 June 2021, of Narula, J., is\n                  required to be borne in mind while deciding the present application IA\n                  10551/2021 and, more particularly, whether the findings returned in\n                  the said judgment dated 10 June 2021 would be binding on me and\n                  were not open to revisitation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                  14.2 Mr. Chander Lall, learned Senior Counsel for Defendant 3, has\n                  no doubt about the legal position in this regard. Indeed, he rose while\n                  the submissions of Mr. Varun Singh, learned Counsel for the plaintiff\n                  were midstream, submitting, with some chagrin (even while retaining\n                  his characteristic savoir faire), that Mr. Singh was arguing issues\n                  which had been laid to rest by the judgment of Narula, J., and were no\n                  longer open to reconsideration. To bring home his point, Mr. Lall\n                  emphasizes para 8 of the order dated 26 July 2021 of the Division\n                  Bench, which allowed the plaintiff to press his claims in terms of para\n                  43 of the judgment dated 10 June 2021 of Narula, J. The findings of\n                  Narula, J., in the judgment dated 10 June 2021, which precede para 43\n                  of the said judgment, therefore, according to him, cannot be now\n                  reagitated or re-examined by this Bench. This Bench has to limit its\n                  cogitative excursions to para 43 of the judgment dated 10 June 2021,\n                  and cannot travel outside the peripheries thereof.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">                  14.3 Mr. Lall, in fact, specifically contended that all that this Bench\n                  was required to do, as per the order dated 26 July 2021 of the Division\n                  Bench, was to examine whether the release of the film - which was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                             Page 10 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">10:10:24</span>\n                   the only change in circumstance since the time of passing of the order\n                  dated 10 June 2021 of Narula, J. - could be said to have entitled the\n                  plaintiff to an injunction, which Narula, J. had refused. He submits\n                  that the answer to this question has, quite obviously, to be in the\n                  negative. Mr. Lall&#x27;s contention is that, in the amended plaint, the\n                  plaintiff has not advanced any submission which could change the\n                  factual or legal position which obtained on 10 June 2021, when\n                  Narula, J. rendered his judgment and that, therefore, the plaintiff\n                  would not be treated as entitled to any injunction against streaming of\n                  the film. Mr. Lall has, in this context, specifically drawn attention to\n                  the observation, in para 43 of the judgment dated 10 June 2021 of\n                  Narula, J., to the effect that, if there was any change in circumstance\n                  after release of the film, the plaintiff had an adequate remedy of being\n                  compensated by award of damages, provided he proved, in trial, that\n                  celebrity/publicity rights were inheritable and exclusively enured to\n                  him. The Division Bench having lent its imprimatur to para 43 of the\n                  judgment of Narula, J., Mr. Lall&#x27;s contention is that the issue had now\n                  necessarily to be relegated to trial. A plain reading of para 43 of the\n                  decision of Narula, J., in terms whereof, alone, the plaintiff had been\n                  permitted, by the Division Bench, to approach this Court, he submits,\n                  reveals that the only right that survived in the plaintiff, consequent to\n                  release of the film, was a right to claim damages and that the said right\n                  was dependent on the plaintiff establishing, during trial, firstly, that\n                  celebrity/publicity rights were heritable and, secondly, that these\n                  rights exclusively enured to him. There is, therefore, according to Mr.\n                  Lall, no question of any injunctive relief being granted to the plaintiff\n                  at this stage.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 11 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">10:10:24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">                   14.4 There are various reasons why I find it difficult to accept this\n                  submission of Mr. Lall.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">                  14.5 In the first place, para 43 of the judgment dated 10 June 2021 of\n                  Narula, J. does not restrict the right of the plaintiff, consequent to\n                  release of the film, to damages. It specifically states that, in the event\n                  of a change of circumstance after release of the film, the plaintiff\n                  could re-apply for injunction. That is precisely what the plaintiff has\n                  done by way of IA 10551/2021. In terms of para 43, therefore, this\n                  Bench has necessarily to examine and decide the said application on\n                  its own merits.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">                  14.6 Secondly, the judgment of Narula, J. was rendered at a time\n                  when no film was in existence. Narula, J. was examining the matter\n                  as a quia timet action. The considerations which apply to a quia timet\n                  action are fundamentally different from those which apply to a prayer\n                  for injunction made after the allegedly tortious act is committed. It\n                  would be fundamentally erroneous, therefore, for this Bench to\n                  proceed on the basis of findings and observations returned by Narula,\n                  J., while examining the quia timet injunction application of the\n                  plaintiff when the film had not yet been released.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                  14.7 Thirdly, the order dated 26 July 2021, of the Division Bench,\n                  specifically states, in para 10, that the Division Bench had not\n                  examined the matter on merits. It goes without saying that, without\n                  examining the merits of the appeal before it, the Division Bench could\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                Page 12 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">10:10:24</span>\n                   not have either approved or disapproved the judgment dated 10 June\n                  2021 of Narula, J. A reading of para 10 of the order of the Division\n                  Bench, in fact, conveys the clear impression that the Division Bench\n                  was of the view that, with the release of the film, the goalpost had\n                  changed. It is obviously for this reason that the Division Bench,\n                  advisedly, did not deem it necessary to advert to the merits of an\n                  interlocutory order passed at the time when the film had not yet been\n                  released, its contents were unknown, and the entire discussion was\n                  still in quia timet territory. This position stands underscored in view\n                  of the specific reservation of liberty, in para 10 of the order of the\n                  Division Bench, with all parties to advance their respective stands -\n                  with no proscriptive, or even cautionary, caveat - before the learned\n                  Single Judge, i.e. before this Bench. Without having examined the\n                  merits of the appeal before it, the Division Bench could, quite\n                  obviously, not have bound this Bench by the observations and\n                  findings of Narula, J., which were subject matter of challenge before\n                  it.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                  14.8 There are, even otherwise, fundamental differences between the\n                  grievance of the plaintiff in the original plaint and in the amended\n                  plaint. The original plaint was predicated on a mere apprehension,\n                  with no film having been released till then.         Quite obviously,\n                  therefore, no claim of defamation could have been raised by the\n                  plaintiff. The opening observations in para 43 of the judgment of\n                  Narula, J., to the effect that the suit was not predicated as a suit\n                  alleging tortious defamation, on which Mr. Lall placed emphasis,\n                  therefore, merely, state a truism. Indeed, as the film had not yet been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                             Page 13 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">10:10:24</span>\n                   released till the date of passing of the judgment by Narula, J., no\n                  question of any allegation of defamation, based on the film, could\n                  have existed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">                  14.9 As against this, the amendments to the plaint, which have been\n                  effected after the film had been released, specifically alleged that the\n                  film is based on unverified and unauthenticated news reports, many of\n                  which were defamatory to SSR, without verifying either their truth or\n                  their authenticity. As such, specific allegations of damage to the\n                  reputation of SSR have been incorporated in the amended plaint. It\n                  has also been alleged that several parts of the film are salacious and\n                  promiscuous and portray SSR in a negative light. These allegations\n                  are in addition, and de hors, the contention that no one could have\n                  publicised the life of SSR, or made any film based on his life, without\n                  obtaining prior permission of the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                  14.10 I am, therefore, of the considered opinion that, in examining IA\n                  10551/2021, this Bench cannot regard itself as bound by the\n                  observations and findings of Narula, J., but would have to proceed on\n                  the basis that it has before it, a tabula rasa.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">                  Rival Contentions\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">                  15.    Opening submissions of Mr Varun Singh\n\n\n                  15.1 Mr. Varun Singh, learned Counsel for the plaintiff, submits that,\n                  over a period of time, celebrity rights have emerged as a distinct\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                              Page 14 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">10:10:24</span>\n                   category of intellectual property right. Celebrity rights, he submits,\n                  are rights which enure in favour of one by virtue of her, or his, being a\n                  celebrity. A celebrity, therefore, according to him, enjoys a distinct\n                  bundle of personality rights, privacy rights and publicity rights. As a\n                  celebrity, he submits that the personality of SSR could not have been\n                  misappropriated for the unjust enrichment of others.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">                  15.2 Mr. Varun Singh submits that the film has been made on the\n                  basis of defamatory statements and news articles, which alleged that\n                  SSR was subject to various vices such as drug addiction, etc, without\n                  any verification and without obtaining any report from any official\n                  agency to the said effect. Additionally, the firm alleges that SSR was\n                  mentally unwell, that he was anxious and depressed and that he died\n                  by committing suicide. In so doing, he submits that the defendants\n                  have violated the right to privacy of both of SSR and the plaintiff,\n                  which inhere in them by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Mr.\n                  Singh submits that it is not permissible for anyone to publish anything\n                  about SSR, laudatory or critical, without the plaintiff&#x27;s consent. The\n                  impugned film, he submits, is no less than a direct retelling of SSR&#x27;s\n                  life. He has drawn attention to various documents, placed by him on\n                  record, which underscore this position.       A news item dated 19\n                  February 2021, on the virtual platform ―Bollywood Hungama News\n                  Network‖ reports the statement of Zuber K Khan, who essays the role\n                  of SSR in the impugned movie, to the effect that the film focuses on\n                  the lives of Rhea Chakraborty and SSR and the chemistry between\n                  them, and was aimed at securing justice not only for SSR but also for\n                  Rhea Chakraborty.

Fans\n                  will get the idea of what really happened or what could have\n                  happened. Not only fans, investigative agencies will also get some\n                  clue and fans should be happy that on the basis of that clue the\n                  investigative agency should be in a position to proceed further. So it is\n                  like pushing the investigative agencies to move further on the basis of\n                  the hints given by us.‖\n\n\n                  15.3 As a celebrity, Mr. Singh submits that the plaintiff has a right to\n                  command and control over his name, his image and his likeness. Any\n                  misuse of the plaintiff&#x27;s name, or image, or his caricaturing would\n                  result in infringement of the personality rights vested in the plaintiff.\n                  It would also amount to passing off. Mr. Singh submits that the\n                  plaintiff is the lawful successor to the said rights which earlier vested\n                  in SSR. He submits that the events which led to the death of SSR, and\n                  post his death, were events which were very personal to the plaintiff,\n                  his family and his friends etc and that streaming/broadcasting of the\n                  said events without the consent of the plaintiff was completely\n                  impermissible. Mr Singh further submits that he seeks an injunction in\n                  order to protect possible irreparable injury to the plaintiff, his son and\n                  his family&#x27;s reputation, damage to the plaintiff&#x27;s family and\n                  defamation and politicization of the event of death of SSR.

Streaming or broadcasting of the said\n                  events, even if in the form of a movie, he submits, would be\n                  completely illegal. Besides, Mr. Singh submits that the investigation\n                  into the circumstances which led to the death of SSR, in which the\n                  CBI is also involved, are still in progress, and the release of movies\n                  such as the impugned film are likely to prejudice fair trial in the case.\n                  He submits that a right to fair trial inheres in every citizen by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article\n                  21</a> of the Constitution of India. The plaintiff is, therefore, seeking an\n                  injunction against continued broadcasting of the impugned film in\n                  order to prevent possible irreparable injury to the plaintiff, his son\n                  SSR and the reputation of their family, damage to the family name and\n                  defamation, and politicisation of SSR&#x27;s death and the circumstances in\n                  which it occurred.

Nonetheless, no consent from the\n                  plaintiff had been obtained before releasing the impugned movie. The\n                  impugned movie, therefore, compromises both the right to privacy of\n                  SSR and the plaintiff, as well as the right to fair trial of the\n                  circumstances which led to the death of SSR.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"358048\" id=\"span_83\">15.5 The right to publicity, as well as celebrity rights, submits Mr.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                  Page 17 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">10:10:24</span>\n                 Singh, are heritable.

He submits that the amended plaint filed by the plaintiff does\n                 not refer to any such change. The submissions of Mr. Singh, he\n                 submits, do not refer to any content in the film which would persuade\n                 this Court to change the view initially adopted by Narula, J.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">                 16.2 Puttaswamy6, submits Mr. Lall, confirms that both the right of\n                 privacy and the right to publicity are birthed in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the\n                 Constitution.

He submits that the\n                plaintiff has admitted that the impugned movie is based on media\n                articles, which were available to the public. The right to privacy, he\n                submits, can obviously never extent to publicly known facts. He\n                places reliance, for this purpose, on the judgment of the High Court of\n                Telangana in <a href=\"/doc/138005440/\" id=\"a_13\">Ramgopal Varma v.

While viewing the\n                  disclaimer, and its value and worth, the Court has to examine the\n                  matter with an approach somewhat different from the lay, and possibly\n                  uninterested, viewer. To my mind, it is obvious that a disclaimer\n                  which, when seen in the backdrop of the movie itself, is plainly\n                  untrue, is worth tinsel.     It is, rather, an unscrupulous attempt at\n                  pulling wool over the eyes, not only of the viewing public, but also of\n                  any other authority - such as this Court in the present case - before\n                  whom an occasion to compare the movie with true life, comes up for\n                  consideration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">                  18.8 Mr. Lall has cited, in his favour, the judgments of this Court in\n                  Sahara One Media11 and Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories12, the High Court\n                  of Madras in Deepa Jayakumar9, the High Court of Karnataka in\n                  Vadlapatla Naga Vara Prasad13 and the High Court of Telangana in\n                  Ramgopal Varma7. None of these decisions, however, can operate to\n                  sustain the disclaimer, inserted in the impugned movie, as disabusing\n                  the impression, cast on a plain viewing of the movie vis-à-vis the life\n                  of SSR, of one being a mere celluloid rehash of the other.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">                  18.9 Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories12 merely notes the fact that the\n                  defendants<a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_29\">, <a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_30\">in that case</a></a>, assured the Court that the movie in question\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 35 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">10:10:24</span>\n                   contained a disclaimer that the characters in the movie were fictitious\n                  and that any resemblance, between the characters and real persons was\n                  coincidental. Besides the fact that the order is purely interlocutory in\n                  nature, expressing a mere prima facie view and is, therefore,\n                  inherently lacking in precedential value, especially as enunciating any\n                  principle of law, it is seen that, in para 18 of the decision, prior to the\n                  reference to the disclaimer, this Court returned clear and categorical\n                  findings that there was, in fact, no similarity between what was shown\n                  in the movie forming subject matter of consideration and real-life\n                  events. The reference to the disclaimer is, therefore, almost as an\n                  aside. Sahara One Media11 is a single line order by the Division\n                  Bench which, while staying the decision of a learned Single Judge\n                  which restrained the release of the film forming subject matter of\n                  consideration <a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_31\">in that case</a>, subjected the stay ―to the condition that the\n                  appellant can only show the film by giving a clear disclaimer that it\n                  has nothing whatsoever to do with the life and works of respondent\n                  No. 1 and her organisation‖. The direction was, therefore, essentially\n                  cautionary in nature, and no proposition of law can be said to emanate\n                  therefrom. Similarly, in Deepa Jayakumar9, the Court has merely\n                  noted the fact of insertion of a disclaimer in the film concerned, as a\n                  relevant factor.

In that case, the questions which arose for consideration were\n                  delineated, by the Supreme Court, in the opening para of the\n                  judgment, as ―a question concerning the freedom of press vis-à-vis the\n                  right to privacy of the citizens of this country‖ as also ―the question as\n                  to the parameters of the right of the press to criticise and comment on\n                  the acts and conduct of public officials‖. The case related to Auto\n                  Shankar, a notorious criminal, who was on death row, having been\n                  convicted for having committed as many as six murders. At the time\n                  when the judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court, the mercy\n                  petition of Auto Shankar was pending before the President of India.\n                  During his incarceration, Auto Shankar penned his autobiography, and\n                  requested his advocate to ensure that it was published in the magazine\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 38 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">10:10:24</span>\n                   Nakkheeran, of R. Rajagopal (―Rajagopal‖, hereinafter), the appellant\n                  before the Supreme Court. Rajagopal was agreeable to publishing the\n                  autobiography. The autobiography, however, allegedly exposed the\n                  close nexus between Auto Shankar and several IAS, IPS and other\n                  officers, some of whom he also accused of complicity in the crimes\n                  committed by him. It also contained photographs and video clippings\n                  showing the presence of such officers at the residence of Auto\n                  Shankar. The announcement, by Rajagopal, of the impending release\n                  of Auto Shankar&#x27;s autobiography, allegedly, threw several highly\n                  placed persons, including prison and police officials into a panic, as\n                  they feared exposure of their links with the condemned prisoner.\n                  Rajagopal&#x27;s petition alleged that the prison and police officials\n                  subjected Auto Shankar to third-degree measures and coerced him into\n                  addressing a communication to the Inspector General (IG) of Prisons,\n                  requesting that his life story be not published in Rajagopal&#x27;s\n                  magazine. The IG Prisons addressed a corresponding letter, dated 15\n                  June 1994, to Rajagopal, requesting Rajagopal to stop publishing the\n                  autobiography of Auto Shankar. This letter was called, by Rajagopal,\n                  into question before court. Rajagopal expressed an apprehension, in\n                  his petition, that the Police officials were likely to threaten his life if\n                  he proceeded to publish the autobiography of Auto Shankar.\n                  Rajagopal, therefore, asserted the right guaranteed to him by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_33\">Article\n                  19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">                  19.4.2 The Supreme Court, before whom the matter ultimately\n                  reached, clarified, at the outset, that, as it could not sit as an appellate\n                  authority on facts, it was proceeding on the assumption that Auto\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 39 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">10:10:24</span>\n                   Shankar had neither written his autobiography nor authorised\n                  Rajagopal to publish the autobiography in his magazine.                          The\n                  Supreme Court went on, thereafter, to frame various issues as arising\n                  for consideration, of which Issue (1), which alone is relevant, read\n                  thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                          ―(1) Whether a citizen of this country can prevent another\n                          person from writing his life story autobiography?

The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive\n                          concept originated in the field of Tort law, under which a new\n                          cause of action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of\n                          privacy was recognised. This right has two aspects which are but\n                          two faces of the same coin - (1) the general law of privacy which\n                          affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful\n                          invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to\n                          the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against\n                          unlawful governmental invasion. The first aspect of this right must\n                          be said to have been violated where, for example, a person&#x27;s name\n                          or likeness is used, without his consent, for advertising - or non-\n                          advertising - purposes or for that matter, his life story is written -\n                          whether laudatory or otherwise - and published without his\n                          consent as explained hereinafter.‖\n                                                                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\n                  Needless to say, the dispute before this Court in the present case\n                  concerns itself with aspect (1) of the right to privacy, as identified by\n                  the Supreme Court in the afore extracted passage. It is important to\n                  note that the usage, of a person&#x27;s name or likeness, without his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                          Page 40 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">10:10:24</span>\n                   consent, for any purpose, or the writing of his life story and its\n                  publication without his consent has been held, by the Supreme Court,\n                  to be one aspect of the right to privacy of the individual. [I may note,\n                  here itself, that this passage was examined, in some detail, by a\n                  Division Bench of this Court, speaking through Sanjay Kishan Kaul,\n                  J. (as his Lordship then was) in Khushwant Singh8, and that the\n                  manner in which the Division Bench interpreted this passage is of\n                  considerable importance in the light of the issues that have been raised\n                  by learned Counsel.]\n\n\n                  19.4.4 The Supreme Court went on to explain the contours of the right\n                  to privacy which, it held, ―must encompass and protect the personal\n                  intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation\n                  and child-rearing‖. The rationale for such protection being necessary\n                  was also thus explained, borrowing a passage from the Stanford Law\n                  Review:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                         ―There are two possible theories for protecting privacy of home.\n                         The first is that activities in the home harm others only to the\n                         extent that they cause offence resulting from the mere thought that\n                         individuals might be engaging in such activities and that such\n                         ‗harm&#x27; is not constitutionally protectible by the State. The second\n                         is that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they can be free\n                         from societal control. The importance of such a sanctuary is that\n                         individuals can drop the mask, desist for a while from projecting\n                         on the world the image they want to be accepted as themselves, an\n                         image that may reflect the values of their peers rather than the\n                         realities of their natures.‖\n\n\n                  19.4.5 The Supreme Court went on, thereafter, to examine the position\n                  in law, as it exists in UK and the US. Mr. Lall placed reliance on\n                  some of the observations and findings contained in the overseas\n                  decisions cited and reproduced by the Supreme Court, but, in my\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                       Page 41 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">10:10:24</span>\n                   opinion, it would not be appropriate to refer to the said decisions in\n                  view of the caveat that came to be inserted by the Supreme Court in\n                  the immediately succeeding paras 21 of the report, to which I would\n                  presently allude. Before that, however, the following enunciation of\n                  the law, in para 18 of the decision, is important:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                         ―18.

This is for the reason that public figures\n                         like public officials often play an influential role in ordering\n                         society. It has been held that as a class the public figures have, as\n                         the public officials have, access to mass media communication\n                         both to influence the policy and to counter-criticism of their views\n                         and activities. On this basis, it has been held that the citizen has a\n                         legitimate and substantial interest in the conduct of such persons\n                         and that the freedom of press extends to engaging in uninhibited\n                         debate about the involvement of public figures in public issues and\n                         events.‖\n\n                  Thus, the Supreme Court has equated ―public figures‖ with ―public\n                  officials‖, in connection with the discussion undertaken by it.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                  19.4.6 Having distilled the legal position as it existed abroad, the\n                  Supreme Court, in para 21 of the report, posed, to itself, the query of\n                  ―how far the principles emerging from the United States and English\n                  decisions are relevant under our constitutional system‖.

This is for the reason that once a matter\n                         becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n                         subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press\n                         and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in\n                         the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved\n                         out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\n                         kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\n                         to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\n                         press/media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                         (3)      There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above --\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">                         indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case\n                         of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter,\n                         the remedy of action for damages is simply not available with\n                         respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their\n                         official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon\n                         facts and statements which are not true, unless the official\n                         establishes that the publication was made (by the defendant) with\n                         reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for\n                         the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\n                         after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for\n                         him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the\n                         publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal\n                         animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be\n                         liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant\n                         to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\n                         protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It\n                         needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power\n                         to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures\n                         protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_40\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_41\">104</a>\n                         respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this\n                         rule.‖\n\n                  Thus, the Supreme Court held that, while the proscription against\n                  publication of matters concerning the right to privacy of an individual,\n                  without his consent, was otherwise absolute, the proscription would\n                  not apply where the publication was based upon public records,\n                  including court records.

Additionally, the Supreme Court held that, in\n                  the case of public officials - which, in view of para 18 of the decision,\n                  reproduced supra, would apply mutatis mutandis to public figures as\n                  well - the right to privacy, or any remedy flowing from the said right,\n                  would not be available except where the publication was made with\n                  reckless disregard for truth. It was further clarified that, in such a\n                  case, it would be sufficient for the defendant - significantly, the\n                  member of the press or media (thereby equating press reports with\n                  media coverages) - to prove that he had acted after a reasonable\n                  verification of the facts. It was not necessary, in such circumstances,\n                  for the publisher of the impugned content to establish that what he had\n                  written was true. This principle, obviously, would not apply where\n                  the publication was actuated by malice or animosity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">                  19.4.9 Based on these principles, the Supreme Court upheld the right\n                  of Rajagopal to publish the autobiography of Auto Shankar.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">                  19.5 Khushwant Singh8\n\n\n                  19.5.1 Khushwant Singh - who needs no introduction - was writing\n                  his memoirs titled, in characteristic tongue-in-cheek fashion, ―Truth,\n                  Love and a Little Malice‖.

It is not seriously disputed before us\n                         on behalf of learned counsel for the respondent that as mentioned\n                         in the chart, other than the three passages complained of, the\n                         others had already been commented upon and published in\n                         previous magazines and books. We have considered the\n                         submissions of learned counsel for the respondent that the\n                         language for expressing the subject matter gives a different\n                         connotation than what was published earlier.

The words may not be exact but the concept and\n                         meaning sought to be conveyed are more or less same, if a\n                         comparison is made of the passages complained of and the\n                         publications in India Today of April 15, 1982, April 30, 1982,\n                         Pupul Jaykar&#x27;s and Ved Mehta&#x27;s book.

In view of this we are\n                          of the considered view that the respondent cannot make a\n                          grievance so as to prevent the publication itself when the remedy\n                          is available to her by way of damages. We are not examining the\n                          statements attributed to appellant No. 1 on the touchstone of\n                          defamation. It would not be appropriate to do so for us at this\n                          stage but what we do observe is that the statements are not of\n                          such a nature as to grant injunction even from publication of the\n                          material when the appellants are willing to face the consequences\n                          in a trial in case the same are held to be defematory and the pleas\n                          of the appellants of truth are analysed by the trial Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"793946\" id=\"span_237\">61.    It is no doubt true that the reporting of the matter in\n                          controversy in the prior publication does not make them public\n                          documents as held by the learned single Judge of this Court in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">                 17</span>\n                     AIR 1982 MP 47\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">                  18</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n                     AIR 1961 AP 190\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                         Page 47 of 68</span>\nRAWAT\nSigning Date:12.07.2023\n10:10:24\n                          Phoolan Devi&#x27;s16 case (supra). However, the question is not of\n                         the documents being public documents but the subject matter\n                         being in the ambit of public domain in terms of there being prior\n                         reporting of the matter in controversy and the comments on the\n                         same. It may be useful at this stage to consider the judgment in\n                         <a href=\"/doc/793946/\" id=\"a_46\">Phoolan Devi</a>&#x27;s case (supra) rendered by learned single Judge of\n                         this Court. On a careful reading of the judgment it is apparent that\n                         the matter in question was peculiar as it related to the rights being\n                         claimed to show a woman being raped and gang-raped if the\n                         concerned woman was alive and did not want this to be made\n                         public. It was in those circumstances that the order was passed\n                         though we may add that subsequently on an apparent settlement\n                         the same was made public and the plaintiff therein was\n                         compensated in terms of the mutual settlement. In fact the learned\n                         single Judge specifically dealt with this aspect and observed that\n                         the display and the graphic details of being paraded nude, raped\n                         and gang raped does not only hurt the feelings, mutilate the soul,\n                         denigrate the person but reduce the victim to a situation of\n                         emotional abandonment.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                         62.     An important aspect to be examined is the claim of right\n                         of privacy advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent to\n                         seek the preventive injunction. This aspect was exhaustively dealt\n                         with in the case of Auto Shankar reported as R. Rajagopal&#x27;s10\n                         case (supra). The Supreme Court while considering these aspects\n                         clearly opined that there were two aspects of the right of privacy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">                         The first aspect was the general law of privacy which afforded\n                         tortuous action for damages from unlawful invasion of privacy. In\n                         the present case we are not concerned with the same as the suit\n                         for damages is yet to be tried. The second aspect, as per the\n                         Supreme Court, was the Constitutional recognition given to the\n                         right of privacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful\n                         governmental action. This also is not the situation in the present\n                         case as we are concerned with the inter se rights of the two\n                         citizens and not a governmental action. It was in the context of\n                         the first aspect that the Supreme Court had given the illustration\n                         of the life story written. Whether laudatory or otherwise and\n                         published without the consent of the person concerned. The\n                         learned counsel for the respondent Mr. Raj Panjwani, sought to\n                         draw strength from this aspect i.e. the lack of consent of the\n                         respondent to publish her life story in the autobiography written\n                         by appellant No. 1. However, this will give rise to tortuous action\n                         for damages as per the Supreme Court since this is the aspect\n                         which is concerned with the first aspect dealt with by the\n                         Supreme Court in respect of the invasion of privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">                         63.     The Supreme Court while considering the right of privacy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">Signature Not Verified   in the aforesaid judgment was clearly of the view that the freedom</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                         Page 48 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">10:10:24</span>\n                          of press extended to engaging any inhibited debate about the\n                         involvement of public figures in public issues and comments.\n                         There is force in the contention of Mr. Sundaram, learned counsel\n                         for the appellant, that a close and microscopic examination of the\n                         private lives of public men is a natural consequence of holding of\n                         public offices. What is good for a private citizen who does not\n                         come within the public gaze may not be true of a person holding\n                         public office. We have seen various examples of rights of public\n                         men being closely scrutinised by the press not only in our country\n                         but all over the world including of the President of the United\n                         States of America. What a person holding public office does\n                         within the four walls of his house does not totally remain a\n                         private matter. It may however, be added that the scrutiny of\n                         public figures by media should not also reach a stage where it\n                         amounts to harassment to the public figures and their family\n                         members. They must be permitted to live and lead their life in\n                         peace. But the public gaze cannot be avoided which is necessary\n                         corollary of their holding public offices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">                                                           ****\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_247\">65.     This aspect of right of privacy analysed in view of the\n                         conclusions of the Supreme Court as set forth in R. Rajagopal&#x27;s\n                         case (supra) fully support the argument advanced by the learned\n                         counsel for the appellant. Thus the observations strongly relied\n                         upon by Mr. Panjwani, learned counsel for the respondent, on the\n                         first point summarised by the Supreme Court cannot be read out of\n                         the context. As explained hereinabove the concept of consent,\n                         while dealing with the private lives of the persons was made in\n                         respect of the claim for damages. Not only this the Supreme Court\n                         further went on to observe that the position would be different if a\n                         person voluntarily thrusts himself into a controversy or voluntarily\n                         invites or raises a controversy. Suffice it to say that the respondent\n                         in fact at the relevant time drew strength or at least kept quite when\n                         the controversy was reported in the press. Issue of public record is\n                         not material in the present case because the controversy does not\n                         relate to the fact whether prior reporting of a matter becomes\n                         public records, which in law it does not, but that wide publicity and\n                         reporting having already been given to the matter in issue at the\n                         relevant stage of time. The task, though difficult it may be, for\n                         persons holding public office, cannot be summed up but to say that\n                         such persons have to show greater tolerance for comments and\n                         criticisms. One cannot but once again rely on the observations of\n                         Cockburn C.J. in ―Seymour v. Butterworth‖ cited with approval in\n                         <a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_47\">Kartar Singh</a>&#x27;s case (supra) to the effect that the persons holding\n                         public offices must not be thin skinned in reference to the\n                         comments made on them and even where they know that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">Signature Not Verified   observations are undeserved and unjust they must bear with them</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                         Page 49 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_250\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_252\">10:10:24</span>\n                          and submit to be misunderstood for a time. At times public figures\n                         have to ignore vulgar criticism and abuses hurled against them and\n                         they must restrain themselves from giving importance to the same\n                         by prosecuting the person responsible for the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">                         66.     Be that as it may the respondent has already chosen to\n                         claim damages and her claim is yet to be adjudicated upon. She\n                         will have remedy if the statements are held to be vulgar and\n                         defamatory of her and if the appellants fail to establish the defence\n                         of truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">                         67.      We are unable to accept the contention advanced on behalf\n                         of the respondent by Mr. Raj Panjwari that if the statements relate\n                         to private lives of persons, nothing more is to be said and the\n                         material must be injuncted from being published unless it is with\n                         the consent of the person whom the subject matter relates to. Such\n                         pre-censorship cannot be countenanced in the scheme of our\n                         constitutional framework. There is also some force in the\n                         submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the prior\n                         publication having occurred much prior to the suit being filed, the\n                         principle denying the relief for interlocutory injunction where the\n                         plaintiff has been dilatory in making the application, as observed in\n                         the Indian Express Newspaper&#x27;s case (supra) would also apply to\n                         the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">                         68.     As stated above, one aspect is very material a categorical\n                         assertion of the author to stand by his statement and claim to\n                         substantiate the same. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_253\">In such a situation interlocutory injunction\n                         restraining publication should not be granted and we are in\n                         agreement with and duly approve the views of the learned single\n                         Judge of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1203848/\" id=\"a_48\">Sardar Charanjeet Singh</a>&#x27;s case (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">                         69.     People have a right to hold a particular view and express\n                         freely on the matter of public interest. There is no doubt that even\n                         what may be the private lives of public figures become matters of\n                         public interest. This is the reason that when the controversy had\n                         erupted there was such wide publicity to the same including in the\n                         two editions of India Today. As observed in Silkin v. Beaverbrook\n                         Newspapers Ltd. (supra), the test to be applied in respect of public\n                         life is that the crank, the enthusiast, may say what he honestly\n                         thinks just as much as the reasonable man or woman who sits on a\n                         jury.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">                         70.    It is interesting to note that in Fraser&#x27;s case (supra) while\n                         considering the proposed publication of Sunday Times, Lord\n                         Denning had noted that the Sunday Times had been frank enough\n                         to admit that the article would be defamatory of the plaintiff yet\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">Signature Not Verified   Sunday Times claimed that the defence would be that the facts are</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                        Page 50 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">10:10:24</span>\n                          true. In the present case the first plea is that the statement is not\n                         defamatory apart from the fact that it has been published and\n                         commented upon in the past. The second plea is that the appellants\n                         will prove the truth of the said statements. Lord Denning had\n                         observed that the courts will not restrain the publication of an\n                         article even where they are defamatory once the defendants\n                         expressed its intention to justify it or make a fair comment on the\n                         matter of public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">                         71.      There is no doubt that there are two competing interests to\n                         be balanced as submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent,\n                         that of the author to write and publish and the right of an individual\n                         against invasion of privacy and the threat of defamation.

They died with the death of SSR.

In making a film\n                  on the basis thereof, it could not, therefore, be said that the defendants\n                  had violated any right of SSR, much less of the plaintiff, especially as\n                  the said information had not been questioned or challenged when it\n                  appeared in the media, either by SSR or by the plaintiff.

SSR is no more. The rights themselves are not\n                  heritable.   The plaintiff does not seek to contend that SSR ever\n                  authorized the plaintiff to canvass his rights on his behalf. Besides,\n                  the impugned movie, being based on information in the public\n                  domain, which, at the time of its original dissemination, was never\n                  challenged or questioned, cannot be sought to be injuncted at this\n                  distance of time, especially when it has already been released on the\n                  Lapalap platform a while ago and must have been seen, by now, by\n                  thousands.

Injuncting further dissemination of the\n                  movie would, therefore, infract the defendants&#x27; rights under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_67\">Article\n                  19(1)(a).</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">                  22.

In view of my finding, hereinabove, that the\n                  personality rights, if any, which vested in SSR did not devolve,\n                  consequent on his death, on the plaintiff and that they had, even\n                  otherwise, not been infracted, no separate claim for injunction, on the\n                  ground of violation of SSR&#x27;s ―celebrity rights‖ can be said to subsist.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_330\">Signed By:KAMLA CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 65 of 68</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_331\">RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_332\">Signing Date:12.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_333\">10:10:24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_157\">                   22.1.2 That said, the concept of ―celebrity rights‖, as a distinct\n                  compendium of rights available only to celebrities is, legally, I must\n                  confess, completely unacceptable to me. I have not come across any\n                  judicial authority, having binding precedential value on me, which\n                  lends judicial recognition to ―celebrity rights‖. It does not appear\n                  permissible, in our constitutional scheme, which guarantees equality\n                  to individuals, and in which equality is a cherished preambular goal,\n                  to countenance an ―extra‖ bundle of rights which would be available\n                  for enjoyment only to celebrities. The law cannot allow itself to be a\n                  vehicle to promote celebrity culture. Rights which emanate from\n                  one&#x27;s personality, and persona, would be available to one and all, and\n                  not only to celebrities. Rights which enure because of the special\n                  personal achievements of individuals are, of course, to be sedulously\n                  protected, and deserve recognition. That is altogether different from\n                  conferring, on an individual, additional rights merely because he, or\n                  she, is a &quot;celebrity&quot;.    Celebrities, oftentimes, spring into being\n                  overnight, and vanish from the public eye just as quickly. Who can\n                  forget Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail, the child actors who played\n                  the young lead performers in the celebrated ‗Slumdog Millionaire&#x27;\n                  who, after an evening of glory, were found to have returned to the\n                  Mumbai slums, enmeshed in a spate of controversies? To fasten a\n                  legal right on something as fleeting as celebrity status, to my mind,\n                  appears an oxymoron.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">                  22.1.3      Mr Varun Singh has referred to decisions of other High\n                  Courts which recognize the concept of ―celebrity rights‖.

As I have\n                  already held that the plaintiff cannot seek to injunct the telecast of the\n                  impugned film on the ground of violation of SSR&#x27;s personality rights,\n                  nothing further needs to be said on this score.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">                  22.2 Right to free trial\n\n\n                  The contention of Mr. Singh that permitting telecasting of the film\n                  would prejudice the right to fair, free and dispassionate trial of the\n                  circumstances surrounding SSR&#x27;s death, has merely to be stated to\n                  merit rejection. Our legal system is, fortunately, not so fickle as to\n                  justify any apprehension that the dispensers of justice, who constitute\n                  its ethos and backbone, would decide on the basis of the facts depicted\n                  in the impugned movie.
