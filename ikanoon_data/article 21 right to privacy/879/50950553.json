One   Mr.    Basappa    Chandaragi       lodged   a    complaint      with    the\n\n     Murgod Police Station, Savadatti Taluk, Belagavi District stating\n\n     that his daughter Ms. Laxmibai Chandaragi, petitioner No.1 herein\n\n     was missing since 14.10.2020.                       In pursuance to the complaint, FIR\n\n     No.226/2020                     of   a    missing   person      was       registered      and     the\n\n     investigation                    officer     recorded    the    statement      of   the    missing\n\n     person’s parents and her relatives and took call details.                                        From\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n\n     the call details, it became apparent that the petitioner No.1 was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">ASHA SUNDRIYAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2021.02.11</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">17:55:47 IST</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Reason:</span>\n\n     in contact with Mr. Santosh Singh Yadav, petitioner No.2. In the\n\n     course of investigation it was found that the petitioner No.1,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                   2</span>\n\napparently without informing her parents, had travelled by flight\n\nfrom Hubli to Bangalore and further from Bangalore to Delhi and\n\nthereafter married petitioner No.2. The petitioner No.1 sent her\n\nmarriage     certificate             to     her    parents        through          whatsapp    on\n\n15.10.2020       in    which    she        revealed      the    factum       of    marriage    to\n\npetitioner No.2.              It is the case of the State that the IO\n\nproceeded to Ghaziabad to know the whereabouts of petitioner No.1\n\nand on visiting the residence of petitioner No.2, was informed by\n\nhis    parents        that    they    do     not       know    the    whereabouts        of   the\n\npetitioners.          However,        the     petitioner             No.1     spoke      to   the\n\ninvestigating officer and informed that she had already married\n\npetitioner No.2 and was residing with him.                             But the IO instead\n\ninsisted that the petitioner No.1 should appear before the Murgod\n\npolice station to record a statement so that the case can be\n\nclosed. The petitioner No.1 sent a letter to the IO stating that\n\nshe was married to petitioner No.2 and there was threat from her\n\nparents and thus, was unable to visit the police station.                                     The\n\ncase was still not closed of missing person by the IO.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">3.     It   is   in     the    aforesaid          circumstances,            that   the   present\n\npetition has been filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia since according to the petitioner there is an issue of\n\nduality of jurisdiction arising from her residing with petitioner\n\nNo.2 in the State of Uttar Pradesh while the petitioner No.1 came\n\nfrom Karnataka. It is the case of the petitioners that the uncle\n\nof    petitioner       No.1    was        threatening         them.    On    the    petitioners\n\napproaching       the    Allahabad          High       Court    on    19.10.2020,        seeking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                            3</span>\n\nprotection for themselves and the family members, the matter\n\ncould not be taken upon even after about a period of one month\n\nfor urgent hearing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">4.   The    petitioners          have   annexed          a     transcript      of   the\n\nconversation between petitioner No.1 and the police whereby the\n\nIO is asking her to come back to Karnataka as otherwise they will\n\ncome to her and register a case of kidnapping against petitioner\n\nNo.2 at the behest of her family members.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">5.   We have gone through the translation of the transcript at\n\npage D to page H originally in Kannada, now translated in English\n\nin which the petitioner No.1 expressed the feeling of lack of\n\nsafety.    Though the IO stated that they would like to close the\n\ncase, they wanted her to get her statement recorded at the police\n\nstation.    The IO also stated that the family members may file a\n\ncase against her that she has stolen things from the home and if\n\nan   FIR   is   filed,     there    would       be   a       negative   mark   against\n\npetitioner No.2 and they would have to arrest him which would be\n\nproblematic for his job also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">6.   The aforesaid does not tally with what is stated in the\n\ncounter affidavit to the extent that the investigation officer\n\nhad at no point threatened the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">7.   The aforesaid         does not     reflect very           well on    the police\n\nauthorities     or   the   IO,    the   marriage         certificate     having     been\n\nreceived by him and the conversation already been held with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                              4</span>\n\npetitioner No.1 where she clearly stated that she was married to\n\npetitioner      No.2     and    that    she       was     feeling     threatened         and\n\napprehensive of coming to the police station.                        If the IO could\n\nhave      visited the residence of petitioner No.2, he could very\n\nwell have recorded the statement of petitioner No.1 at the place\n\nwhere the petitioners were residing rather than insisting and\n\ncalling upon the petitioners to come to the local police station\n\nat Karnataka.      Not only that, he undoubtedly sought to compel the\n\npetitioner      No.1   to    come     and    record     the    statement        at   police\n\nstation   on    the    threat    of    possibility        of   a    false   case       being\n\nregistered by her parents against the petitioner No.2 and the\n\nconsequent action of the police which would result in the arrest\n\nof petitioner No.2. We strongly deprecate the conduct of the IO\n\nin   adopting    these      tactics    and    the     officer      must    be    sent   for\n\ncounseling as to how to manage such cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">8.     Both the parties are well educated. The petitioner No.2 is\n\nan M.Tech from NIT, Tiruchirapalli, while petitioner No.1-wife,\n\nis an M.A.B.Ed. The petitioner No.2 had got a placement as an\n\nAssistant Professor in Jain College of Engineering, Belagavi,\n\nKarnataka      while   the     petitioner      No.1     was    a   Lecturer       in    KLES\n\n(Karnataka Lingayat Education Society) Pre-University College,\n\nBailhongal and it appears that they developed liking for each\n\nother during these assignments. However, there was resistance\n\nfrom   the   parents     of     petitioner        No.1,    though    the    parents       of\n\npetitioner No.2 were willing for the matrimony of both the well\n\nqualified petitioners who are majors and Hindu by religion.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                  5</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">9.       Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life\n\npartners which, in turn is a departure from the earlier norms of\n\nsociety where caste and community play a major role. Possibly,\n\nthis is the way forward where caste and community tensions will\n\nreduce        by    such    inter      marriage        but    in    the       meantime   these\n\nyoungsters face threats from the elders and the Courts have been\n\ncoming to the aid of these youngsters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">10.      We    are     fortified        in    our      view        by   earlier       judicial\n\npronouncements of this Court clearly elucidating that the consent\n\nof the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once\n\nthe two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that\n\ntheir consent has to be piously given primacy.1                                It is in that\n\ncontext it was further observed that the choice of an individual\n\nis an inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be thought\n\nof where there is erosion of choice.                         Such a right or choice is\n\nnot is not expected to succumb to the concept of “class honour”\n\nor “group thinking.”2\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">11.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18303067\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/18303067/\" id=\"a_2\">Shafin Jahan v.

The intervention of this Court would really not have been\n\nrequired in the given facts of the case if the IO had conducted\n\nhimself more responsibly in closing the complaint and if he\n\nreally wanted to record the statement of the petitioner No.1,\n\nshould have informed that he would visit her and recorded the\n\nstatement instead of putting her under threat of action against\n\npetitioner No.2 to come to the police station.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">13.   The way forward to the police authorities is to not only\n\ncounsel the current IOs but device a training programme to deal\n\nwith such cases for the benefit of the police personnel. We\n\nexpect the police authorities to take action in this behalf in\n\nthe next eight weeks to lay down some guidelines and training\n\nprogrammes how to handle such socially sensitive cases.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">14.   Insofar as the present case is concerned, the petitioners\n\nhaving filed the present petition, no further statement is really\n\nrequired to be recorded and thus, the proceedings in pursuance to\n\nthe FIR No.226/2020 dated 15.10.2020 registered at Murgod Police\n\nStation, Belagavi District, Karnataka are quashed with the hope\n\nthat the parents of petitioner No.1 will have a better sense to\n\naccept the marriage and re-establish social interaction not only\n\n\n5 (2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                    7</span>\n\nwith petitioner No.1 but even with petitioner No.2. That, in our\n\nview, is the only way forward. Under the garb of caste and\n\ncommunity to alienate the child and the son-in-law will hardly be\n\na desirable social exercise. In the words of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\n\n“Annihilation of Caste:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      “I am convinced that the real remedy is inter-marriage.\n      Fusion of blood can alone create the feeling of being kith\n      and kin, and unless this feeling of kinship, of being\n      kindred,   becomes   paramount,   the   separatist   feeling—the\n      feeling of being aliens—created by Caste will not vanish.\n      Where society is already well-knit by other ties, marriage\n      is an ordinary incident of life. But where society is cut\n      asunder, marriage as a binding force becomes a matter of\n      urgent necessity. The real remedy for breaking caste is\n      inter-marriage.
