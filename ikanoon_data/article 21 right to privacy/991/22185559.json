Briefly stated, circumstances relevant for present purposes are as\n                          follows. The respondent no.1 is employed with the petitioners (police\n                          authorities) as a Lady Constable since 03.07.2006. Prior to her joining\n                          service with the petitioners, she got married with one Satya Pal on\n                          07.04.1998 and was blessed with two children. Unfortunately, marriage of\n                          respondent no.1 with Satya Pal could not succeed and was got dissolved\n                          by way of decree dated 16.12.2015 of divorce with mutual consent,\n                          whereby custody of children born from their wedlock was handed over to\n                          Satya Pal. After her divorce, respondent no.1 got married with Deepak on\n                          11.12.2016 and from this second wedlock, respondent no.1 was blessed\n                          with a child on 08.06.2018, so she submitted an application before the\n                          petitioners, thereby seeking maternity leave with effect from 08.06.2018.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">                          The said maternity leave application of respondent no.1 was forwarded by\n                          the petitioners vide communication dated 31.08.2018 to the Government\n                          of NCT of Delhi, seeking opinion. On being consulted by the petitioners,\n                          the Department of Personnel &amp; Training (DoPT) rendered their opinion\n                          dated 12.03.2019 that according to Rule 43 of the CCS (Leave) Rules,\n                          1972, entitlement of a female government servant to maternity leave for a\n                          period of 180 days is if she has less than two surviving children. Relying\n                          upon the said opinion, petitioners rejected the maternity leave application\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                        Page 2 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">11:36:25</span>\n                           of respondent no.1 vide order dated 05.04.2019 and informed her\n                          accordingly. Feeling aggrieved with the decision, respondent no.1\n                          preferred an Original Application, registered as O.A No.1716/2019 before\n                          the learned Tribunal, whereby she sought quashing of order dated\n                          05.04.2019 along with directions to the petitioners to grant her maternity\n                          leave. After hearing both sides, by way of the impugned order dated\n                          30.10.2023, the learned Tribunal allowed the Original Application,\n                          thereby setting aside order dated 05.04.2019 of petitioners and directing\n                          them to grant maternity leave to the respondent. Hence, the present\n                          petition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">                          3.     During arguments, learned counsel for petitioners took us through\n                          the above records and contended that the impugned order is not\n                          sustainable in the eyes of law. She strongly contended that               since\n                          respondent no.1 has two surviving children, in view of Rule 43 of CCS\n                          (Leave) Rules, 1972 she is not entitled to maternity leave now, it being her\n                          third child. However, the learned Tribunal fell in error by placing reliance\n                          on the judgment in the case of Ruksana vs State of Haryana, W.P.(C) No.\n                          4229/2011 as the same pertained to Rule 8.127 of the Punjab Civil\n                          Services Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">                          3.1    Learned counsel for respondent no.2 also supported the petition and\n                          contended that vide Rule 43 of CCS (Leave) Rules 1972, respondent no.1\n                          is not entitled to maternity leave, it being a case of her third child. It was\n                          also argued that Rule 43 being a benevolent provision, maternity leave\n                          cannot be granted where the government servant has more than two\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                           Page 3 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">11:36:25</span>\n                           surviving children, as the principle is based on public policy and family\n                          planning goal of the Central Government.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">                          4.     As mentioned above, finding no merit in the challenge, we opted\n                          not to issue notice of the petition to respondent no.1 so as to avoid on her\n                          the burden of litigation expenses.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">                          5.     Thence, the issue before us is as to whether a lady government\n                          servant, who has two surviving children is or is not entitled to maternity\n                          leave in case of third or subsequent child. The only resistance from the\n                          side of petitioners to grant of maternity leave to respondent no.1 is based\n                          on Rule 43 of CCS (Leave) Rules, 1972, despite the factual position even\n                          according to petitioners&#x27; own pleadings being that both her children born\n                          from her wedlock with her first husband Satya Pal are in custody of the\n                          latter by virtue of the terms of their mutual consent divorce.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                          6.     To begin with, we find this issue to be qua rights of not just\n                          respondent no.1 but rights of her third child as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                          7.

According to Oxford\n                          English Dictionary, the word &quot;maternity&quot; means motherhood. According\n                          to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (5th Edition) &quot;maternity&quot; means\n                          (1) the quality or condition of being a mother; motherhood and (2) the\n                          qualities or conduct characteristic of a mother; motherliness. As per\n                          Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (8th Edition) the word &quot;maternity&quot; means the state\n                          or condition of being a mother, especially a biological one; motherhood.\n                          Broadly speaking, &quot;maternity&quot; in the present day scenario would mean the\n                          period during pregnancy and shortly after acquisition of motherhood\n                          through child birth or adoption or surrogacy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">                          12.    The purpose of the maternity leave is to ensure that a working lady\n                          may overcome the state of motherhood honourably, peaceably and\n                          undeterred by the fear of being victimized for forced absence from work\n                          during pre and post natal period. Women, even otherwise constituting\n                          sizeable part of workforce in our society, must be treated with honour and\n                          dignity at places where they work to earn livelihood.

It is a matter of common knowledge that pregnancy brings about\n                          major physiological changes in the body as well as psychological changes\n                          in mind of the women, ranging from morning sickness to enlargement of\n                          abdomen, coupled with mood swings and bouts of depression. Pregnancy\n                          also restricts movement of the lady carrying the child as it progresses\n                          through the term. In case complications arise during the term, movement\n                          of the pregnant lady may get completely stalled. It is for these reasons that\n                          a pregnant lady is granted maternity leave in government as well as\n                          non-government establishments. The difficulties get aggrandized when the\n                          pregnant lady is in a nuclear family, where she has to take care of all basic\n                          needs of her husband and children. But understanding of maternity cannot\n                          be uni-dimensional, keeping in context only the pregnant lady. The child\n                          from womb to infancy is an integral part of the concept of maternity,\n                          insofar as immediately from the birth moment across the stages of infancy\n                          the child undergoes extensive physical, physiological and psychological\n                          development, which would have significant bearing on her adulthood.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">                          14.    Therefore, not just motherhood, it is also the childhood that requires\n                          special attention. The health issues of both - mother as well as the child\n                          are to be kept in consideration while providing maternity leave, aimed at\n                          protecting the dignity of motherhood by providing for full and healthy\n                          maintenance of the woman and her child. The maternity leave is intended\n                          to achieve the object of ensuring social justice to women and children.\n                          This kind of leave ensures creation of a bond of affection between the\n                          mother and the child.

In earlier centuries, predominantly, in agrarian society, the role\n                          of woman was limited to taking care of children, household and family.\n                          Social conditions of modern family underwent transformation due to\n                          education, industrialization and urbanization. As a result, the social and\n                          legal concept related to the society also got changed. Motherhood has\n                          become a contentious issue in the modern society, particularly, in\n                          economic frontier, as the competing market interests override notions of\n                          culture and social justice like gender equity.

Biologically speaking, in the words of Ernst Haeckel, ontogeny\n                          recapitulates phylogeny. This historical hypothesis, coined in 19th century\n                          suggests that the development of an organism from the stage of\n                          fertilization of ovum to birth of the child (ontogeny) expresses\n                          evolutionary history and all immediate forms of its ancestors (phylogeny).\n                          Although, across past few years, the hypothesis has been slightly\n                          modulated, for present purposes, suffice it to notice the biological\n                          significance of embryonic development during pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">                          15.1 It is scientifically well established that the period of pregnancy and\n                          shortly thereafter is a very crucial period for not just health of the mother,\n                          but also for development of overall personality, the child would acquire\n                          and develop even across her adulthood.

The close touch between the\n                          mother and the child produces a sense of security in the infant, which\n                          gives them a surety that they are secure and in safe hands.                The\n                          skin-to-skin touch assists in balancing blood sugar levels in the infant,\n                          thereby reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                          15.2 The early infancy environment and changes have lasting effect on\n                          the development of brain in the child. Researchers across the world have\n                          observed that infants begin to bond with their mother from the moment of\n                          birth, and this social bond continues to provide regulatory emotional\n                          functions throughout adulthood.

For instance, in\n                          Romania during 1980s, in target group aged 6 to 12 years, levels of the\n                          stress hormone Cortisol were found much higher in children who lived in\n                          orphanages for more than eight months as compared to those who were\n                          adopted at or before the age of four months.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">                          15.3 Other researches show that children who experienced early\n                          deprivation of maternal touch had different levels of Oxytocin and\n                          Vasopressin (hormones that have been linked to emotion and social\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                           Page 16 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">11:36:25</span>\n                           bonding), despite having spent an average of three years in a family home\n                          and this environmental change into a home does not seem to have\n                          completely overridden the effects of earlier neglect, according to medical\n                          researches published in the year 2005 in the proceedings of the National\n                          Academy of Sciences, University of Wisconsin.

The\n                                      concept of social justice is not narrow, one-sided, or pedantic, and is\n                                      not confined to industrial adjudication alone.

The object of maternity leave is to protect the\n                                      dignity of motherhood by providing for full and healthy\n                                      maintenance of the woman and her child. Maternity leave is\n                                      intended to achieve the object of ensuring social justice to women.\n                                      Motherhood and childhood both require special attention. Not only\n                                      are the health issues of the mother and the child considered while\n                                      providing for maternity leave but the leave is provided for creating a\n                                      bond of affection between the two. It is said that being a mother is one\n                                      of the most rewarding jobs on the earth and also one of the most\n                                      challenging. To distinguish between a mother who begets a child\n                                      through surrogacy and a natural mother who gives birth to a child,\n                                      would result in insulting womanhood and the intention of a woman\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                                   Page 20 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">11:36:25</span>\n                                       to bring up a child begotten through surrogacy, as her own. A\n                                      commissioning mother like the petitioner would have the same rights\n                                      and obligations towards the child as the natural mother. Motherhood\n                                      never ends on the birth of the child and a commissioning mother like\n                                      the petitioner cannot be refused paid maternity leave. A woman\n                                      cannot be discriminated, as far as maternity benefits are concerned,\n                                      only on the ground that she has obtained the baby through surrogacy.\n                                      Though the petitioner did not give birth to the child, the child was\n                                      placed in the secured hands of the petitioner as soon as it was born. A\n                                      newly born child cannot be left at the mercy of others. A maternity\n                                      leave to the commissioning mother like the petitioner would be\n                                      necessary. A newly born child needs rearing and that is the most\n                                      crucial period during which the child requires the care and attention\n                                      of his mother. There is a tremendous amount of learning that takes\n                                      place in the first year of the baby&#x27;s life, the baby learns a lot too.\n                                      Also, the bond of affection has to be developed. A mother, as already\n                                      stated hereinabove, would include a commissioning mother or a\n                                      mother securing a child through surrogacy. Any other interpretation\n                                      would result in frustrating the object of providing maternity leave to a\n                                      mother, who has begotten the child.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">                                                                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1952292\" id=\"span_106\">(emphasis supplied)\n\n\n                          16.5     Another progressive judicial precedent we came across is in the\n                          case of <a href=\"/doc/1952292/\" id=\"a_28\">Rama Pandey vs Union of India &amp; Ors</a>, 2015 SCC OnLine\n                          10484, where this court approved grant of maternity leave in cases where\n                          surrogacy route is adopted for motherhood and observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                                      &quot;11.3 Rule 43 implicitly recognises that there are two principal\n                                      reasons why maternity leave is accorded.

It is obvious that in a civilized society the importance of child\n                                      welfare cannot be over-emphasized, because the welfare of the entire\n                                      community, its growth and development, depend on the health and\n                                      well-being of its children. Children are a &quot;supremely important\n                                      national asset&quot; and the future well-being of the nation depends on\n                                      how its children grow and develop. The great poet Milton put it\n                                      admirably when he said: &quot;Child shows the man as morning shows the\n                                      day&quot; and the Study Team on Social Welfare said much to the same\n                                      effect when it observed that &quot;the physical and mental health of the\n                                      nation is determined largely by the manner in which it is shaped in\n                                      the early stages&quot;. The child is a soul with a being, a nature and\n                                      capacities of its own, who must be helped to find them, to grow into\n                                      their maturity, into fullness of physical and vital energy and the\n                                      utmost breath, depth and height of its emotional, intellectual and\n                                      spiritual being; otherwise there cannot be a healthy growth of the\n                                      nation.

Coming back to the question of dignity, those dignity has to be\n                                      understood in the societal background. Indian cultural and\n                                      traditional practices would go to show that motherhood is an\n                                      essential part of family responsibility. International Human Rights\n                                      Law thus protect dignity of woman and also family. The Constitution\n                                      thus demand interpretation of its provisions in that background.\n                                      Person-hood of a woman as mother is her acclaim of individuality\n                                      essentially valued as liberty of her life. This was so designed by\n                                      culture, tradition and civilisation. Mother&#x27;s role in taking care of the\n                                      child has been considered as an honour; she enjoyed such status\n                                      because of her position in respect of the child. If on any reason she\n                                      could not attend her workplace due to her duties towards child\n                                      (compelling circumstances), the employer has to protect her\n                                      person-hood as &quot;mother&quot;. If not that, it will be an affront to her\n                                      status and dignity. No action is possible against a woman employee\n                                      for her absence from duty on account of compelling circumstances\n                                      for taking care of her child. No service Regulations can stand in the\n                                      way of a woman for claiming protection of her fundamental right of\n                                      dignity as a mother. Any action by an employer can be only regarded\n                                      as a challenge against the dignity of a woman. Motherhood is not an\n                                      excuse in employment but motherhood is a right which demands\n                                      protection in given circumstances. What employer has to consider is\n                                      whether her duty attached to mother prevented her from attending\n                                      employment or not. As already adverted above, motherhood is an\n                                      inherent dignity of woman, which cannot be compromised.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">                                                                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133206931\" id=\"span_124\">(emphasis supplied)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                                    Page 24 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">11:36:25</span>\n                           16.8 In the case of <a href=\"/doc/133206931/\" id=\"a_34\">Chanda Keswani vs State of Rajasthan</a>, through the\n                          Principal Secretary, Higher Education, Government of Rajasthan &amp;\n                          Anr., 2023 SCC OnLine Raj 3274, the High Court of Rajasthan\n                          recapitulated various judicial precedents and observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                                      &quot;26.

In view of the aforesaid legal analysis, it is ipso facto clear that\n                                      no distinction can be made by the State Government to a natural\n                                      mother, a biological mother and a mother who has begotten a child\n                                      through surrogacy method.

Therefore, the action of the\n                                      State-respondent is quite unjustified in denying maternity leave to the\n                                      surrogate mother (the petitioner) for taking care of her twins born\n                                      through surrogacy method. Making a difference between natural\n                                      biological mother and surrogate/commissioning mother would\n                                      amount to insult of motherhood.

Unless a purposive interpretation were to be adopted in the\n                                      present case, the object and intent of the grant of maternity leave\n                                      would simply be defeated. The grant of maternity leave under Rules\n                                      of 1972 is intended to facilitate the continuance of women in the\n                                      workplace. It is a harsh reality that but for such provisions, many\n                                      women would be compelled by social circumstances to give up work\n                                      on the birth of a child, if they are not granted leave and other\n                                      facilitative measures. No employer can perceive child birth as\n                                      detracting from the purpose of employment. Child birth has to be\n                                      construed in the context of employment as a natural incident of life\n                                      and hence, the provisions for maternity leave must be construed in\n                                      that perspective.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">                                                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">                          17.

It\n                          was held that the right to maternity leave as created in the Basic\n                          Conditions of Employment Act is an entitlement not linked solely to\n                          welfare and health of the child&#x27;s mother but must of necessity be\n                          interpreted to and take into account the best interest of the child. Not to do\n                          so would be to ignore the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the Republic\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                                   Page 30 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">11:36:25</span>\n                           of South Africa and the Children&#x27;s Act. In all matters concerning the care,\n                          protection and well being of a child the standard that the child&#x27;s best\n                          interest is of paramount importance must be applied. In the said case, as\n                          stipulated under the Surrogacy Agreement, the newly born child was\n                          immediately handed over to the commissioning parents and in the\n                          evidence, the applicant explained that for various reasons, he and his\n                          spouse had decided that he, the applicant would perform the role usually\n                          performed by the birth mother by taking immediate responsibility for the\n                          child and accordingly would apply for maternity leave. Given these\n                          circumstances, the court took a view that there is no reason why an\n                          employee in the position of the applicant should be held not entitled to\n                          maternity leave as granted to a biological mother. Of course, so long as\n                          same sex marriages are not recognized, the factual matrix of the said case\n                          would appear distinctive. But the significance of the said order is to\n                          underline the principle that the basic purpose of maternity leave is the\n                          welfare of the child, which has to be paramount, apart from health of the\n                          mother.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">                          18.

The core of the argument advanced on behalf of the State is that if a\n                          lady government servant has two surviving children, by virtue of Rule 43\n                          of CCS(Leave) Rules, she cannot be granted maternity leave for the third\n                          and subsequent children. That calls upon us to test the applicability of\n                          parity or probe for intelligible differentia, if any between the two sets of\n                          pregnant lady government servants.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">                          19.    It would be crucial to remember that physiological and physical\n                          changes coupled with psychological turbulence that a pregnant woman\n                          undergoes remain the same, be it the first two occasions of pregnancy or\n                          third one or any further thereafter. Besides, on examining the issue from\n                          angle of child rights, we find that   Rule 43 CCS(Leave) Rules creates an\n                          unreasonable distinction between rights of first two children born to a lady\n                          government servant and the third or the subsequent child, making the third\n                          and the subsequent child suffer deprivation of motherly care, which first\n                          two children had received. We are of prima facie view that classification\n                          of lady government servants on the basis of number of surviving children\n                          they have lacks intelligible differentia. However, we must add a rider that\n                          our this view is only prima facie view, because vires of Rule 43 were not\n                          challenged before us, and only in order to arrive at just and fair decision,\n                          we have examined the logic, if any behind Rule 43 of CCS(Leave) Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">                          20.

We\n                          have to be rationalist and situationist judges while dealing with such\n                          situations. The duty of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the will\n                          of the Parliament, as expressed in legislations and in performance of that\n                          duty, the judges do not act as computers into which are fed the statutes and\n                          the rules for construction of statutes in order to cull out mathematically\n                          correct answers.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">                          21.    We have also deliberated upon the argument that Rule 43 of CCS\n                          (Leave) Rules was enacted in tune with the two child policy of the\n                          Government of India, aimed at population control, so must pass muster of\n                          <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Of course, the two child policy aimed at\n                          population control is a laudable policy. That being so, we certainly do not\n                          advocate to incentivise more than two children. But the steps to\n                          disincentivise more than three children must be addressed to the parents\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                           Page 33 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">11:36:25</span>\n                           and not to the children. What is the fault of the third and subsequent child?\n                          They did not have any control over their birth. That being so, it would be\n                          atrocious to expect the third and the subsequent child to be deprived of\n                          motherly touch immediately post natal and during infancy because Rule\n                          43 expects the mother of that child to report for official duties the very\n                          next day of delivery.

In order to achieve success in population control, the government\n                          may take any appropriate innovative steps in order to dissuade the citizens\n                          from giving birth to more than two children. But once third child comes\n                          into existence even in womb, her rights cannot be trampled over.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">                          23.    Further, no statistical data has been placed before us to show as to\n                          out of total women population, how many are in government service and\n                          how many lady government servants give birth to more than two children,\n                          which would have led the government frame Rule 43 of the CCS (Leave)\n                          Rules. For population explosion, the government servants are not the only\n                          class to be held responsible. Nothing has been placed before us to show\n                          the steps taken by the government addressed to the citizens other than\n                          government servants for population control. To reiterate, it is not the\n                          question of incentivising the lady government servant with the third and\n                          the subsequent maternity leave; it is the question of protecting rights of the\n                          third and the subsequent child to mother&#x27;s touch immediately post natal\n                          and during infancy period, which is most crucial for their overall\n                          development - physical as well as psychological.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(C) 9270/2024                                              Page 34 of 35 pages</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">By:RAHUL YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">Signing Date:23.07.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">11:36:25</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">                           24.    Besides, if object of Rule 43 of the CCS (Leave) Rules is population\n                          control, it remains unexplained as to why the maternity leave can be\n                          granted in case of child born through surrogacy. A childless couple always\n                          has an option to adopt, as in every society there are number of children\n                          who do not have parents and the vice versa.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">                          25.
