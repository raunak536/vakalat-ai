The case arose out of a complaint filed by the complainant, Ashok\n                         Kumar before the Superintendent of Police, CBI, ACB, New Delhi, alleging\n                         that the respondent Neeraj Kumar (Junior Engineer, MCD) and co-accused\n                         Sukhdev (Beldar, MCD) demanded a bribe of Rs. 7,000/- to allow him to\n                         store construction materials outside his shop.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">                         3.    Based on the complaint, the CBI, which is the petitioner herein,\n                         conducted verification proceedings on 2nd June, 2022 and 6th June, 2022,\n                         following which a trap operation was conducted on 6th June, 2022, leading to\n                         the arrest of Sukhdev, who was caught red-handed accepting the bribe on\n                         behalf of the respondent allegedly. According to the chargesheet, the\n                         respondent was arrested on 6th June, 2022 and was released on bail on 23rd\n                         June, 2022.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">                         4.    During the course of the trial proceedings, the respondent filed an\n                         application under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 207</a> of the CrPC read with <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 91</a> of the CrPC,\n                         seeking copies of unrelied statements and documents arguing that access to\n                         such documents cannot be denied merely because the prosecution deems\n                         them irrelevant. The respondent also sought preservation of CDRs and\n                         location data of CBI officers and independent witnesses, contending that\n                         such records could be crucial for his defence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">                         5.

Learned SPP appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the\n                         primary objective of a trial is to uncover the truth and the Court cannot aid\n                         the accused in formulating a speculative defence as it would violate the\n                         principles of a fair trial and due process. It is further submitted that while the\n                         prosecution bears the burden of proof, the accused is expected to either\n                         present a truthful version or remain silent rather than fabricate a defence\n                         after reviewing prosecution documents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">                         8.    It is submitted that the respondent has neither raised a specific defence\n                         in any application nor identified any particular documents in the possession\n                         of the petitioner that would support his case. It is further submitted that since\n                         the stage of arguments on charge has not yet reached, such a request is\n                         premature and legally untenable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                         9.    It is submitted that the respondent‟s right to a fair trial was not\n                         infringed, as all documents relied upon by the petitioner were duly provided.\n                         It is further submitted that in cases where there is a conflict between\n                         fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution such as the accused\n                         persons‟ right to a fair trial, the privacy rights of the officials, and the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                                Page 3 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">15:42:20</span>\n                          petitioner‟s right to investigate, the Court must prioritize the broader public\n                         interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">                         10.    It is submitted that the present application is merely an attempt\n                         towards fishing and roving inquiry, lacking any specific allegation, and the\n                         accused is merely attempting to identify loopholes in the investigation\n                         despite there being no claim of any overt act against him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                         11.    It is submitted that as per the accused person‟s own statements\n                         recorded during the investigation, there is no claim that the trap team\n                         members were absent at the time of the incident. It is further submitted that\n                         there is also no allegation that the said officials falsely implicated the\n                         accused. It is also submitted that the request for preserving the CDRs is,\n                         therefore, unfounded and merely a vague attempt to invoke the principle of a\n                         fair trial without any substantive basis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">                         12.    It is submitted that the mobile phones, whose CDRs are sought to be\n                         preserved, are irrelevant to the investigation and have no connection to the\n                         subject matter. It is further submitted that none of the requested CDRs would\n                         establish that the prosecution‟s case is improbable or unworthy of trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">                         13.    It is submitted that the impugned order directed the preservation of\n                         CDRs without establishing a clear connection between the requested mobile\n                         numbers and their relevance to the case. It is further submitted that there is\n                         no specific allegation questioning the presence of the trap team or\n                         independent witness, nor any claim that mobile phone records would alter\n                         the prosecution‟s case.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                             Page 4 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">15:42:20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">                          14.

It is further submitted that given their roles, they are\n                         regularly engaged in investigations and maintain contact with secret\n                         informers. It is also submitted that preserving the CDRs of their mobile\n                         phones could compromise their personal safety, jeopardize ongoing\n                         investigations, and risk exposing confidential sources ultimately affecting\n                         the agency‟s ability to function effectively.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                         15.   It is submitted that mobile numbers and call detail records of CBI\n                         officials and independent witnesses constitute personal information and\n                         disclosing them to the respondent would violate their fundamental right to\n                         privacy. It is further submitted that granting the accused access to CDRs of\n                         CBI officials could lead to the leakage of sensitive information related to\n                         other ongoing investigations, jeopardizing national interest and the agency‟s\n                         operational integrity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                         16.   It is submitted that at no stage has the respondent alleged that the\n                         prosecution against him is mala fide, nor has he claimed that any electronic\n                         evidence in the form of CDRs would disprove the prosecution‟s case. It is\n                         further submitted that the respondent cannot assert a right over the records of\n                         the investigating officer‟s activities, as the officer is engaged in multiple\n                         investigations beyond this case.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                             Page 5 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">15:42:20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">                          17.

It is also submitted that this does not compromise their\n                         safety or privacy, nor does it seek access to their contacts or family details.

It is further submitted that the respondent will present his defence at\n                         the appropriate stage of trial, and the prosecution cannot compel disclosure\n                         of defence before proceedings reach the stage of <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 313</a> of the CrPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">                         29.

It is the case of the petitioner that the impugned order is legally\n                         untenable and prejudicial to the investigation and contends that the\n                         respondent‟s request for the preservation of CDRs and location data lacks\n                         legal basis, as no specific defence has been raised, nor has any claim been\n                         made that the prosecution is mala fide. It is submitted that all necessary\n                         documents have already been provided, and the accused cannot manufacture\n                         a defence by scrutinizing investigative records.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">                         32.   Additionally, since CBI officials and independent witnesses handle\n                         sensitive cases, preserving their CDRs could compromise their privacy,\n                         security and investigative operations. It is further argued that that no\n                         prejudice is caused to the respondent‟s fair trial rights and the impugned\n                         order serves no legitimate purpose. Accordingly, the impugned order is\n                         legally unsustainable and may be set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"68459168\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"849843\" id=\"span_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"872277\" id=\"span_53\">33.

Having considered the submissions advanced by both parties, it is\n                         evident that the crux of the dispute revolves around the scope and validity of\n                         the impugned order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">                         36.

If the petition is found maintainable, the next\n                         question for consideration is whether the impugned order suffers from legal\n                         infirmities and contravenes established principles of law. Lastly, since the\n                         present petition also invokes the inherent powers of this Court, it must be\n                         examined whether the impugned order warrants interference under the\n                         inherent powers of this Court to prevent miscarriage of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">                         38.

The Court outlined four tests to determine whether an order is\n                         final or interlocutory, focusing on whether the order resolves the main\n                         dispute or merely decides a subsidiary procedural matter. An interlocutory\n                         order, while not deciding the primary issue, may still be conclusive on\n                         procedural aspects. The relevant portion is quoted herein below:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                               &quot;The reason probably is that a judgment or order may be final\n                               for one purpose and interlocutory for another or final as to part\n                               and interlocutory as to part. The meaning of the two words\n                               &quot;final&quot; and &quot;interlocutory&quot; has, therefore, to be considered\n                               separately in relation to the particular purpose for which it is\n                               required. However, generally speaking a judgment or order\n                               which determines the principal matter in question is termed\n                               final. It may be final although it directs enquiries or is made on\n                               an interlocutory application or reserves liberty to apply.

From the collective analysis of legal definitions and judicial\n                         pronouncements, it is evident that an interlocutory order is one that does not\n                         finally determine the rights of the parties and merely address a procedural or\n                         interim aspect necessary for the progression of the case. Such an order does\n                         not bring the proceedings to a conclusion, rather, it operates as a temporary\n                         or interim measure that facilitates the trial process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">                         49.   The primary test to determine whether an order is interlocutory is\n                         whether, if reversed, it would terminate the proceedings. If the order does\n                         not conclusively decide the case or any substantial right of the parties, it is\n                         interlocutory in nature and thus, barred from revision under <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 397(2)</a>\n                         of the CrPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">                         50.   In the present case, the impugned order dated 12th July, 2023 merely\n                         directs the preservation of CDRs and location charts, ensuring that such data\n                         remains available if required at a later stage. It does not grant immediate\n                         access to the records, nor does it alter the prosecution‟s case in any manner.\n                         The order only safeguards potential evidence from automatic deletion, and\n                         the respondent would still have to seek permission from the Court at the\n                         appropriate stage to access these records. There is no element of finality in\n                         the order, as it neither adjudicates upon the guilt or innocence of the accused\n                         nor conclusively affects the prosecution‟s ability to conduct the trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">                         51.   Furthermore, applying the test of finality, the impugned order does not\n                         bring the criminal proceedings to an end or determine any significant right\n                         of the parties. The prosecution/petitioner herein remains unaffected in its\n                         ability to proceed with the case, and the respondent‟s request merely\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                               Page 16 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">15:42:20</span>\n                          preserves a category of evidence without disrupting the investigation.

The first and foremost requirement of the section is\n                               about the document being necessary or desirable. The necessity\n                               or desirability would have to be seen with reference to the stage\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                            Page 17 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">15:42:20</span>\n                                when a prayer is made for the production. If any document is\n                               necessary or desirable for the defence of the accused, the\n                               question of invoking Section 91 at the initial stage of framing of\n                               a charge would not arise since defence of the accused is not\n                               relevant at that stage. When the section refers to investigation,\n                               inquiry, trial or other proceedings, it is to be borne in mind that\n                               under the section a police officer may move the court for\n                               summoning and production of a document as may be necessary\n                               at any of the stages mentioned in the section. Insofar as the\n                               accused is concerned, his entitlement to seek order under\n                               Section 91 would ordinarily not come till the stage of defence.\n                               When the section talks of the document being necessary and\n                               desirable, it is implicit that necessity and desirability is to be\n                               examined considering the stage when such a prayer for\n                               summoning and production is made and the party who makes it,\n                               whether police or accused. If under Section 227, what is\n                               necessary and relevant is only the record produced in terms of\n                               Section 173 of the Code, the accused cannot at that stage\n                               invoke Section 91 to seek production of any document to show\n                               his innocence. Under Section 91 summons for production of\n                               document can be issued by court and under a written order an\n                               officer in charge of a police station can also direct production\n                               thereof. Section 91 does not confer any right on the accused to\n                               produce document in his possession to prove his defence.\n                               Section 91 presupposes that when the document is not produced\n                               process may be initiated to compel production thereof.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">                         53.    While the petitioner relied upon the above quoted precedent to argue\n                         that an accused cannot invoke <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 91</a> of the CrPC at the stage of framing\n                         of charge, a closer examination reveals that the judgment is not directly\n                         applicable to the present case and is distinguishable upon the facts.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                             Page 18 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">15:42:20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                          54.   The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the above quoted precedent was\n                         dealing with the issue of accused person‟s right to summon documents in his\n                         defence before the commencement of trial. The Hon‟ble Court held that an\n                         accused does not have an absolute right to summon and produce documents\n                         to prove his innocence before the trial begins, as the charge is to be framed\n                         based only on the prosecution‟s case under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 173</a> of the CrPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">                         55.   However, the facts in the present case are materially different. The\n                         respondent is not seeking the production of documents for his defence at the\n                         charge stage but has merely sought the preservation of CDRs and location\n                         data to ensure the relevant records are not lost due to automatic deletion by\n                         telecom service providers. This distinction is crucial, as the above quoted\n                         precedent dealt with whether an accused can summon documents to\n                         establish his defence at the charge stage, whereas the present case concerns\n                         the preservation of potential evidence and not its immediate production or\n                         use by the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                         56.   It is also clear that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court observed that the\n                         entitlement of an accused to seek an order under <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 91</a> of the CrPC\n                         would „ordinarily‟ not arise until the defence stage. The use of the word\n                         „ordinarily‟ suggest that this is not an absolute rule and that exceptions may\n                         exist where such an order could be warranted at an earlier stage, depending\n                         upon the necessity of the documents sought.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7496\" id=\"span_105\">57.   Thus, reliance on <a href=\"/doc/7496/\" id=\"a_49\">Debendra Nath Padhi</a> (Supra) to argue that an\n                         accused can never seek preservation of documents before the defence stage\n                         is misplaced and also due to the reason that the present case does not involve\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                            Page 19 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">15:42:20</span>\n                          an attempt by the accused to introduce evidence prematurely but rather a\n                         judicial direction ensuring that potentially exculpatory evidence is not lost\n                         before the trial progresses.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"7496\" id=\"span_111\">Hence, the impugned order does not conflict with\n                         the principles <a href=\"/doc/7496/\" id=\"a_50\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/7496/\" id=\"a_51\">State of Orissa v.

Accordingly, issue „a‟ stands decided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">                         59.   Since the revision petition has been found to be not maintainable\n                         under <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 397(2)</a> of the CrPC, a detailed examination of the legality of\n                         the impugned order dated 12th July, 2023 is not necessary. However, given\n                         that the petitioner has challenged the correctness of the impugned order, and\n                         the present petition has been filed under Section 397 read with „<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 482</a>\n                         of the CrPC‟, it becomes necessary to determine whether the inherent\n                         powers of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC can be invoked to\n                         interfere with the impugned order dated 12th July, 2023 and whether any\n                         miscarriage of justice has occurred that warrants judicial intervention?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">                         60.   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC embodies the inherent powers of the High\n                         Court to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice.

Upon perusal of the impugned order, it is clear that it merely directs\n                         the preservation of CDRs and location charts, without granting immediate\n                         access to the respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">                         64.   The purpose of the impugned order is not to provide the accused with\n                         evidence at this stage but to ensure that relevant records are not lost due to\n                         automatic deletion by telecom service providers. The learned Trial Court\n                         exercised its discretion under <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 91</a> of the CrPC, a provision that allows\n                         the court to summon documents if they are necessary or desirable for the\n                         proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">                         65.   Furthermore, upon perusal of the pleadings and submissions of the\n                         petitioner, it is evident that no specific grounds have been raised justifying\n                         interference under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC.

The trial court has categorically held that the impugned order merely\n                         directs the preservation of records and does not grant access to the\n                         respondent at this stage. Since the CDRs and location data have only been\n                         ordered to be preserved and not disclosed, there is no basis for the\n                         petitioner‟s apprehension that this would provide an undue advantage to the\n                         defence. The direction does not interfere with the prosecution‟s case but\n                         simply ensures that potentially relevant evidence is not lost due to automatic\n                         deletion. Therefore, the petitioner‟s contention regarding prejudice to the\n                         prosecution or an unfair advantage to the respondent is unfounded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">                         67.   In view of the foregoing discussions, it is evident that the entire\n                         argument of the petitioner holds no merits as there is neither any legal\n                         infirmity in the impugned order, nor any exceptional ground warranting\n                         interference under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC. The impugned order merely\n                         directs the preservation of potential evidence without affecting the\n                         prosecution‟s case or investigative authority. Furthermore, the petitioner has\n                         not demonstrated any abuse of process or miscarriage of justice which are\n                         the only recognized grounds for invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this\n                         Court under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">                         68.   Accordingly, issue „b‟ stands decided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">                         69.   In light of the foregoing discussions on law and facts, this Court finds\n                         that the present revision petition is not maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 397(2)</a> of\n                         the CrPC, as the impugned order is interlocutory in nature. Furthermore,\n                         even upon examining the impugned order under the spectacles of <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n                         482</a> of the CrPC, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate any legal infirmity,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">Digitally Signed By:PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">KUMAR BABBAR             CRL.REV.P. 1194/2023                                            Page 23 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">Signing Date:04.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">15:42:20</span>\n                          abuse of process or miscarriage of justice that would warrant interference by\n                         this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">                         70.   In view of the above, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the\n                         impugned order passed by the learned Trial Court, as it merely directs the\n                         preservation of potential evidence without affecting the prosecution‟s case or\n                         investigative prerogatives. The impugned order is well within the learned\n                         Trial Court‟s discretionary powers and does not confer any unwarranted\n                         advantage to the accused at this stage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68459168\" id=\"span_133\">71.
