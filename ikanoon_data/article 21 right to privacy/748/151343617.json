As stated earlier the allegations in this regard are two sides\n                                 of the same coin. They are inextricably connected. The importance of the\n                                 question does not lie in the political facts as alleged. But the question is\n                                 whether public utilities affecting very large number of its employees and\n                                 citizens generally, can in law take vital decisions on extraneous\n                                 considerations. This question if of paramount importance to the working\n                                 and administration of public utilities.

In Anand&#x27;s petition the DTC now wants to play a\n                                role of spectator. It had earlier filed a counter affidavit justifying the action\n                                of removal of Anand. It is also heavily relyin on Anand&#x27;s allegation in his\n                                petition, for contesting the qua warranto petition. There is no doubt that if\n                                Anand&#x27;s petition is allowed to go un-contesting and inevitably succeeded,\n                                the quo warranto proceedings would gravely suffer. If Anand succeeds in\n                                his petition in these circumstances, the DTC will on its own showing re-\n                                instate him as a Traffic Manager. The counsel for the DTC in the qua\n                                warranto proceeding has already submitted that on re-instatement of Anand\n                                the present appointment of Anand as a Deputy General Manager would be\n                                cancelled. In such any eventually qua warranto petition may become\n                                infractuous. These circumstances impel me to exercise discretion in favour\n                                of the petitioner in the qua qarranto proceeding.

Mr.\n                                      Prithviraj had mentioned in the nomination papers that he had\n                                      passed MBA in 2004 from Mysore University. The bench, however,\n                                      rejected his plea saying that the election result was materially\n                                      affected by the false declaration and it had to be quashed. The\n                                      court noted that,\n\n                                          He had made the false declaration in the 2008 assembly\n                                          election as well. The contention of the appellant that the\n                                          declaration relating to his educational qualification in the\n                                          affidavit is a clerical error cannot be accepted. It is not an\n                                          error committed once. Since 2008, he was making the\n                                          statement that he has an MBA degree. The information\n                                          provided by him in the affidavit filed in form 26 would amount\n                                          to a false declaration. The said false declaration cannot be\n                                          said to be a defect which is not substantial. An educated\n                                          person cannot hide his education.

With regard to question whether disclosure of such\n                                      identification related information causes invasion of privacy, or is\n                                      that unwarranted invasion of privacy, the PIO has not put forward\n                                      any evidence or explained possibility to show that disclosure of\n                                      degree related information infringes the privacy or causes\n                                      unwarranted invasion of privacy.

The Commission\n                                      observes that the disclosure of details of educational records of a\n                                      student, maintained at University in no way Infringes his/her right\n                                      to privacy, hence there cannot be any violation of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_38\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of\n                                      the Right to Information Act, 2005.

As\n                                      explained above, it cannot be defended as information given in\n                                      &#x27;fiduciary capacity&quot; because the result of examination given after\n                                      securing education through a public admission process is the\n                                      information generated and given by public authority to the student\n                                      and not vice versa.

It cannot also be considered as third\n                                      party information. Public authority has a statutory function to\n                                      process answer-sheets and declare the result.

The issue remained\n                                      is the point of payment of fee. Whether appellant/complainant paid\n                                      the fee of Rs. 10? Only point repeatedly argued and heavily\n                                      dependent upon by the CPIO was that IPO was not properly filled,\n                                      No other reason for rejection was mentioned by the CPIO in all of\n                                      her explanations. The IPO stands proof of his payment of fee.\n                                      Writing &#x27;PIO&#x27; in IPO does not render the entire RTI application as\n                                      &#x27;no application&#x27; as alleged by the CPIO. The IPO in this case is not\n                                      invalid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">                                      15. The CPIO has every authority to collect the fee prescribed. But\n                                      when IPO indicates that Rs 10 paid to Government of India, the\n                                      RTI application cannot be considered as &#x27;without payment&#x27; and be\n                                      rejected. Even non-payment of fee was not prescribed as a ground\n                                      for rejection of RTI application. Only grounds for rejection are\n                                      specifically provided under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_91\">section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_92\">9</a>. Reading <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 6</a> and\n                                      <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_94\">7</a> together and understanding spirit of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_95\">RTI Act</a> as a whole should\n                                      make CPIO to act reasonably and provide information rather than\n                                      searching for excuses to reject. Expression &quot;on payment of such\n                                      fee&quot; means both fee of Rs 10 and further fee representing cost of\n                                      copying. For that the CPIO has to accept and study the RTI\n                                      Application, get ready to give the information sought, if not\n                                      exempted, and seek payment of cost of copying and on receipt of\n                                      additional fee, if needed, and then the information need to be\n                                      provided. What is the significance of fee of Rs. 10? Does it\n                                      represent the value of the information, cost of its searching, labour\n                                      charge for preparing the information or consideration for it? No. If\n                                      CPIO- has any issues with realization of that fee for his authority,\n                                      she has every chance of addressing those issues or communicating\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">                          W.P.(C) 600/2017 &amp; Connected Matters                                  Page 40 of 175</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">Signing Date:25.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">15:29:13</span>\n                                       same with appellant. By returning application along with IPO she\n                                      has closed all those chances. One sms or email or phone call from\n                                      public authority would have helped appellant to resolve the issue\n                                      and facilitated public authority to consider RTI request. The CPIOs\n                                      action of rejection resulted in denial of RTI and harassment of\n                                      applicant. It appears RTI wing of public authority is bent upon\n                                      rejecting RTI requests on some or the other ground,\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">                                      16. There is a point in the contention of the complainant that\n                                      according to the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_96\">RTI Act</a>, Rs. 10 is fee prescribed only at the\n                                      threshold level and nowhere a fee is prescribed at first and second\n                                      appellate stages. The Public authority should know that the fee\n                                      does not mean the cost for their services in giving information. The\n                                      information is not generated for <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_97\">RTI Act</a> but it was developed\n                                      during its core activity. The public authority cannot spend\n                                      unreasonable amounts for gaining Rs.10 when it is already paid in\n                                      the account of Government of India. In this case one can easily say\n                                      that Delhi University has spent more than Rs. 10 in writing a\n                                      rejection letter and more than Rs. 1 lakh in defending the illegal\n                                      rejection upto second appeal. Once fee is paid to the Government\n                                      of India through IPO, it is the duty of the public authority to\n                                      examine whether information demanded could be disclosed or\n                                      exempted under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_99\">9</a> of RTI Act. By rejecting the\n                                      request the CPIO refused to perform this statutory function.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_106\">                                      17.

The\n                                      order of one Information Commissioner is not binding on another\n                                      Information Commissioner except that it might have a strong\n                                      persuasive value.

If application\n                                      is not accompanied by the prescribed fee or the BPL Certificate, it\n                                      cannot be treated as an application under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_100\">RTI Act</a>.

From these guidelines it is clear that &#x27;fee&#x27; is not material factor\n                                      to throw out the RTI request. Non- payment of fee is not prescribed\n                                      ground for rejection of request. In fact, this is not at all a case of\n                                      RTI request without payment of fee. Applicant is also not claiming\n                                      BPL status. The very fact that he has paid fee through court fee\n                                      stamps proves his intention to pay. When guidelines goad the\n                                      public authority to be sympathetic to an applicant without paying\n                                      fee, it does not need special mention that it cannot take technical\n                                      excuse about form of payment to deny or delay the information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">                                      21. Thus the Commission finds no justification to apprehend audit\n                                      objection to giving information disputing the mode of payment. In\n                                      fact, audit will surely object this way of unmindful spending of huge\n                                      amount for Rs. 10. There is a duty cast upon the public authority to\n                                      simplify the process of payment of fee of Rs 10. In Patna, public\n                                      authority accepts the RTI application on phone though it is not\n                                      accompanied with Rs. 10, which is added to telephone bill. Some\n                                      states accept court stamps for payment of fee. It is pathetic that\n                                      such a simple request for information has been dragged to the level\n                                      of second appeal building heaps of documents with multiple files\n                                      consuming reams of paper spending huge amount of money besides\n                                      consuming precious time of public servants including that of the\n                                      Commission.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">                                      22.

It was\n                                      stated in the letter that the IPO is not in favour of Registrar,\n                                      University of Delhi which is required as per Rules. Therefore,\n                                      application alongwith the inadmissible IPO was returned by the\n                                      CPIO to the Appellant with proper guidance. The CPIO has\n                                      mentioned about the website of the University and relevant link of\n                                      the Information Handbook under <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 4</a> of the Act. Therefore,\n                                      the contention of the Appellant that the CPIO has wrongfully\n                                      returned the application is untenable as the procedure followed in\n                                      this matter is, a standard, procedure in the University for such\n                                      incomplete Financial Instruments.

The CPIO claims it was institutional decision and\n                                          not his personal decision. Both the CPIO and Registrar\n                                          présented more than dozen points of &#x27;institutional procedure&#x27;\n                                          for admissibility of RTI applications.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">                                      19. Each of the above factual points appear to be an impediment in\n                                      the access to information as that happened in this case. Denial of\n                                      access was admitted but the CPIO tried to justify. Neither the CPIO\n                                      nor the Registrar could explain the basis of this &#x27;institutional\n                                      procedure for admissibility of RTI applications&#x27;, who authored it,\n                                      who authorized it and when etc. The public authority has not\n                                      published this &#x27;procedure&#x27; on its official website. They claimed it as\n                                      internal procedure. It is not shown to be a regulation passed by\n                                      appropriate body of the public authority. The point 9 of this\n                                      procedure as submitted by the CPIO and reiterated by Registrar,\n                                      authorizes the CPIO to return the original RTI application. The\n                                      text of the point 9 is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">                                      On receipt of the applications with the inadmissible financial\n                                      Instruments from the Section Officer (Finance VII), a letter is\n                                      prepared by the Information Section addressed to the applicant\n                                      forwarding the application and financial Instrument in original for\n                                      the purpose of rectification.

The CPIO reiterated: &quot;As already explained by the CPIO in his\n                                      submissions, the application was not an RTI application, at the first\n                                      instance as per the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_150\">RTI Act</a> and rules framed there under, and\n                                      therefore cannot be treated as an application filed by an\n                                      application as per <a href=\"/doc/864781/\" id=\"a_151\">section 6(1)</a> of the RTI Act&quot;. The CPIO is not\n                                      considering an applicant as RTI Applicant. All this reveal that RTI\n                                      applications were returned routinely allegedly as per this\n                                      unauthorized procedure. Even assuming that it was authorized\n                                      procedure, <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_152\">RTI Act</a> overrides it as per the <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 22</a> of RTI Act. It\n                                      is not just denial of this RTI application, but a continuous practice\n                                      of denying applications in routine, which appears to be seriously\n                                      flawed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_151\">                                      21. The complainant explained that if his RTI request is being\n                                      stone-walled by a self proclaimed &#x27;institutional procedure&#x27;; a\n                                      student, who is at the mercy of the University authorities may not\n                                      venture to challenge them for fear of their stay in University, future\n                                      and career, those students are in fact suffering a lot with this\n                                      attitude of officers and hence he was seriously pursuing this issue.\n                                      He also said that the CPIO being a public servant, expected to act\n                                      in conformity of the law under which he was designated as an\n                                      authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_152\">                                      22. Another contention of the CPIO was that the appellant filed\n                                      complaint, without waiting for the decision in first appeal. This\n                                      cannot come to his rescue as <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 18</a> enables a citizen to file a\n                                      complaint without filing first appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_153\">                                      23. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_155\">The RTI Act</a> specifically says that information request could be\n                                      rejected on the grounds of exemptions prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 8</a>\n                                      or 9 of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_157\">RTI Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1755121/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 5(2)</a> of RTI Act says every public authority\n                                      shall designate an officer to receive the applications for\n                                      information...

The fact of returning the RTI: application of complainant is\n                                      admitted by the CPIO, First Appellate Authority, Deputy Dean\n                                      (Law), and the new CPIO, etc. As the application has been\n                                      returned, the complainant has left with no chance of getting any\n                                      information. Thus the effect of this return of application is rejection\n                                      and complete denial of information. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_163\">The RTI Act</a> has not provided\n                                      for this kind of rejection.

The OM also cautioned that\n                                      such nón-acceptance of IPOs may amount to refusal to accept the\n                                      application which may result into imposition of penalty by the CIC\n                                      on the concerned CPIO. Returning of RTI application in this case\n                                      amounts to refusing to receive an application.

The issue\n                                      remained is the point of payment of fee. Whether\n                                      appellant/complainant paid the fee of Rs. 10? Önly point\n                                      repeatedly argued and heavily dependent upon by the CPIO was\n                                      that IPO was not completely filled. No other reason for rejection\n                                      was mentioned by the CPIO in all of his explanations. The IPO\n                                      stands proof of his payment of fee. Leaving space for addressee\n                                      blank in IPO does not render the entire RTI application as &#x27;no\n                                      application&#x27; as alleged by the CPIO. The IPO in this case is not\n                                      invalid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">                                      28. The CPIO has every authority to collect the fee prescribed. But\n                                      when IPO indicates that Rs 10 paid to Government of India, the\n                                      RTI application cannot be considered as without payment. Even\n                                      non-payment of fee cannot be a ground for rejection of RTI\n                                      application. Only grounds for rejection are specifically provided\n                                      under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_170\">section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_171\">9</a>. Reading <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_173\">7</a> together and\n                                      understanding &#x27;spirit of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_174\">RTI Act</a> as a whole should make CPIO to\n                                      act reasonably and provide information rather than searching for\n                                      excuses to reject. Expression &quot;on payment of such fee&quot; means both\n                                      fee of Rs 10 and further fee representing cost of copying. For that\n                                      the CPIO has to accept and study the RTI Application, get ready to\n                                      give the information sought, if not exempted, and seek payment of\n                                      cost of copying and on receipt of additional fee, if needed, and then\n                                      the information need to be provided. What is the significance of fee\n                                      of &#x27;Rs. 10&#x27;? Does it represent the value of the information, cost of\n                                      its searching, labour charge for preparing the information or\n                                      consideration for it? No. The decision of CPIO to return the entire\n                                      application lock stock and barrel on the excuse that addressee\n                                      space was left blank is without any legal base and totally\n                                      unjustifiable. He refused application at threshold and was not\n                                      inclined to arrange information. The mandatory 30 day limit is\n                                      dismissed by this action. If CPIO has any issues with realization of\n                                      that fee for his authority, he has every chance of addressing those\n                                      issues. By returning application along with IPO he has closed all\n                                      those chances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">                                      29.

Thus it is proved that several\n                                      RTI applications are being rejected on such grounds.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_271\">                                      10. The CPIO justified her action stating that Delhi University has\n                                      a procedure for admissibility of RTI application (they called it\n                                      Institutional Procedure of Admission of RTI Applications). The\n                                      point 9 of this procedure as submitted by the CPIO authorizes the\n                                      CPIO to return the original RTI application. The text of the point\n                                      9-is as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_272\">                                          9. On receipt of the applications with the inadmissible\n                                          financial instruments from the Section Officer (Finance VII), a\n                                          letter is prepared by the Information Section addressed to the\n                                          applicant forwarding the application and financial instrument\n                                          in original for the purpose of rectification.

The CPIO did not explain the basis of this &#x27;institutional\n                                      procedure for admissibility of RTI applications&#x27;, who authored it\n                                      who authorized it and when etc. The public authority has not\n                                      published this &#x27;procedure&#x27; on its official website. They claimed it as\n                                      internal procedure. It is not shown to be a regulation passed by\n                                      appropriate body of the public authority. The rule 9 of that\n                                      procedure proves that there is merit in the contention of\n                                      complainant that Delhi University habitually rejects the RTI\n                                      application on illegal grounds. Pretending to be dedicated and\n                                      committed to earn Rs 10 to the public authority, the CPIO is\n                                      causing the drain of public funds in getting letters of rejection\n                                      posted with approximate cost of Rs 50 or more, makes the\n                                      authorities to appoint lawyers to argue this case at huge cost and\n                                      harass the RTI applicants without giving any information and\n                                      litigating on that to any extent. It appears that there is a set of\n                                      people in the University who bent upon denying information and\n                                      harass the seekers by misusing their discretionary authority both\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_444\">                          W.P.(C) 600/2017 &amp; Connected Matters                                   Page 73 of 175</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_445\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_446\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_447\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_448\">Signing Date:25.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_449\">15:29:13</span>\n                                       under their original office and under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_188\">RTI Act</a>.

Even non-payment of fee was not prescribed as a ground\n                                      for rejection of RTI application.

By returning application along with IPO she\n                                      has closed all those chances. The simple form of communication\n                                      would have helped the appellant to resolve the issue and facilitated\n                                      public authority to consider RTI request. The CPIO&#x27;s action of\n                                      rejection resulted in denial of RTI and harassment of applicant.

There is a point in the contention of the complainant that\n                                      according to the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_207\">RTI Act</a>, Rs. 10 is fee prescribed only at the\n                                      threshold level and nowhere a fee is prescribed at first and second\n                                      appellate stages. The Public authority should know that the fee\n                                      does not mean the cost for their services in giving information. The\n                                      Information is not generated for <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_208\">RTI Act</a> but it was developed\n                                      during its core activity. The public authority cannot spend\n                                      unreasonable amounts for gaining Rs. 10 when it is already paid in\n                                      the account of Government of India. In this case one can easily say\n                                      that Delhi University has spent more than Rs. 10 in writing a\n                                      rejection letter and more than Rs. 1 lakh in defending the Illegal\n                                      rejection upto second appeal. Once fee is paid to the Government\n                                      of India through IPO, it is the duty of the public authority to\n                                      examine whether information demanded could be disclosed or\n                                      exempted under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_210\">9</a> of RTI Act.

The CIC\n                                erroneously held that, since the University is a public body engaged in\n                                public functions (i.e., conducting educational courses), it is obliged to\n                                disclose degree-related information of individuals to third parties under\n                                the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_243\">RTI Act</a>.

In the present case, PSC has taken upon itself in appointing the\n                                         examiners to evaluate the answer papers and as such, PSC and\n                                         examiners stand in a principal-agent relationship. Here PSC in the\n                                         shoes of a principal has entrusted the task of evaluating the answer\n                                         papers to the examiners. Consequently, examiners in the position of\n                                         agents are bound to evaluate the answer papers as per the\n                                         instructions given by PSC. As a result, a fiduciary relationship is\n                                         established between PSC and the examiners. Therefore, any\n                                         information shared between them is not liable to be disclosed.\n                                         Furthermore, the information seeker has no role to play in this and\n                                         we do not see any logical reason as to how this will benefit him or\n                                         the public at large. We would like to point out that the disclosure of\n                                         the identity of examiners is in the least interest of the general\n                                         public and also any attempt to reveal the examiner&#x27;s identity will\n                                         give rise to dire consequences. Therefore, in our considered\n                                         opinion revealing examiner&#x27;s identity will only lead to confusion\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_518\">                          W.P.(C) 600/2017 &amp; Connected Matters                                      Page 85 of 175</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_519\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_520\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_521\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_522\">Signing Date:25.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_523\">15:29:13</span>\n                                       and public unrest.

Public interest in access to information refers to something that\n                                      is in the interest of the public welfare to know. Public welfare is\n                                      widely different from what is of interest to the public. &quot;Something\n                                      which is of interest to the public&quot; and &quot;something which is in the\n                                      public interest&quot; are two separate and different parameters. For\n                                      example, the public may be interested in private matters with which\n                                      the public may have no concern and pressing need to know.\n                                      However, such interest of the public in private matters would\n                                      repudiate and directly traverse the protection of privacy.

In each of the four\n                                 principles. the emphasis is on trust, reliance, the fiduciary&#x27;s superior\n                                 power or dominant -position and corresponding dependence of the\n                                 beneficiary on the fiduciary which imposes responsibility on the\n                                 fiduciary to act in good faith and for the benefit of and to protect the\n                                 beneficiary and not oneself. <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_454\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> is a legal acceptance that\n                                 there are ethical or moral relationships or duties in relationships that\n                                 create rights and obligations, beyond contractual, routine or even\n                                 special relationships with standard and typical rights and obligations.\n                                 Contractual or non-fiduciary relationships could require that the party\n                                 should protect and promote the interest of the other and not cause harm\n                                 or damage, but the fiduciary relationship casts a positive obligation and\n                                 demands that the fiduciary should protect the beneficiary and not\n                                 promote personal self-interest. A fiduciary&#x27;s loyalty, duties and\n                                 obligations are stricter than the morals of the marketplace and it is not\n                                 honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honour which is the most sensitive\n                                 standard of behaviour which is applied (see Opinion of Cardozo, J. in\n                                 Meinhard v. Salmon). Thus, the level of judicial scrutiny in cases of\n                                 fiduciary relationship is intense as the level of commitment and loyalty\n                                 expected is higher than non-fiduciary relationships. Fiduciary\n                                 relationship may arise because of the statute which requires a fiduciary\n                                 to act selflessly with integrity and fidelity and the other party, that is, the\n                                 beneficiary, depends upon the wisdom and confidence reposed in the\n                                 fiduciary. A contractual, statutory and possibly all relationships cover a\n                                 broad field, but a fiduciary relationship could exist, confined to a\n                                 limited area or an act, as relationships can have several facets. Thus,\n                                 relationships can be partly fiduciary and partly non-fiduciary with the\n                                 former being confined to a particular act or action which need not\n                                 manifest itself in entirety in the interaction and relationship between two\n                                 parties. What would distinguish non-fiduciary relationship from\n                                 fiduciary relationship or an act is the requirement of trust reposed,\n                                 higher standard of good faith and honesty required on the part of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_750\">                          W.P.(C) 600/2017 &amp; Connected Matters                                        Page 116 of 175</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_751\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_752\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_753\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_754\">Signing Date:25.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_755\">15:29:13</span>\n                                  fiduciary with reference to a particular transaction(s) due to moral,\n                                 personal or statutory responsibility of the fiduciary as compared to the\n                                 beneficiary, resulting in dependence of the beneficiary.

The person so\n                                 entrusted with power is required to determine how to exercise that\n                                 power. Fiduciaries are identified by ascendancy, power and control on\n                                 the part of the stronger party and therefore, a fiduciary relationship\n                                 implies a condition of superiority of one of the parties over the other.

Breach of confidentiality has an older conception and was\n                                    primarily an equitable remedy based on the principle that one party\n                                    is entitled to enforce equitable duty on the persons bound by an\n                                    obligation of confidentiality on account of the relationship they\n                                    share, with actual or constructive knowledge of the confidential\n                                    relationship. Conventionally a conception of equity, confidentiality\n                                    also arises in a contract, or by a statute. Contractually, an obligation\n                                    to keep certain information confidential can be effectuated expressly\n                                    or implicitly by an oral or written agreement, whereas in statutes\n                                    certain extant and defined relationships are imposed with the duty to\n                                    maintain details, communication exchanged and records\n                                    confidential. Confidentiality referred to in the phrase &quot;breach of\n                                    confidentiality&quot; was initially popularly perceived and interpreted as\n                                    confidentiality arising out of a pre-existing confidential relationship,\n                                    as the obligation to keep certain information confidential was on\n                                    account of the nature of the relationship. The insistence of a pre-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_369\">                                    existing confidential relationship did not conceive a possibility that a\n                                    duty to keep information confidential could arise even if a\n                                    relationship, in which such information is exchanged and held, is not\n                                    pre-existing. This created a distinction between confidential\n                                    information obtained through the violation of a confidential\n                                    relationship and similar confidential information obtained in some\n                                    other way. With time, courts and jurists, who recognised this\n                                    anomaly, have diluted the requirement of the existence of a\n                                    confidential relationship and held that three elements were essential\n                                    for a case of breach of confidentiality to succeed, namely -- (a)\n                                    information should be of confidential nature; (b) information must be\n                                    imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidentiality;\n                                    and (c) that there must be unauthorised use of information\n                                    [See Coco v.

In the\n                                    former case, the claim for misuse of private information can survive\n                                    even when information is in the public domain as its repetitive use\n                                    itself leads to violation of the said right. The right to privacy gets the\n                                    benefit of both the quantitative and the qualitative protection. The\n                                    former refers to the disclosure already made and what is yet\n                                    undisclosed, whereas the latter refers to the privateness of the\n                                    material, invasion of which is an illegal intrusion into the right to\n                                    privacy. Claim for confidentiality would generally fail when the\n                                    information is in public domain. The law of privacy is, therefore, not\n                                    solely concerned with the information, but more concerned with the\n                                    intrusion and violation of private rights. Citing an instance of how\n                                    publishing of defamatory material can be remedied by a trial\n                                    establishing the falsity of such material and award of damages,\n                                    whereas invasion of privacy cannot be similarly redressed, the Court\n                                    had highlighted the reason why truth or falsity of an allegation or\n                                    information may be irrelevant when it comes to invasion of privacy.\n                                    Therefore, claims for protection against invasion of private and\n                                    family life do not depend upon confidentiality alone. This distinction\n                                    is important to understand the protection given to two different rights\n                                    vide <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_498\">Sections 8(1)(j)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_499\">11</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_372\">                                    xxx                               xxx                               xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_373\">                                    51.

This observation highlights the status and importance\n                                    of the right to privacy as a constitutional right. The ratio as recorded\n                                    in the two concurring judgments of the learned Judges (R.F.\n                                    Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul, JJ.) is similar. It is observed that\n                                    privacy involves a person&#x27;s right to his physical body; right to\n                                    informational privacy which deals with a person&#x27;s mind; and the\n                                    right to privacy of choice which protects an individual&#x27;s autonomy\n                                    over personal choices. While physical privacy enjoys constitutional\n                                    recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_503\">Articles 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_504\">Article 21</a>,\n                                    personal informational privacy is relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_505\">Article 21</a> and right to\n                                    privacy of choice is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_506\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21\n                                    and 25 of the Constitution. In the concurring opinion, there is a\n                                    reference to &quot;The Right to Privacy&quot; by Samuel Warren and Louis D.\n                                    Brandeis on an individual&#x27;s right to control the dissemination of\n                                    personal information and that an individual has a right to limit\n                                    access to such information/shield such information from\n                                    unwarranted access. Knowledge about a person gives another power\n                                    over that person, as personal data collected is capable of effecting\n                                    representations in his decision-making process and shaping\n                                    behaviour which can have a stultifying effect on the expression of\n                                    dissent which is the cornerstone of democracy. In the said\n                                    concurring judgment, it has been further held that the right to\n                                    protection of reputation from being unfairly harmed needs to be\n                                    zealously guarded not only against falsehood but also against certain\n                                    truths by observing : (SCC p. 628, para 623)\n\n                                    &quot;623. An individual has a right to protect his reputation from being\n                                    unfairly harmed and such protection of reputation needs to exist not\n                                    only against falsehood but also certain truths. It cannot be said that\n                                    a more accurate judgment about people can be facilitated by\n                                    knowing private details about their lives -- people judge us badly,\n                                    they judge us in haste, they judge out of context, they judge without\n                                    hearing the whole story and they judge with hypocrisy. Privacy lets\n                                    people protect themselves from these troublesome judgments.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_375\">                                    53. Privacy, it is uniformly observed in K.S. Puttaswamy, is essential\n                                    for liberty and dignity. Therefore, individuals have the need to\n                                    preserve an intrusion-free zone for their personality and family. This\n                                    facilitates individual freedom. On the question of invasion of\n                                    personal liberty, the main judgment has referred to a threefold\n                                    requirement in the form of -- (i) legality, which postulates the\n                                    existence of law (the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_507\">RTI Act</a> in the present case); (ii) need, defined\n                                    in terms of a legitimate State aim; and (iii) proportionality, which\n                                    ensures a rational nexus between the objects and the means to be\n                                    adopted to achieve them.

The said judgment goes on to clarify that it is important to distinguish\n                          between the separate concept of &quot;interest of the public&quot; and &quot;something in\n                          public interest&quot;. The Court has emphasized that public interest needs to be\n                          distinguished from matters which are for &quot;public entertainment, curiosity or\n                          amusement&quot;. The relevant observations of the Court are as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_416\">                                 &quot;151. The contextual balancing involves &quot;proportionality test&quot;. [See\n                                 K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-9 J.) v. Union of India] The test is to see\n                                 whether the release of information would be necessary, depends on the\n                                 information seeker showing the &quot;pressing social need&quot; or &quot;compelling\n                                 requirement for upholding the democratic values&quot;. We can easily\n                                 conclude that the exemption of public interest as occurring under\n                                 <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_552\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> requires a balancing test to be adopted. We need to\n                                 distinguish two separate concepts i.e. &quot;interest of the public&quot; and\n                                 &quot;something in the public interest&quot;. Therefore, the material distinction\n                                 between the aforesaid concepts concern those matters which affect\n                                 political, moral and material welfare of the public need to be\n                                 distinguished from those for public entertainment, curiosity or\n                                 amusement. Under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_553\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act requires us to hold that\n                                 only the former is an exception to the exemption. Although we must note\n                                 that the majority opinion in K.S. Puttaswamy has held that the data\n                                 privacy is part of the right to privacy, however, we need to note that the\n                                 concept of data protection is still developing [refer Google Spain SL v.\n                                 Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD), Bavarian Lager Co.\n                                 Ltd. v.

The CPIO, when considering whether or not &quot;public interest&quot; in a\n                          particular context would override the exemption afforded by <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_554\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>,\n                          cannot be expected to assess the matter based on purely subjective\n                          predilections. There has to be an objective test that is to be applied. Such an\n                          objective test is mandated in terms of the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_555\">Bihar Public Service\n                          Commission v.

It is evident\n                              therefrom that disclosure is not mandated in a situation where the\n                              information sought has no relation to any public activity.

However, the RTI Act does not specifically identify factors to be taken\n                          into account in determining where the public interest lies.

The legislature has not exempted all personal information under\n                                 <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_570\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> but only such personal information, the disclosure of\n                                 which has no relationship to any public activity or interest. Since the\n                                 selection process for Junior Clerks at the District Court in Pune was\n                                 essentially a public activity which commenced with public advertisement\n                                 inviting applications from eligible candidates, we do not think that the\n                                 disclosure of marks obtained by the candidates participating in such a\n                                 process would amount to personal information, the disclosure of which\n                                 has no relationship to any public activity or interest. Given that such\n                                 selection processes must be transparent and above board, it would be in\n                                 the public interest to disclose such information rather than withhold it\n                                 and allow any doubts about the process (however unjustified such\n                                 doubts may be) to linger.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_421\">                                 29. Similarly, in the context of a public examination for selection to a\n                                 public post, we are doubtful whether the disclosure of marks obtained by\n                                 the candidates would amount to any unwarranted invasion of the\n                                 privacy of such candidates. The legislature has advisedly used the\n                                 expression &quot;unwarranted&quot;. Therefore, not any and every invasion of an\n                                 individual&#x27;s privacy is exempted from disclosure. Only what is exempted\n                                 from disclosure is &quot;unwarranted invasion&quot;. Even here, the disclosure\n                                 can be ordered where the PIO or the appellate authorities are satisfied\n                                 that the &quot;larger public Interest justifies the disclosure of such\n                                 information&quot;. The proviso is also significant since it provides that the\n                                 information which cannot be denied to Parliament or the State\n                                 Legislature will not be denied to any person.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_414\">                          130. Thus, in Onkar Dattatray Kalmankar (supra), the Court found that\n                          the disclosure of marks obtained by candidates participating in a recruitment\n                          process was justified, inasmuch as public interest warranted that the\n                          selection process be transparent and above board, and that this public\n                          interest would be served by disclosing the requisite information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_415\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_967\">131.

Medical records, treatment, choice of medicine, list of\n                                 hospitals and doctors visited, findings recorded, including that of the\n                                 family members, information relating to assets, liabilities, income tax\n                                 returns, details of investments, lending and borrowing, etc. are personal\n                                 information.

This list is illustrative\n                                 and not exhaustive. The observations in this para must be considered in\n                                 tandem with the other observations in the same decision, bearing in\n                                 mind the context in which they were made.

The court has explained that public interest in access to\n                                 Information refers to something that is in the interest of public welfare\n                                 to know. Public welfare is widely different from what is of interest to the\n                                 public. &quot;Something which is of interest to the public&quot; and &quot;something\n                                 which is in the public interest&quot; are two separate and different\n                                 parameters. For example, the public may be interested in private\n                                 matters with which the public may have no concern and pressing need to\n                                 know. However, such public interest in private matters would repudiate\n                                 and directly traverse the protection of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_424\">                                   xxx                             xxx                                xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_425\">                                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98132808\" id=\"span_974\">37. Thus, if the decision in <a href=\"/doc/98132808/\" id=\"a_572\">Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a> case is read in\n                                 its entirety and not by just picking some stray sentences dehors the\n                                 entire context, we are satisfied that the objection based on the\n                                 expression under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_573\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act ought not to prevail.

The disclosure of marks in a public recruitment process\n                                 cannot be said to be purely personal information, the disclosure of\n                                 which has no relationship to any public activity or interest or which\n                                 would cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. In\n                                 any event, the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such\n                                 information. Such disclosure would promote transparency and\n                                 accountability and dispel the lingering doubts about wrongdoings in the\n                                 public recruitment process.

Thus, the trend\n                                 under the new RTI regime is to disclose information that would maintain\n                                 trust in the recruitment process without unduly compromising the\n                                 privacy of any candidate.

This may not be the correct approach. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_587\">The Act</a> seeks to bring\n                                 about a balance between two conflicting interests, as harmony between\n                                 them is essential for preserving democracy. One is to bring about\n                                 transparency and accountability by providing access to information\n                                 under the control of public authorities The other is to ensure that the\n                                 revelation of information, in actual practice, does not conflict with other\n                                 public interests which include efficient operation of the Governments,\n                                 optimum use of limited fiscal resources and preservation of\n                                 confidentiality of sensitive information. The Preamble to the Act\n                                 specifically states that the object of the Act is to harmonise these two\n                                 conflicting interests.

As rightly pointed out by the Ld.

The other subjective observations in the impugned order viz. equating\n                          acquisition of a degree to the acquisition of immovable property, or drawing\n                          subjective inference from the fact that degrees are conferred in a\n                          convocation, etc. are all de-hors the statutory provisions. Moreover, the CIC\n                          misdirected itself in relying upon anecdotal material and subjective\n                          assessments and drawing conclusions therefrom.

From these guidelines it is clear that &#x27;fee&#x27; is not material factor to\n                                 throw out the RTI request. Non- payment of fee is not prescribed ground\n                                 for rejection of request. In fact, this is not at all a case of RTI request\n                                 without payment of fee. Applicant is also not claiming BPL status. The\n                                 very fact that he has paid fee through court fee stamps proves his\n                                 intention to pay. When guidelines goad the public authority to be\n                                 sympathetic to an applicant without paying fee, it does not need special\n                                 mention that it cannot take technical excuse about form of payment to\n                                 deny or delay the information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_471\">                                 21. Thus the Commission finds no justification to apprehend audit\n                                 objection to, giving information disputing the mode of payment. In fact,\n                                 audit will surely object this way of unmindful spending of huge amount\n                                 for Rs. 10. There is a duty cast upon the public authority to simplify the\n                                 process of payment of fee of Rs 10. In Patna, public authority accepts the\n                                 RTI application on phone though it is not accompanied with Rs 10, which\n                                 is added to telephone bill. Some states accept court stamps for payment\n                                 of fee. It is pathetic that such a simple request for information has been\n                                 dragged to the level of second appeal building heaps of documents with\n                                 multiple files consuming reams of paper spending huge amount of money\n                                 besides consuming precious time of public servants including that of the\n                                 Commission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_472\">                                 22.

The\n                          said order again characterized the conduct of the CPIO/Delhi University as\n                          &quot;penny wise and pound foolish&quot;.

From these guidelines it is clear that &#x27;fee&#x27; is not material factor to\n                                 reject the RTI request. In fact, this is not at all a case of RTI request\n                                 without payment of fee. Applicant is also not claiming BPL status. The\n                                 very fact that he has paid fee through court fee stamps proves his\n                                 intention to pay. When guidelines goad the public authority to be\n                                 sympathetic to an applicant without paying fee, it does not need special\n                                 mention that it cannot take technical excuse about form of payment to\n                                 deny or delay the Information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_449\">                                 21. Thus the Commission finds no justification to apprehend audit\n                                 objection to giving Information disputing the mode of payment. In fact,\n                                 audit will surely object this way of unmindful spending of huge amount\n                                 for Rs. 10. There is a duty cast upon the public authority to simplify the\n                                 process of payment of fee of Rs 10. In Patna, public authority accepts\n                                 the RTI application on phone though it is not accompanied with Rs 10,\n                                 which is added to telephone bill. Some states accept court stamps for\n                                 payment of fee. It is condemnable that such a simple request for\n                                 information has been dragged to the level of second appeal, building\n                                 heaps of documents with multiple files, consuming reams of paper,\n                                 spending huge amount of money besides consuming precious time of\n                                 public servants including that of the Commission.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_450\">                                 22.

They do not, however, render any\n                          determination on the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_704\">Sections 8(1)(e)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_705\">8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI\n                          Act in the context of their respective petitions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_479\">                          174. This Court is of the opinion that the above impugned orders are\n                          fraught with various legal infirmities. Firstly, while seeking to impose\n                          penalty, the authority has failed to take note of the scope and import of\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_706\">Section 20</a> of the RTI Act. The same contemplates that a penalty can be\n                          imposed only if CPIO has: (i) without reasonable cause, refused to receive\n                          an application; (ii) not furnished the information within the time specified;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_480\">                          (iii) malafidely denied the request for information; and/or (iv) knowingly\n                          given incorrect or misleading information, or destroyed information which\n                          was subject of the RTI Application.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_481\">                          175. The imposition of a penalty and its recovery from the personal salary\n                          of the CPIO requires clear, cogent and specific finding of deliberate wrong\n                          doing or misconduct. The impugned order fails to take into account that\n                          there is a stark difference between a procedural infirmity/error and the\n                          deliberate obstruction of an RTI application.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_482\">                          176.

It was emphasized that the procedure was\n                          evolved in view of the extremely large number of RTI applications that are\n                          received by the Delhi University.

There is no scope of application of any personal discretion by the\n                                 CPIO as he is neither physically accepting the applications along with\n                                 the financial instruments directly from the applicant nor deliberating\n                                 upon the fee encashment process. A careful perusal the RTI (Fee and\n                                 Cost) Rules, 2012 clearly brings out that such responsibility has been\n                                 categorically vested on the CAPIO of the Public Authority and the\n                                 University is yet to designate, a CAPIO under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_709\">RTI Act</a>. In the\n                                 absence of the CAPIO, the Finance Office of the University de facto\n                                 discharges the duties of the CAPIO in terms of fee encashment. Mere\n                                 communication of the inadmissible applications for various reasons\n                                 including reason of inadmissible fee instrument is done by the\n                                 Information Section to facilitate such rectification of such deficiency by\n                                 the Information seekers.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_462\">                                 11.

The staggering number of RTI applications is demonstrative of the\n                          burden imposed on the CPIO. To attribute malafides to the CPIO for\n                          following the established, institutionalized procedure does not appear to be\n                          justified in the present case. Moreover, the recovery of the maximum\n                          amount of penalty contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_722\">Section 20</a> of the RTI Act from the\n                          personal salary of CPIO is clearly disproportionate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_496\">                          188. While this Court is usually loath to interfere with the exercise of\n                          discretion by the CIC in assessing / considering a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_723\">Section\n                          18</a> and/or imposing a penalty under <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_724\">Section 20</a>, in the facts of this case it is\n                          evident that such discretion had not been properly exercised. The same\n                          suffers on account of non-consideration of the &quot;reasonable cause shown by\n                          the CPIO&quot;, particularly the fact that the procedure followed was in sync with\n                          the established internal protocol/s, which had evolved and been put in place\n                          in view of the sheer volume of RTI applications received every year by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1165\">                          W.P.(C) 600/2017 &amp; Connected Matters                          Page 172 of 175</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1166\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1167\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1168\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1169\">Signing Date:25.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1170\">15:29:13</span>\n                           Delhi University.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_497\">                          189. Moreover, on previous occasions, CIC found that the alleged\n                          infraction did not constitute a valid ground for imposition of penalty. While\n                          a body such as CIC is not strictly bound by the doctrine of stare decisis, it is\n                          expected to take a uniform, consistent view. Such a stark deviation (in the\n                          present cases), without any attempt to distinguish past precedents (attention\n                          to which was specifically drawn by the Delhi University) or to explain the\n                          rationale of the departure, renders the entire adjudicatory exercise vulnerable\n                          to challenge on the ground of arbitrariness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_498\">                          190.

The\n                                    Commission in case No. 001389 has directed the CPIO to explain and\n                                    show cause as to why maximum penalty should not be imposed against\n                                    him and why compensation should not be granted to the appellant and\n                                    disciplinary action should not be recommended against him.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_503\">                          195. These show cause notices, being founded on the very same\n                          circumstances already examined and adjudicated upon in the preceding\n                          paragraphs of this judgment, are equally unsustainable and are, accordingly,\n                          set aside. Also, as noted above, respondent no. 1/the RTI applicant/ Shri\n                          R.K. Jain, has since passed away. Consequently, the grievance/s of the\n                          information applicant has been rendered moot.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_504\">                          196.

The present writ petition has been filed to challenge the order dated\n                          13.06.2016 passed by respondent no. 1, whereby the petitioner&#x27;s RTI\n                          application seeking inspection of documents pertaining to a student of the\n                          Delhi University, bearing enrolment number CC-5594/74, was rejected on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1177\">                          W.P.(C) 600/2017 &amp; Connected Matters                                    Page 174 of 175</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1178\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1179\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1180\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1181\">Signing Date:25.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1182\">15:29:13</span>\n                           the ground that the information sought was exempted under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_729\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\n                          of the RTI Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_506\">                          198. The petitioner has also impugned the order dated 15.07.2016 passed\n                          by the First Appellate Authority, which upheld the decision of the CPIO\n                          rendered on 13.06.2016. Further, the petitioner assails the order dated\n                          08.09.2017 passed by the CIC, whereby the CIC disposed of the second\n                          appeal of the petitioner on the reasoning that the subject matter was already\n                          pending adjudication before this Court in W.P.(C) No. 600 of 2017. It was\n                          noted that this Court had granted a stay on 23.01.2017, and hence, no further\n                          intervention was considered necessary by the Commission. It is in the above\n                          background that the present petition has been filed by the RTI applicant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_507\">                          199. For the reasons elaborately discussed in the preceding paragraphs of\n                          this judgment, it is manifest that the information sought by petitioner&#x27;s RTI\n                          application falls squarely within the exemption contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_730\">Section\n                          8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, for the reasons enumerated hereinabove.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_508\">                          200.
