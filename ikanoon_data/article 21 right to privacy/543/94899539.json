Heard      the    arguments    of   Sri   Hashmath     Pasha,\n\nlearned Senior counsel along with learned counsel Sri Nasir\n\nAli appearing for the petitioner/accused No.1 and Sri\n\nV.M.Sheelavanth, learned SPP-I along with Sri Mahesh\n\nShetty, learned High Court Government Pleader for the\n\nrespondents\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.   The case of the petitioner/accused No.1 is that on\n\nthe suo motu complaint of Chandrashekar S.G., PSI of\n\nAnnapoorneshwari Nagar Police Station (respondent No.2\n\nherein)   the   case    came   to   be    registered   in   Crime\n\nNo.110/2021 for the aforesaid offences.          It is alleged by\n\nthe Police Officer in his complaint dated 20.05.2021 that\n\nhe received credible information that at ITI Layout, 6th\n\nMain road, Mallathahalli, Bengaluru, in one of the houses,\n\nsome persons are giving Covishield vaccination to the\n\npublic by collecting Rs.500/- per head illegally and the\n\nvials were stolen from government Primary Health Centre.\n\nImmediately, he secured women constables, other police\n\nconstables along with panchas, visited the said address\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                4</span>\n\n\nand sent a Constable as decoy and after confirming the\n\ncomplaint, apprehended accused Nos.1 and 2.                    The\n\npetitioner who is said to be a Doctor working in a Primary\n\nHealth Centre at Manjunathanagar in Rajajinagar ward has\n\nstolen the Covishield vaccine from the hospital and illegally\n\nvaccinating the public by collecting Rs.500/- per head.\n\nThen    the   Investigating   Officer   seized    the     remaining\n\nCovishield vials and empty vaccine bottles, syringes and\n\nused syringes under the panchanama. It is also revealed\n\nthat the said house belonged to accused No.2 who is a\n\nfriend of accused No.1, the present petitioner. They also\n\nseized Rs.12,000/- from her possession, brought her to the\n\nPolice Station and registered the case. Subsequently, the\n\npetitioner is said to have been released on bail. Hence, the\n\npetitioner/accused No.1 has filed this petition for quashing\n\nthe FIR and all further proceedings for the aforesaid\n\noffences as an abuse of process of law on various grounds.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.     Sri    Hashmath   Pasha,     learned      Senior     counsel\n\ncontended that registering the FIR after apprehending the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               5</span>\n\n\naccused is illegal. Therefore, registering the FIR, seizing\n\nthe articles and preparing the panchanama after arresting\n\nthe petitioner is in violation of the procedure under Section\n\n154 and 155(2) of Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">5.       Learned Senior counsel also contended that the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1008909/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 53</a> of the Disaster Management Act\n\nis a non-cognizable offence which is punishable with two\n\nyears of imprisonment and also with fine and as per\n\nSchedule II of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_11\">Cr.P.C</a>., the offence is non-cognizable.\n\nTherefore,    without   obtaining   the   permission   of   the\n\nMagistrate under <a href=\"/doc/1518148/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 155(2)</a> of Cr.P.C., proceeding to\n\nthe spot, seizing the articles, arresting the accused is in\n\nviolation of the provisions of law and also raiding the\n\nhouse is nothing but breach of fundamental rights of\n\nprivacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.     Learned Senior counsel also contended that the\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/839778/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 380</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1591527/\" id=\"a_15\">403</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_16\">409</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_17\">420</a> of IPC are not\n\nattracted as there is no theft or cheating. The Police have\n\ninvoked the said provisions by implicating the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                6</span>\n\n\nfalsely.   The Police gets the authority to seize the articles\n\nand arrest the accused only after registering the FIR\n\notherwise it amounts to violating the fundamental rights as\n\nwell as the procedure prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_18\">Cr.P.C</a>.         In\n\nsupport of his case, learned counsel relied upon a decision\n\nof a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of\n\nL.Shankaramurthy         and       others   vs.   State    by\n\nLokayuktha Police, City Division, Bangalore Urban\n\nDivision, Bangalore, reported in 2012 SCC OnLine Kar.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_5\">8923 and the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_19\">Lalitha Kumari vs. Government of Uttar\n\nPradesh and others</a> reported in (2014) 2 SCC 1. Also,\n\nin respect of right of privacy, learned Senior counsel relied\n\nupon a judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case\n\nof Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.)</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_6\">and <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_20\">another\n\nvs. Union of India and others</a> reported in (2017) 10\n\nSCC 1.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.    Per contra, Sri V.M. Sheelavanth, learned SPP-I,\n\nobjected     the   petition    and    contended    that   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                               7</span>\n\n\npetitioner/accused No.1 being a Doctor working in a\n\nPrimary Health Centre situated at Manjunathanagar in\n\nRajajinagar was supposed to administer vaccine to the\n\npublic in the government hospital which is meant for free\n\nof cost has carried the Covishield vials to a private place of\n\nlong distance away from the hospitals and kept in the\n\nhouse of accused No.2, who is her friend and administered\n\nthe same to the public by collecting Rs.500/- per head,\n\nwhich amounts to theft of government property from the\n\nplace of work and also using it for his own purpose or\n\nselling the same is nothing but mis-appropriation and\n\ncheating the government.     Moreover, selling the same to\n\nthe public after taking Rs.500/- per head is an offence\n\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">Indian Penal Code</a> as well as under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"><a href=\"/doc/1008909/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 53</a> of the Disaster Management Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.    Further, the learned SPP-I contended that the Police,\n\nbefore proceeding to the spot, registered the information\n\nreceived in writing in the Station Diary and then proceeded\n\nto the spot, apprehended the accused, seized the articles\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                              8</span>\n\n\nand brought to the Police station, registered the case and\n\nthen arrested the petitioner.      Therefore, there is no\n\nviolation of any of the provisions of law either under\n\nSection 154 or 155 of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_23\">Cr.P.C</a>.     The Investigating Officer\n\nhas no definite information as to whether the offence\n\ncommitted is cognizable or non-cognizable in order to\n\nprepare the FIR prior to ascertaining the nature of offence.\n\nTherefore, he sent a Police Constable as a decoy and after\n\nconfirming the crime, he apprehended, seized the empty\n\nbottles and vials of Covishield vaccine, but by that time\n\nalready the petitioner has vaccinated many persons by\n\ncollecting Rs.500/- per head. Selling the vaccine which is\n\nmeant for free of cost for Rs.500/- is nothing but selling it\n\nin the black market.       The Investigating Officer has\n\nascertained the offence only on the spot and thereafter\n\narrested the petitioner as such, there is no violation of any\n\nof the provisions of law and also there is no violation of\n\nany of the fundamental right of the petitioner by raiding\n\nthe spot. Hence, prayed for dismissal of the petition.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                              9</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">8.    Upon hearing the arguments and on perusal of the\n\nrecords, it is not in dispute that the petitioner is a Doctor\n\nworking in the Primary Health Centre at Manjunathanagar\n\nin Rajajinagar ward and her services were appreciated by\n\nthe Minister by felicitating her as per the photographs\n\nproduced by the petitioner&#x27;s counsel.       However, the fact\n\nremains that accused Nos.1 and 2 were arrested at\n\nAnnapoorneshwari Nagar Police limits.        In the house of\n\naccused No.2, the petitioner/accused No.1 was found to be\n\nadministering   Covishield   vaccine   to    the   public   by\n\nmaintaining a note-book and receiving Rs.500/- per head\n\nand already emptied 3 vials and two more vials were in her\n\npossession. The used syringes as well as unused syringes,\n\nin all, 24 syringes and two syringes filled with Covishield\n\nvaccine were seized by the Police.     As per <a href=\"/doc/1008909/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 53</a> of\n\nthe Disaster Management Act, the offence is punishable\n\nupto two years of imprisonment and with fine and a non-\n\ncognizable offence requires permission of the Magistrate\n\nfor seizure and arrest. The fact remains that the Police got\n\nthe information on 20.05.2021 at 3.30 p.m. that some\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     10</span>\n\n\npersons are administering Covishield vaccine to the public\n\nby collecting Rs.500/- per head, which is meant for free of\n\ncost.     That was the only information received.             Whether\n\nthe accused was a Doctor and giving vaccination is not\n\nknown      to    the    Investigating      Officer.       Though,    the\n\nInvestigating Officer has written in the Station House Diary\n\nthat information is received regarding some persons\n\nvaccinating the public by collecting Rs.500/- per head, but\n\nnot registered the FIR and not chosen to get permission of\n\nthe     Magistrate.          Thereafter,   the   Police    Officer   has\n\nproceeded to the spot, seized the articles and later\n\nregistered the FIR without obtaining any permission of the\n\nMagistrate either for search or seizure and arrested the\n\naccused persons. It is well-settled principle by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme         Court   in    the   case   of Lalitha      Kumari     at\n\nparagraph 120, which is as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot;Conclusion/Directions:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        120.

Admittedly, the Police officer\n\nwent to the spot and with the help of a decoy, the Police\n\nofficer got confirmed that the petitioner was selling\n\nCovishield vaccine to the public at Rs.500/- per head and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  14</span>\n\n\nthe vaccination had been stolen from the Primary Health\n\nCentre    at       Manjunathanagar,    which    is    nothing     but\n\nmisappropriation and misusing the material which is meant\n\nfor pandemic relief material and using, selling the same is\n\nan offence under <a href=\"/doc/1008909/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 53</a> of the Disaster Management\n\nAct, but after confirming the information, the Police Officer\n\nhas not chosen to prepare the complaint and send to the\n\nPolice Station for the purpose of registering the case and\n\nfor taking any permission from the Magistrate.             On the\n\nother hand, the Police Officer took the action by arresting\n\nthe accused and seizing the articles which amounts to\n\ninvestigation. Even if the case is made out for cognizable\n\noffence, the Police are required to register the case and\n\nthen take action.       In a non-cognizable offence, even the\n\nPolice cannot register the case, without taking permission\n\nand they cannot proceed to take action either seizure or\n\narrest   of    a    person,   which   amounts    to   violation    of\n\nprocedure.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 15</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/1008909/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 53</a> of the Disaster Management Act is\n\nextracted as under;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      &quot;53.

On perusal of the Station House Diary where there is\n\nan entry regarding credible information received by the\n\nPolice that vaccinations were given to the public by taking\n\nmoney but even in the Station House Diary, it was not\n\nmentioned that he had no time to register the FIR and the\n\nnature of the offence committed, but it says, only he has\n\ndeputed a Police constable for bringing panchas, which\n\nmeans he has proceeded to the spot with panchas for\n\nseizure and later searched and seized the articles along\n\nwith cash and apprehended accused Nos.1 and 2, which is\n\nnothing but action taken in pursuance of the information\n\nreceived amounting to investigation commenced without\n\nregistering the FIR. First of all, even if the Police registers\n\nthe   FIR   for   the   offence    punishable   under   <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_27\">Disaster\n\nManagement Act</a>, without permission of the Court, he\n\ncannot investigate the matter as per <a href=\"/doc/1518148/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 155(2)</a> of\n\nCr.P.C. which is a non-cognizable offence.         Here in this\n\ncase, no FIR has been registered, but action has been\n\ntaken which is a clear violation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n154</a> of Cr.P.C. and also the guidelines issued by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                              17</span>\n\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of Lalitha Kumari\n\nstated supra.   It appears that the Police willfully added\n\n<a href=\"/doc/839778/\" id=\"a_30\">Sections 380</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1591527/\" id=\"a_31\">403</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_32\">409</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_33\">420</a> of IPC which are all\n\ncognizable offences.    Therefore, without registering the\n\nFIR, taking any action, seizing the articles amounts to\n\ninvestigation prior to registering the FIR, which is violation\n\nof the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 154</a> of Cr.P.C. and against the\n\nguidelines issued in the case Lalitha Kumari stated supra.\n\nThe authority of the Police to search and seize assumes\n\nonly after registering the FIR, otherwise the Police have no\n\nauthority to search and seize or arrest any person which is\n\nnothing but violation of fundamental rights guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Justice K.S.Puttaswamy\n\n(Retd.) stated supra has held that if at all the petitioner is\n\nfound to have committed any offence under <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_36\">Disaster\n\nManagement Act</a>, the Police, after making an enquiry and\n\neven after seizing the same could have submitted a report\n\nto the appropriate authority for taking action as per Rule 3\n\nof the Disaster Management (Notice of Alleged Offence)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                18</span>\n\n\nRules 2007 (for short &#x27;Rules&#x27;).

A reading of <a href=\"/doc/453580/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 60</a> of the Disaster Management\n\nAct makes it clear that the Court cannot take cognizance of\n\nan offence under this Act, except on a complaint made by\n\nthe authorities mentioned under sub-sections (a) and (b)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/453580/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 60</a> of the Disaster Management Act.                       The\n\npetitioner being a government doctor who is entrusted\n\nwith the work of vaccinating the public heading in the\n\nPrimary     Health   Centre      at   Manjunathanagar          is     a\n\ngovernment     servant     working    under      the   government\n\ndepartment coming within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1830152/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 55</a> of the\n\nDisaster Management Act. The prosecution is not able to\n\nproduce even a single piece of paper to show that the\n\nPolice officer recorded the reasons in writing before\n\nproceeding to the spot for seizing the same.                        The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                             20</span>\n\n\npanchanama itself reveals that the articles were seized in\n\nfront of the panchas and thereafter, a suo motu complaint\n\ncame to be registered by the PSI. The offences mentioned\n\nin the complaint are punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_42\">Sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_43\">409</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1591527/\" id=\"a_44\">403</a> of IPC or 380 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_45\">IPC</a>, which are cognizable offences.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191123696\" id=\"span_21\">Though the Police Officer has power to arrest the accused\n\nwithout warrant, but not without registering the FIR, which\n\notherwise amounts to violation of <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 154</a> of Cr.P.C.\n\nTherefore, the learned Senior counsel rightly contended\n\nthat there is a gross violation of <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 154</a> of Cr.P.C.\n\nThough the learned SPP-I relied upon the judgment of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/191123696/\" id=\"a_48\">Anjan Dasgupta\n\nvs. The State of West Bengal and others</a> in Criminal\n\nAppeal    No.298/2006      and   the   order   passed    in\n\nCrl.P.No.3073/2020 and connected matters by a co-\n\nordinate Bench of this Court considering the bail petition,\n\nthe same are not applicable to the case on hand. It is only\n\nfor a limited purpose of considering grant of bail. In the\n\ncase of Ajnan Dasgupta stated supra, the Police visited\n\nthe spot, received the complaint from the informant and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                             21</span>\n\n\nthen went to the Police Station for registering the case. A\n\ncareful perusal of the said order goes to show that prior to\n\nregistering the complaint for the    offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n\n302</a> of IPC, UDR was also registered in UDR No.43/2020.\n\nLater, the UDR was converted into FIR under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 154</a>\n\nof Cr.P.C.   The facts and circumstances of the said case\n\ncannot be applicable to the case on hand. Once the Police\n\nregisters the UDR, they are permitted to make enquiry\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 174</a> of Cr.P.C. The Police visited the spot\n\nand later received the complaint and forwarded it to the\n\nPolice Station for registering the FIR.   But, here in this\n\ncase, the Police though visited the spot and sent a Police\n\nConstable as a decoy and confirms the offence, but the\n\nInvestigating Officer has not sent any written complaint to\n\nthe Police Station through other Police Constable for\n\nregistering the FIR, for taking action. Even otherwise, as\n\nalready held above, the vials or vaccine supplied by the\n\nGovernment      to    the     Primary     Health    Centre,\n\nManjunathanagar for free vaccination to the public has\n\nbeen misused and misappropriated by the petitioner which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                              22</span>\n\n\nis in her dominion is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1008909/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 53</a> of the\n\nDisaster Management Act but not under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_53\">Sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1591527/\" id=\"a_54\">403</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_55\">409</a> of IPC.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">14.   As already held above, the Police Officer has no\n\nauthority to arrest or seize any article without registering\n\nthe FIR and also has no power to arrest in a non-\n\ncognizable offence without a warrant or permission of the\n\nMagistrate.    That apart, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_56\">Disaster\n\nManagement Act</a> is a non-cognizable offence and it cannot\n\nbe proceeded without permission of the Magistrate as per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1518148/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 155(2)</a> of Cr.P.C.     Therefore, the contention of\n\nlearned SPP-I is not acceptable that the arrest and seizure\n\nconducted by the Investigating Officer is only a preliminary\n\nenquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">15.   On the other hand, the act of the Police arresting the\n\npetitioner, seizing the articles prior to registering of the\n\nFIR is illegal and search and seizure in non-cognizable\n\noffences amounts to violation of right of privacy and the\n\nliberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                 23</span>\n\n\nTherefore,     registering   the   FIR   after   conducting   the\n\ninvestigation is bad in law in view of the principles <a href=\"/doc/191123696/\" id=\"a_59\">laid\n\ndown by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of Lalitha\n\nKumari stated supra.         Therefore, the Police shall not be\n\nallowed to conduct investigation, which amounts to abuse\n\nof process of law.      Hence, the FIR registered against the\n\npetitioner requires to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">16.
