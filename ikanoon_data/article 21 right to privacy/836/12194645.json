Therefore, he could not avail the opportunity of\n\ninclusion of his name in the SAP List. Subsequently, he\n\npursued his claim to be included in SAP List. As a\n\nconsequence thereof, in compliance to the order passed by\n\nthis Court, the opposite party no.3 conducted an inquiry\n\nand vide order dated 12.11.2015, opposite party no.2\n\ndeclared opposite party no.4 as the beneficiary with SAP\n\nNo.B-123(A).

The said WP(C)\n\nNo.4693/2016 was disposed of by this Court on 22.11.2016\n\nby remitting the matter back to opposite party no.2 with a\n\ndirection to comply the principles of natural justice and in\n\ncase any decision had been taken in the RPDAC meeting\n\ndated 05.04.2016 the same would also be considered and\n\nconsequential action would be taken accordingly. The said\n\nexercise would be completed within a period of six weeks\n\nfrom the date of production of the certified copy of the\n\norder.    In   view   of the   aforementioned order dated\n\n22.11.2016, opposite party no.2 issued notices to the\n\npetitioner as well as opposite party no.4 on 15.12.2016\n\nrequiring to appear before him on 28.12.2016. Pursuant to\n\nsuch notice, the petitioner appeared through their advocate\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                   Page 7 of 25</span>\n and opposite party no.4 as well as learned Govt.

Upon giving due opportunity, the order\n\nimpugned dated 28.12.2016 was passed by the opposite\n\nparty no.2 holding that being a major married son of Late\n\nDwari Behera, name of Prafulla Chandra Behera has been\n\nrightly included in the SAP List. As regards his being a\n\nGovernment Servant, it was further observed that there is\n\nno law or rule debarring a Government servant to avail R&amp;R\n\nbenefit, if he is a land oustee. By so holding, the opposite\n\nparty no.2 directed that as Sri Prafulla Chandra Behera-\n\nopposite party no.4 has exercised job option for his son, the\n\nname of his nominee may be sponsored to NTPC, if not\n\nalready done. Hence, this writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">3.        Mr. B.S. Tripathy, learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe petitioner vehemently contended that the claim of\n\nopposite party no.4 to include in SAP List, after lapse of\n\nlong years of its finalisation, which was done in 1996, is\n\nabsolutely misconceived one. It is further contended that at\n\nthe relevant point of time opposite party no.4 was a\n\nGovernment servant and was not residing in the village\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                    Page 8 of 25</span>\n and, as such, he cannot be included in the SAP List. His\n\nfurther contention is that as per the clarification issued by\n\nthe Govt. of Odisha, R&amp;DM Department, vide letter no.\n\n92388 dated 20.10.2010, the persons/families who were\n\nordinarily not residing in or near the project area are not\n\neligible   for   and   shall   not    be    enumerated      as\n\ndisplaced/affected families for the purpose of R&amp;R benefit.\n\nIt is also contended that by the time the notification under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1601237/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 4(1)</a> was issued opposite party No.4 was not a\n\nmajor married son. Without considering the submissions\n\nmade on behalf of the petitioner and the objection filed on\n\nits behalf, opposite party no.2 came to a conclusion that\n\nopposite party no.4, being a major married son of Late\n\nDwari Behera, has been rightly included in the SAP List,\n\nand that there is no law or rule debarring a Government\n\nservant to avail R&amp;R benefit, if he is a land oustee, and that\n\nas he has exercised job option for his son, the name of\n\nnominee of opposite party no.4 may be sponsored to NTPC,\n\nif not done already.

During the period of\n\nacquisition, Late Dwari Behera had three major sons,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                     Page 10 of 25</span>\n namely, Maheswar Behera, Prafulla Chandra Behera and\n\nJagadish Behera. As a land oustee, Late Dwari Behera was\n\nawarded with SAP No.A-307. His major married eldest son\n\nMaheswar Behera, who was awarded with SAP No.B-123,\n\nnominated his son Bibhuti Behera for job as per the\n\nprovision of R&amp;R Policy of NTPC. Late Dwari Behera, being\n\nover aged and unfit, nominated his youngest son Jagadish\n\nBehera as his nominee. But due to communication gap, the\n\nagency which was entrusted with the work of survey for\n\nenumeration of SAPs, excluded Prafulla Chandra Behera,\n\nwho was the middle son of Late Dwari Behera, as he was\n\nserving in other department. As the land of Late Dwari\n\nBehera had been acquired for NTPC project and as per the\n\nR&amp;R scheme of NTPC all awardees and beneficiaries have\n\navailed their R&amp;R benefit, except the middle son Prafulla\n\nChandra Behera- opposite party no.4, therefore, he cannot\n\nbe debarred from his legitimate claim. The date of birth of\n\nPradyumna Kumar Bhera, son of Prafulla Chandra Behera,\n\nas ascertained from HSC certificate, is dated 12.6.1987.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be said that at the time of <a href=\"/doc/1601237/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 4(1)</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                   Page 11 of 25</span>\n notification dated 23.4.1990 Prafulla Chandra Behera was\n\nunmarried.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n4.1       So far as non-inclusion of the name of Prafulla\n\nChandra Behera in the final SAP List is concerned, it is\n\ncontended that at that time the agency, i.e., IMCO Ltd. had\n\nfinalized the SAP List by investigating the land/family\n\nstatus of the land owners, but Prafulla Chandra Behera-\n\nopposite party no.4 was debarred from his legitimate claim\n\nof R&amp;R benefit due to ignorance of family status of the land\n\nowner by IMCO Ltd. As a matter of fact, the beneficiary\n\nwould have been included in the SAP List, which was done\n\naccordingly by opposite party no.2 in compliance to the\n\norder dated 19.02.2015 passed by this Court in W.P.(C)\n\nNo.14454/2014. By the said order, opposite party no.2 was\n\ndirected to dispose of the representation filed by opposite\n\nparty no.4 within a period of three months from the date of\n\ncommunication of the order.

Thereby, no illegality or\n\nirregularity has been committed by the Collector &amp; District\n\nMagistrate, Angul in passing the order impugned so as to\n\ncause interference by this Court. To substantiate his\n\ncontention, reliance has been placed on the decision of this\n\nCourt in the case of Govinda Chandra Naik v.

On the basis of the factual matrix, as discussed\n\nabove, there is no dispute that the land of Late Dwari\n\nBehera was acquired by the petitioner, and that said Late\n\nDwari Bhera had three major sons, but, while making\n\ninquiry, the investigating agency did not include the name\n\nof opposite party no.4, who is the middle son of Dwari\n\nBehera, in the SAP List, as he was employed outside.

The displacement is\na serious human problem and its short-term and\nlong-term implications cannot be brushed aside.\nThe families who are going to lose their home and\nhearth and the means of livelihood for the interest\nof the nation should have some perceptible\ncompensatory benefits so that they do not visualize\nthe project as enimical to their interests. Any plan\nof rehabilitation has to aim at least restoring their\nexisting financial and social status, if not improving\nit. The State Government have been seized with the\nproblem of displacement in a number of irrigation,\nhydel and thermal project in the State and have\nsubstantially liberalized their rehabilitation policy\nrecently to remove the feeling of discontent from the\naffected families. In the case of the State&#x27;s own Ib\nThermal      Power     Station    presently     under\nconstruction in Banharpalli in Sambalpur district,\nthe State Government has provided a package of\nrehabilitation assistance which is in even more\nliberal than what has been provided in the revised\nrehabilitation policy. Some of the salient feature of\nthat package are:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">  i)   Houses including Ac.0.10 of homestead land\n       for the oustees who are losting their houses.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">  ii) Shifting allowances at the rate of Rs.2000/-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">      per family.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">  iii) Job for at least one member of each family\n       (both substantially and marginally affected\n       families).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">  iv) Treating the      married   sons   as   separate\n      families.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">  v) Training of oustees for improving           their\n     potential for semi-skilled jobs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">  vi) Provision of school, hospital, roads and\n      drinking water facilities in the rehabilitation\n      area.\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">  vii) Allotment of      shops and pindis for\n       rehabilitation    of   marginally affected\n       families.&quot;\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                  Page 16 of 25</span>\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"> 8.        In view of the aforementioned provision, it is\n\nmade clear that a married son is to be treated as a separate\n\nfamily and job for at least one member of each family (both\n\nsubstantially and marginally affected families) shall be\n\nprovided. By the time <a href=\"/doc/169774/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 4(1)</a> notification was issued,\n\nopposite party no.4 was the major married son and, as\n\nsuch, constituted a separate family and is entitled to get\n\nR&amp;R benefit, being SAP, by providing job to his nominee.\n\nThe reason for non-inclusion of his name in the SAP List is\n\nwell founded because he was not available in the locality at\n\nthe time of inquiry conducted by the private investigating\n\nagency, i.e., IMCO Ltd. That is to say, the name of opposite\n\nparty no.4 was not included in SAP List, as he was\n\nrendering service outside the locality. Admittedly, opposite\n\nparty no.4 is the 2nd son of the original land oustee, namely,\n\nLate Dwari Behera. Therefore, non-inclusion of his name in\n\nthe SAP List is absolutely illegal and arbitrary. When\n\nopposite party no.4 approached this Court, vide order dated\n\n19.02.2015 passed in W.P.(C) No. 14454 of 2014, this Court\n\ndirected for consideration of his representation.

It was also directed that in case the decision was\n\ntaken in RPDAC meeting dated 05.04.2016, the same shall\n\nalso be considered and consequential action shall be taken\n\naccordingly, as because in view of the provisions contained\n\nin Clause-3 of the R&amp;R Plan, as quoted above, a right has\n\nbeen accrued in favour of the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">9.
