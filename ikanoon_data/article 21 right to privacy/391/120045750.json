The relevant fact, involved in these writ\n\n       applications, is that earlier two depots were to be constructed in\n\n       mauza Aitwarpur and mauza Ramchak Bairiya, but subsequently it\n\n       was decided to construct only one depot, at mauza Pahari and\n\n       Ranipur. The Cabinet of the State of Bihar approved the Patna\n\n       Metro Rail Project on 09.10.2018. Earlier, the M/s Rail India\n\n       Technical and Economic Service (RITES) had given the proposal\n\n       for two depots.\n\n                    11. In the year 2019, i.e on 03.09.2019, the work of\n\n       construction of Metro Rail and Depot in Patna has been given by\n\n       Patna Metro Rail Corporation Limited (in short, &#x27;PMRCL&#x27;) to\n\n       Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (in short, &#x27;DMRC&#x27;) and the same\n\n       was approved by State of Bihar. The agreement between PMRCL\n\n       and DMRC was entered on 25.09.2019.\n\n                    12. The DMRC has made changes in the line alignment\n\n       of the Patna Metro on 08.02.2020 and also changed the location of\n\n       metro depot from two locations to one locations, i.e. mauza Pahari\n\n       and Ranipur, which are under acquisition. The lands have been\n\n       acquired under the general provisions of the 2013 Act.\n\n                    13. The Urban Development and Housing Department,\n\n       Government of Bihar, issued an Office Order on 17.03.2020, in\n\n       which reasons for relocation of the Metro depot from two depots\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n                                         21/125\n\n\n\n\n       to one depot, has been mentioned that there shall be large number\n\n       of demolition of houses at previous location, drainage system,\n\n       seamless integration of I.S.B.T. and the Metro depot, and further\n\n       11.6 Hectares for the purpose of Property Development Area. The\n\n       revised detailed project report has been approved by the State\n\n       Government and the Central Government.\n\n                    14. The objection hearing on Social Impact Assessment\n\n       Report was held on 04.06.2021 and the report of the Social Impact\n\n       Assessment was prepared and published on 14.06.2021 and\n\n       subsequently, Expert Committee was constituted on 23.06.2021\n\n       and this Committee submitted its report on 30.06.2021.\n\n                    15. After submission of the report by the Expert\n\n       Committee, notification, under <a href=\"/doc/137759646/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11</a> of 2013 Act, was issued\n\n       on 23.10.2021.

Finally,   the   declaration\n\n       notification, under <a href=\"/doc/150747018/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 19</a> of the 2013 Act, was published on\n\n       11.05.2022</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1\"> and on 04.08.2022, the award was prepared under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/116467955/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/139009488/\" id=\"a_9\">30</a> of the 2013 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">       ARGUMENTS ADVANCED ON BEHALF OF                                      THE\n       PETITIONERS (EXCEPT CWJC NO. 7650 OF 2022)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">                    16. Mr. Sumeet Singh, learned Counsel for the\n\n       petitioners, appearing in all the writ applications, except CWJC\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         22/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       No. 7650 of 2022, argued that the decision to change the\n\n       construction of depot from earlier two locations (mauza Aitwarpur\n\n       and Ramchak Bairiya) to one location (mauza Pahari and Ranipur)\n\n       is a decision taken in haste on contradictory reasons and without\n\n       approval of the State Government and is bad in law. Earlier two\n\n       depots were proposed at mauza Aitwarpur and Ramchak Bairiya,\n\n       which is in the same side of the new Inter-State Bus Terminal. The\n\n       DMRC made changes in the line alignment in order to save\n\n       historical structures, i.e. archaeological complexes or for the\n\n       reasons that large number of houses would be demolished. The\n\n       letter/notification, dated 17.03.2020, by which the decision was\n\n       taken to change the site from one place to another place with only\n\n       one depot instead of two depots was not approved by the State\n\n       Government. The letter, dated 17.03.2020, has suggested that\n\n       instead of 21 houses, there would be demolition of 7 houses,\n\n       would also save drainage problem, and will have seamless\n\n       integration from the I.S.B.T. to proposed I.S.B.T. Metro Station.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">                    17. The reasons for change of Metro depot is not correct\n\n       as there is no historical structures and/or archaeological complex,\n\n       there are no large number of houses, which are required to be\n\n       demolished, the line alignment has been changed to protect the\n\n       archaeological complex, at Kumhrar, but the depot area is having\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                         23/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       no archaeological complex, there is no historical structure at\n\n       mauza Aitwarpur and Ramchak Bairiya.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">                    18. The line alignment was changed to avoid complexity\n\n       and demolition of large number of house and others. One\n\n       integrated depot has been decided to be constructed in front of\n\n       I.S.B.T. The respondent nos. 5 and 6 have not given any answer\n\n       with regard to the reasons as to why the one depot is there in place\n\n       of two depots and in their counter affidavit, it has been stated that\n\n       the construction of Metro depot from two locations to one location\n\n       has been done due to technical reasons. There is no technical\n\n       reason except to provide the additional area in the name of\n\n       Property Development Area suggested by the DMRC to the extent\n\n       of 11.2 Hectares.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">                    19.

Mr. Sumeet Singh further argued that respondent\n\n       nos. 5 and 6 have stated in their counter affidavit that altogether\n\n       759 objections have been filed, which justifies that there are more\n\n       than 800 families, which would be affected, as objections against\n\n       the acquisition of the land has been filed in a large number. Thus,\n\n       it is much less than the total affected families, whom the Social\n\n       Impact Assessment team has contacted.

The various families, who have given objections\n\n       to the Social Impact Assessment team, are the families which are\n\n       being affected by the said acquisition having small plots for\n\n       residential purposes. The size of Social Impact Assessment Report\n\n       is small, which would show that the authorities themselves have\n\n       stated that only 108 families have directly approached to talk, it\n\n       means that the report prepared for Social Impact Assessment is\n\n       without considering the majority of families, which is, in fact, less\n\n       than 10 per cent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                         30/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">                    31.

As per Rules 6, 8, 10 and 11 of the 2014 Rules, the\n\n       Social Impact Assessment team must provide the conclusive\n\n       assessment of the balance and distribution of the adverse social\n\n       impact and social cost and benefit of the proposed project and land\n\n       acquisition, including the mitigation measures and provide\n\n       assessment as to whether the benefit from the proposed project\n\n       exceeds the social cost and adverse social impact. The entire report\n\n       of the Social Impact Assessment, based on less than 10 per cent of\n\n       the families, shows that the conclusion of the Social Impact\n\n       Assessment Report is in itself very small, thereby defeating the\n\n       aims and objectives of the Statute, especially <a href=\"/doc/84279018/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 4</a> of the 2013\n\n       Act read with Rules 10 and 11 of the 2014 Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">                    33.

The District Land Acquisition Officer, Patna,\n\n       while rejecting the objection, has mentioned that the Social Impact\n\n       Assessment Report has stated with regard to more benefit than the\n\n       negative impact. In fact, a new finding has been given with regard\n\n       to constitution of six-member committee for higher compensation.\n\n       The entire exercise was an empty formality, there is a procedural\n\n       impropriety, non-application of mind and non-consideration of the\n\n       objections in terms of the statutory provisions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">                    53.

Mr. Basant Kumar Choudhary, learned Senior\n\n       Counsel for the petitioners, in CWJC No. 7650 of 2022, while\n\n       adopting the arguments advanced by Mr. Sumeet Singh, argued\n\n       that the law makers had made a major departure in the 2013 Act\n\n       completely jettisoning the archaic law of doctrine of eminent\n\n       domain and purported to make a fair and transparent law in the\n\n       larger public interest, restricting the power of State to acquire the\n\n       land at the will simply by stating that the acquisition was in public\n\n       interest. In the 2013 Act, he pointed out the provisions of law with\n\n       special features, like <a href=\"/doc/87046240/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 2</a> (Application of Act). <a href=\"/doc/43654/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 4</a>\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                         47/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       (Preparation of Social Impact Assessment Study), <a href=\"/doc/134097646/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 5</a>\n\n       (Public hearing for Social Impact Assessment), <a href=\"/doc/1792838/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 6</a>\n\n       (Publication of Social Impact Assessment Study), <a href=\"/doc/1789527/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 7</a>\n\n       (Appraisal of Social Impact Assessment report by an Expert\n\n       Group), <a href=\"/doc/85884054/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 8</a> (Examination of proposals for land acquisition\n\n       and Social Impact Assessment report by appropriate Government),\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1235658/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 15</a> (Hearing of objections), <a href=\"/doc/562722/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 16</a> (Preparation of\n\n       Rehabilitation and Resettlement Scheme by the Administrator),\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1797812/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 17</a> (Review of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement\n\n       Scheme) and <a href=\"/doc/1166255/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 19</a> (Publication of declaration and summary\n\n       of Rehabilitation and Resettlement), etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">                    70. From the aforesaid quoted provisions of law, it is\n\n       crystal clear that the hands of the executives are no more\n\n       unchecked and unrestricted and the executive is supposed to\n\n       strictly follow the procedure provided therein sincerely and\n\n       bonafide. Any insincerity, unreasonableness and non-application of\n\n       mind by executive while purporting to acquire land is not\n\n       permissible and that will vitiate the whole proceeding of the\n\n       acquisition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                    71. Mr. Choudhary further argued that after the present\n\n       law of acquisition came into existence, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n       Court, in the case of K. S. Puttaswamy and Another v. Union of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                         48/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       India and Others, reported in 2017 (10) SCC 1, while discussing\n\n       the scope of right to privacy held that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n       Constitution of India is a declaration of life and liberty, which\n\n       comprises of many other fundamental rights, such as Right to\n\n       Shelter also. Hence after declaration of right to shelter as\n\n       fundamental right. the State respondents have to be extremely\n\n       careful circumspect while acquiring the dwelling houses for any\n\n       purpose, much less for constructing a mall and market in order to\n\n       add the income of PMRCL.

The Committee has further concluded that the houses,\n\n       in question, should not be acquired and the alignment should shift\n\n       500 to 600 meters south where there are no houses. The\n\n       Committee further concluded that construction of malls or\n\n       multiplex will lead to congestion of traffic and pollution since\n\n       Inter-State Bus Terminal of Patna is to be constructed/established\n\n       there.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                         49/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                    73. Further, recommendation of the Social Inspection\n\n       Team is that those houses, which are being affected on account of\n\n       acquisition, should be given alternative sites. All the aforesaid\n\n       conclusions, observations and recommendations of the Social\n\n       Impact Assessment Committee have completely been ignored by\n\n       the State respondents. Sub-clause (d) of Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/43654/\" id=\"a_104\">Section-4</a> of\n\n       the 2013 Act clearly mandates the Social Impact Assessment\n\n       Committee to see whether the extent of land proposed for\n\n       acquisition is the absolute bare minimum extent of land needed for\n\n       the project. The purported exercise to acquire the houses of the\n\n       petitioners clearly shows that it does not come under the\n\n       conception of bare minimum land acquired for the project.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">                    74.

The integral part of the depot is work shops, sheds, tracks,\n\n       domestic canteen for the workers, residential quarters for the\n\n       workers and is no case, it can be a mall.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">                    76. The stand of the respondent-State that the\n\n       construction of malls and markets will generate revenue is simply\n\n       a ridiculous and cruel joke with the petitioners and others, whose\n\n       houses are standing there. According to the estimate, nearly 2\n\n       lakhs riders are estimated to use the metro every day, which will\n\n       go on increasing when the entire Patna Metro Project will be\n\n       functional. This metro project will not only provide a rapid\n\n       transportation of men and goods, but will also go a long way to\n\n       reduce congestion on the roads of the Patna, decrease the carbon\n\n       level in the city and saving of citizens&#x27; time which are of immense\n\n       quantifiable values. The State Government has to spend only 20\n\n       per cent of value of total work and, therefore, Patna Metro will\n\n       never prove to be a burden on exchequers if the Patna Metro is\n\n       administered efficiently and competently by the professionals and\n\n       experts. The map (Annexure 19) will clearly show the position of\n\n       houses, in question, in blue squires and plenty of vacant lands\n\n       available on the southern and northern side of the houses, in\n\n       question.

No work has\n\n       been started in the property development area till now.

Mr. P. K. Shahi, learned Advocate General,\n\n       representing the State respondents, argued that that launching of\n\n       Patna Metro Rail Project is an ambitious project, which will prove\n\n       a game changer in future.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">                    79. He next argued that the Metro Rail, all over the\n\n       world, is recognized as an efficient, economical and faster mode of\n\n       public transport. The size and population of Patna, over the last\n\n       two decades, has grown exponentially, commuters have increased\n\n       manifold and the business activities, which was confined at select\n\n       places, have spread over to every nook and corner of the city. The\n\n       Government of Bihar has so far done its best to broaden, increase\n\n       and maintain length of road in the city. However, there is a limit to\n\n       the expansion of road network. As a result of expansion of\n\n       business activity coupled with manifold increase in the population,\n\n       the pressure of commuters has led to congestion, traffic snarls and\n\n       practically unmanageable traffic on roads. Manifold growth of\n\n       vehicular traffic has made the life worst. Not only the roads are\n\n       more often than not congested and witness long hours of traffic\n\n       jam, but it is also taking a toll on environment. The emission of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                         53/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide has polluted the city. Most of the\n\n       time, air quality index is extremely hazardous causing serious\n\n       health issues. Pollution, by motorized vehicles, poses a serious\n\n       threat to the health of the people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">                    80. Every urban conglomerate, therefore, has a\n\n       responsibility to not only provide an efficient means of public\n\n       transport, but also to minimize the causes of pollution. Rail\n\n       transport, worldwide, has been considered as an alternate, efficient\n\n       and faster mode of public transport. Wherever, metro rail has been\n\n       launched and made functional, it has provided manifold benefits\n\n       not only to the commuters in general, but also in reducing overall\n\n       air pollution. Experience has proved that metro rail, connecting\n\n       end to end in urban areas, is the best mode of efficient and non-\n\n       pollutant commutation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">                    81.

It was\n\n       considered appropriate to rope an agency having the experience of\n\n       successfully implementing Metro Rail Project, its commissioning\n\n       and operationalization.

In other words, metro rail must have\n\n       component of commercial utilization of its property, including\n\n       metro stations, depots etc. Everywhere in the world, including in\n\n       India, where metro rail project has been launched, it necessarily\n\n       includes components of revenue to be generated from sources\n\n       other than fare.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                         61/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">                    99.

The property development by\n\n       Metro Projects is in line with the global example as Metros are\n\n       highly capital intensive projects and the only way they can remain\n\n       financially healthy, without government subsidy, is to increase the\n\n       non-operational revenue, i.e. revenue from advertisement,\n\n       retailing, real estate, parking lot etc., as in the case of Hong Kong\n\n       and other international Metros is done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_96\">                    100.

Besides the above, in the\n\n       earlier proposal, land for depot was identified at two places, both\n\n       at east and west of the State Highway. In course of execution, the\n\n       project authorities realized that the alignment needs to be changed\n\n       and instead of two depots, only one depot with inter-changeability\n\n       at Khemnichak would serve the purpose. The construction of\n\n       depot, at present site, is also beneficial for seamless integration\n\n       between the Inter-State Bus Terminal and I.S.B.T. Metro Station.\n\n       The present depot is adjacent to proposed I.S.B.T. Metro Station,\n\n       which is Terminal Station and, therefore, operationally and\n\n       financially is found to be most suitable by the PMRCL. It was in\n\n       the interest of PMRP to have depot at one place instead of two\n\n       depots, at two different locations. Accordingly, the project report\n\n       was again revised incorporating the revised alignment and laying\n\n       of metro rail, which was approved by the State Government on\n\n       17.03.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">                    105.

The major/rest part\n\n       of the acquired land is vastly used for the agriculture purpose, such\n\n       as growing of vegetables etc. Accordingly, the Six-men\n\n       Committee, in its report dated 22.06.2021, has unanimously\n\n       considered the nature of the entire land under acquisition as\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                         66/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       residential under mauza Pahari, Thana no-14.

The Plot No. 1306 and 1313 under the said mauza,\n\n       which is adjacent to Patna Masaurhi Main Road, has been\n\n       considered as residential Main Road. The nature of the land under\n\n       mauza Ranipur, under Thana No. 19, has also been considered to\n\n       be residential branch road by the said Committee. By way of\n\n       treating the entire land as residential, the land owners would be\n\n       getting much more amount of compensation in comparison to the\n\n       compensation amount they would have been getting treating the\n\n       land as agriculture in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_107\">                    109.

The Supreme Court has held that exercise of discretionary\n\n       jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India should\n\n       be very circumspect and not only on making of a case even if there\n\n       are certain procedural violations, the land owners are entitled to be\n\n       appropriately compensated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_113\">                    115. He, then, argued that the second question relates to\n\n       the selection of land. The petitioners&#x27; contention is that alternative\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                         70/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       land suggested by them was not taken into consideration. In the\n\n       counter affidavit of PMRCL, it has been elaborately explained that\n\n       the present site is more suitable for the project in comparison to\n\n       suggested site. Besides, PMRCL. has also averred that the project\n\n       cost would go up by approximately Rs. 500-700 crores, if the site\n\n       suggested by the petitioners is selected for work of depot and\n\n       property development area. Moreover, it is held in a catena of\n\n       decisions of the Supreme Court that selection of land, unless\n\n       shown to be the arbitrary, unreasonable and mala fide is the\n\n       domain of the acquiring authority. The petitioners have not alleged\n\n       any mala fide. The petitioners have further not shown any\n\n       arbitrariness or unreasonableness in the selection of the land. On\n\n       the other hand, the respondents have demonstrated the need for\n\n       selection of the present land with sufficient justification. It is,\n\n       therefore, not open for the Writ Court to substitute the views of\n\n       acquiring authority. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"394915\" id=\"span_71\">In this regard, reference has been made to the\n\n       case of <a href=\"/doc/394915/\" id=\"a_121\">Ramji Veerji Patel</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">                    116.

The petitioners have also raised an issue with\n\n       regard to component of property development. It need not be\n\n       repeated again that the Metro Rail Project is a composite project\n\n       consisting not only ferry of commuters, but of many essential\n\n       items including property development. In the Metro Rail Policy of\n\n       2017, the necessity of including public property development has\n\n       been emphasized. It has already been pointed out that in order to\n\n       make a Metro Rail Project viable, it must be able to generate\n\n       revenue from Non-Fair Box also and the property development is\n\n       one of the modes to generate revenue from Non-Fair Box.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1963266\" id=\"span_73\">118. The Supreme Court has considered all these\n\n       aspects, in details, in the case of Soora Ram Pratap Reddy and\n\n       Others v. District Collector, Ranga Reddy District and Others,\n\n       reported in 2008 (9) <a href=\"/doc/1963266/\" id=\"a_122\">SCC 552, Nand Kishore Gupta</a> (supra) and\n\n       Eros City Developer (P) Limited (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">                    119. The PMRP, having commercial components, is an\n\n       essential facet of infrastructure development. It would, thus, be\n\n       evident that the petitioners have not been able to make out a case\n\n       for interference by this Court in exercise of its extra ordinary writ\n\n       jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_119\">                    120.

The determination of compensation has been done\n\n       strictly in accordance with statutory provisions and even though it\n\n       is not yet a residential area, the entire land has been classified as\n\n       residential area and compensation has been determined on that\n\n       basis. The procedural requirement has been meticulously followed.\n\n       The experts commissioning the project are the best judge to decide\n\n       efficacy and suitability of land. PMRCL has conducted field\n\n       survey and has identified the present chunk of land for\n\n       establishment of depot and property development area. In exercise\n\n       of writ jurisdiction, this Court may not substitute its views on\n\n       persuasion of some of the objectors for the view taken by the\n\n       experts. In every acquisition, people are likely to be affected. If the\n\n       considerations, which have been highlighted by the petitioners, are\n\n       factored in, no acquisition would be possible. While protecting the\n\n       right of individual is an important facet, this Court may not\n\n       outweigh individual rights in comparison to the overwhelming\n\n       public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">       ARGUMENTS ADVANCED ON BEHALF OF THE PMRCL\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_121\">                    121.

Thereafter, DMRC made physical assessment of the\n\n       detailed project report prepared by M/s Rail India Technical and\n\n       Economic Service at ground level and made suggestions to change\n\n       in the line alignment in order to save Kumhrar Archaeological\n\n       sites, due to change of the alignment suggested by DMRC at\n\n       certain points, the proximity, i.e. the distance between the two\n\n       Corridors, came very close and as such it was suggested to inter\n\n       link both Corridors at Khemnichak and in view of the aforesaid\n\n       changes suggested by DMRC, instead of two depots, it was\n\n       suggested to construct only one depot at the Inter-State Bus\n\n       Terminal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">                    125.

With regard to alternative sites, as argued by the\n\n       petitioners, learned Senior Counsel argued that the petitioners have\n\n       suggested three other alternative places for construction of depot\n\n       instead of the present site, which are (i) Sahara Land, (ii) dumping\n\n       yard and (iii) Abdullachak. These sites are not viable because the\n\n       present depot is contiguous to the I.S.B.T. Metro Station. By\n\n       producing a sketch map of the aforesaid area, it has been\n\n       demonstrated that Abdullachak is located at a distance of about\n\n       2.96 Km, which will increase the cost of construction by Rs.\n\n       393.39 crores. Similarly, the other site, namely, Sahara Land is at a\n\n       distance of 5.52 Km, which will incur additional cost of Rs.\n\n       733.62 crores and the third site suggested by the petitioners, i.e.\n\n       dumping yard is at a distance of 1.64 Km, which will incur\n\n       Additional cost of construction of Rs. 217.96 crores. Apart from\n\n       the aforesaid additional cost towards construction of the depot, it\n\n       will also increase the recurring operational costs because the train\n\n       will have to cover the aforesaid extra distance without any\n\n       passenger in order to reach the depot. As such, the aforesaid\n\n       alternative sites are not viable and suitable in comparison to the\n\n       site at which the depot is being constructed at present.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                         77/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">                    131.

So far\n\n       as the extra amount of 217.96 crores to be incurred by the\n\n       respondents is concerned, it is argued that the State is willing to\n\n       pay Rs. 790.90 crores for mauza Pahari and Ranipur and this\n\n       amount of Rs. 790.90 crores is taken into consideration, still the\n\n       Government would be saving Rs. 573 crores. Not only this, the\n\n       Government will save about 1300 families from displacement.\n\n       Apart from this, the vicinity of mauza Ramchak Bairiya has so\n\n       much environmental issues, which would be cured and the entire\n\n       surrounding, which is catering to the needs of about 2000 families,\n\n       will be saved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">                    151.

The petitioners have never given any suggestions for the\n\n       lands at Abdullachak; rather, it is the opposite side of the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                         85/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       Abdullachak near Gyanasthali High School. In fact, the families at\n\n       mauza Ramchak Bairiya are willing to give their land near\n\n       Gyanasthali High School.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">                    153. Learned Counsel further argued that in a Public\n\n       Interest Litigation, bearing CWJC No. 20570 of 2015, a Division\n\n       bench of this Court, by order, dated 17.10.2023, directed the\n\n       Municipal Commissioner to place on record the concrete proposals\n\n       as to the separate site identified and also the processing of the\n\n       waste in the present location. The Government was also directed to\n\n       identify an alternate site, where the future dumping can be done.\n\n       The Municipal Commissioner informed that there is a proposal to\n\n       set up an Integrated Solid Waste Management Plant, which is\n\n       pending before the Central Government for approval. The Central\n\n       Government Counsel was directed to take instruction as to the\n\n       stage of the approval which is pending before the Central\n\n       Government. The State Government was directed to ensure the\n\n       preparedness of the Police Department and the Fire Department to\n\n       meet any adverse situation arising and to contain any fire mishap\n\n       that may occur at the site.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">                    154. There has been a request for acquiring the land in\n\n       terms of the general procedure of the 2013 Act and not in\n\n       accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1694707/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 40</a> of the 2013 Act, which mandates for\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                         86/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       compulsory emergency acquisition. Application for emergency\n\n       acquisition was given by PMRCL, vide letter no. 723, dated\n\n       27.08.2020, but the District Land Acquisition Officer has\n\n       consented for acquiring the land except for emergency acquisition.\n\n       The Social Impact Assessment report was given on 01.06.2021 but\n\n       there is no discussion with regard to property development area in\n\n       the said hearing/notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">                    155. The property development area for the PMRP, the\n\n       DMRC has suggested for taking more land of the Government and\n\n       thus under this background the land of Transport Nagar, which is\n\n       shifting to some other location, is taken into consideration and\n\n       then also, the alternative sites can be considered.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">                    156. In the Master Plan 2030-31, at page No. 68, it\n\n       would be evident that Ramchak Bairiya and Dumping Yard is\n\n       commercial one type land and in 2030-31, they will be used as\n\n       commercial land. The Government has 85 acres of land, which can\n\n       be utilised for the purposes of construction of depot area.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">                    157. Learned Counsel next argued that the entire project\n\n       is to be completed by December, 2028, as per the press release,\n\n       dated 29.03.2023, issued by the Japan International Credit Agency\n\n       and the claim of the PMRCL that 42 per cent of the work has been\n\n       completed is absolutely false and baseless, and only 5 per cent of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                         87/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       the work has been done, if photography is taken into consideration.\n\n       There is no construction work done on the site except boundary\n\n       and even that is also not complete. Even if 65 crores of investment\n\n       has been made, then, if the project is shifted to some other place,\n\n       there will be recovery of the invested amount, if at all paid to some\n\n       other person for the respective land.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">                    158. Even otherwise, the compensation amount, which\n\n       has been paid, is much below and thus under this background, the\n\n       people, who will have been paid will automatically be happy to\n\n       return the said amount to the respective authorities. In fact, there\n\n       are 1300 families, in number, and the amount which has been\n\n       alleged to be accepted by them is very minimal, i.e. less than 5 per\n\n       cent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">                    159. Altogether 188 petitioners have approached this\n\n       Court and the people, who are approaching the Court, are\n\n       representing 23.56 acres of land. The 63 petitioners, along with\n\n       others, petitioners are having 2.6 acres of land. If the total\n\n       petitioners are considered, then 1/3rd of the parties are before this\n\n       Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_164\">       CONSIDERATION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">                    160.

Learned Counsel for the petitioners, during the\n\n       course of arguments, challenged the acquisition of land done by\n\n       the State Government and has mainly argued that (i) acquisition\n\n       has been done in violation of provisions as contained in the 2013\n\n       Act and further without considering the proposal of rehabilitation\n\n       and resettlement of the petitioners; (ii) the alternative sites\n\n       suggested by the petitioners were not considered by the\n\n       authorities; (iii) the component of property development area not\n\n       being the public purpose and (iv)              compensation paid is\n\n       inadequate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_167\">                    162. Mr. Sumeet Singh, learned Counsel for the\n\n       petitioners, during the course of argument, has admitted that the\n\n       PMRP is a public purpose project. However, his submission is that\n\n       the Writ Court need to intervene if the acquisition authorities have\n\n       not followed the statutory provisions of law. The PMRP is a mass\n\n       rapid transit system, which is under construction in Patna, the\n\n       capital of Bihar, by PMRCL, through Special Purpose Vehicle\n\n       (SPV).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">                    163. The PMRP shall be constructed in five phases and\n\n       will be operated by State run PMRCL. The present case relates to\n\n       Phase-1 of the PMRP, which consists of two corridors. The line of\n\n       Corridor-1 (also known as &#x27;East-West Corridor&#x27;) will cover a\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                         89/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       distance of 16.86 kms. from Danapur Cantonment to Khemnichak,\n\n       and has 14 metro stations. The line of Corridor-2 (also known as\n\n       &#x27;North-South Corridor&#x27;) will cover a distance of 14.05 kms. from\n\n       Patna Junction to New I.S.B.T., and has 12 metro stations.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">                    164. The acquisition of land has been done by the State\n\n       authorities for the purpose of construction of depot and property\n\n       development area, which is the subject matter of the present writ\n\n       applications. The objective of the PMRP is to cope up with the\n\n       increasing traffic demand in Patna, which will contribute to the\n\n       improvement of the urban environment. Patna has a population of\n\n       little over 2.5 million, making it eligible for metro services. The\n\n       PMRP will contribute to the achievement of sustainable\n\n       development goals. Altogether 11.2 Hectares of land have been\n\n       acquired for the property development area and 19.2 Hectares of\n\n       land has been acquired for the purpose of construction of depot.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">                    165. On 25th September, 2018, the Government of Bihar\n\n       approved the constitution of PMRCL as the Special Purpose\n\n       Vehicle for construction of PMRP, which, in turn, appointed\n\n       DMRC, as the general consultant to assist in the implementation of\n\n       the PMRP. The PMRP received the approval of the Central\n\n       Government on 06.02.2019 and in November, 2019, the DMRC\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                         90/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       suggested a change in the detailed project report of the PMRP and\n\n       line alignment of both the corridors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">                    166. In relation to the depot under the PMRP, initially\n\n       there were two locations, the first one at mauza Aitwarpur and the\n\n       second one at mauza Ramchak Bairiya, which has later been\n\n       changed to only one location, at mauza Pahari and Ranipur, to\n\n       which the petitioners belong. The estimated cost of construction of\n\n       the depot is Rs. 143 crores.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_172\">                    167. The petitioner, in the present writ applications, have\n\n       challenged the acquisition of the land in mauza Pahari and\n\n       Ranipur, which is being acquired for the purpose of construction of\n\n       depot and property development area. The total land required for\n\n       the depot and the property development area is 76.6450, out of\n\n       which, at mauza Pahari and Ranipur, 0.70 acres of land is of\n\n       Government of Bihar and rest 75.95 acres of land has been\n\n       acquired in mauza Pahari and Ranipur.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_173\">                    168. Regarding the challenge to the acquisition by the\n\n       petitioners in violation of provisions of 2013 Act, it has been\n\n       argued on behalf of the writ petitioners that the decision to change\n\n       the depot from mauza Aitwarpur and Ramchak Bairiya to mauza\n\n       Pahari and Ranipur has been taken in haste and that too, without\n\n       the approval of the State Government. Further argument on behalf\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                         91/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       of the writ petitioners is that the Social Impact Assessment\n\n       Study/Report is bad in law as there is non-compliance of <a href=\"/doc/43654/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 4</a>\n\n       of the 2013 Act read with Rules 5 to 10, under Chapter III, of 2014\n\n       Rules. There is no finding that the alternative lands have been\n\n       considered and found not feasible. There is also no finding with\n\n       regard to bare minimum land, which is required for the purpose of\n\n       construction of depot. <a href=\"/doc/134097646/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 5</a> of the 2013 Act was also not\n\n       followed properly.

Rule 11 (3) of the 2014 Rules mandates that public\n\n       hearing must be announced three weeks in advance through daily\n\n       newspaper and clear 21 days&#x27; time was not given in the present\n\n       case inasmuch as the public hearing was announced on 01.06.2021\n\n       and the hearing was conducted on 04.06.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">                    170. <a href=\"/doc/1792838/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 6</a> of the 2013 Act has also not been\n\n       followed as the Social Impact Assessment Report was not\n\n       published in the affected area in such manner as prescribed and\n\n       was not uploaded on the website of the State Government.

On property development area, it has been\n\n       submitted by the State that in any Metro Rail project, its viability\n\n       is not dependent only on fare recovered from commuters, but\n\n       mostly depends upon Non-Fare Box Revenue. The metro rail must\n\n       have component of commercial utilization of its property,\n\n       including metro stations, depots etc. Everywhere in the World,\n\n       including India, where metro rail project has been launched, it\n\n       necessarily include the component of revenue generation from\n\n       sources other than fare. The property development by the Metro\n\n       Rail is one of the accepted modes of resource mobilization towards\n\n       capital cost as well as sustainable operation. The Ministry of\n\n       Urban Development, Government of India has issued letter, dated\n\n       30.03.2009, bearing K-14011/8/2000, stating therein that the\n\n       property development is one of the ways of mobilizing resources\n\n       for the project. Therefore, the word &quot;Project&quot; would also include\n\n       &quot;Property Development&quot;, as such the property development on the\n\n       acquired land shall also be considered as part of the project.

The\n\n       Supreme Court considered <a href=\"/doc/740483/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 3</a> of the Land Acquisition Act,\n\n       1894, which contains definition of &quot;Public Purposes&#x27; and observed\n\n       that the Expressway is a work of immense public importance. The\n\n       State gains advantages from the construction of an expressway and\n\n       so does the general public. Creation of a corridor for fast-moving\n\n       traffic resulting into curtailing the travelling time, as also the\n\n       transport of the goods, would be some factors, which speak in\n\n       favour of the Project being for the public purpose. The creation of\n\n       the five zones for industry, residence, amusement, etc. would be\n\n       complementary to the creation of the Expressway. The Supreme\n\n       Court has further held that it cannot be forgotten that the creation\n\n       of land parcels would give impetus to the State creating more jobs\n\n       and helping the economy and thereby helping the general public.\n\n       The creation of five parcels will certainly help the maximum\n\n       utilization of the Expressway and the existence of an Expressway\n\n       for the fast-moving traffic would help the industrial culture created\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                         103/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       in the five parcels. Thus, both will be complimentary to each other\n\n       and can be viewed as parts of an integral scheme. Therefore, it\n\n       cannot be said that it is not a public purpose.

The argument of learned Counsel for the PMRCL is\n\n       that the Property Development area is an integral part of any metro\n\n       project. Property Development area is for sustainability of the\n\n       metro project and to make the metro project viable financially and\n\n       sustainable. It is necessary to develop certain area in order to\n\n       generate revenue for the metro project. In absence of the Property\n\n       Development area, the metro project cannot survive. The\n\n       alternative sites suggested by the petitioners are also not viable\n\n       because the present depot is contiguous to the proposed I.S.B.T.\n\n       Metro Station and further if the project is shifted to any of the sites\n\n       suggested by the petitioners, it would incur additional cost of Rs.\n\n       217-733 crores.

As per the revised detail project\n\n       report, the total cost of construction nof PMRP is reduce to Rs.\n\n       13365 crores from Rs. 17887.56 crores. Further, the location has\n\n       been changed from the earlier site to the present site at mauza\n\n       Pahari and Ranipur due to change in line alignment in order to\n\n       save historical places, at Kumhrar, including the archaeological\n\n       complexes. The revised detail project report prepared by M/s Rail\n\n       India Technical and Economic Service has been approved by the\n\n       State Government, Central Government as well as Japan\n\n       International Credit Agency. Therefore, it appears that at various\n\n       stages, the deliberations and decisions have been taken by the\n\n       State Government, Central Government, executing agency as well\n\n       as financing agency. Thus, it cannot be said that decision to change\n\n       the site and to construct only one depot instead of two depots was\n\n       taken in haste. It is not the case of the petitioners that this decision\n\n       was taken by the respondent authorities with ulterior motive or\n\n       with any mala fide intention.

The State has no role to indulge in\n\n       profiteering by constructing malls, cinema halls near metro\n\n       stations/depot. In this regard, the argument advanced by the State\n\n       is that the Property Development Area is an integral part of any\n\n       metro project and in any metro rail project, its viability is not\n\n       dependent upon fare recovered from the commuters and its\n\n       viability also depends upon Non-Fare Box Revenue. The metro\n\n       rail must have component of commercial utilization of its property,\n\n       including metro stations, depots etc. Everywhere in the world,\n\n       including India, where metro rail project has been launched, it\n\n       necessarily includes components of revenue to be generated from\n\n       sources other than fare. The property development by the Metro\n\n       Rail is one of the accepted modes of resource mobilization towards\n\n       capital cost as well as sustainable operation. The property\n\n       development by Metro Projects is in line with the global example\n\n       as Metros are highly capital intensive projects and the only way\n\n       they can remain financially healthy, without government subsidy,\n\n       is to increase the non-operational revenue, i.e. revenue from\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">                                         116/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       advertisement, retailing, real estate, parking lot etc., as in the case\n\n       of Hong Kong and other international Metros is done.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1963266\" id=\"span_146\">213.

The\n\n       Supreme Court considered the definition of &quot;Public Purposes&#x27; and\n\n       held that the creation of a corridor for fast-moving traffic resulting\n\n       into curtailing the travelling time, as also the transport of the\n\n       goods, would be some factors, which speak in favour of the\n\n       Project being for the public purpose. It has also been held that the\n\n       creation of the five zones for industry, residence, amusement, etc.\n\n       would be complementary to the creation of the Expressway. Both,\n\n       the Expressway and the five zone, along with the Expressway, is\n\n       complimentary to each other and can be viewed as parts of an\n\n       integral scheme.

The metro rail implementing agencies should endeavor\n\n       to maximize revenue through commercial development at stations\n\n       and on land allocated for this purpose. The detail project report\n\n       should also mandatorily contain a chapter on enhancing non-fare\n\n       box revenue through conventional as well as innovative means.\n\n       Accordingly, in the present case also, the respondent-State while\n\n       constructing the metro rail project system in Patna have taken into\n\n       account the factors, which may increase the Non-Fare Box\n\n       Revenue in line with the Metro Rail Policy, 2017, and has decided\n\n       to construct the Property Development area, which, in my opinion,\n\n       would be a part of the public purpose inasmuch as metro rail\n\n       project and the Property Development Area are complimentary to\n\n       each other and can be said to be a part of an integral scheme of the\n\n       PMRP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">                    215.

Upon consideration of the arguments advanced by\n\n       the parties, discussion held, findings arrived herein above, in my\n\n       considered opinion, it would not be in the interest of public at large\n\n       to interfere with the acquisition of the subject land. Accordingly,\n\n       writ applications, seeking quashing of the acquisition notice, are\n\n       dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">                    219.     During      the    preparation   of   Social   Impact\n\n       Assessment Report, majority of the land owners have demanded\n\n       just and fair compensation based upon the revised M.V.R. and\n\n       rehabilitation, job in lieu of acquisition of their land.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">                    220.

The whole scheme has progressed to a substantial\n\n       level wherefrom it would be extremely difficult now to return back\n\n       and quash the entire acquisition proceeding. Interference, at this\n\n       stage, would mean impeding or bringing at halt the infrastructural\n\n       development of the City of Patna in the shape of metro rail, which\n\n       is of immense public importance for the benefit of about 22.5\n\n       millions residents of Patna and other persons visiting the State\n\n       capital of Bihar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_239\">                    222. It is well settled law that in judicial review, it is not\n\n       open to the Court to examine the aspect of suitability of land as a\n\n       court of appeal and substitute its opinion. In the present case, the\n\n       PMRCL has found the land, in question, more suitable for\n\n       construction of depot under the PMRP at mauza Pahari and\n\n       Ranipur and has also given reasons as to why the land, in question,\n\n       has been selected to be most suitable for the purpose of\n\n       construction of depot and Property Development Area. The courts\n\n       have to weigh the overwhelming public interest vis-à-vis the\n\n       private interest while exercising the power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n       Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">                    223. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1952933\" id=\"span_151\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1952933/\" id=\"a_202\">Godrej and Boyce</a> (supra), the\n\n       Bombay High Court has dealt with the ambit and scope of the writ\n\n       jurisdiction in the matter of acquisition of land for eminent public\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                         121/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       purpose.

It may even be open to the High Court to direct, in\n\n       case it finds finally that the acquisition was vitiated on account of\n\n       non-compliance with some legal requirement, that the persons\n\n       interested shall also be entitled to a particular amount of damages\n\n       to be awarded as a lump sum or calculated at a certain percentage\n Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                         122/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n       of compensation payable. There are many ways of affording\n\n       appropriate relief and redressing a wrong; quashing the acquisition\n\n       proceeding is not the only mode of redress, which is ultimately a\n\n       matter of balancing the competing interest beyond this, which is\n\n       neither visible nor advisable to say.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_242\">                    225. In the present acquisition process, certain\n\n       provisions of the 2013 Act as well as 2014 Rules were not\n\n       followed and there appears to be procedural lapses at the stage of\n\n       preparation of Social Impact Assessment Report, formation of\n\n       Expert Committee and non-consideration of the recommendations\n\n       of the Expert Committee by the Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">                    226. I have already held herein above that since this\n\n       project is a public project, certain procedural infirmities shall not\n\n       render the entire acquisition process as invalid. However, upon\n\n       balancing the public interest vis-a-vis the interest of land/house\n\n       owners, who have lost their entire land, including houses and some\n\n       business establishments, the interest of justice demands that just,\n\n       fair and adequate compensation be paid to the land/house owners,\n\n       including their rehabilitation and resettlement, as prescribed under\n\n       the Scheme of the 2013 Act and also recommended by the Expert\n\n       Committee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.4562 of 2022 dt.21-12-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                         123/125</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_245\">                    227. From the records of these cases, it appears that the\n\n       lands have been acquired at two mauza, i.e. Pahari and Ranipur,\n\n       For mauza Ranipur, the rate of the lands fixed by the State\n\n       Government is less than the rate fixed for the land of mauza\n\n       Pahari. Since the lands have been acquired in both the mauza, i.e.\n\n       Pahari and Ranipur, for one project, therefore, on the principle of\n\n       one project one compensation, the lands owners of mauza Ranipur\n\n       are entitled to get equal compensation at the same rate, which has\n\n       been given to the land owners of mauza Pahari.

The question, which, now, requires consideration is\n\n       as to how to ascertain the just and fair compensation, which the\n\n       petitioners and others are entitled and at the same time, the Court\n\n       must balance the State exchequer by not awarding any amount,\n\n       which may be in excess so that not to put additional burden on the\n\n       State entity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_247\">                    229. The price of the land in Patna has skyrocketed and\n\n       increased manifold, but the M.V.R./circle rate of the area has not\n\n       been revised for many years.
