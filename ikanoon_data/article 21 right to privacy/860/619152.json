He was put under\tsur-\nveillance -is defined in Regulation 236 of the U. P.  Police\nRegulations.  Surveillance involves secret picketing of\t the\nhouse\tor  approaches\tto  the\t houses\t of  the   suspects,\ndomiciliary   visits  at  night,  periodical  enquiries\t  by\nofficers  not below the rank of Sub-Inspector  into  repute,\nhabits,\t association, income, expenses and  occupation,\t the\nreporting  by  constables and chaukidars  of  movements\t and\nabsences  from\thome,  the  verification  of  movements\t and\nabsences  by means of inquiry slips and the  collection\t and\nrecord\ton  a history sheet of all  information\t bearing  on\nconduct.\nThe petitioner filed a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1\">Art. 32</a> in  which\nhe  challenged the constitutional validity of Chapter XX  of\nU.  P.\tPolice\tRegulations, in which  Regulation  236\talso\noccurs.\nThe  defence  of  the  respondent  was\tthat  the   impugned\nRegulations did not constitute an infringement of any of the\nfreedoms  Guaranteed  by Part III of the  Constitution,\t and\neven if they were, they had been framed in the interests  of\nthe General public and public order and to enable the police\nto discharge its ditty in a more efficient manner, and hence\nwere reasonable restrictions on that freedom.\nHeld,  (Subba Rao and Shah JJ., dissenting) that out of\t the\nfive  kinds of surveillance referred to in  Regulation\t236,\nthe  part dealing with domiciliary visits was  violative  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Art. 21\n333</a>\nof  the\t Constitution and as there was no law on  which\t the\nsame   could  be  justified  it\t must  be  struck  down\t  as\nunconstitutional, and the petitioner was entitled to a\twrit\nof  mandamus  directing\t the  respondent  not  to   continue\ndomiciliary   visits.\t The  other   matters\tconstituting\nsurveillance   were   not  unconstitutional.\tThe   secret\npicketing  of the houses of tile suspects could not  in\t any\nmaterial  or  palpable form affect either the right  on\t the\npart of the suspect to move freely&#x27; or to deprive him of his\n&#x27;Personal  liberty&#x27;  within  the meaning  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Art.  21.</a>\t  In\ndealing\t with a fundamental right such as the right to\tfree\nmovement  or personal liberty, that only can  constitute  an\ninfringement  which is both direct as well as tangible,\t and\nit could not be that under these freedoms the  Constitution-\nmakers\tintended  to  protect  or  protected  mere  personal\nsensitiveness,\t&#x27;The term &#x27;picketing&#x27; has been used  in\t the\nRegulation  not in the sense of offering resistance  to\t the\nvisitor-physical  or otherwise-or even dissuading  him\tfrom\nentering the house of the suspect but merely of watching and\nkeeping- a record of the visitors.  Clauses (c), (d) and (e)\nof Regulation 236 dealt with the details of the shadowing of\nthe  history-sheeters for the purpose of having a record  of\ntheir  movements  arid\tactivities,  and  the  obtaining  of\ninformation  relating  to persons with whom they  came\tinto\ncontact\t with  a  view\tto ascertain  the  nature  of  their\nactivities,  arid did not infringe any fundamental right  of\nthe  petitioner.  The freedom guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_4\">Art. 19 (1)\t (d)</a>\nwas  not infringed by a watch being kept over the  movements\nof  the\t suspect.   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Art. 21</a> was\t also  not  applicable.\t The\nsuspect\t had  the  liberty to answer or not  to\t answer\t the\nquestion  put to him by the police,and no Law  provided\t for\nany  civil or criminal liability if the suspect\t refused  to\nanswer a question or remained silent.  The right of  privacy\nis  not\t a  guaranteed right under  our\t Constitution,\tarid\ntherefore  the\tattempt\t to ascertain the  movements  of  an\nindividual  is merely a manner in which privacy\t is  invaded\nand is not an infringement of a fundamental right guaranteed\nin Part III.\nThe  term  &#x27;personal  liberty&#x27;\tis used\t in  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Art.  21</a>  as  a\ncompendious term to include within itself all the  varieties\nof  rights which go to make up the &#x27;personal  liberties&#x27;  of\nman  other than those dealt with in the several\t clauses  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_7\">Art.  19  (I  ).</a> While <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_8\">Art. 19\t(1)</a>  deals  with  particular\nspecies\t or attributes &#x27;of that freedom, &#x27;personal  liberty&#x27;\nin  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Art.  21</a> takes in and comprises the residue.   The\tword\n&quot;life&quot;\tin  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Art.  21</a>  means not\t merely\t the  right  to\t the\ncontinuance  of a person&#x27;s animal existence, but a right  to\nthe possession of each of his organsarms, legs, etc.\nThe  contention\t of  the respondent that if an\tact  of\t the\npolice involved a trespass to property, that could give rise\nto a\n334\nclaim in tort as that action was not authorised by law,\t and\nthe remedy of the petitioner was a claim for damages and not\na  petition  under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_11\">Art. 32</a>, was without\t any  substance\t and\nwholly\tirrelevant for considering whether such\t action\t was\n-in invasion of a fundamental right.  It is wholly erroneous\nto assume that before the jurisdiction of this Court  uinder\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_12\">Art. 32</a> can be invoked, the applicant must either  establish\nthat he has no other remedy adequate or otherwise or that he\nhas  exhausted such remedies as the law affords and has\t yet\nnot obtained pro. per redress, for when once it is proved to\nthe  satisfaction  of this Court that by  State\t action\t the\nfundamental right of the petitioner tinder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_13\">Art. 32</a> has\tbeen\ninfringed,  it\tis not only the right but the duty  of\tthis\nCourt to afford relief to him by passing appropriate  orders\nin this behalf.\nPer  Subba  Rao and Shah, JJ.-The petitioner was a  class  A\nhistory-sheeter and hence was subject to the entire field of\nsurveillance. Policeman were posted near his house to  watch\nhis  movements and those of his friends and  associates\t who\nwent to his house.  They entered his house in the night\t and\nwoke  him  up to ascertain whether he was in the  house\t and\nthereby\t disturbed his sleep and rest.\tThe  officials,\t not\nbelow the rank of Sub-Inspector, made inquiries from  others\nas  regards his habits, associations, income, -expenses\t and\noccupations.   They got information from others\t as  regards\nhis  entire  way  of life.  The\t constables  and  chaukidars\ntraced his movements, shadowed him and made reports to their\nsuperiors.   It\t was conceded that there was  no  law  which\nimposed restrictions on bad characters.\nHeld,  that the whole of Regulation 236 is  unconstitutional\nand  not  only cl. (b).\t The attempt to dissect the  act  of\nsurveillance   into   its  various  ramifications   is\t not\nrealistic.   Clauses  (a) to (f) of Regulation 236  are\t the\nmeasures  adopted  for the purpose of supervision  or  close\nobservation  of\t tile movements of the\tpetitioner  and\t are\ntherefore parts of surveillance.\nBoth  Arts.  19(1)  and\t 21  deal  with\t two  distinct\t and\nindependent  fundamental rights.  The  expression  &quot;personal\nliberty&quot; is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely\nis an attribute of personal liberty.  But it is not  correct\nto say that freedom to move freely is carved\t\t out\nof  personal liberty and therefore the expression  &quot;Personal\nliberty&quot;  in  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Art. 21</a> excludes that  attribute.\t  No  doubt,\nthese fundamental rights overlap each other but the question\nof one being carved\n335\nout of the other does not arise.  The fundamental rights  of\nlife  and personal liberty have many attributes and some  of\nthem are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 19.</a>  The State must satisfy that both\nthe  fundamental  rights are not infringed by  showing\tthat\nthere  is  a law within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Art. 21</a> and  that  it\ndoes  amount to a reasonable restriction within the  meaning\nof <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_17\">Art. 19(2)</a> of the Constitution.\nThe right of personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Art. 21</a> implies a right  of\nan individual to be free from restrictions or  encroachments\non  his person, whether those restrictions or  encroachments\nare   directly\timposed\t or  indirectly\t brought  about\t  by\ncalculated  measures.\tIf so understood, all  the  acts  of\nsurveillance  under Regulation 236 infringe the\t fundamental\nright of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution.\nAs  regards the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_20\">Art.  19(1)\n(d)</a>,  mere  movement unobstructed  by  physical\t restritions\ncannot\tin  itself be the object of a  person&#x27;s\t travel.   A\nperson\ttravels ordinarily in quest of some  objective.\t  He\ngoes  to a place to enjoy, to do business, to meet  friends,\nto have secret and intimate consultations with other and  to\ndo  many  other\t such things.  If a  man  is  shadowed,\t his\nmovements are obviously constricted.  He can move physically\nbut it can only be a movement of an automation.\t A  movement\nunder  the  scrutinising  gaze\tof  a  policeman  cannot  be\ndescribed  as  a free movement.\t The whole  country  is\t his\njail.\tThe  freedom  of movement  in  <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_21\">Art.  19(1)(d)</a>  must,\ntherefore,  be\ta  movement in a free country,\ti.e..  in  a\ncountry\t where\tlie  can do whatever  lie  likes,  speak  to\nwhomsoever  he wants, meet people of his choice without\t any\napprehension,  subject\tof  course  to\tthe  law  of  social\ncontrol.  The petitioner under the shadow of surveillance is\ncertainly deprived of this freedom.  He can move physically,\nbut  be\t cannot\t do so freely, for all\this  activities\t are\nwatched\t and  the  shroud  of  surveillance  cast  upon\t him\nperforce  engenders  inhibitions in him, and he\t cannot\t act\nfreely as he would like to do.\tHence, the entire Regulation\n236 offends <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_22\">Art. 19(1) (d)</a> of the Constitution.\nHeld, also that petitioner&#x27;s freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_23\">Art. 19(1) (a)</a> of\nthe Constitution was also infringed.  It was impossible\t for\na  person in the position of the petitioner to\texpress\t his\nreal  and  intimate thoughts to the visitor as fully  as  he\nwould like to do.\nA.K.  Gopalan v.

J.,  Imam,\nAyyangar and Mudholkar, jj., was delivered by Ayyangar,\t j.,\nSubba Rao and Shah, jj., delivered a separate judgment.\nAYYANGAR,   J.--This   petition\t under\t<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_25\">Art.   32</a>   of\t the\nConstitution  challenges the constitutional validity of\t Ch.\nXX of the U. P. Police Regulations and the powers  conferred\nupon  police  officials\t by its several\t provisions  on\t the\nground that they violate the right guaranteed to citizens by\nArts. 19(1)(d) and 21 of the  Constitution.\nTo  appreciate the contention raised it is necessary to\t set\nout the facts averred on the basis of which the\t fundamental\nright of the petitioner, is said to be violated, as well  as\nthe  answers by the respondent-State to\t these\tallegations.\nThe  petitioner--Kharak\t Singh -was challaned in a  case  of\ndacoity\t in  1941 but was released under s.  169,  Criminals\nProcedure Code as there was no evidence against him.  On the\nbasis of the accusation made against him he states that\t the\npolice\thave  opened  a &quot;historysheet&quot;\tin  regard  to\thim.\nRegulation  228\t which\toccurs\tin Ch.\t XX  of\t the  Police\nRegulations   defines  &quot;history-sheets&quot;\t as  &quot;the   personal\nrecords\t of criminals under surveillance&quot;.  That  regulation\nfurther directs that a &quot;history-sheet&quot; should be opened only\nfor  persons  who  are\tor are\tlikely\tto  become  habitual\ncriminals or the aiders or abettors of such criminals.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> 337</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">These  history-sheets  are  of two classes  :  Class  A\t for\ndacoits,  burglars, cattle-thieves,  and  railway-goodswagon\nthieves,  and  class  B\t for those  who\t are  confirmed\t and\nprofessional criminals who commit crimes other than dacoity,\nburglary,  etc.\t like professional cheats.  It\tis  admitted\nthat  a\t history-sheet in class A has been  opened  for\t the\npetitioner and he is therefore &quot;under surveillance.&quot;\nThe  petitioner describes the surveillance to which  he\t has\nbeen  subjected\t thus  : Frequently  the  chaukidar  of\t the\nvillage\t and  sometimes police constables enter\t his  house,\nknock  and shout at his door, wake him up during  the  night\nand  thereby  disturb his sleep.  On a number  of  occasions\nthey have compelled him to get up from his sleep and  accom-\npany  them  to\tthe police station to  report  his  presence\nthere.\t When the petitioner leaves his village for  another\nvillage\t or town, he has to report to the chaukidar  of\t the\nvillage\t or at the police station about his  departure.\t  He\nhas  to give them information regarding his destination\t and\nthe  period within which he would return.   Immediately\t the\npolice station of his destination is contacted by the police\nstation\t of  his  departure and the former  puts  him  under\nsurveillance in the same way as the latter.  There are other\nallegations  made about misuse or abuse of authority by\t the\nchaukidar or the police officials but these have been denied\nand we do not consider them made out for the purposes of the\npresent\t petition.  If the officials outstep the  limits  of\ntheir\tauthority   they  would\t be   violating\t  even\t the\ninstructions  given to them, but it looks to us\t that  these\nexcesses   of\tindividual   officers\twhich\tare   wholly\nunauthorised could not be complained of in a petition  under\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_26\">Art. 32.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">In  deciding this petition we shall proceed upon  the  basis\nthat  the  officers conformed strictly to the terms  of\t the\nRegulations  in\t Ch.  XX properly construed and\t discard  as\nexaggerated or not proved the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">338</span>\nincidents   or\tpieces\tof  conduct  on\t the  part  of\t the\nauthorities which are alleged in the petition but which have\nbeen  denied.  As already pointed out it is admitted that  a\nhistory-sheet has been opened and a record as prescribed  by\nthe Regulations maintained for the petitioner and that\tsuch\naction\tas  is required to be taken in respect\tof  history-\nsheeters of Class A into which the petitioner fell under the\nclassification made in Ch.  XX of the Police Regulations  is\nbeing  taken in regard to him.\tIt is stated in the  counter\naffidavit that the police keep a confidential watch over the\nmovements  of the petitioner as directed by the\t Regulations\nin  the\t interests  of\tthe  general  public  and  for\t the\nmaintenance of Public order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">Before\tentering on the details of these regulations  it  is\nnecessary  to  point out that the defence of  the  State  in\nsupport\t of  their  validity  is two-fold  :  (1)  that\t the\nimpugned  regulations do not constitute an  infringement  of\nany   of  the  freedoms\t guaranteed  by\t Part  III  of\t the\nConstitution  which are invoked by the petitioner,  and\t (2)\nthat  even  if\tthey were, they have  been  framed  &quot;in\t the\ninterests  of  the general public and public order&quot;  and  to\nenable\tthe  police  to\t discharge  its\t duties\t in  a\tmore\nefficient    manner   and   were    therefore\t &quot;reasonable\nrestrictions&quot; on that freedom.\tPausing here it is necessary\nto  point  out that the second point urged  is\twithout\t any\nlegal  basis  for if the petitioner were able  to  establish\nthat the impugned regulations constitute an infringement  of\nany  of the freedoms guaranteed to him by  the\tConstitution\nthen  the  only\t manner\t in  which  this  violation  of\t the\nfundamental  right could be defended would be by  justifying\nthe  impugned action by reference to a valid law, i. e.,  be\nit  a statute, a statutory rule or a  statutory\t regulation.\nThough\tlearned\t counsel  for  the  respondent\tstarted\t  by\nattempting  such  a justification by invoking s. 12  of\t the\nIndian\tPolice\tAct he gave this up and\t conceded  that\t the\nregulations contained in Ch.  XX bad no such statutory basis\nbut were merely executive or departmental\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">339</span>\ninstructions framed for the guidance of the police officers.\nThey  would  not therefore be &quot;&#x27;a law&quot; which  the  State  is\nentitled  to make under the relevant clauses 2 to 6 of\t<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_27\">Art.\n19</a>  in\torder  to regulate  or\tcurtail\t fundamental  rights\nguaranteed  by the several sub-clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_28\">Art. 19  (1);</a>\t nor\nwould the same be &quot;  a procedure established by law&quot;  within\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Art.  21.</a>  The position therefore is that if the  action  of\nthe police which is the arm of the executive of the State is\nfound  to  infringe any of the freedoms\t guaranteed  to\t the\npetitioner the petitioner would be entitled to the relief of\nmandamus  which he seeks to restrain the State\tfrom  taking\naction under the regulations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">There  is  one other matter which requires to  be  clarified\neven  at  this stage.  A considerable part of  the  argument\naddressed to us on behalf of the respondent was directed  to\nshowing\t that  the  regulations\t were  reasonable  and\twere\ndirected  only\tagainst\t those who were\t on  proper  grounds\nsuspected to be of proved anti-social habits and  tendencies\nand  on whom it was necessary to impose some restraints\t for\nthe  protection of society.  We entirely agree that  if\t the\nregulations had any statutory basis and were a &quot;law&#x27;  within\n<a href=\"/doc/654960/\" id=\"a_30\">Art.  13  (3)</a>,\tthe consideration mentioned  might  have  an\noverwhelming  and even decisive weight in establishing\tthat\nthe  classification was rational and that  the\trestrictions\nwere  reasonable  and designed to preserve public  order  by\nsuitable  preventive action.  But not being any such  &quot;law&quot;,\nthese\tconsiderations\t are   out  of\t place\t and   their\nconstitutional\tvalidity has to be judged on the same  basis\nas   if\t they  were  applied  against\teveryone   including\nrespectable  and  lawabiding  citizens\tnot  being  or\teven\nsuspected of being, potential dangers to public order.\nThe  sole  question for determination therefore\t is  whether\n&quot;surveillance&quot; under the impugned Ch.

We consider that there is no substance  in\tthis\nargument.   In dealing with a fundamental right such as\t the\nright  to free movement or personal liberty , that only\t can\nconstitute  an infringement which is both direct as well  as\ntangible  and it could not be that under these freedoms\t the\nConstitution-makers  intended to protect or  protected\tmere\npersonal  sensitiveness.   It was then suggested  that\tsuch\npicketing might have a tendency to prevent, if not  actually\npreventing friends of the suspect from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">342</span>\ngoing  to his house and would thus interfere with his  right\n&quot;to form associations&quot; guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_34\">Art. 19 (f) (c).</a>  We do\nnot  consider it necessary to examine closely and  determine\nfinally\t the precise scope of the &quot;freedom  of\tassociation&quot;\nand particularly whether it would be attracted to a case  of\nthe  type now under discussion, since we are satisfied\tthat\n&quot;picketing&quot; is used in cl. (a) of this Regulation not in the\nsense  of  offering resistance to  the\tvisitor-physical  or\notherwise-or even dissuading him, from entering the house of\nthe  suspect but merely of watching and keeping a record  of\nthe  visitors.\tThis interpretation we have reached  (a)  on\nthe   basis  of\t the  provisions  contained  in\t the   later\nRegulations  in the Chapter, and (b) because more than\teven\nthe express provisions, the very purpose of the watching and\nthe secrecy which is enjoined would be totally frustrated if\nthose  whose  duty it is to watch, contacted  the  visitors,\nmade their presence or identity known and tried to  persuade\nthem to any desired course of action.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(b)  Domiciliary visits at night:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;Domiciliary  visits&quot;  is  defined  in\tthe  Oxford  English\nDictionary  as\t&quot;Visit to a private  dwelling,\tby  official\npersons, in order to search or inspect it.&quot; Webster&#x27;s  Third\nNew International Dictionary defines the word as &quot;&#x27;Visit  to\na  private dweling (as for searching it)  under\t authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">The definition in Chambers&#x27; Twentieth Century Dictionary  is\nalmost identical-&quot;Visit under authority, to a private  house\nfor  the  purpose  of searching it.&quot;  These  visits  in\t the\ncontext\t of  the provisions in the Regulations are  for\t the\npurpose\t of making sure that the suspect is staying at\thome\nor  whether  he has gone out, the latter being\tpresumed  in\nthis  class  of\t cases, to be with the\tprobable  intent  of\ncommitting  a crime.  It was urged for the  respondent\tthat\nthe  allegations  in the petition regarding  the  manner  in\nwhich  &quot;domiciliary  visits&quot; are conducted, viz.,  that\t the\npoliceman or chaukidar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">343</span>\nenters\tthe house and knocks at the door at night and  after\nawakening the suspect makes sure of his presence at his home\nhad  been denied in the counter-affidavit and was not  true,\nand  that the policemen as a rule merely watch from  outside\nthe  suspect&#x27;s house and make enquiries from  third  persons\nregarding  his presence or whereabouts.\t We do not  consider\nthat this submission affords any answer to the challenge  to\nthe constitutionality of the provision.\t In the first place,\nit  is clear that having regard to the plain meaning of\t the\nwords  &quot;domiciliary  visits,&quot;  the  police  authorities\t are\nauthorised  to enter the premises of the suspect,  knock  at\nthe door and have it opened and search it for the purpose of\nascertaining  -his presence in the house.  The fact that  in\nany  particular\t instance  or even  generally  they  do\t not\nexercise to the full the power which the regulation vests in\nthem,  is wholly irrelevant for determining the validity  of\nthe  regulation\t since\tif they are so minded  they  are  at\nliberty\t to exercise those powers and do those acts  without\noutstepping  the limits of their authority under  the  regu-\nlations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">Secondly, we are, by no means, satisfied that having  regard\nto  the\t terms of Regulation 236 (b) the allegation  by\t the\npetitioner that police constables knock at his door and wake\nhim  up\t during\t the  night  in\t the  process  of   assuring\nthemselves of his presence at home are entirely false,\teven\nif  the other allegations regarding his being  compelled  to\naccompany  the\tconstables during the night  to\t the  police\nstation be discarded as mere embellishment.\nThe  question that has next to be considered is whether\t the\nintrusion  into the residence of a citizen and the  knocking\nat  his door with the disturbance to his sleep and  ordinary\ncomfort\t  which\t such  action  must   necessarily   involve,\nconstitute a violation of the freedom guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_35\">Art.  19\n(1)  (d)</a>  or  &quot;a  deprivation&quot;\tof  the\t &quot;personal  liberty&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">guaranteed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">344</span>\nby <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Art. 21.</a>  Taking first <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_37\">Art. 19 (1) (d)</a> the &quot;freedom&quot; here\nguaranteed  is\ta  right &quot;to  move  freely&quot;  throughout\t the\nterritory of India.  Omitting as immaterial for the  present\npurpose the last words defining the geographical area of the\nguaranteed  movement,  we agree that the  right\t to  &quot;&#x27;move&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">denotes nothing more than a right of locomotion, and that in\nthe context the adverb &quot;&#x27;freely&quot; would only connote that the\nfreedom\t to move is without restriction and is absolute,  i.\ne.,  to\t move  wherever one likes, whenever  one  likes\t and\nhowever\t one likes subject to any valid law enacted or\tmade\nunder  cl. 5. It is manifest that by the knock at the  door,\nor by the man being roused from his sleep, his locomotion is\nnot  impeded or prejudiced in any manner.   Learned  Counsel\nsuggested that the knowledge or apprehension that the police\nwere  on the watch for the movements of the  suspect,  might\ninduce a psychological inhibition against his movements but,\nas already pointed out, we are unable to accept the argument\nthat  for this reason there is an impairment of the  &quot;&#x27;free&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">movement  guaranteed by sub-cl. (d).  We are  not  persuaded\nthat Counsel is right in the suggestion that this would have\nany  effect even on the mind of the suspect, and even if  in\nany  particular\t case  it had the  effect  of  diverting  or\nimpeding  his  movement,  we  are  clear  that\tthe  freedom\nguaranteed  by\t<a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_38\">Art. 19 (1) (d)</a> has reference  to  something\ntangible  and  physical rather and not to  the\timponderable\neffect on the mind of a person which might guide his  action\nin the matter of his movement or locomotion.\nThe   content  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Art.\t 21</a>  next  calls  for\texamination.\nExplaining  the\t scope of the words  &quot;life&quot;  and  &quot;&#x27;liberty&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">which  occurs  in the 5th and 14th Amendments to the  U.

But the qualifying adjective has been employed in\norder  to  avoid  overlapping  between\tthose  elements\t  or\nincidents of &quot;liberty&quot; like freedom of speech, or freedom of\nmovement  etc.,\t already dealt with in <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_42\">Art. 19 (1)</a>  and\t the\n&quot;&#x27;liberty&quot;  guaranteed\tby Art. 21-and particularly  in\t the\ncontext of the difference between the permissible restraints\nor restrictions which might be imposed by sub-cls. 2 to 6 of\nthe article on the several species of liberty dealt with  in\nthe  several  clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_43\">Art. 19 (I).</a>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_10\">In view of  the\tvery\nlimited\t nature of the question before us it is\t unnecessary\nto pause to consider either the precise relationship between\nthe &quot;liberties&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_44\">Art. 19 (1) (a)</a> &amp; (d) on the one hand and\nthat   in  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Art.\t 21</a>  on\t the  other,  or  the  content\t and\nsignificance of the words &quot;&#x27;procedure established by law&quot; in\nthe latter article, both of which were the subject of elabo-\nrate consideration by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_46\">A.

It was said that if the act  of\nthe  police  involved a trespass to property ,\ti.  e.,\t the\ntrespass involved in the act of the police official  walking\ninto  the  premises of the. petitioner and knocking  at\t the\ndoor,  as well as the disturbance caused to him, might\tgive\nrise  to claim in tort, since the action was not  authorised\nby    law   and\t  that\t for   these   breaches\t   of\t the\npetitioner&#x27;strights  damages might be claimed and  recovered\nfrom the tortfeasor, but that the same could not  constitute\nan  infraction\tof a fundamental right.\t  Similarly  it\t was\nurged  that  the  petitioner or persons\t against  whom\tsuch\naction\twas taken might be within their rights\tin  ejecting\nthe  trespasser\t and  even  use\t force\tto  effectuate\tthat\npurpose,  but that for what was a mere tort of\ttrespass  or\nnuisance the Jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_49\">Art. 32</a>  could\nnot  be\t invoked.   These submissions  proceed\ton  a  basic\nfallacy.  The fact that an act by the State executive or  by\na State functionary acting under a pretended authority gives\nrise to an action at common law or even under a statute\t and\nthat  the injured citizen or person may have redress in\t the\nordinary  courts  is wholly immaterial and,  we\t would\tadd,\nirrelevant  for\t considering  whether  such  action  is\t  an\ninvasion  of  a\t fundamental right.  An\t act  of  the  State\nexecutive infringes a guaranteed liberty only when it is not\nauthorised by a valid law or by any law as in this case, and\nevery such illegal act would obviously give rise to a  cause\nof  action-civil or criminal at the instance of the  injured\nperson\tfor redress.  It is wholly erroneous to assume\tthat\nbefore the,jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_50\">Art. 32</a> could be\ninvoked\t the applicant must either establish that he has  no\nother remedy adequate or otherwise or that he has  exhausted\nsuch remedies as the law affords and has yet not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">347</span>\nobtained  proper redress, for when once it is proved to\t the\nsatisfaction  of  this\tcourt  that  by\t State\taction\t the\nfundamental  right  of a petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_51\">Art. 32</a>  has\tbeen\ninfringed,  it\tis not only the right but the duty  of\tthis\nCourt to afford relief to him by passing appropriate  orders\nin that behalf.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">We  shall  now proceed with the examination of\tthe  width.,\nscope  and content of the expression &quot;personal\tliberty&quot;  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Art.  21.</a>  Having regard to the terms of <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_53\">Art.  19(1)(d)</a>,  we\nmust  take it that expression is used as not to include\t the\nright  to move about or rather of locomotion.  The right  to\nmove  about  being excluded its\t narrowest  inter  pretation\nwould be that it comprehends nothing more than freedom\tfrom\nphysical  restraint or freedam from confinement\t within\t the\nbounds of a prison; in other words, freedom from arrest\t and\ndetention, from false imprisonment or wrongful\tconfinement.\nWe  feel unable to hold that the term was intended  to\tbear\nonly  this  narrow  interpretation but\ton  the\t other\thand\nconsider that &quot;&#x27;personal liberty&quot; is used in the Article  as\na  compendious\tterm  to  include  within  itself  all\t the\nvarieties  of  rights  which go to  make  up  the  &quot;personal\nliberties&quot; of man other than those deal with in the  several\nclauses\t of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_54\">Art. 19 (1).</a>  In other words, while\t <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_55\">Art.  19(1)</a>\ndeals with particular species or attributes of that freedom,\n&quot;personal  liberty&quot;  in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">Art. 21</a> takes in and  comprises\t the\nresidue.   We  have  already extracted a  passage  from\t the\njudgment  of  Field, J. in Munn v.

(b) of Regulation 236 is plainly  violative\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Art. 21&#x27;</a> and as there is no &quot;law&quot; on which the same could\nbe justified it must be struck down as unconstitutional.\nClauses\t (c), (d) and (e) may be dealt with  together.\t The\nactions suggested by these clauses are really details of the\nshadowing of the history-sheeters for the purpose of  having\na record of their movements and activities and the obtaining\nof  information relating to persons with whom they  come  in\ncontact or associate, with a view to ascertain the nature of\ntheir activities.  It was urged by learned Counsel that\t the\nshadowing of a person obstructed his free movement or in any\nevent was an impediment to his free movement within <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_60\">Art.  19\n(1) (d)</a> of the Constitution.  The argument that the  freedom\nthere  postulated  was\tnot  confined  to  a  mere  physical\nrestraint hampering movement but that the term &#x27;freely&#x27; used\nin  the Article connoted a wider freedom  transcending\tmere\nphysical restraints, and included psychological\t inhibitions\nwe  have  already  considered and  rejected.   A  few  minor\nmatters\t arising in connection with these clauses might\t now\nbe  noticed.   For  instance, cls. (d) &amp; (e)  refer  to\t the\nreporting  of the movements of the suspect and\this  absence\nfrom his home and the verification of movements and absences\nby  means  of  enquiries.  The enquiry for  the\t purpose  of\nascertaining the movements of the suspect might\t conceivably\ntake  one  of  two forms : (1) an  enquiry  of\tthe  suspect\nhimself, and (2) of others.  When an enquiry is made of\t the\nsuspect\t  himself   the\t question  mooted  was\t that\tsome\nfundamental  right of his was violated.\t The answer must  be\nin  the\t negative  because the suspect has  the\t liberty  to\nanswer or not to answer the question for ex concessis  there\nis no law on the point involving him in any  liability-civil\nor  criminal-if\t he refused to answer  or  remained  silent.\nDoes  then the fact that an enquiry is made as\tregards\t the\nmovements of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">351</span>\nsuspect\t and  the  facts ascertained  by  such\tenquiry\t are\nverified   and\t the  true  facts   sifted   constitute\t  an\ninfringement  of  the  freedom to move?\t  Having  given\t the\nmatter our best consideration we are clearly of the  opinion\nthat  the  freedom  guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_61\">Art. 19  (1)\t(d)</a>  is\t not\ninfringed  by a watch being kept over the movements  of\t the\nsuspect.  Nor do we consider that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Art. 21</a> has any  relevance\nin  the\t context as was sought to be  suggested\t by  learned\nCounsel\t for  the petitioner.  As already pointed  out,\t the\nright  of  privacy  is\tnot a  guaranteed  right  under\t our\nConstitution  and  therefore the attempt  to  ascertain\t the\nmovements of an individual which is merely a manner in which\nprivacy\t is invaded is not an infringement of a\t fundamental\nright guaranteed by Part III.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">The  result therefore is that the petition succeeds in\tpart\nand Regulation 236 (b) which authorises &quot;domiciliary visits&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">is struck down as unconstitutional.

It is said\nthat  the freedom to move freely is carved out\tof  personal\nliberty and, therefore, the expression &quot;personal liberty&quot; in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_69\">Art. 21</a> excludes that attribute.  In our view, this is not a\ncorrect approach.  Both are independent fundamental  rights,\nthough\tthere is overlapping.

Further, the  right  to\npersonal  liberty takes in not only a right to be free\tfrom\nrestrictions  placed  on his movements, but also  free\tfrom\nencroachments\ton  his\t private  life.\t  It  is  true\t our\nConstitution  does not expressly declare a right to  privacy\nas  a fundamental right, but the said right is an  essential\ningredient  of personal liberty.  Every\t democratic  country\nsanctifies  domestic life; it is expected to give him  rest,\nphysical happiness, peace of mind and security.\t In the last\nresort,\t a person&#x27;s house, where lie lives with his  family,\nis his &quot;castle&quot; : it is his rampart against encroachment  on\nhis  personal  liberty.\t The pregnant words of\tthat  famous\nJudge, Frankfurter J., in Wolf v. Colorado (1), pointing out\nthe  importance\t of the security of  one&#x27;s  privacy  against\narbitrary  intrusion  by  the police,  could  have  no\tless\napplication  to\t an Indian home as to an American  one.\t  If\nphysical  restraints  on  a person&#x27;s  movements\t affect\t his\npersonal liberty, physical encroachments on his private life\nwould affect it in a larger degree.  Indeed, nothing is more\ndeleterious to a man&#x27;s physical happiness and health than  a\ncalculated   interference  with\t his  privacy.\t We   would,\ntherefore,  define the right of personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">Art.  21</a>\nas a right of an individual to be free from restrictions  or\nencroachments  on his person, whether those restrictions  or\nencroachments  are  directly imposed or\t indirectly  brought\nabout  by  calculated measures.\t If so understood,  all\t the\nacts of surveillance under,Regulation 236 infringe the fund-\namental\t right\tof  the\t petitioner under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_80\">Art.\t 21</a>  of\t the\nConstitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">This  leads US Lo the second question, namely,\twhether\t the\npetitioner&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_81\">Art. 19 (1) (d)</a> is also\ninfringed.   What  is the content of  the  said\t fundamental\nright?\tIt is argued for the\n(1)  (1949) 338 U.S. 25.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">360</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">State  that it means only that a person can move  physically\nfrom  one  point  to another without  any  restraint.&#x27;\tThis\nargument  ignores the adverb &quot;freely&quot; in cl. (d).   If\tthat\nadverb is not in the clause, there may be some justification\nfor this COntention; but the adverb &quot;freely&quot; gives a  larger\ncontent\t to  the  freedom  Mere\t movement  unobstructed\t  by\nphysical  restrictions cannot in itself be the object  of  a\nperson&#x27;s  travel.  A person travels ordinarily in  quest  of\nsome  objective.   He  goes  to a  place  to  enjoy,  to  do\nbusiness,  to  meet  friends, to have  secret  and  intimate\nconsultations with 0thers and to do many other such  things.\nIf   a\tman  is\t shadowed,  his\t movements   are   obviously\nconstricted.   He can move physically, but it can only be  a\nmovement  of an automation.  How could a movement under\t the\nscrutinizing  gaze of the policemen be described as  a\tfree\nmovement?   The whole country is his jail.  The\t freedom  of\nmovement  in cl. (d) therefore must be a movement in a\tfree\ncountry,  i.  e., in a country where he can do\twhatever  he\nlikes, speak to whomsoever he wants, meet people of his\t own\nchoice\twithout any apprehension, subject of course  to\t the\nlaw  of social control.\t The petitioner under the shadow  of\nsurveillance is certainly deprived of this freedom.  He\t can\nmove  physically,  but he cannot do so freely, for  all\t his\nactivities   are   watched  and\t noted.\t   The\t shroud\t  of\nsurveillance cast upon him perforce engender inhibitions  in\nhim  and  he cannot act freely as he would like to  do.\t  We\nwould,\ttherefore,  hold  that\tthe  entire  Regulation\t 236\noffends also <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_82\">Art. 19\n(1)  (d)</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">Assuming  that <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_83\">Art. 19 (1) (d)</a> of the Constitution  must  be\nconfined  only to physical movements, its  combination\twith\nthe freedom of speech and expression leads to the conclusion\nwe have arrived at.  The act of surveillance is certainly  a\nrestriction  on\t the said freedom.  It cannot  be  suggested\nthat  the said freedom is also bereft of its  subjective  or\npsychological content, but will sustain only the mechanics\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">361</span>\nof  speech  and expression.  An illustration will  make\t our\npoint clear.  A visitor, whether. a wife, son or friend,  is\nallowed\t to be received by a prisoner in the presence  of  a\nguard.\tThe prisoner can speak with the visitor; but, can it\nbe suggested that he is fully enjoying the said freedom?  It\nis  impossible\tfor  him to express his\t real  and  intimate\nthoughts to the visitor as fully as he would like.  But\t the\nrestrictions on the said freedom are supported by valid law.\nTo  extend the analogy to the present case is to  treat\t the\nman under surveillance as a prisoner within the confines  of\nour  country and the authorities enforcing  surveillance  as\nguards.,   without  any\t law  of   reasonable\trestrictions\nsustaining  or protecting their action.\t So  understood,  it\nmust be held that the petitioner&#x27;s freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_84\">Art. 19 (1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">(a) of the Constitution is also infringed.\nIt is not necessary in this case to express our view whether\nsome  of  the  other freedoms enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_85\">Art.\t 19</a>  of\t the\nConstitution are also infringed by the said Regulation.\nIn  the\t result,  we  would issue  an  order  directing\t the\nrespondents  not to take any measure against the  petitioner\nunder  Regulation  236\tof Chapter XX of the  U.  P.  Police\nRegulations.  The respondents will pay the costs of the\n petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">By  COURT : In accordance with the opinion of  the  majority\nthis Writ Petition is partly allowed and Regulation 236\t (b)\nwhich  authorises  &quot;domiciliary visits&quot; is  struck  down  as\nunconstitutional.   The Petitioner would be entitled to\t the\nissue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondent not  to\ncontinue domiciliary visits.  The rest of the petition fails\nand is dismissed.  There will be no order as to costs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">362</span>\n\n\n\n","numcites":9,"numcitedby":429,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":619152,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"history sheet","formInput":"history%20sheet"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"freedom of movement","formInput":"freedom%20of%20movement"},{"value":"how art.19(1)(a)","formInput":"how%20art.19%281%29%28a%29"},{"value":"encroachment as is where is","formInput":"encroachment%20as%20is%20where%20is"},{"value":"right to liberty","formInput":"right%20to%20liberty"},{"value":"personal right","formInput":"personal%20right"},{"value":"coercion","formInput":"coercion"},{"value":"constitutional validity","formInput":"constitutional%20validity"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"history sheeter ","formInput":"history%20sheeter%20"},{"value":"art. 21- a","formInput":"art.%2021-%20a"},{"value":"right to personal liberty","formInput":"right%20to%20personal%20liberty"},{"value":"reasonable restriction","formInput":"reasonable%20restriction"},{"value":"torts","formInput":"torts"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"art.21 ","formInput":"art.21%20"},{"value":"mandamus","formInput":"mandamus"},{"value":"public order","formInput":"public%20order"},{"value":"life and personal liberty","formInput":"life%20and%20personal%20liberty"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"appeal-to-supreme-court, power-to-issue-writ","formInput":"tag:appeal-to-supreme-court, power-to-issue-writ"},{"value":"individual-freedom","formInput":"tag:individual-freedom"},{"value":"freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions","formInput":"tag:freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
