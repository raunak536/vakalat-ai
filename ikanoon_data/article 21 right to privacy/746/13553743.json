This Court observed that RBI is\n\nnot in any fiduciary relationship with the banks and that the\n\nRBI has a statutory duty to uphold the interest of public at\n\nlarge, the depositors, country’s economy and the banking\n\nsector. This Court was of the opinion that the RBI has to act\n\nwith transparency and not hide information that might\n\nembarrass the banks and that it is duty bound to comply with\n\nthe provisions of the Act and disclose the information sought.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">2.

Thereafter, Contempt Petitions were filed complaining\n\nof willful disobedience of the directions issued by this Court\n\nin its judgment dated 16.12.2015 in Transferred Case (Civil)\n\nNo.91 of 2015.        The disclosure policy of RBI dated\n\n30.11.2016 which was contrary to the directions issued by\n\nthis Court was found to be in willful disobedience of the\n\njudgment dated 16.12.2015. During the course of hearing of\n\nthe Contempt Petition, it was brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt that another disclosure policy was uploaded on the RBI\n\nwebsite on 12.04.2019.

All the judgments\n\nthat are cited on this point are cases where petitions for\n\nrecall were entertained when a person directly affected by\n\nthe judgment was not heard.
