With gradual passage of time, most of them\n                                          5\n\n\nwith their love, affection and caring attitude strive to ensure good health, care\n\nand education of their child to enable him encounter any challenge that life is\n\nlikely to pose and to keep him free from the evils of society. The parents sincerely\n\nwish their child to be successful in all his pursuits for a bright future. Not much\n\nis expected by the parents in return for what they have done for the child. The\n\nconcept of quid pro quo is alien so far as self-respecting and responsible parents\n\nare concerned. It is not unusual for parents to yearn that their child holds a\n\nposition of respectability in society. It may not materialize at all; nonetheless, if\n\nthe child grows up to be successful in life (in the sense that he stands on his own\n\nfeet and earns enough to maintain his parents) and, at the same time, is a\n\nperson who is sensitive and alive to his moral obligations and duties, more often\n\nthan not he looks after his parents well, lovingly and caringly, out of a sense of\n\nresponsibility and gratitude towards his parents for they having ungrudgingly\n\nshowered all that were at their disposal which acted as catalyst for his eventual\n\nsuccess. Fortunate are those parents, who during their lifetime having gradually\n\ncrossed over from the time they became parents to old age, are showered the\n\nsame love, care and affection by their child which years ago they had while he\n\nneeded most in his childhood and even thereafter.\n\n       However, a disturbing trend of late is discernible. Children of hapless\n\nparents, now grown up and in a position to maintain them have been failing to\n\nlook after them in their times of need. Even the bare necessities of life are not\n\nbeing provided, not to speak of maintenance. The parents, who are at the\n\nreceiving end, are often the subjects of abuse, insult and violence at the instance\n                                          6\n\n\nof their own children. Allegations of the parents being coerced to transfer\n\nproperty in the name of their grown up married son, mostly hen-pecked, failing\n\nwhich they are mentally and physically tortured is now routine. Refusal to\n\nsuccumb leads to acrimonious relationship and differences which snowball into\n\nproperty disputes. To my mind, it is greed that is the root of such disputes. By\n\npassage of time, with the increasing torture, they are devastated and ravaged.\n\nFinding it difficult to endure the torture and violence, they approach the police\n\nfor assistance. Not in every case the police, acting within the parameters of law,\n\nare able to extend assistance. They are not supposed to interfere in disputes, civil\n\nin nature. Resolution of domestic disputes also does not fall within the arena of\n\ntheir duty. In such cases, the police are reluctant to interfere. Alleging police\n\ninaction, the Court of Writ is being flooded with petitions presented by those\n\nunfortunate parents, who are mostly in the December years of their life. Before\n\nthe almighty ushers them into eternity, they urge the Court of Writ to come to\n\ntheir rescue by directing the police to take appropriate measures against the\n\nerring son and daughter-in-law and to protect their right to life and property,\n\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_2\">300A</a> of the Constitution.\n\n      This batch of petitions, some heard analogously and some separately, are\n\nat the instance of such unfortunate parents. The common feature in these\n\npetitions is the allegation that they have been receiving a battering from their\n\nsons and daughters-in-law and their approach to the police not having yielded\n\nthe desired result, the Court of Writ is urged to enforce their right to life and\n\nproperty. As a judge of this Court having determination to deal with residuary\n                                          7\n\n\nmatters (which includes matters relating to police inaction), I have to decide the\n\nfate of these unfortunate parents.\n\n      In the absence of any authority directly on the question of maintainability\n\nof a writ petition which alleges police inaction on a complaint made by the\n\nparents against their sons/daughters-in-law for the latter unleashing violence\n\nthereby affecting the peace, dignity, person and property rights of the former and\n\nin regard to the extent of powers exercisable by the Court of Writ in respect of\n\ncomplaints of the nature at hand, I had requested Mr. L.K. Gupta and Mr. P.S.\n\nSengupta, learned senior counsel of this Court to assist me as amicus curiae.\n\n      Sparing time out of their busy schedule, both Mr. Gupta and Mr. Sengupta\n\nhave addressed the Court at length. I record my sincere appreciation for the\n\nservices rendered by them on my request.\n\n      Before discussing the facts relevant for deciding the petitions involving\n\nsomewhat common questions of law and fact, I consider it proper to notice the\n\nsubmissions advanced by learned amicus curiae.\n\n      Mr. Gupta at the inception reminded me of the well settled position in law\n\nthat the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is very wide and the\n\nsame is not and cannot be restricted by law; however, various judicial\n\npronouncements have set the limits of exercise of such power or jurisdiction, the\n\nlimits being the self-imposed restrictions conceptualized through judicial wisdom.\n\n      In the context of the nature of the cases in hand, according to him, the\n\nrestrictions to be kept in mind in deciding the question of maintainability are -\n                                      8\n\n\n(i)       whether such dispute is or is not a purely private one without\n\n          having any impact on the socio-economic aspects recognized by\n\n          law;\n\n(ii)      whether the State has any legal duty to intervene and to\n\n          ameliorate the grievances of the petitioners;\n\n(iii)     whether there exists any equally efficacious alternative remedy in\n\n          civil or criminal courts and even if an alternative forum of redress\n\n          is available, should a Writ Court entertain a writ petition; and\n\n(iv)      whether the Constitution provides for any special rights for this\n\n          category of citizens or imposes any special duties upon the State\n\n          for protection of their life and property.\n\nHe went on to elaborate the above aspects by submitting that :\n\na)      A dispute per se with regard to property between or among\n\n        individuals is a purely private one and normally the remedy is to file\n\n        a suit for declaration and injunction. A civil court is authorized to\n\n        pass orders and decrees to adequately protect the right of a person,\n\n        both with regard to his title and possession. Thus, generally a Writ\n\n        Court does not interfere in property disputes of citizens except where\n\n        illegal interference or deprivation is alleged against an authority,\n\n        being a &#x27;State&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.\n\n        However, the investigation does not end there. There may be\n\n        situations where a private property dispute may lead to crimes or\n\n        apprehension of commission of offence punishable by any law for the\n                                   9\n\n\n     time being in force. The role of the State in such a situation can and\n\n     should arise. Here, the aggrieved person may take steps as provided\n\n     in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_5\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> (hereafter the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_6\">Cr.P.C</a>.) for the\n\n     protection of his life and property and for punishment of the wrong-\n\n     doer. Judicial precedents have clearly outlined the diverse nature of\n\n     proceedings that may be initiated through filing of First Information\n\n     Report (hereafter FIR)/complaints and taking consequential steps.\n\n     That apart, where the aggrieved person is interested in protecting his\n\n     life or property and does not want to take the rigour of initiating\n\n     criminal proceedings for the punishment of the offender, he may, as\n\n     aforesaid, move civil courts. This general principle may not and\n\n     should not, however, be construed as shutting the doors of the Writ\n\n     Court in all situations to all persons regardless of the nature of the\n\n     complaint and regardless of the enquiry into the fact as to whether\n\n     the aggrieved person is recognized by law to belong to a special\n\n     category for whom any special right or protection is recognized by\n\n     law or any special duty is conferred on the State by &quot;Law&quot;. The &quot;Law&quot;\n\n     referred to above embraces within itself the Constitution, the\n\n     Parliamentary    and   the       State   legislative   enactments,   and\n\n     international conventions not inconsistent with such legislative\n\n     documents.\n\nb)   The petitioners belong to a class who are old, sick, disabled and\n\n     complain of being victims of undeserved want. They seek to make out\n                                  10\n\n\n     a case of being ousted from the property of which they are owners or\n\n     co-owners or have right of residence; of being subjected to physical\n\n     and mental torture. This obviously affects their life - life within the\n\n     meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution with all its components like\n\n     livelihood, basic human rights, happiness, fulfillment, dignity,\n\n     shelter etc. as distinguished from animal existence and drudgery.\n\n     The contents of the word &quot;life&quot; for the above referred categories of\n\n     persons even includes right to treatment, care, attention and\n\n     company. The State in these situations has a duty to extend its\n\n     hands through its law enforcing agencies to make the dream of the\n\n     founding fathers of the Constitution a reality, to promote the ideals\n\n     embedded in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_8\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">21</a> and bring back smile on the faces of\n\n     this class which desperately needs such help. We are a &#x27;Welfare\n\n     State&#x27; and for such citizens to entertain such expectation is what we\n\n     &#x27;The People of India&#x27; have resolved to secure. Thus the case is one\n\n     where the Court is being approached with a prayer to exercise its\n\n     jurisdiction to issue a mandate upon the State to protect the\n\n     fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> read\n\n     in the context of the Directive Principles of State Policy set by <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_11\">Article\n\n     41.</a> One should also read in this context the Preamble to the\n\n     Constitution which speaks, inter alia, of social and economic justice.\n\nc)   Should a Writ Court shut its doors to such litigants with such plea\n\n     on the ground that they can file civil suits for relief or initiate\n                             11\n\n\ncriminal proceedings? A civil suit definitely lies as <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 9</a> of the\n\nCode of Civil Procedure (hereafter <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_13\">the CPC</a>) is broad enough to permit\n\nthe filing of such suits. However, possibly being sensitive to the\n\nprevailing socio-economic situation in the country, the Apex Court\n\nhas held that the existence of alternative remedy by way of filing of a\n\nsuit is not a ground for a Writ Court not to entertain a petition.\n\nProvisions in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">Cr.P.C</a>. can also deal with all situations involving\n\ncommission of offences and even prevention thereof. But such\n\nprovisions require, as a first step, the filing of FIR/complaint followed\n\nup by investigation, report, enquiry, trial, etc. To expect an old\n\nperson, who may also be sick or disabled, to move out for such\n\npurposes or for any of them and to ask him to await the ultimate\n\nconclusion of such proceedings would itself be contrary to recognized\n\nhuman rights. In any event, what he gains in the long run, assuming\n\nhe survives to see such result, is the punishment awarded to the\n\noffender of his rights. How does his life, with all the rights lawfully\n\nexpected to be associated with it, get protected thereby? Are not such\n\nalternative remedies thoroughly inadequate and inefficacious to him?\n\nIs he not entitled to avail of an easier procedure? Is not right to such\n\neasier procedure more consistent with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_16\">41?</a> Does\n\navailability of such a forum ensure quicker fulfillment of his lawful\n\nrights and dignity which are components of &#x27;life&#x27;? If the answer to\n\nthese questions is in the affirmative, then for these deprived lot the\n                                         12\n\n\n            very right to make a writ petition may be considered as an aid to the\n\n            enjoyment of life within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21.</a>\n\n      He contended that the international conventions on human rights and\n\ngreat jurists have accorded highest priority to the right to life.

Krishna Iyer, J. published\n\nby Eastern Law House in the book entitled &quot;The Dialectics and Dynamics of\n\nHuman Rights in India&quot; were referred to in the context.\n\n      It was also contended that based on the International Conventions on\n\nHuman Rights, the Parliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_18\">Protection of Human Rights Act</a> 1993.\n\nIn <a href=\"/doc/994266/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 2(d)</a> of the 1993 Act, the definition of &quot;human rights&quot; means the rights\n\nrelating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the\n\nConstitution or embodied in the international covenants and enforceable by\n\ncourts in India. Both the National Human Rights Commission and the State\n\nHuman Rights Commissions are vested with the functions of making enquiry into\n\ncomplaints of violation of human rights or abetment thereof and, on completion\n\nof enquiry, to take steps, inter alia, to approach the Supreme Court or the High\n\nCourt for directions, orders or writs (<a href=\"/doc/842137/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/958544/\" id=\"a_21\">12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1348169/\" id=\"a_22\">13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1753082/\" id=\"a_23\">18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1915618/\" id=\"a_24\">21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1523097/\" id=\"a_25\">29</a>). Trial of\n\noffences by the Human Rights Courts is also provided in <a href=\"/doc/1549134/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 30</a> of the Act.\n\n      To protect women, he contended, there exists the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_27\">Protection of Women\n\nfrom Domestic Violence Act, 2005</a> (hereafter the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_28\">DV Act</a>). Domestic violence as\n\ndefined in <a href=\"/doc/406908/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 3</a> of the DV Act includes harassment to coerce a woman or a\n\nperson related to her to meet any unlawful demand for property. Domestic\n\nviolence also includes physical abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic\n                                           13\n\n\nabuse. Every woman in a domestic relationship has the right to reside in the\n\nshared household, whether or not she has any right, title or beneficial interest in\n\nthe same (<a href=\"/doc/615600/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 17</a>). A hierarchy of fora has been prescribed and the Act\n\ncontains provisions for passing of protection orders and residence orders\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/1860699/\" id=\"a_31\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1130386/\" id=\"a_32\">19</a>).\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/946025/\" id=\"a_33\">The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956</a> was the next            statute\n\nreferred to by him. <a href=\"/doc/485875/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 20</a> thereof casts a duty upon a Hindu to maintain,\n\ninter alia, his or her aged or infirm parents.\n\n      The Mohammedan Law, it was further contended, also contains similar\n\nprovision (Mulla&#x27;s Principles of Mohamedan Law - Sec 371 was referred to in the\n\ncontext).\n\n      Another relevant legislation of recent origin which, according to him, would\n\nhave a bearing on the issue at hand is the <a href=\"/doc/118724005/\" id=\"a_35\">Maintenance and Welfare of Parents\n\nand Senior Citizens Act, 2007</a> (hereafter the 2007 Act).\n\n      In Mr. Gupta&#x27;s opinion, these legislations definitely recognize the old and\n\ninfirm as a distinct class who need special protection. The principles\n\nconceptualized in these legislations and in the International Conventions on\n\nHuman Rights are all contained in the jurisprudence woven in our Constitution\n\nin abbreviated excellence.\n\n      He continued by submitting that it is not only within the jurisdiction of the\n\nWrit Court to protect and advance such jurisprudence, but it has a constitutional\n\nduty to do so. However, he was quick to sound a word of caution. The general law\n\nlike the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_36\">Cr.P.C</a>. or the special laws referred to above prescribe procedures for\n                                         14\n\n\nmeeting the nature of the grievance in question. It is only where the facts of any\n\ncase are such that the remedy provided by such laws is found to be inadequate\n\nor inefficacious to the judicial mind that a writ petition may be entertained and\n\ndecided. During the 60 years of existence of India as a Republic, the\n\nConstitutional Courts of our country have gained sufficient experience and\n\nexpertise to separate the grain from the chaff and decide on whether there exists\n\nan equally efficacious alternative remedy or any particular writ petition or a class\n\nof writ petitions should be entertained in the extraordinary jurisdiction to uplift\n\nthe constitutional jurisprudence. The jurisdiction of a Writ Court is enormous\n\nbut it will not act as a &quot;bull in the china shop&quot; (U.P. State Co-operative Land\n\nDevelopment Bank Ltd. vs Chandra Bhan Dubey and ors., AIR 1999 SC 753).\n\nWherever the Court may feel it necessary, it may before passing any effective\n\norders for disposal of such a writ petition call for reports from the law enforcing\n\nagency to ascertain the veracity of the factual allegations contained in the writ\n\npetition in order that the party against whom the allegations are made may not\n\nfind an easy escape route on the specious plea of disputed questions of fact. The\n\npolice have definite statutory obligations under <a href=\"/doc/1839199/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 23</a> of the Police Act, 1861\n\n(hereafter the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_38\">Police Act</a>), inter alia, to prevent commission of offence and public\n\nnuisance. Where a person or authority is vested with a duty by specific statutory\n\nprovisions, for compelling such person or authority to perform such duty is\n\ncertainly within the power and jurisdiction of a Writ Court. The exercise of such\n\npower will be consistent with the constitutional provisions which a person on his\n                                           15\n\n\nelevation as a Judge is bound by the oath of office administered to him. Where\n\nthere is a duty to act, refusal is the least the law can tolerate.\n\n      He concluded by submitting that the ordinary legal remedies that are\n\nprovided by the various recent legislations, if not efficacious, the Writ Court may\n\non a case to case basis interfere for granting relief to this distinct class of old\n\naged and infirm parents. They cannot be thrown out on the basis of Supreme\n\nCourt decisions which deal with different set of facts.\n\n      Mr. Sengupta, at the outset, conceded that the Court is faced with a\n\nserious human problem. In his introductory address, he contended that the\n\nrealities of life would have to be examined to give shape to law, for, law would\n\ncease to serve its purpose if justice cannot be administered. He referred to Lord\n\nAtkins famous remark that &#x27;law is good but justice is better&#x27; to emphasize that\n\nlaw ought to be so interpreted to promote justice and not to defeat it. According\n\nto him, the ultimate goal of the Constitution is to secure justice to the people and\n\nthe entire system is oriented by the word &#x27;justice&#x27;. All the powers must be\n\nexercised in consonance with the preamble and definitely a Court of Writ would\n\nbe justified in interfering if the situation, which might vary from case to case, so\n\nwarrants. The extraordinary writ powers, he contended, have to be exercised only\n\nin extraordinary cases and the special facts of the case therefore must be\n\nconsidered. The preambular promise must always be borne in mind and,\n\ntherefore, the Court of Writ ought to strive to dispense justice to the parties not\n\noblivious of the self-imposed restrictions but by striking a balance in such a\n\nmanner that justice does not become a casualty.\n                                          16\n\n\n      Mr. Sengupta, however, very fairly invited my attention to two Constitution\n\nBench decisions of the Apex Court in P.D. Shamdasani v. Central Bank of India\n\nLtd., AIR 1952 SC 59, and Vidya Verma v. Shiv Narain Sharma, AIR 1956 SC\n\n108, wherein law has been laid down to the effect that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> would be\n\nattracted only in case of violation of a right guaranteed thereunder by the State\n\nbut not in case of violation thereof by an individual.\n\n      The Supreme Court in P.D. Shamdasani (supra) was dealing with the\n\nnature of right conferred by <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 31</a>, a declaration in negative form similar to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a> which also in negative form declares the fundamental right to life and\n\nliberty without any express reference to the word &#x27;State&#x27;. Mr. Sengupta by\n\nreferring to P.D. Shamdasani (supra) sought to draw an analogy and contended\n\nthat the ratio of the decision would also be applicable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> and, therefore,\n\nthe said Article would not provide protection against private actions. It was his\n\nfurther contention that the decision in Vidya Verma (supra) upon consideration\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21</a> and the decision in P.D. Shamdasani (supra) declares the law to be\n\nso.\n\n      The declaration of law in the above referred decisions, according to him, is\n\nto the effect that if the State infringes a right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a> contrary to\n\nprocedure established by law, the person whose right is infringed could seek\n\nenforcement of the right but the right cannot be enforced against a private\n\nindividual. It is only in circumstances where the right is or likely to be infringed\n\nby a private individual and the State is approached to intervene to remedy the\n\nwrong that is likely to ensue or has ensued that the State must act; if, however,\n                                          17\n\n\nthe State does not intervene, it would aid deprivation of the right of the victim\n\nand the writ jurisdiction may be invoked in such case alleging failure of the\n\npublic authority to discharge a duty which it owes to the victim of such\n\ninfringement.\n\n      However, he was quick to submit that law in the changing society must\n\ncope with challenges faced by the people and that change in social circumstances\n\nrequires a different look.\n\n      Various decisions on the scope of Mandamus were referred to by him. The\n\ndecision in Dwarka Nath v. Income Tax Officer, AIR 1966 SC 81 was the first one.\n\nIt was observed therein that <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 226</a> is couched in comprehensive phraseology\n\nand it ex facie confers a wide power on the High Courts to reach injustice\n\nwherever it is found. Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. Rohtas Industries Staff Union, AIR\n\n1976 SC 425, Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. &amp; ors. v. Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor\n\nSabha &amp; ors., AIR 1980 SC 1896 and Chandra Bhan Dubey (supra) were the\n\nother decisions cited by him wherein the scope and ambit of writ powers were\n\nexplained. At the same time, he submitted that a somewhat discordant note was\n\nsounded by the Supreme Court in its decision in G. Bassi Reddy v. International\n\nCrops Research Institute, (2003) 4 SCC 225.\n\n      Based on these decisions, he submitted that the Writ Court may not be\n\nunjustified even in interfering with disputes between parents and children if on\n\nconsideration of the facts it is satisfied that interference is warranted for securing\n\njustice.\n\n      On the issue of alternative remedy being available to the litigants, it was\n                                          18\n\n\nsubmitted that disinclination of a Court of Writ to entertain a petition if an\n\nalternative remedy exists is one of the self-imposed restrictions; it is not a rule of\n\nlaw but a rule of convenience. If alternative remedy exists but immediate\n\nintervention is necessary, the Court of Writ ought not to decline to interfere for in\n\ncase of non-interference the remedy against the mischief might be of no avail.\n\nWhether the alternative remedy is equally efficacious or not would largely depend\n\non the facts of each case for a minor difference in facts is crucial for entertaining\n\na writ petition. It would be opposed to constitutional philosophy if relief is\n\nrefused only on the ground of existence of an alternative remedy which may not\n\nbe equally efficacious. The decisions in Dushyant Somal v. Sushma Somal &amp;\n\nanr., (1981) 2 SCC 277, J.M. Baxi &amp; Co. v. Commissioner of Customs, (2001) 9\n\nSCC 275, and BCPP Mazdoor Sangh v. NTPC, (2007) 14 SCC 234, were referred\n\nto emphasize the approach of the Court to hold petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 226</a>\n\nmaintainable despite availability of alternative remedy.\n\n      He contended that the pros and cons of the matter in the context of the\n\nfact situation of the case should be carefully weighed and appropriate decision\n\ntaken and in this connection referred to the decision in Life Insurance\n\nCorporation of India v. Asha Goel, (2001) 2 SCC 160. Referring to the decision in\n\nUnion of India v. R. Redappa, (1993) 4 SCC 269, it was contended that if there is\n\na glaring injustice, no rule or technicality can stand in the way of rendering\n\njustice.\n\n      Referring to the decision in Aleque Padamsee v. Union of India, (2007) 6\n\nSCC 171, it was contended that the complaint did not relate to anyone&#x27;s right to\n                                          19\n\n\nlife and that the declaration of law has to be read in the light of the facts of the\n\ncase before the Court. The said decision, according to him, does not declare a law\n\nto be followed in all cases without having regard to the peculiar facts involving\n\ncomplaints of perceiving threat to life and invasion of liberty. Pointing out to\n\nparagraph 8 of the decision and in particular to direction no.3, it was further\n\ncontended that the Court had in fact entertained the petition.\n\n      He concluded by stressing on the point that since <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution guarantees right to life and personal liberty of a person which can\n\nonly be affected by procedure established by law, it therefore follows that the law\n\nmade by the State would provide machinery to protect one&#x27;s life or liberty if any\n\none seeks to curtail the right of another guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21;</a> in a given case\n\nif the Court is satisfied that the police has by its inaction or negligence has failed\n\nto secure law and order in the society, and the Court&#x27;s interference is warranted\n\nas per the need of the situation, the Court ought to rise to the occasion for\n\nadministering justice between the parties according to principles of justice, equity\n\nand good conscience and redress the expectation of people. The law courts exist\n\nfor the society and, therefore, technicalities ought not to stand in the way of the\n\njustice delivery system.\n\n      Mr. Kashi Nath De, learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P. No. 3915 (W)\n\nof 2010 contended that a writ petition would be maintainable wherein the\n\nallegation pertains to failure of the police officers to discharge their statutory\n\nduty. He referred to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_49\">Police Act</a> as well as the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_50\">Cr.P.C</a>. where\n\nthe powers of the police have been delineated.\n                                         20\n\n\n      On the point of maintainability of the writ petition, he heavily relied on the\n\nSpecial Bench decision of this Court in Jay Engineering Works Ltd. &amp; ors. v.\n\nState of West Bengal &amp; ors., AIR 1968 Cal 470, well-known as the &#x27;gherao&#x27; case,\n\nwhere the Court had directed the police officers to rescue the officers of the\n\npetitioner company from the &#x27;gherao&#x27; of agitating workmen. The law on the\n\nsubject of police inaction, he contended, has been elaborately discussed and he\n\nurged the Court to be guided by the same.\n\n      The decision in Dadu Dayalu Mahasabha, Jaipur (Trust) v. Mahant Ram\n\nNiwas, (2008) 11 SCC 753, was cited by him for the proposition that a judgment\n\nshould not be read as a statute.\n\n      He also relied on the decisions in Moran M. Baselios Marthoma Mathews II\n\nv. State of Kerala, (2007) 6 SCC 517, Howrah Mills Co. Ltd. v. Mohd. Shamin,\n\n(2006) 5 SCC 539, and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261,\n\nin support of his submissions that the writ petition filed by his client is\n\nmaintainable.\n\n      Appearing in support of the petitioners in W.P. No. 10423 (W) of 2010, Mr.\n\nKishore Dutta, learned counsel referred to <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_51\">Articles 8</a><a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_52\">, 12</a><a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_53\">, 22</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_54\">25</a> of the\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948. The said Articles read as follows:\n\n      &quot;8.Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national\n      tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by\n      Constitution or by law.\n      12. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,\n      family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and\n      reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such\n      interference or attacks.\n      22. Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is\n      entitled to realization through national effort and international co-operation\n      and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the\n                                          21\n\n\n      economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free\n      development of his personality.\n      25.1. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health\n      and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing\n      and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in\n      the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other\n      lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond its control.\n      2. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All\n      children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social\n      protection.&quot;\n\n\n      He contended that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes the\n\nright to life, liberty and security of a person and there is no reason as to why the\n\nsame, apart from the Fundamental Rights in Part III of the Constitution of India,\n\nshould not be given effect.\n\n      Next he referred to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\n\n1966, to which India is a signatory, and in particular to <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 17</a> of the said\n\ncovenant. It reads :\n\n         &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 17\n\n         1.</a> No one shall be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his\n         privacy, family, human or correspondence, nor to lawful attacks on his\n         honour and reputation.\n         2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such\n         interference or attacks.&quot;\n\n\n      The decision in People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India, (1997) 1\n\nSCC 301, was cited where the Supreme Court held that the said covenant is not\n\ncontrary to any part of our municipal law, and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has,\n\ntherefore, been interpreted in conformity with the international law.\n\n      For the proposition that in the event of doubt the national laws have to be\n                                              22\n\n\ninterpreted and harmonized in accordance with the State&#x27;s international\n\nobligations, reference was made by him to the decision in Kubic Darusz v. Union\n\nof India &amp; ors., (1990) 1 SCC 568.\n\n      Next, he referred to the decision in Chairman, Railway Board &amp; ors. v.\n\nChandrima Das (Mrs.) &amp; ors., (2000) 2 SCC 465, for the proposition that\n\ninternational   covenants      must     be   respected    and   the   rights    effectively\n\nimplemented.\n\n      He referred to the Constitution Bench decision in Kartar Singh v. State of\n\nPunjab, (1994) 3 SCC 569, and relied on paragraphs 447 &amp; 448 to contend that\n\nright to life is a basic human right.\n\n      It was argued that the cry of the old, disabled and unfortunate parents for\n\nsocial justice against their children ought not to be throttled by relying on\n\ndecisions rendered at a point of time when the situation was completely different\n\nand it could never have been conceived that Indian parents would be subjected to\n\ncontinued neglect and torture at the hands of their children, which is a regular\n\nfeature in developed foreign nations.\n\n      Replying to a query of Court as to whether the decisions in P.D.\n\nShamdasani (supra) and Vidya Verma (supra), cited by Mr. Sengupta, still hold\n\nthe field or not, he very fairly submitted that not to speak of being overruled, the\n\nsaid decisions were noticed and the law declared in respect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a> vis-à-vis\n\ninfringement    thereof   by   a   private   individual   was   approved   by     another\n\nConstitution Bench in ADM, Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla, (1976) 2 SCC 521.\n\n      Notwithstanding the said decisions, he contended that the problem at hand\n                                            23\n\n\nhas to be viewed from the standpoint of the deprived or the tortured, - is he\n\nentitled to right to life and of liberty or not? If torture or deprivation by the\n\nchildren attracts penal laws, they are punishable in accordance with law but in\n\nsuch eventuality the victim&#x27;s interest must also be safeguarded. Law, according\n\nto him, has to be interpreted visualizing the change in societal situations and,\n\ntherefore, the decisions reported in Shri Sohan Lal v. Union of India &amp; anr., AIR\n\n1957 SC 529, Chandra Bhan Dubey (supra) and Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra\n\nChakraborty (Ms), (1996) 1 SCC 490, would squarely apply in respect of\n\ncomplaint of breach of fundamental right by a private individual. Social changes\n\ncan, therefore, be looked into by the Court for granting/moulding relief without\n\nbeing bound by precedents which declared the law having regard to the fact\n\nsituation prevailing then.\n\n      To give effect to the pledge in the preamble of securing social justice\n\nagainst the interminable wrong-doing by the children, the old infirm parents\n\ncould, according to him, legitimately claim a right and ask the State to ensure\n\nthat such right is not breached.\n\n      The decision in People&#x27;s Union for Democratic Rights &amp; Union of India, AIR\n\n1982 SC 1473, was next referred where the Supreme Court entertained an <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_59\">Article\n\n32</a> petition for ensuring compliance of social welfare legislations like the labour\n\nlaws by private contractors. Relying thereon, it was contended by him that a\n\nCourt of Writ is not powerless to direct the State to ensure that the old and\n\ndisabled parents are provided with every amenity by their children to enable\n\nthem live a peaceful and dignified life.\n                                        24\n\n\n      Two decisions of the Bombay High Court were relied on by Mr. Dutta to\n\nhighlight the duties of police. The same are Transmissions P. Ltd. v. C.V. Bapat,\n\nAIR 1981 Bombay 83, and Mithailal v. State of Maharashtra, 1993 Cr. L.J. 3580.\n\n      Referring to the submissions of Mr. Gupta, it was however contended by\n\nhim that <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 41</a> may not take care of the present situation. <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 41</a>, he\n\ncontended, recognizes quid pro quo. According to him, the provision would take\n\ncare of those who serve the State during their younger days; as and when a\n\nperson grows old with age, the State steps in and takes welfare measures to take\n\ncare of him so that a dignified life may be led without being dependent on his\n\nchildren.\n\n      Lastly, he referred to paragraph 33 of the decision in D.S. Nakara v. Union\n\nof India, (1983) 1 SCC 305, where the concept of socialism was explained in some\n\ndetail.\n\n      He concluded by submitting that keeping in mind the rights guaranteed\n\nunder the national laws vis-à-vis the international laws and deprivation of the\n\nright to life and of liberty by even a private individual being violative of the\n\nguarantee envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the Court of Writ in a fit\n\nand proper case may interfere and pass such orders necessary to sub-serve ends\n\nof justice.\n\n      I have heard learned advocates representing the respective parties as well\n\nas Mr. Gupta and Mr. Sengupta, learned amicus curiae.\n\n\n\n      Before I proceed to deal with the writ petitions individually, it would be\n                                         25\n\n\nnecessary to notice the law declared by the Apex Court and by the High Courts in\n\nthe decisions that have been referred to for appreciating the expanse of writ\n\njurisdiction in cases of the present nature as well as to find out whether the\n\nissues involved are covered by any precedent directly on the point or not.\n\n      In P.D. Shamdasani (supra), the Supreme Court was considering a petition\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution for the enforcement of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nfundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_64\">Articles 19(1)(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/27622490/\" id=\"a_65\">31(1)</a> of the Constitution alleged to\n\nhave been violated by the Central Bank of India, a company incorporated under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/470004/\" id=\"a_66\">Indian Companies Act, 1882</a>. The bank had sold five shares held by the\n\npetitioner in the share capital of the bank to a third party in purported exercise\n\nof its right of lien for recovery of a debt due to it from the petitioner and the\n\ntransfer was registered in the bank&#x27;s books in 1937. The validity of the said sale\n\nand transfer were challenged by the petitioner by instituting series of proceedings\n\nin the High Court at Bombay. The last of such proceedings was a suit filed\n\nagainst the bank in 1951, the plaint whereof was rejected on 2.3.1951 under\n\nOrder 7 Rule 11 (d), <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_67\">C.P.C</a>. as barred by limitation. The petitioner had prayed for\n\nquashing of all the adverse orders made in the previous proceedings and for a\n\ndirection for hearing of the suit as undefended.\n\n      It was noted that the petitioner did not prefer any appeal against the order\n\nrejecting the petitioner&#x27;s plaint on an extraordinary ground mentioned in\n\nparagraph 2 of the decision. The Supreme Court while rejecting the contentions\n\nof the petitioner held as follows :\n                                          26\n\n             &quot;3. We are of opinion that the petitioner has misconceived his remedy\n            and the petition must fail on a preliminary ground. Neither <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_68\">Article\n            19(1)(f)</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/27622490/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 31(1)</a> on its true construction was intended to\n            prevent wrongful individual acts or to provide protection against\n            merely private conduct. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 19</a> deals with the &quot;right to freedom&quot; and\n            by clause (1) assures to the citizen certain fundamental freedoms\n            including the freedom &quot;to acquire, hold and dispose of property&quot;\n            subject to the power of the State to impose restrictions on the exercise\n            of such rights to the extent and on the grounds mentioned in clauses\n            (2) to (6). The language and structure of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 19</a> and its setting in\n            Part III of the Constitution clearly show that the article was intended to\n            protect those freedoms against State action other than in the legitimate\n            exercise of its power to regulate private rights in the public interest.\n            Violation of rights of property by individuals is not within the purview\n            of the article.\n            5. **** We consider it unnecessary for the purpose of the present\n            petition to go into that question. Even assuming that clause (1) has to\n            be read and construed apart from clause (2), it is clear that it is a\n            declaration of the fundamental right of private property in the same\n            negative form in which <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 21</a> declares the fundamental right to life\n            and liberty. There is no express reference to the State in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21.</a> But\n            could it be suggested on that account that that article was intended to\n            afford protection to life and personal liberty against violation by\n            private individuals? The words &quot;except by procedure established by\n            law&quot; plainly exclude such a suggestion. Similarly, the words &quot;save by\n            authority of law&quot; in clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 31</a> show that it is a prohibition\n            of unauthorised governmental action against private property, as there\n            can be no question of one private individual being authorised by law to\n            deprive another of his property.&quot;\n\n\n      In Smt. Vidya Verma (supra), the Supreme Court was considering a\n\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus. The\n\npreliminary question which fell for consideration was whether in a case where\n\ndetention complained of is by a private person and not by a State or under the\n\nauthority or orders of a State, a fundamental right is at all involved or not.\n\n      Relying on the decisions of the Supreme Court in A.K. Gopalan v. State of\n\nMadras, AIR 1950 SC 27, and P.D. Shamdasani (supra), the Supreme Court\n\ndismissed the petition. It was held that for the same reasons for which <a href=\"/doc/27622490/\" id=\"a_76\">Article\n\n31(1)</a> did not apply to invasions of a right by a private individual and\n\nconsequently no writ under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 32</a> would lie, the petition which was founded\n                                         27\n\n\non <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 21</a> would not lie under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 32.</a>\n\n      The aforesaid two decisions along with a host of other decisions were\n\nconsidered by the Supreme Court in ADM, Jabalpur (supra). The facts giving rise\n\nto the said decision are well-known to all students of law and I need not burden\n\nmy decision by discussing the facts. Hon&#x27;ble A.N. Ray, CJ. (as His Lordship then\n\nwas) noticing the law laid down in P.D. Shamdasani (supra) and Vidya Verma\n\n(supra) ruled as follows:\n\n            &quot;88. The respondents contended that permanent law cannot be\n            repealed by temporary law. The argument is irrelevant and misplaced.\n            The Presidential Order under <a href=\"/doc/1760044/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 359(1)</a> is not a law. The order\n            does not repeal any law either. The suggestion that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 21</a> was\n            intended to afford protection to life and personal liberty against\n            violation by private individual was rejected in Shamdasani case\n            because there cannot be any question of one private individual being\n            authorised by law to deprive another of his property or taking away\n            the life and liberty of any person by procedure established by law. The\n            entire concept in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21</a> is against executive action. In Vidya Verma\n            case this Court said that there is no question of infringement of\n            fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 21</a> where the detention complained of\n            is by a private person and not by a State under the authority or orders\n            of a State.\n\n      Hon&#x27;ble M.H. Beg, J. (as His Lordship then was) in his judgment, recorded\n\nthat &quot;it is admitted that part III of the Constitution is only meant to protect\n\ncitizen against illegal actions of organs of the State and not against wrongs done\n\nby individual.&quot;\n\n      Hon&#x27;ble P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was) held as under:\n\n\n            &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 21</a> gives protection against deprivation of personal liberty but\n            what is the nature and extent of this protection? In the first place, it\n            may be noted that this protection is only against State action and not\n            against private individual. ...... Secondly, it is clear from the language\n            of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_85\">Art. 21</a> that the protection it secures is a limited one. ......The only\n                                         28\n\n\n            safeguard enacted by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a>, therefore, is that a person cannot be\n            deprived of his personal liberty except according to procedure\n            prescribed by &#x27;State made&#x27; law. If a law is made by the State\n            prescribing the procedure for depriving a person of his personal liberty\n            and deprivation is effected strictly in accordance with such procedure,\n            the terms of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 21</a> would be satisfied and there would be no\n            infringement of right guaranteed under that Article.&quot;\n\n\n      The aforesaid Constitution Bench decisions declare the law that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 21</a>\n\nis prohibition against unauthorized executive action and law referred to in such\n\nArticle would mean State made law.\n\n      Now let me take a look at the decisions discussing the powers conferred on\n\nHigh Court relating to issuance of writs.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Dwarka Nath (supra) was faced with a preliminary\n\nobjection raised by the respondents to the effect that the order of the\n\nCommissioner under <a href=\"/doc/1992406/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 33A</a> of the Income Tax Act was an administrative\n\nact and, therefore, no writ of certiorari to the High Court to quash that order\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution would lie.\n\n      While holding that the case falls directly within the confines of the\n\ncertiorari jurisdiction, K. Subba Row, J. (as His Lordship then was) observed as\n\nfollows :\n\n            &quot;4. We shall first take the preliminary objection, for if we maintain it,\n            no other question will arise for consideration. <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 226</a> of the\n            Constitution reads:\n            &#x27;... ... ... ...&#x27;\n            This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and it ex facie\n            confers a wide power on the High Courts to reach injustice wherever it\n            is found. The Constitution designedly used a wide language in\n            describing the nature of the power, the purpose for which and the\n            person or authority against whom it can be exercised. It can issue\n            writs in the nature of prerogative writs as understood in England; but\n            the scope of those writs also is widened by the use of the expression\n            &#x27;nature&#x27;, for the said expression does not equate the writs that can be\n                                          29\n\n            issued in India with those in England, but only draws an analogy from\n            them. That apart, High Courts can also issue directions, orders or\n            writs other than the prerogative writs. It enables the High Courts to\n            mould the reliefs to meet the peculiar and complicated requirements of\n            this country. Any attempt to equate the scope of the power of the High\n            Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution with that of the English\n            Courts to issue prerogative writs is to introduce the unnecessary\n            procedural restrictions grown over the years in a comparatively small\n            country like England with a unitary form of government to a vast\n            country like India functioning under a federal structure. Such a\n            construction defeats the purpose of the article itself. To say this is not\n            to say that the High Courts can function arbitrarily under this Article.\n            Some limitations are implicit in the article and others may be evolved\n            to direct the article through defined channels. This interpretation has\n            been accepted by this Court in (T.C. Basappa v. Nagappa, 1955-1 SCR\n            250 : AIR 1954 SC 440) and Irani v. State of Madras [1962 (2) SC 169\n            : (AIR 1961 SC 1731].&quot;\n\n\n      Though in the aforesaid decision it was held that a writ of certiorari can be\n\nissued only to quash a judicial or a quasi judicial act and not an administrative\n\nact, it is now settled law that pure administrative acts abridging rights of parties\n\nare also amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts and in an\n\nappropriate case the Court may issue appropriate writ to set things right.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Rohtas Industries (supra) was considering an order\n\nof the High Court that quashed part of an award of the Arbitrators under <a href=\"/doc/483312/\" id=\"a_93\">Section\n\n10A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The questions that were urged were\n\nnoted in paragraph 8 of the decision and the discussion on the expansive and\n\nextraordinary powers of the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 226</a> were noted in\n\nparagraph 9. I consider it relevant to reproduce below both paragraphs 8 and 9 :\n\n            &quot;8. The main points urged\n            The short but important issue, which has projected some serious\n            questions of law, is as to whether the impugned part of the award has\n            been rightly voided by the High Court. We may as well formulate them\n            but highlight the only major submission that merits close examination,\n            dealing with the rest with terse sufficiency. In logical order, counsel for\n                                         30\n\n           the appellant urged that : (1)(a) an award under <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 10-A</a> of the\n           Act savours of a private arbitration and is not amenable to correction\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. (b) Even if there be jurisdiction, a\n           discretionary desistence from its exercise is wise, proper and in\n           consonance with the canons of restraint this Court has set down. (2)\n           The award of compensation by the arbitrators suffers from no vice\n           which can be regarded as a recognised ground for the High Court&#x27;s\n           interference. (3) The view of law taken by the High Court on (i) the\n           supposed flaw in the award based on &#x27;mixed motives&#x27; for the\n           offending strike; (ii) the exclusion of remedies other than under <a href=\"/doc/927844/\" id=\"a_97\">Section\n           26</a> of the Act; and (iii) the implied immunity from all legal proceedings\n           against strikers allegedly arising from <a href=\"/doc/514425/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 18</a> of the Trade Unions\n           Act, 1926 is wrong. A few other incidental arguments have cropped up\n           but the core contentions are what we have itemised above.\n\n\n           (9) (1a) &amp; (b)\n\n           The expansive and extraordinary power of the High Courts under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 226</a> is as wide as the amplitude of the language used indicates\n           and so can affect any person -- even a private individual -- and be\n           available for any (other) purpose -- even one for which another\n           remedy may exist. The amendment to <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 226</a> in 1963 inserting\n           <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 226 (1-A)</a> reiterates the targets of the writ power as inclusive of\n           any person by the expressive reference to &#x27;the residence of such\n           person&#x27;. But it is one thing to affirm the jurisdiction, another to\n           authorise its free exercise like a bull in a china shop. This Court has\n           spelt out wise and clear restraints on the use of this extraordinary\n           remedy and High Courts will not go beyond those wholesome\n           inhibitions except where the monstrosity of the situation or other\n           exceptional circumstances cry for timely judicial interdict or mandate.\n           The mentor of law is justice and a potent drug should be judiciously\n           administered. Speaking in critical retrospect and portentous prospect,\n           the writ power has, by and large, been the people&#x27;s sentinel on the qui\n           vive and to cut back on or liquidate that power may cast a peril to\n           human rights. We hold that the award here is not beyond the legal\n           reach of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 226</a>, although this power must be kept in severely\n           judicious leash.\n                                                   (underlining in original)\n\n     In Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. (supra), the Court was considering a decision of\n\nthe High Court which had reversed an award of the Arbitrator upholding the\n\naction of the management and dismissing certain workmen and substantially\n                                         31\n\n\ndirecting reinstatement in service. Krishna Iyer, J. (as His Lordship then was) on\n\nthe sweep of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 226</a> observed as follows :\n\n            &quot;72. Once we assume that the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to enquire\n            into the alleged misconduct was exercised, was there any ground\n            under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to demolish that holding? Every\n            wrong order cannot be righted merely because it is wrong. It can be\n            quashed only if it is vitiated by the fundamental flaws of gross\n            miscarriage of Justice, absence of legal evidence, perverse misreading\n            of facts, serious errors of law on the face of the order, jurisdictional\n            failure and the like.\n            73. While the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 226</a> is extraordinary and is of\n            Anglo-Saxon vintage, it is not a carbon copy of English processes.\n            <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 226</a> is a sparing surgery but the lancet operates where injustice\n            suppurates. While traditional restraints like availability of alternative\n            remedy hold back the court, and judicial power should not ordinarily\n            rush in where the other two branches fear to tread, judicial daring is\n            not daunted where glaring injustice demands even affirmative action.\n            The wide words of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 226</a> are designed for service of the lowly\n            numbers in their grievances if the subject belongs to the court&#x27;s\n            province and the remedy is appropriate to the judicial process. There is\n            a native hue about <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 226</a>, without being anglophilic or\n            anglophobic in attitude. Viewed from this jurisprudential perspective,\n            we have to be cautious both in not overstepping as if <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 226</a> were\n            as large as an appeal and not failing to intervene where a grave error\n            has crept in. Moreover, we sit here in appeal over the High Court&#x27;s\n            judgment. And an appellate power interferes not when the order\n            appealed is not right but only when it is clearly wrong. The difference\n            is real, though fine.&quot;\n\n\n\n      Chandra Bhan Dubey (supra) is a decision rendered by the Supreme Court\n\nwhile it was considering a judgment of the High Court holding that the appellant\n\nis an instrumentality of the State and as such amenable to the writ jurisdiction of\n\nthe High Court. Paragraph 26 contains certain reflections on the scope and ambit\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 226.</a> The same is reproduced hereunder :\n\n            &quot;26. In view of the fact that control of the State Government on the\n            appellant is all-pervasive and the employees had statutory protection\n            and therefore the appellant being an authority or even instrumentality\n                                   32\n\n     of the State, would be amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, it may not be necessary to\n     examine any further the question if <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 226</a> makes a divide\n     between public law and private law. Prima facie from the language of\n     <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 226</a>, there does not appear to exist such a divide. To\n     understand the explicit language of the article, it is not necessary for\n     us to rely on the decision of the English courts as rightly cautioned by\n     the earlier Benches of this Court. It does appear to us that <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 226</a>\n     while empowering the High Court for issue of orders or directions to\n     any authority or person, does not make any such difference between\n     public functions and private functions. It is not necessary for us in this\n     case to go into this question as to what is the nature, scope and\n     amplitude of the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo\n     warranto and certiorari. They are certainly founded on the English\n     system of jurisprudence. <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution also speaks of\n     directions and orders which can be issued to any person or authority\n     including, in appropriate cases, any Government. Under clause (1) of\n     <a href=\"/doc/579323/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 367</a>, unless the context otherwise requires, the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_117\">General Clauses\n     Act, 1897</a>, shall, subject to any adaptations and modifications that\n     may be made therein under <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 372</a>, apply for the interpretation of\n     the Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of the\n     legislature of the Dominion of India. &#x27;Person&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1400425/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 2(42)</a> of the\n     General Clauses Act shall include any company or association or body\n     of individuals, whether incorporated or not. The Constitution is not a\n     statute. It is a fountainhead of all the statutes. When the language of\n     <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 226</a> is clear, we cannot put shackles on the High Courts to limit\n     their jurisdiction by putting an interpretation on the words which\n     would limit their jurisdiction. When any citizen or person is wronged,\n     the High Court will step in to protect him, be that wrong be done by the\n     State, an instrumentality of the State, a company or a cooperative\n     society or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or\n     not, or even an individual. Right that is infringed may be under Part III\n     of the Constitution or any other right which the law validly made might\n     confer upon him. But then the power conferred upon the High Courts\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is so vast, this Court has laid\n     down certain guidelines and self-imposed limitations have been put\n     there subject to which the High Courts would exercise jurisdiction, but\n     those guidelines cannot be mandatory in all circumstances. The High\n     Court does not interfere when an equally efficacious alternative\n     remedy is available or when there is an established procedure to\n     remedy a wrong or enforce a right. A party may not be allowed to\n     bypass the normal channel of civil and criminal litigation. The High\n     Court does not act like a proverbial &#x27;bull in a china shop&#x27; in the\n     exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 226.&quot;</a>\n\nIt is, however, noted that in Ramchandra Govind Dongre v. Indian Hume\n                                           33\n\n\nPipe Co. Ltd., (2001) 10 SCC 461, the view expressed in Chandra Bhan Dubey\n\n(supra) quoted above has not been accepted and the issue has been referred to a\n\nlarger bench.\n\n      In R. Redappa (supra), the Supreme Court was considering the issue of\n\ndismissal of railway employees without holding any enquiry. According to the\n\ndisciplinary authority it was not reasonably practicable to hold such enquiry. The\n\nCentral Administrative Tribunal interfered and set aside the order of dismissal.\n\nWhile disposing of the appeals by directing reinstatement and payment of\n\ncompensation, the Court observed that although the jurisdiction exercised by the\n\nHigh Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 226 &quot;</a>is not as wide as it is in appeal or revision but once\n\nthe Court is satisfied of injustice or arbitrariness then the restriction, self-imposed\n\nor statutory, stands removed and no rule or technicality on exercise of power can\n\nstand in way of rendering justice&quot;.\n\n      In Asha Goel (supra), the Supreme Court was hearing an appeal against\n\nthe judgment of the Bombay High Court allowing a writ appeal on the ground\n\nthat the appellant should have had an opportunity of leading evidence relevant to\n\ntheir contention that the insurance policy was obtained by misrepresentation\n\nand, therefore, avoidable at the instance of the Corporation and remitting the\n\nwrit petition to the Writ Court for fresh decision. The High Court had overruled\n\nthe objection of the Corporation against maintainability of the writ petition on the\n\nground that the case involves enforcement of contractual right, for adjudication\n\nof which a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 226</a> is not the proper remedy. The Supreme\n\nCourt in paragraph 11 held as follows :\n                                          34\n\n             &quot;11. The position that emerges from the discussions in the decided\n            cases is that ordinarily the High Court should not entertain a writ\n            petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution for mere enforcement\n            of a claim under a contract of insurance. Where an insurer has\n            repudiated the claim, in case such a writ petition is filed, the High\n            Court has to consider the facts and circumstances of the case, the\n            nature of the dispute raised and the nature of the inquiry necessary to\n            be made for determination of the questions raised and other relevant\n            factors before taking a decision whether it should entertain the writ\n            petition or reject it as not maintainable. It has also to be kept in mind\n            that in case an insured or nominee of the deceased insured is refused\n            relief merely on the ground that the claim relates to contractual rights\n            and obligations and he/she is driven to a long-drawn litigation in the\n            civil court it will cause serious prejudice to the claimant/other\n            beneficiaries of the policy. The pros and cons of the matter in the\n            context of the fact-situation of the case should be carefully weighed\n            and appropriate decision should be taken. In a case where claim by\n            an insured or a nominee is repudiated raising a serious dispute and\n            the Court finds the dispute to be a bona fide one which requires oral\n            and documentary evidence for its determination then the appropriate\n            remedy is a civil suit and not a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 226</a> of the\n            Constitution. Similarly, where a plea of fraud is pleaded by the insurer\n            and on examination is found prima facie to have merit and oral and\n            documentary evidence may become necessary for determination of the\n            issue raised, then a writ petition is not an appropriate remedy.&quot;\n\n      In G. Bassi Reddy (supra), the Supreme Court was considering whether the\n\nrespondent institute is amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 226</a> or not.\n\nIn that context, the Supreme Court held in paragraph 27 as follows:\n\n\n            &quot;27. It is true that a writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 226</a> also lies against a &#x27;person&#x27;\n            for &#x27;any other purpose&#x27;. The power of the High Court to issue such a\n            writ to &#x27;any person&#x27; can only mean the power to issue such a writ to\n            any person to whom, according to the well-established principles, a\n            writ lay. That a writ may issue to an appropriate person for the\n            enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III is clear enough\n            from the language used. But the words &#x27;and for any other purpose&#x27;\n            must mean &#x27;for any other purpose for which any of the writs\n            mentioned would, according to well-established principles issue&#x27;.&quot;\n\n\n\n      In J.M. Baxi (supra), having regard to the special facts of the case where\n                                          35\n\n\nthe demand of nearly Rs. 46 lakh was challenged on the ground that it was\n\nbarred by time, the Supreme Court held that the High Court instead of\n\ndismissing the writ petition on the ground that alternative remedy was available\n\nought to have determined the questions which were raised in the writ petition on\n\nmerits.\n\n        In Capt. Dushyant Somal (supra), the contention of the appellant that the\n\nrespondent had alternative remedies under the <a href=\"/doc/1874830/\" id=\"a_129\">Guardians and Wards Act</a> and\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_130\">Cr.P.C</a>. and so writ should not have been issued was negatived by holding\n\nthat:\n\n             &quot;True, alternative remedy ordinarily inhibits a prerogative writ. But it\n             is not an impassable hurdle. Where what is complained of is an\n             impudent disregard of an order of a court, the fact certainly cries out\n             that a prerogative writ shall issue.&quot;\n\n\n        In BCPP Mazdoor Sangh (supra), the Supreme Court overruled the plea of\n\nexistence of alternative remedy in the following words :\n\n             &quot;19. Though no serious objection was made as to the maintainability\n             of the writ petition, however, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n             management pointed out that even if there is any breach by BALCO of\n             its obligations in the matter of terms and conditions of employment,\n             the appellants have appropriate remedy under industrial law.\n             Inasmuch as the claim of the employees relates to interpretation of\n             certain clauses in the agreement and appointment letters and no\n             disputed facts are involved and taking note of the fact that the issue\n             relates to employment of few hundreds of employees and in the light of\n             the assertion that transferring them to private organisation from a\n             public sector undertaking without their specific consent is arbitrary\n             and unreasonable and also of the settled position that alternative\n             remedy is rule of discretion and not the rule of law, we accept the\n             conclusion of the High Court and hold that the writ petitions under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution filed by the employees are\n             maintainable.&quot;\n                                             36\n\n\n      In Aleque Padamsee (supra), the Supreme Court was considering an <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_132\">Article\n\n32</a> petition praying for a direction on the police to register the complaint as First\n\nInformation Report and to conduct investigation. In paragraph 7 it was observed\n\nas follows :\n\n               7. Whenever any information is received by the police about the\n               alleged commission of offence which is a cognizable one there is a\n               duty to register the FIR. There can be no dispute on that score. The\n               only question is whether a writ can be issued to the police authorities\n               to register the same. The basic question is as to what course is to be\n               adopted if the police does not do it. As was held in All India Institute of\n               Medical Sciences case, (1996) 11 SCC 582, and reiterated in\n               Gangadhar case, (2004) 7 SCC 768, the remedy available is as set out\n               above by filing a complaint before the Magistrate. Though it was\n               faintly suggested that there was conflict in the views in All India\n               Institute of Medical Sciences case, Gangadhar case, Hari Singh case,\n               (2006) 5 SCC 733, Minu Kumari case, (2006) 4 SCC 359, and Ramesh\n               Kumari case, (2006) 2 SCC 677, we find that the view expressed in\n               Ramesh Kumari case related to the action required to be taken by the\n               police when any cognizable offence is brought to its notice. In Ramesh\n               Kumari case the basic issue did not relate to the methodology to be\n               adopted which was expressly dealt with in All India Institute of\n               Medical Sciences case, Gangadhar case, Minu Kumari case and Hari\n               Singh case. The view expressed in Ramesh Kumari case was\n               reiterated in Lallan Chaudhary v. State of Bihar, (2006) 12 SCC 229.\n               The course available, when the police does not carry out the statutory\n               requirements under Section 154 was directly in issue in All India\n               Institute of Medical Sciences case, Gangadhar case, Hari Singh case\n               and Minu Kumari case. The correct position in law, therefore, is that\n               the police officials ought to register the FIR whenever facts brought to\n               their notice show that cognizable offence has been made out. In case\n               the police officials fail to do so, the modalities to be adopted are as set\n               out in Section 190 read with Section 200 of the Code. It appears that\n               in the present case initially the case was tagged by order dated 24-2-\n               2003 with WP (C) No. 530 of 2002 and WP (C) No. 221 of 2002.\n               Subsequently, these writ petitions were delinked from the aforesaid\n               writ petitions.\n\n      Mr. Sengupta is right in his submission that despite the observations\n\ncontained in paragraph 7 of the decision, direction no.3 contained in paragraph 8\n\nof the decision is suggestive of entertainment of the writ petition by the Supreme\n\nCourt.\n                                         37\n\n\n     In Sohanlal (supra), the writ petitioner Jagan Nath obtained an order from\n\nthe Punjab High Court on a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 226</a> directing the Union of\n\nIndia and Sohanlal to forthwith restore possession of a particular house on the\n\nground that the Union of India had illegally evicted Jagan Nath. It was in such\n\ncircumstances that the Supreme Court held in paragraph 7 as follows :\n\n\n           7. The eviction of Jagan Nath was in contravention of the express\n           provisions of Section 3 of the Public Premises (Eviction) Act. His\n           eviction, therefore, was illegal. He was entitled to be evicted in due\n           course of law and a writ of mandamus could issue to or an order in\n           the nature of mandamus could be made against the Union of India to\n           restore possession of the property to Jagan Nath from which he had\n           been evicted if the property was still in possession of the Union of\n           India. The property in dispute, however, is in possession of the\n           appellant. There is no evidence and no finding of the High Court that\n           the appellant was in collusion with the Union of India or that he had\n           knowledge that the eviction of Jagan Nath was illegal. Normally, a\n           writ of mandamus does not issue to or an order in the nature of\n           mandamus is not made against a private individual. Such an order is\n           made against a person directing him to do some particular thing,\n           specified in the order, which appertains to his office and is in the\n           nature of a public duty (Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England Vol. 11, Lord\n           Simonds Edn. p. 84). If it had been proved that the Union of India and\n           the appellant had colluded, and the transaction between them was\n           merely colourable, entered into with a view to deprive Jagan Nath of\n           his rights, jurisdiction to issue a writ to or make an order in the nature\n           of mandamus against the appellant might be said to exist in a Court.\n           We have not been able to find a direct authority to cover a case like the\n           one before us, but it would appear that so far as election to an office is\n           concerned, a mandamus to restore, admit, or elect to an office will not\n           be granted unless the office is vacant. If the office is in fact full,\n           proceedings must be taken by way of injunction or election petition to\n           oust the party in possession and that a mandamus will go only on the\n           supposition that there is nobody holding the office in question. In R. v.\n           Chester Corporation, (1855) 25 LJQB 61, it was held that it is an\n           inflexible rule of law that where a person has been de facto elected to\n           a corporate office, and has accepted and acted in the office, the\n           validity of the election and the title to the office can only be tried by\n           proceeding on a quo warranto information. A mandamus will not lie\n           unless the election can be shown to be merely colourable. We cannot\n           see why in principle there should be a distinction made between such\n           a case and the case of a person, who has, apparently, entered into\n           bona fide possession of a property without knowledge that any person\n           had been illegally evicted therefrom.&quot;\n\n     This decision, therefore, could be an authority for the proposition that if a\n                                           38\n\n\npublic authority in collusion with a private individual indulges in acts of\n\ncommission/omission affecting the rights of the petitioner, a writ petition would\n\nlie against the private individual too.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Kartar Singh (supra) was considering the\n\nconstitutional validity of various central legislations enacted to prevent terrorist\n\nactivities. Hon&#x27;ble R.M. Sahai, J. (as His Lordship then was), while concurring\n\nsubstantially with the majority opinion, in a separate judgment traced the history\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 21</a>, legislatively and judicially, and succinctly laid down what &#x27;Right to\n\nLife&#x27; connotes. Paragraphs 447 and 448 of the decision are considered to be\n\nuseful guide and thus quoted below :\n\n             &quot;447.***** Before embarking upon this exercise it may be worthwhile\n             examining the depth of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution as any law of\n             punitive or preventive detention has to be tested on the touchstone of\n             the constitutional assurance to every person that he shall not be\n             deprived of his liberty except in accordance with procedure\n             established by law. It is declaration of deep faith and belief in human\n             rights. In the &#x27;pattern of guarantee woven in Chapter III of the\n             Constitution, personal liberty of a man is at the root of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 21&#x27;.</a>\n             Modern history of human rights is struggle for freedom and\n             independence of the man. One may call the right guaranteed under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 21</a> as, &#x27;natural right&#x27; or &#x27;basic human right&#x27; but a society,\n             committed to secure to its citizens &#x27;justice social, economic and\n             political; liberty of thought, equality of status and liberty to promote\n             amongst themselves fraternit&#x27; the foundation on which edifice of the\n             Constitution has been structured could not have done otherwise than\n             to provide for the human dignity and freedom as has been done by\n             <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution which reads as under :\n             *****\n             Each expression used in this article enhances human dignity and\n             value. It lays foundation for a society where rule of law has primacy\n             and not arbitrary or capricious exercise of power. &#x27;Life&#x27; dictionarily\n             means, &#x27;state of functional activity and continual change peculiar to\n             organised matter, and especially to the portion of it constituting an\n             animal or plant before death; animate existence; being alive&#x27;. But used\n             in the Constitution it may not be mere existence. As far back as 1877\n             Field, J. in Munn v. Illinois, 94 US 113 (1877) construed similar\n             expression in the American Constitution as &#x27;more than animal\n             existence&#x27;. It has been approved by our Court in Kharak Singh v. State\n             of U.P., AIR 1963 SC 1295 and reiterated in Sunil Batra v. Delhi\n             Administration (I), (1978) 4 SCC 494. It was given new dimension in\n                                   39\n\n     Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248 and extended in\n     Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, (1981)\n     1 608, when it was held: (SCC pp. 618-619, para 8)\n     &#x27;... protection of limb or faculty or does it go further and embrace\n     something more. We think that the right to life includes the right to live\n     with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare\n     necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and\n     facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms,\n     freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human\n     beings.&#x27;\n     448. Liberty is the most cherished possession of a man. &#x27;Truncate\n     liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 21</a> and several other freedoms fade out\n     automatically&#x27;. Edmond Burke called it &#x27;regulated freedom&#x27;. Liberty is\n     the right of doing an act which the law permits. This article instead of\n     conferring the right, purposely uses negative expression. Obviously\n     because the Constitution has recognised the existence of the right in\n     every man. It was not to be guaranteed or created. One inherits it by\n     birth. This absolutism has not been curtailed or eroded. Restriction has\n     been placed on exercise of power by the State by using the negative. It\n     is State which is restrained from interfering with freedom of life and\n     liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.\n     Use of the word &#x27;deprive&#x27; is of great significance. According to th\n     dictionary it means, &#x27;debar from enjoyment; prevent (child etc.) from\n     having normal home life&#x27;. Since deprivation of right of any person by\n     the State is prohibited except in accordance with procedure\n     established by law, it is to be construed strictly against the State and\n     in favour of the person whose rights are affected. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 21</a> is a\n     constitutional command to State to preserve the basic human rights of\n     every person. Existence of right and its preservation has, thus, to be\n     construed liberally and expansively. As a corollary to it the exercise of\n     power by the State has to be construed narrowly and restrictively. It\n     should be so understood and interpreted as not to nullify the basic\n     purpose of the guarantee. No legislative or executive action can be\n     permitted to get through unless it passes through the judicial scanning\n     of it being not violative of the cherished right preserved\n     constitutionally. If the article is construed as empowering the State to\n     make a law and deprive a person as the Constitution permits it then\n     the entire concept of personal liberty shall stand frustrated. A political\n     party voted to power may adopt repressive measures against its\n     political foes by enacting a law and it may well be said that\n     deprivation being in accordance with procedure established by law it\n     is within the constitutional frame. The procedure adopted by State\n     either legislatively or executively must therefore satisfy the basic and\n     fundamental requirement of being fair and just. The word &#x27;except&#x27;\n     restricts the right of the State by directing it not to fiddle with this\n     guarantee, unless it enacts a law which must withstand the test of\n     <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 13.</a> Today it appears wellnigh settled that procedure\n     established by law, extends both to the substantive and procedural\n     law. Further mere law is not sufficient. It must be fair and just law.\n     Even in absence of any provision as in American Constitution fair trial\n     has been rendered the basic and primary test through which a\n     legislative and executive action must pass.&quot;\n\nIn Bodhisattwa Goutam (supra), the Supreme Court while considering an\n                                          40\n\n\nappeal against the order passed by the High Court refusing to quash criminal\n\nproceedings was seized with the question as to whether any further order could\n\nbe passed in the case and the appellant be compelled to pay maintenance during\n\nthe pendency of criminal case for which show cause notice had been issued to\n\nhim. While disposing of the appeal by ordering that the appellant shall pay to the\n\nrespondent a sum of Rs. 1000/- every month as interim compensation during the\n\npendency of the criminal case, the Court in paragraphs 6 to 10 observed as\n\nfollows :\n\n\n            6. This Court, as the highest Court of the country, has a variety of\n            jurisdiction. Under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution, it has the jurisdiction\n            to enforce the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution by\n            issuing writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition,\n            quo warranto and certiorari. Fundamental Rights can be enforced even\n            against private bodies and individuals. Even the right to approach the\n            Supreme Court for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights under\n            <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 32</a> itself is a Fundamental Right. The jurisdiction enjoyed by\n            this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 32</a> is very wide as this Court, while\n            considering a petition for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental\n            Rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution, can declare an Act to\n            be ultra vires or beyond the competence of the legislature and has also\n            the power to award compensation for the violation of the Fundamental\n            Rights (See: Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 141; Peoples&#x27;\n            Union for Democratic Rights v. Police Commr., Delhi Police HQs, (1989)\n            4 SCC 730.\n            7. For the exercise of this jurisdiction, it is not necessary that the\n            person who is the victim of violation of his fundamental right should\n            personally approach the court as the court can itself take cognizance of\n            the matter and proceed suo motu or on a petition of any public-spirited\n            individual. This Court through its various decisions, has already given\n            new dimensions, meaning and purpose to many of the fundamental\n            rights especially the Right to Freedom and Liberty and Right to Life.\n            The Directive Principles of State Policy have also been raised by this\n            Court from their static and unenforceable concept to a level as high as\n            that of the fundamental rights.\n            8. This Court has, innumerable times, declared that &quot;Right to Life&quot;\n            does not merely mean animal existence but means something more,\n                                           41\n\n             namely, the right to live with human dignity. (See: Francis Coralie\n             Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, (1981) 1 SCC 608;\n             State of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan Tale, (1983) 3 SCC 387; Olga\n             Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corpn., (1985) 3 SCC 545; and Delhi\n             Transport Corpn. v. DTC Mazdoor Congress, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 600.\n             Right to Life would, therefore, include all those aspects of life which go\n             to make a life meaningful, complete and worth living.\n             9. Unfortunately, a woman, in our country, belongs to a class or group\n             of society who are in a disadvantaged position on account of several\n             social barriers and impediments and have, therefore, been the victim\n             of tyranny at the hands of men with whom they, fortunately, under the\n             Constitution enjoy equal status. Women also have the right to life and\n             liberty; they also have the right to be respected and treated as equal\n             citizens. Their honour and dignity cannot be touched or violated. They\n             also have the right to lead an honourable and peaceful life. Women, in\n             them, have many personalities combined. They are mother, daughter,\n             sister and wife and not playthings for centre spreads in various\n             magazines, periodicals or newspapers nor can they be exploited for\n             obscene purposes. They must have the liberty, the freedom and, of\n             course, independence to live the roles assigned to them by Nature so\n             that the society may flourish as they alone have the talents and\n             capacity to shape the destiny and character of men anywhere and in\n             every part of the world.\n             10. Rape is thus not only a crime against the person of a woman\n             (victim), it is a crime against the entire society. It destroys the entire\n             psychology of a woman and pushes her into deep emotional crisis. It is\n             only by her sheer will-power that she rehabilitates herself in the\n             society which, on coming to know of the rape, looks down upon her in\n             derision and contempt. Rape is, therefore, the most hated crime. It is a\n             crime against basic human rights and is also violative of the victim&#x27;s\n             most cherished of the Fundamental Rights, namely, the Right to Life\n             contained in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 21.</a> To many feminists and psychiatrists, rape is\n             less a sexual offence than an act of aggression aimed at degrading\n             and humiliating women. The rape laws do not, unfortunately, take\n             care of the social aspect of the matter and are inept in many respects.\n\n\n      Paragraphs 24 and 25 of the decision in Chandrima Das (supra) referred to\n\nby Mr. Dutta, where the Supreme Court was dealing with a public interest\n\nlitigation, read as follows :\n\n             &quot;24. The International Covenants and Declarations as adopted by the\n             United Nations have to be respected by all signatory States and the\n             meaning given to the above words in those Declarations and\n                                          42\n\n            Covenants have to be such as would help in effective implementation\n            of those rights. The applicability of the Universal Declaration of Human\n            Rights and the principles thereof may have to be read, if need be, into\n            the domestic jurisprudence.\n            25. Lord Diplock in Salomon v. Commr. of Customs and Excise said\n            that there is a prima facie presumption that Parliament does not intend\n            to act in breach of international law, including specific treaty\n            obligations. So also, Lord Bridge in Brind v. Secy. of State for the\n            Home Deptt. observed that it was well settled that, in construing any\n            provision in domestic legislation which was ambiguous in the sense\n            that it was capable of a meaning which either conforms to or conflicts\n            with the International Convention, the courts would presume that\n            Parliament intended to legislate in conformity with the Convention and\n            not in conflict with it.&quot;\n\n\n\n      In Peoples&#x27; Union for Civil Liberties (supra), the Supreme Court taking note\n\nof the fact that India is a signatory to the International Covenants on Civil &amp;\n\nPolitical Rights, 1966 observed that <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights, 1948 is almost in similar terms as <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 17</a> of the said covenant\n\nand that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has, therefore, been interpreted in\n\nconformity with the international law.\n\n      Moran M. Baselios Marthoma Matthews (II) (supra) related to a dispute\n\nbetween the parties regarding management of &quot;Syrian churches&quot;. The Court\n\nnoticed that 200 civil suits between the parties touching one aspect or the other\n\nwere pending and held that the High Court erred in the exercise of its jurisdiction\n\nin entertaining a writ petition when disputed questions of fact relating to title\n\nwere involved. Paragraph 8 of the decision being relevant is quoted below:\n\n\n            &quot;8. A distinction, in our opinion, must be borne in mind in regard to the\n            exercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India in\n            relation to the matters providing for public law remedy vis-à-vis private\n            law remedy. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under\n                                         43\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, no doubt, exercises a plenary power\n            but then certain limitations in regard thereto are well accepted.\n            Ordinarily, a writ of or in the nature of mandamus would be issued\n            against a &#x27;State&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of\n            India or the public authorities discharging public functions or a public\n            utility concern or where the functions of the respondents are referable\n            to a statute, which a fortiorari would mean that save and except for\n            good reasons Court would not entertain a matter involving private law\n            remedy.&quot;\n\n\n      The Court considered its earlier decision in P.R. Murlidharan v. Swami\n\nDharmananda Theertha Padar, (2006) 4 SCC 501 (to which reference shall be\n\nmade at a later part of this judgment), while observing that the observations in\n\nthe order of the High Court under appeal would not bind the lower courts where\n\nthe proceedings were pending.\n\n      In Howrah Mills (supra), while considering whether the State of West\n\nBengal should have responded to a request for protecting the property from\n\ntrespassers so as to ensure that revival of a sinking industry is achieved and its\n\nworkers are protected, the Supreme Court observed that in such a situation it\n\nwas the duty of the police of the State to give necessary protection to the\n\nstruggling industry to tide over the crises and protect its property from\n\ninterference by lawless elements and unauthorized persons.\n\n      The decision in Jay Engineering Works (supra) though relatable to police\n\ninaction is not one directly on the point. The Government of West Bengal had\n\nissued two circulars dated 28.3.1967 and 12.6.1997. The circular dated\n\n28.3.1967 related to a cabinet decision dated 14.3.1967 wherein it was decided\n\nthat in cases of &#x27;gherao&#x27; of industrial establishments by workers resulting in the\n                                         44\n\n\nconfinement of managerial and other staff, the matter should immediately be\n\nreferred to the Labour Minister and his direction obtained before deciding upon\n\npolice intervention for the rescue of the confined personnel. Circular dated\n\n12.6.1967 was issued by the Government to impress officers, specially those\n\nconnected with maintenance of law and order that the police must not intervene\n\nin legitimate labour movements and that in case of any complaint regarding\n\nunlawful activity in connection with such movements the police must first\n\ninvestigate carefully whether the complaint has any basis in fact before\n\nproceeding to take any action provided under the law.\n\n      It was the common case of the petitioners in the series of gherao cases that\n\nthe aforesaid two circulars constituted the primary reason for the total inaction of\n\nthe police.\n\n      Upon these facts, the following questions arose for determination:\n\n      1. What is a &#x27;gherao&#x27;?\n      2. Is &#x27;gherao&#x27; as practiced in this case lawful?\n      3. Are the circulars dated 22nd March 1967 and 12th June 1967 and/or the\n         decisions, if any, upon which they are based lawful or competent?\n      4. Did the respondents 6 and 7 fail to perform their legal duties either in\n         obedience to the said circulars or otherwise?\n      5. To what relief are the petitioners entitled to?\n\n      While answering the questions raised, Their Lordships of the Special Bench\n\nhad the occasion to trace the powers of the police in different enactments and\n\nconsidered whether by an executive fiat the police could be directed not to\n\nexercise its statutory powers on the face of commission of offences punishable\n\nunder law. The Court declared the impugned circulars unlawful and the\n                                          45\n\n\nrespondents were directed to act in terms of the law laid down in the judgment. It\n\nwas in the circumstances that the Court observed that the police were bound to\n\ndischarge their statutory duties not only by apprehending those who committed\n\nan offence but also to take steps to prevent it from being committed. It was also\n\nobserved that prevention is the more important phase of the duty of the police\n\nand is illustrative of the homely phrase &#x27;prevention is better than cure&#x27;.\n\n      In Mithailal (supra), the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n            &quot;29.****Democratic society is governed by the concept of rule of law.\n            The police are essentially a law enforcing agency. It is he who enforces\n            the liability, maintains the public order, regulates traffic, keeps the\n            lawless elements in check, brings the offenders to book and so on and\n            so forth. Police after advent of independence of India and becoming a\n            parliamentary democracy, practically became a servant of people. Now\n            whilst maintaining law and order as servants of the democracy, it has\n            to act as guide of the people, to counsel them towards the responsible\n            civil life. Police service is essential and police have to spend most of\n            their time in working with the people from whom they too expect\n            cooperation. The police instead of being ante are now of the People\n            and for the People.****&quot;\n\n\n      A learned Judge of the Bombay High Court, in Transmissions P. Ltd.\n\n(supra), was seized with the question as to whether the petitioners are entitled to\n\nclaim police protection or assistance for enforcing their right of entering the\n\nfactory premises and enjoying their properties. On consideration of the provisions\n\ncontained in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_152\">Cr.P.C</a>. as well as the <a href=\"/doc/109320082/\" id=\"a_153\">Bombay Police Act, 1951</a>, it was held that\n\nthe Writ Court would not be powerless to intervene if the police fail or refuse to\n\ncarry out their duty.\n                                           46\n\n\n      At this juncture, it would also be worthwhile to take note of a decision of\n\nthe Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in Midland Rubber &amp; Produce Co.\n\nLtd., Cochin v. Superintendent of Police, Pathanamthitta &amp; ors., 1999 (1) L.L.J.\n\n385. Hon&#x27;ble Justice AR. Lakshmanan (as His Lordship then was) speaking for\n\nthe Bench, while referring to the decision of the Apex Court in Shri Anadi Mukta\n\nSadguru S.M.V.S.J.M.S. Trust vs V.R. Rudani, AIR 1989 SC 1607, held as\n\nfollows:\n\n            &quot;It is clear from the above pronouncement that a writ of mandamus\n            should be issued to police authorities to enforce law. It is needless to\n            say that duties imposed on the police authorities are to prevent the\n            commission of crimes including the commission of cognizable offences.\n            It is immaterial whether such crime is committed against an individual\n            or public at large. In this view of ours it is necessary for us to grant the\n            relief to the appellant because he is complaining of the inaction on the\n            part of the police authorities to prevent the respondents from\n            committing offences and also rescue the appellant from the clutches of\n            the contesting respondents who have taken law in their own hands\n            and are preventing the management from exercising their fundamental\n            right to engage their own men and carry on a lawful trade or business\n            as above. For the foregoing reasons the writ petition and writ appeal\n            are allowed.****&quot;\n\n\n\n      In D.S. Nakara (supra), the Supreme Court while dealing with cut-off dates\n\nfixed for entitlement to pensionary benefits delved deep into the aspect of\n\nsocialism and observed as follows :\n\n            &quot;33. Recall at this stage the Preamble, the flood light illuminating the\n            path to be pursued by the State to set up a Sovereign Socialist Secular\n            Democratic Republic. Expression &quot;socialist&quot; was intentionally\n            introduced in the Preamble by the Constitution (Forty-second\n            amendment) Act, 1976. In the objects and reasons for amendment\n            amongst other things, ushering in of socio-economic revolution was\n            promised. The clarion call may be extracted:\n            &#x27;The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties\n            which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio-economic\n                             47\n\nrevolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and\ninequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of\nGovernment and the public for some time....\nIt is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out\nexpressly the high ideals of socialism ... to make the directive\nprinciples more comprehensive....&#x27;\nWhat does a Socialist Republic imply? Socialism is a much\nmisunderstood word. Values determine contemporary socialism pure\nand simple. But it is not necessary at this stage to go into all its\nramifications. The principal aim of a socialist State is to eliminate\ninequality in income and status and standards of life. The basic\nframework of socialism is to provide a decent standard of life to the\nworking people and especially provide security from cradle to grave.\nThis amongst others on economic side envisaged economic equality\nand equitable distribution of income. This is a blend of Marxism and\nGandhism leaning heavily towards Gandhian socialism. During the\nformative years, socialism aims at providing all opportunities for\npursuing the educational activity. For want of wherewithal or financial\nequipment the opportunity to be fully educated shall not be denied.\nOrdinarily, therefore, a socialist State provides for free education from\nprimary to PhD but the pursuit must be by those who have the\nnecessary intelligence quotient and not as in our society where a\nbrainy young man coming from a poor family will not be able to\nprosecute the education for want of wherewithal while the ill equipped\nson or daughter of a well-to-do father will enter the portals of higher\neducation and contribute to national wastage. After the education is\ncompleted, socialism aims at equality in pursuit of excellence in the\nchosen avocation without let or hindrance of caste, colour, sex or\nreligion and with full opportunity to reach the top not thwarted by any\nconsiderations of status, social or otherwise. But even here the less\nequipped person shall be assured a decent minimum standard of life\nand exploitation in any form shall be eschewed. There will be\nequitable distribution of national cake and the worst off shall be\ntreated in such a manner as to push them up the ladder. Then comes\nthe old age in the life of everyone, be he a monarch or a mahatma, a\nworker or a pariah. The old age overtakes each one, death being the\nfulfilment of life providing freedom from bondage. But here socialism\naims at providing an economic security to those who have rendered\nunto society what they were capable of doing when they were fully\nequipped with their mental and physical prowess. In the fall of life the\nState shall ensure to the citizens a reasonably decent standard of life,\nmedical aid, freedom from want, freedom from fear and the enjoyable\nleisure, relieving the boredom and the humility of dependence in old\nage. This is what <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 41</a> aims when it enjoins the State to secure\n                                          48\n\n\n            public assistance in old age, sickness and disablement. It was such a\n            socialist State which the Preamble directs the centres of power --\n            Legislative, Executive and Judiciary -- to strive to set up. From a\n            wholly feudal exploited slave society to a vibrant, throbbing socialist\n            welfare society is a long march but during this journey to the fulfilment\n            of goal every State action whenever taken must be directed, and must\n            be so interpreted, as to take the society one step towards the goal.&quot;\n\n      These are more or less all that have been cited before me by learned\n\ncounsel. I feel a lot more educated and am encouraged to make a shift from my\n\nrigid stand, which I had expressed at the commencement of hearing. But one\n\nthing is clear, there is no precedent directly on the point of conflicting interest of\n\nthe present nature and that the slate is clean on which I have the chance to\n\nscribble.\n\n      All human beings cherish certain basic human freedoms which occupy\n\nprime position among the higher values of life. One of those is abiding faith in the\n\nrule of law and the sanctity of personal liberty. Bound as I am by the\n\nConstitution Bench decisions in P.D. Shamdasani (supra), Vidya Verma (supra)\n\nand ADM, Jabalpur (supra), I would have had no other alternative but to hold\n\nthat howsoever dear and precious the right to life and liberty might be to a\n\nperson, if such right is sought to be invaded by a private individual and not by\n\nthe State and a writ petition is filed for enforcement of the right so invaded, the\n\nWrit Court&#x27;s jurisdiction would not extend and the deprivation ought to be\n\neschewed relegating the victim of deprivation to avail his remedy under the\n\nordinary laws of the country.\n\n      I, however, wonder whether the framers of the Constitution, or even the\n\nerudite Hon&#x27;ble Judges who adorned the seats of Judges of the Supreme Court\n                                          49\n\n\nduring the fifties or even thereafter while deciding ADM, Jabalpur (supra) ever\n\nimagined of a situation of conflict of the present nature between parents and\n\nchildren. Much water has flown down the Ganges since the decisions in A.K.\n\nGopalan (supra), P.D. Shamdasani (supra), Vidya Verma (supra) and ADM,\n\nJabalpur (supra) were rendered. The rigid interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 21</a> given by the\n\nCourts therein though have not been overruled by subsequent decisions, the\n\ndifference in opinion in respect of interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 21</a> is largely noticeable\n\nin the air and the ratio of such decisions, to my mind, have been diluted to a\n\nlarge extent by subsequent decisions. I consider Maneka Gandhi v. Union of\n\nIndia (supra) to be the first decision in a series of decided cases which broadened\n\nthe horizons of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 21.</a>\n\n      That a narrow construction of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 21</a> was placed by the Supreme Court\n\nin ADM, Jabalpur (supra) has been expressed in paragraph 448 of the decision in\n\nKartar Singh (supra), which reads as follows:\n\n\n            &quot;449. How fundamental is the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_159\">Article 21</a> of the\n            Constitution can be well appreciated when one looks at the\n            constitutional amendment made in the year 1978. By the 44th\n            <a href=\"/doc/113521647/\" id=\"a_160\">Amendment Act, 1978</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1594774/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 359</a> was amended and it was provided\n            that <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_162\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_163\">21</a> could not be suspended even during\n            emergency. The occasion for it arose due to narrow construction placed\n            by this Court in Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur v. Shivakant\n            Shukla (supra) denying a citizen his right to challenge even arbitrary\n            arrest and detention.&quot;\n\n\n\n      It is also noted that even during the sixties, with passage of time, the\n\nSupreme Court [without overruling Vidya Verma (supra)] has entertained\n\npetitions under Section 491 of the old <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_164\">Cr.P.C</a>. holding that such provision is\n                                        50\n\n\nexpressly concerned with directions of the nature of Habeas Corpus and directed\n\nmaking over custody of the infant from one parent to the other [see Gohar Begum\n\nv. Suggi alias Nazma Begum &amp; ors., AIR 1960 SC 93]. Similar course of action\n\nwas followed in Mohd. Ikram Hussain v. State of U.P. &amp; ors., AIR 1964 SC 1625.\n\n      Judicial activism has expanded the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 21</a> to such an extent\n\nthat deprivation of liberty otherwise than according to procedure established by\n\nlaw is also well within the Court&#x27;s interference now. The decision in Bodhisattwa\n\nGoutam (supra), it is noted, has been referred to with approval quite recently in\n\nDinesh v. State of Rajasthan, (2006) 3 SCC 771, where rape has been considered\n\nto be a crime not only against basic human rights but also violative of the\n\nvictim&#x27;s most cherished fundamental right, viz. the right to life contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n      Without fear of admonition, I may venture to hold that the efficacy of the\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court in A.K. Gopalan (supra), P.D. Shamdasani\n\n(supra), Vidya Verma (supra) and ADM, Jabalpur (supra) as binding precedents\n\nstand eroded in view of the radically changed socio-economic conditions of the\n\ncountry. Interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 21</a> made therein having regard to the present\n\nday socio-economic scenario of the country may not hold good. The scope and\n\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_168\">Article 21</a> having been expanded during the last three decades, the view\n\nthat protection under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_169\">Article 21</a> would not be applicable in respect of wrong\n\ndoing by a private individual does not appear to be of much relevance.\n\n      The law declared by the Supreme Court State of Punjab v. Amritsar\n\nBeverages Ltd., (2006) 7 SCC 607, in this connection may also be noted. The\n                                            51\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/160862327/\" id=\"a_170\">Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948</a> viv-a-vis advancement in information\n\ntechnology was under consideration there. The Court had the occasion to rule as\n\nfollows:\n\n           &quot;9. <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_171\">The Act</a> was enacted in the year 1948. Information technology at that\n           time far from being developed was unknown. The Constitution of India is\n           a living organ. It had been interpreted differently having regard to\n           different societal situations. [See Liverpool &amp; London S.P. &amp; I Assn. Ltd.\n           v. MV Sea Success, (2004) 9 SCC 512, Union of India v. Naveen Jindal,\n           (2004) 2 SCC 510, John Vallamattom v. Union of India, (2003) 6 SCC 611\n           and Kapila Hingorani v. State of Bihar, (2003) 6 SCC 1] Same principle is\n           applicable in respect of some statutes.\n           10. Creative interpretation had been resorted to by the Court so as to\n           achieve a balance between the age-old and rigid laws on the one hand\n           and the advanced technology, on the other. The judiciary always\n           responds to the need of the changing scenario in regard to development\n           of technologies. It uses its own interpretative principles to achieve a\n           balance when Parliament has not responded to the need to amend the\n           statute having regard to the developments in the field of science.&quot;\n\n\n      Yet again, in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Assn. of India, (2008) 3 SCC 1, the\n\nSupreme Court was considering the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/50959283/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 30</a> of the\n\nPunjab Excise Act, 1914. The Court reiterated the need to interpret the laws\n\nhaving regard to changed societal conditions as follows:\n\n           &quot;7. <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_173\">The Act</a> is a pre-constitutional legislation. Although it is saved in terms\n           of <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 372</a> of the Constitution, challenge to its validity on the\n           touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_175\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_176\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_177\">19</a> of the Constitution of India, is\n           permissible in law. While embarking on the questions raised, it may be\n           pertinent to know that a statute although could have been held to be a\n           valid piece of legislation keeping in view the societal condition of those\n           times, but with the changes occurring therein both in the domestic as also\n           in international arena, such a law can also be declared invalid.\n\n           9. Changed social psyche and expectations are important factors to be\n           considered in the upkeep of law. Decision on relevance will be more often\n           a function of time we are operating in. Primacy to such transformation in\n           constitutional rights analysis would not be out of place.****&quot;\n                                           52\n\n\n      Law not being a static concept, it is quite but natural that with passage of\n\ntime its interpretation might change to keep pace with needs of the society. In\n\nCommon Cause v. Union of India, (1999) 6 SCC 667, the Supreme Court noticed\n\nthat in its earlier decisions &#x27;Life&#x27; has been explained in a manner which has\n\ninfused &quot;LIFE&quot; in to the letters of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 21.</a>\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution being the heart of the Fundamental Rights\n\n[see Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P., (1993) 1 SCC 645] has received\n\nexpanded meaning in the following decisions:\n\n\n\n       1. Right to travel [see :Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (supra) and\n       Satwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, AIR 1967 SC 1836];\n       2.     The right to go abroad [see : Satwant Singh Sawhney v.

The right to food, shelter and clothing [see : Shantistar Builders v.\n       N.K. Totame, (1990) 1 SCC 520].\n        15. The right to free legal services/aid [see : Khatri (II) v. State of Bihar,\n       (1981) 1 SCC 627, and State of Maharashtra v. Manubhai Pragaji Vashi,\n       (1995) 5 SCC 730];\n       16. The right to primary education [see : Unni Krishnan, J.P. v.

The right to health and medical care [see : Consumer Education &amp;\n       Research Centre v. Union of India, (1995) 3 SCC 42 and State of Punjab v.\n       Mohinder Singh Chawla, (1997) 2 SCC 83];\n       18. The right to pollution-free environment [see : M.C. Mehta v. Union of\n       India, (1986) 2 SCC 176];\n       19. The right to safe drinking water [see : A.P. Pollution Control Board v.\n       Prof. M.V. Nayudu, (1999) 2 SCC 718];\n       20.    The right of a woman to work with dignity and to a working\n       environment safe and protected from sexual harassment or abuse [see :\n       Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, (1997) 6 SCC 241 and Apparel Export\n       Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra, (1999)1 SCC 759];\n       21.    The right to a quality life [see : Hinch Lal Tiwari v. Kamala Devi,\n       (2001) 6 SCC 496];\n       22.   The right to family pension [see : S.K. Mastan Bee v. G.M., South\n       Central Rly., (2003) 1 SCC 184];\n      23.    The right to reputation [see : State of Bihar v. Lal Krishna Advani,\n      (2003) 8 SCC 361, and State of Maharashtra v.

The right to reproductive choice of a woman [see : Suchita\n       Srivastava v Chandigarh Administration, (2009) 9 SCC 1].\n\n\n     It can thus be seen that the earlier narrow exposition of law has given way\n\nto a more bold, unequivocal, comprehensive and wide interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 21\n                                           54</a>\n\n\nwhich perhaps was unimaginable in the yesteryears. The interpretation so given\n\nis consistent with the rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nand the International Covenants. One cannot be oblivious of reality while\n\ninterpreting a provision, be it constitutional or statutory. The people of the\n\ncountry look up to the Courts of Law for justice and it would be gross injustice if\n\nI proceed to decline to entertain the petitions, following the old decisions which\n\nthe Supreme Court has chosen to depart from (albeit without referring to the\n\nsame).\n\n      Interestingly, while considering the case of the prisoners blinded by police\n\nofficers in Khatri (II) (supra), the Supreme Court was considering a submission\n\nmade by advocate for the State of Bihar that even if the prisoners had been\n\nblinded by the police, the State was not liable to bear compensation for violation\n\nof constitutional right.

Public order is the even tempo of\n      life of the community taking the country as a whole or even a specified\n      locality. The distinction between the areas of &#x27;law and order&#x27; and &#x27;public\n      order&#x27; is one of the degree and extent of the reach of the act in question on\n      society. It is the potentiality of the act to disturb the even tempo of life of the\n      community which makes it prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order.\n      If a contravention in its effect is confined only to a few individuals directly\n      involved as distinct from a wide spectrum of the public, it could raise\n      problem of law and order only.

The preamble of the Act further says: &#x27;whereas it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                          58</span>\n\n            expedient to re-organise the police and to make it a more efficient\n            instrument for the prevention and detection of crime, it is enacted as\n            follows&#x27;. This indicates that the police is the instrument for the\n            prevention and detection of crime which can be said to be the main\n            object and purpose of having the police. <a href=\"/doc/207919/\" id=\"a_193\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/723519/\" id=\"a_194\">25</a> lay down\n            the duties of the police officers and <a href=\"/doc/485875/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 20</a> deals with the authority\n            they can exercise. They can exercise such authority as is provided for\n            a police officer under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_196\">Police Act</a> and any Act for regulating criminal\n            procedure. The authority given to police officers must naturally be to\n            enable them to discharge their duties efficiently. Of the various duties\n            mentioned in Section 23, the more important duties are to collect and\n            communicate intelligence affecting the public peace, to prevent the\n            commission of offences and public nuisances and to detect and bring\n            offenders to justice and to apprehend all persons whom the police\n            officer is legally authorised to apprehend. It is clear, therefore, in view\n            of the nature of the duties imposed on the police officers, the nature of\n            the authority conferred and the purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_197\">Police Act</a>, that the\n            powers which the police officers enjoy are powers for the effective\n            prevention and detection of crime in order to maintain law and order.&quot;\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      The learned Judge of the Bombay High Court in Transmissions P. Ltd.\n\n(supra) noticed the decision of Lord Denning in In R. V. Metropolitan Police\n\nCommissioner, Ex parte Blackburn, wherein on the point of discretion\n\nexercisable by the police, it was observed as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            &quot;Although the chief officers of police are answerable to the law, there\n            are many fields in which they have a discretion with which the law\n            will not interfere. For instance, it is for the Commissioner of Police, or\n            the chief constable, as the case may be, to decide in any particular\n            case whether enquiries should be pursued, or whether an arrest\n            should be made, or a prosecution brought. It must be for him to decide\n            on the disposition of his force and the concentration of his resources on\n            any particular crime or area. No court can or should give him direction\n            on such a matter. He can also make policy decisions and give effect to\n            them, as, for instance, was often done when prosecutions were not\n            brought for attempted suicide; but there are some policy decisions with\n            which, I think, the courts in a case can, if necessary, interfere.\n            Suppose a chief constable were to issue a directive to his men that no\n            person should be prosecuted for stealing any goods less than $100 in\n            value. I should have thought that the court could countermand it. He\n            would be failing in his duty to enforce the law.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          59</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">      While deciding the issues that have surfaced, I would fail in my duty to\n\ndispense justice if I do not take judicial notice of the ground realities. More than\n\ntwo decades ago, the concept of presentation of writ petitions before this Court\n\nalleging &quot;police inaction&quot; was, perhaps, unknown. Now the situation has come to\n\nsuch a pass that the rules of this Court provide a separate code for &quot;police\n\ninaction&quot; matters to be heard by the learned Judge having determination of\n\nResiduary (Group IX) matters. At times writ petitions are also presented against\n\n&quot;police in action&quot; meaning thereby that the police is alleged to have exceeded its\n\njurisdiction. Non-registration of FIR despite being seized of information relating to\n\ncommission of cognizable offence, registration of complaint as FIR despite the\n\nsame not disclosing any offence or in respect of matters purely civil in nature to\n\nharass the accused, neglect or deliberate inaction to arrest despite rejection of\n\nprayer of the accused for anticipatory bail, encouraging wrongdoers to infringe\n\npeople&#x27;s rights, failure to recover missing minor girls abducted for immoral\n\npurposes, perfunctory investigation likely to aid the accused in the long run,\n\ninterference in private disputes and seeking to assume the role of a civil\n\nadjudicator, are some instances of matters brought to the judicial notice of a\n\nJudge taking up residuary matters. Number of writ petitions alleging police\n\ninaction and excess police action is swelling. Although interference by the Writ\n\nCourt to a large extent is declined either due to availability of alternative remedy\n\nor because disputed questions are involved, people continue to throng the\n\ncorridors of the High Court with an expectation that it is the temple where justice\n\nwould be available and the Court is urged to set things right. The police have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          60</span>\n\n\nbeen entrusted with the duty to secure the safety and security of the people; they\n\nare to prevent and detect crime; they are to maintain order, peace and tranquility\n\nin the area within their jurisdiction; they are the enforcers of law. Being public\n\nservants they are as much bound by the law as any other person of the street.\n\nOne vital question that normally arises in all such matters is why should the\n\npolice be accused of being partisan? Why should a disciplined force be accused of\n\nindiscipline? The answer is not far to seek. Public impression of integrity of the\n\npolice force, or for that matter other branches of administration, is not very\n\nencouraging. The impression that has gained ground is that a good chunk of the\n\npolice force and public servants in other fields are corrupt. People are taking it in\n\ntheir stride but there can be no two opinions that the nation is faced with a\n\nsevere crisis, which ought to be overcome immediately by identifying the black\n\nsheep or else ruination is imminent. So far as instances of corruption in the\n\npolice force are concerned, the same are largely noticeable when judicial review of\n\ndecisions, taken in connection with matters of disciplinary action taken against\n\nerrant police officers, is sought for. Instances of the police force being remiss or\n\nnegligent are also discernible from reports that senior police officers submit to\n\nCourt when called upon in terms of orders passed by it. Constables entrusted to\n\ncontrol vehicular traffic accepting gratification from errant drivers of vehicles in\n\nbroad daylight is a daily feature. Corruption, remissness, negligence etc. of police\n\nofficers can be traced to collusion with that section of society who use the police\n\nforce for achieving their narrow self-interest. To build up an efficient force is no\n\nmean job; it is necessary to have officers of the highest caliber which regrettably\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                         61</span>\n\n\nis lacking nowadays. It is in matters where the Court has reasonable ground to\n\nsuspect such collusion that writ powers ought to be exercised even though a\n\nprivate dispute may be at the root of the controversy that has traveled to the\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">      As noticed above, right to life has been interpreted to mean something\n\nmore than survival or animal existence; it would include the right to live with\n\nhuman dignity and that can be achieved if <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 21</a> is construed in a manner to\n\nembrace private individuals also who may violate the fundamental right of others\n\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 21</a> and get away without being penalized if he has the\n\nblessings of the police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">      In the event it is brought to the notice of a police officer that life of an\n\nindividual is under threat at the instance of another or that personal liberty of\n\none is likely to be invaded by the other and the police officer despite being under\n\nan obligation to prevent the likely commission of any cognizable offence remains\n\ninactive, a writ petition, alleging failure of the police officer to perform his\n\nstatutory duty, may lie and such writ petition does not deserve to be dismissed in\n\nlimine on the ground that the conflict of interest arises out of a pure and simple\n\nprivate family dispute or that alternative remedy under the ordinary laws are\n\navailable. If an elderly person does not survive after being threatened by his son\n\neither due to shock or the threat is translated into action, the remedies available\n\nin law would be meaningless for the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">         Similarly, if an individual without being authorized by law poses a threat\n\nto the life of another or seeks to deprive the other of his personal liberty or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                          62</span>\n\n\nintrudes on one&#x27;s privacy and the Court of Writ is approached to redress a\n\ngrievance voiced that the police has put up a show of activating itself and has not\n\ntaken legal measures at the instigation of that individual, would the Court fold its\n\nhands and deny relief? In an appropriate case, if the Court is satisfied that the\n\npolice have been colluding with one party to the detriment of the complainant,\n\nthe answer to the aforesaid question cannot but be in the affirmative.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">      As Roscoe Pound had observed, flexibility is the greatest virtue of the law\n\nCourts and as and when the situation so demands, the law Courts ought to\n\nadminister justice in accordance therewith and as per the needs of the situation.\n\nThe Courts of law exist for the society. If in a given situation the Court feels the\n\nrequirement to interfere in accordance with principles of justice, equity and good\n\nconscience, it ought to rise to the occasion for redressing the grievances of a large\n\nsection of society who due to old age and other kinds of disablement expect the\n\nCourt of Writ to uphold their human right to have access to justice and\n\nconsequently to enforce the fundamental right to life and personal liberty.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      It is elementary law that an alternative remedy is not a bar to entertain a\n\nwrit petition and, in any event, a writ petitioner ought not to be relegated to the\n\nalternative forum when he complains of breach of the most fundamental of all\n\nfundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, i.e. the protection of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 21.</a> The decision in Aleque Padamsee (supra) and other previous decisions\n\nreferred to therein did not pertain to complaints from persons threatened with\n\ninvasion of their right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 21.</a> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"747596\" id=\"span_12\">Having regard to the law\n\ndeclared in <a href=\"/doc/747596/\" id=\"a_202\">Haryana Financial Corporation v.

The power of the Court ranges\n\nfrom testing the validity of legislation enacted by Parliament/Legislature and to\n\nstrike it down if found ultra vires; to lay down guidelines in the absence of\n\nlegislation on a particular point and to direct that such guidelines would operate\n\nas law till such time appropriate legislation is enacted; to interfere with policy\n\ndecisions of the executive if the same are found to be unreasonable or contrary to\n\nstatutory provision; to quash criminal proceedings in exceptional cases to\n\nprevent miscarriage of justice; to award compensation to victims of custodial\n\nviolence and so on and so forth. The length and width of the powers conferred by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 226</a> need not be dilated elaborately here since the same are well-\n\nrecognized. It must, however, be borne in mind that in exercise of Writ\n\nJurisdiction, the Courts are obliged to promote justice and not to defeat it. The\n\nJudges must be sensitive to the needs of the hour and would be justified in\n\nfinding out ways and means for imparting justice through legal measures to\n\nthose classes of persons who find their lives to be mutilated by the cruel hands of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                          64</span>\n\n\ndestiny.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      At the same time, the Courts ought also to bear in mind that a private\n\nindividual accused of violating the right guaranteed to another under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 21</a> is\n\nas much entitled to the same right as the complainant in addition to his\n\nentitlement to equal protection of the laws. In exercising its vast jurisdiction, the\n\nCourts ought not to be swayed by passing passions, populist sentiments or\n\nmisplaced sympathy. The power exercisable is extraordinary and, therefore, it is\n\nonly in extraordinary cases of violation of fundamental and statutory rights that\n\nthe Court would unfold itself and exercise the power to issue prerogative writs.\n\nNo wonder, the Courts have evolved restrictions, by now well accepted by judicial\n\ndecisions as the self-imposed restrictions, keeping in mind the principle that\n\nwider the power the authority enjoys the more circumspect it must be while\n\nexercising those powers. As cautioned in Chandra Bhan Dubey (supra), a Writ\n\nCourt does not act like a proverbial &#x27;bull in the china shop&#x27;. It is, therefore, up to\n\nthe Court before whom the lis is brought to consider the rival claims in\n\naccordance with well-recognized principles of self-imposed restrictions and to\n\ndecide whether interference is at all necessary or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">      Keeping pace with the needs of changing society, the Parliament has\n\nintroduced two enactments of late in respect of two separate classes at the\n\nreceiving end, viz. (i) women and (ii) parents and senior citizens.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">      The first of these is the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_205\">DV Act</a> introduced in 2005 to protect women from\n\ndomestic violence. The other is the 2007 Act. These enactments, containing a list\n\nof do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts, seek to redefine the facets of human life in present day\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                          65</span>\n\n\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">      I am of the clear opinion that rights traceable in the said statutes when\n\nexercised by the victims of deprivation and proceedings are pending before the\n\nappropriate forum, it would not be sound exercise of discretion to interfere on a\n\nwrit petition and seek to determine rights of parties. That would amount to a\n\nparallel remedy being pursued, which ordinarily is legally impermissible.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      Any discussion on the topic of &quot;police inaction&quot; vis-à-vis exercise of writ\n\npowers would be incomplete without reference to certain other decisions of the\n\nSupreme Court having some bearing on the issue at hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732085\" id=\"span_16\">The first of these is <a href=\"/doc/1732085/\" id=\"a_206\">Mohd.

While\n\nreiterating that writ remedy is a remedy in public law and explaining general\n\nprinciples governing exercise of writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 226</a>, the Supreme\n\nCourt observed that the jurisdiction being extra-ordinary in nature it is not\n\nmeant for declaring private rights of parties.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">      Mohan Pandey &amp; anr. v. Smt. Usha Rani Rajgaria &amp; ors., AIR 1993 SC\n\n1225, is the next. The Supreme Court was considering an appeal against an\n\norder passed by the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. The\n\nrespondents in the appeal had been successful in invoking the writ jurisdiction\n\nfor enforcement of a private right to immovable property against the appellants\n\ndespite the fact that pendency of a civil suit between the parties was known to\n\nthe High Court. While allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court held in paragraph\n\n6 as follows :\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                         66</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     &quot;6. Mr Arun Jaitley, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent 1\n     has supported the impugned judgment on the ground that prayer for issuing\n     a direction against Delhi Administration and Commissioner of Police who\n     were respondents 1 and 2 was also made. It has to be appreciated that the\n     present appellants were respondents 3 and 4 before the High Court; and the\n     High Court has by the impugned order, considered it fit to allow the prayer of\n     the respondents against them for removal of the grills for access to the\n     backyard. According to the stand of the landlord-respondent, since the police\n     were taking a partisan attitude against her, the filing of a writ petition\n     became necessary. We are unable to follow this argument. There is no doubt\n     that the dispute is between two private persons with respect to an\n     immovable property. Further, a suit covering either directly a portion of the\n     house-property which is in dispute in the present case or in any event some\n     other parts of the same property is already pending in the civil court. The\n     respondent justifies the step of her moving the High Court with a writ petition\n     on the ground of some complaint made by the appellants and the action by\n     the police taken thereon. We do not agree that on account of this\n     development, the respondent was entitled to maintain a writ petition before\n     the High Court. It has repeatedly been held by this Court as also by various\n     High Courts that a regular suit is the appropriate remedy for settlement of\n     disputes relating to property rights between private persons and that the\n     remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_209\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution shall not be available except\n     where violation of some statutory duty on the part of a statutory authority is\n     alleged. And in such a case, the Court will issue appropriate direction to the\n     authority concerned. If the real grievance of the respondent is against the\n     initiation of criminal proceedings, and the orders passed and steps taken\n     thereon, she must avail of the remedy under the general law including the\n     <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_210\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>. The High Court cannot allow the constitutional\n     jurisdiction to be used for deciding disputes, for which remedies, under the\n     general law, civil or criminal, are available. It is not intended to replace the\n     ordinary remedies by way of a suit or application available to a litigant. The\n     jurisdiction is special and extraordinary and should not be exercised\n     casually or lightly. We, therefore, hold that the High Court was in error in\n     issuing the impugned direction against the appellants by their judgment\n     under appeal. The appeal is accordingly allowed, the impugned judgment is\n     set aside and the writ petition of the respondents filed in the High Court is\n     dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                        (underlining for emphasis by me)\n\n     The other decision is P.R. Murlidharan (supra) referred to above, where a\n\ndispute arose as to whether the respondent was entitled to continue in the\n\ncapacity of Madathipathi and Sthiradhyakshan of a particular Sangh. A suit filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                          67</span>\n\n\nearlier by the respondent for declaration that he was entitled to continue was\n\ndismissed for default. The application for restoration was also dismissed. After\n\nsuch dismissal, he filed a writ petition praying for police protection. The High\n\nCourt while allowing the prayer observed that the respondent was entitled to hold\n\nthe said office and that the State and the police officials were under a legal\n\nobligation to give protection to his life and properties. The appeal was allowed by\n\nthe Supreme Court. Hon&#x27;ble S.B. Sinha, J.

It is one thing to say that in a given case a person may be held to\n            be entitled to police protection, having regard to the threat perception,\n            but it is another thing to say that he is entitled thereto for holding an\n            office and discharging certain functions when his right to do so is open\n            to question. A person could not approach the High Court for the\n            purpose of determining such disputed questions of fact which were\n            beyond the scope and purport of the jurisdiction of the High Court\n            while exercising writ jurisdiction as it also involved determination of\n            disputed questions of fact. Respondent 1 who sought to claim a status\n            was required to establish the same in a court of law in an appropriate\n            proceeding. He for one reason or the other, failed to do so. The\n            provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_211\">Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a> stare on his\n            face. He, therefore, could not have filed a writ petition for getting the\n            selfsame issues determined in his favour which he could not do even\n            by filing a suit. Indeed the jurisdiction of the writ court is wide while\n            granting relief to a citizen of India so as to protect his life and liberty\n            as adumbrated under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, but while doing so\n            it could not collaterally go into that question, determination whereof\n            would undoubtedly be beyond its domain. What was necessary for\n            determination of the question arising in the writ petition was not the\n            interpretation of the documents alone, but it required adduction of oral\n            evidence as well. Such evidence was necessary for the purpose of\n            explaining the true nature of the deed of trust, as also the practice\n            followed by this trust. In any event, the impleading applicant herein,\n            as noticed hereinbefore, has raised a contention that he alone was\n            ordained to hold the said office as per the bye-laws of the trust. The\n            qualification of the first respondent to hold the office was also in\n            question. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that such\n            disputed questions could not have been gone into by the High Court in\n            a writ proceeding.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">                                         (underlining for emphasis by me)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                          68</span>\n\n\n     Hon&#x27;ble P.K.

A writ petition under the guise of seeking a writ of mandamus\n           directing the police authorities to give protection to a writ petitioner,\n           cannot be made a forum for adjudicating on civil rights. It is one thing\n           to approach the High Court, for issuance of such a writ on a plea that\n           a particular party has not obeyed a decree or an order of injunction\n           passed in favour of the writ petitioner, was deliberately flouting that\n           decree or order and in spite of the petitioner applying for it, or that the\n           police authorities are not giving him the needed protection in terms of\n           the decree or order passed by a court with jurisdiction. But, it is quite\n           another thing to seek a writ of mandamus directing protection in\n           respect of property, status or right which remains to be adjudicated\n           upon and when such an adjudication can only be got done in a\n           properly instituted civil suit. It would be an abuse of process for a writ\n           petitioner to approach the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 226</a> of the\n           Constitution seeking a writ of mandamus directing the police\n           authorities to protect his claimed possession of a property without first\n           establishing his possession in an appropriate civil court. The\n           temptation to grant relief in cases of this nature should be resisted by\n           the High Court. The wide jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 226</a> of the\n           Constitution would remain effective and meaningful only when it is\n           exercised prudently and in appropriate situations.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">           18. In the case on hand, various disputed questions arose based on a\n           deed of trust and the facts pleaded by the writ petitioner and\n           controverted by the other side. The High Court should have normally\n           directed the writ petitioner to have his rights adjudicated upon, in an\n           appropriate suit in a civil court. The fact that a writ petitioner may be\n           barred from approaching the civil court, in view of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_215\">Order 9 Rule 9 of\n           the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, or some other provisions, is no ground for\n           the High Court to take upon itself, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 226</a> of the\n           Constitution, the duty to adjudicate on the civil rights of parties for the\n           purpose of deciding whether a writ of mandamus could be issued to\n           the police authorities for the protection of the alleged rights of the writ\n           petitioner. A writ of mandamus directing the police authorities to give\n           protection to the person of a writ petitioner can be issued, when the\n           court is satisfied that there is a threat to his person and the authorities\n           have failed to perform their duties and it is different from granting\n           relief for the first time to a person either to allegedly protect his right to\n           property or his right to an office, especially when the pleadings\n           themselves disclose that disputed questions are involved. My learned\n           Brother has rightly pointed out that the High Court was in error in\n           proceeding to adjudicate on the rights and obligations arising out of\n           the trust deed merely based on the affidavits and the deed itself. I\n           fully agree with my learned Brother that the High Court should not\n           have undertaken such an exercise on the basis that the right of the\n           writ petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_217\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is sought to be\n           affected by the actions of the contesting respondents and their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                          69</span>\n\n            supporters and that can be prevented by the issue of the writ of\n            mandamus prayed for.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            19. A writ for &quot;police protection&quot; so-called, has only a limited scope, as,\n            when the court is approached for protection of rights declared by a\n            decree or by an order passed by a civil court. It cannot be extended to\n            cases where rights have not been determined either finally by the civil\n            court or, at least at an interlocutory stage in an unambiguous manner,\n            and then too in furtherance of the decree or order.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                                          (underlining for emphasis by me)\n\n\n      The principles (emerging from the aforesaid decisions and discussions and\n\nthe submissions of learned amicus curiae and learned counsel) that the Court\n\nought to bear in mind while deciding allegations of police inaction in respect of\n\nalleged violation of rights to life and of liberty as well as property may be\n\nsummarized as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            a.

State of W.B. &amp; ors.)\n\n\n\n      The petitioner is the mother of the respondent no.5, aged about 65 years.\n\nFor reasons mentioned in the writ petition she is constrained to reside in the\n\nmatrimonial home of her daughter. It has been alleged in the petition that the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s husband and the father of the respondent no.5 died testate on\n\n2.1.2009. The residential house at 120D, Linton Street, Kolkata 700014 was\n\nbequeathed in favour of the petitioner. Coming to learn thereof the respondent\n\nno.5 started pressurising the petitioner to convey title thereof in his favour.\n\nRefusal to accede to the request was followed by physical and mental torture. The\n\npetitioner requested her daughter and son-in-law to dissuade the respondent\n\nno.5 from indulging in pressurising her, but to no avail. Gradually, the degree of\n\ntorture on the petitioner was increased. Apart from abusing the petitioner, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                         74</span>\n\n\nrespondent no.5 slapped her with his slipper. The petitioner was made to work as\n\nmaid in her own house and to perform all household chores. The respondent\n\nno.5 started bringing pork while the petitioner used to take meal, knowing fully\n\nwell that being a Hindu widow she would not be able to tolerate the same. Other\n\nacts of cruelty have been mentioned which need not be elaborated. Suffice to say\n\nthat the respondent no.5 made the life of the petitioner miserable for which she\n\nhad to take shelter in her daughter&#x27;s matrimonial home. The petitioner had\n\napplied for probate of the will of her late husband. Served with notice of such\n\nproceedings, the respondent no.5 broke the padlock on the bedroom of the\n\npetitioner and started assaulting her brutally. The petitioner complained to the\n\npolice authorities on 12.1.2010. It is further alleged that the respondent no.5\n\npoured water on the body of the petitioner and disconnected the geyser forcing\n\nher to take her bath with cold water and made her to sleep on wet bed. A further\n\ncomplaint dated 5.2.2010 was lodged. It is alleged that the police officers of the\n\nlocal police station apart from calling the respondent no.5 and warning him did\n\nnot act in accordance with law by not taking cognizance of the complaint lodged\n\nby the petitioner. Feeling aggrieved thereby, this petition has been presented with\n\na prayer for ordering the respondents 1 to 4 to take immediate action on the\n\nbasis of such complaints lodged by the petitioner and to command the\n\nrespondent no.5 to allow her to stay at the said residential premises and not to\n\ncreate any disturbances in any manner whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">      The respondent no.5 was represented by learned advocate. It has been\n\nsubmitted on his behalf that the petitioner has left the said premises on her own\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                          75</span>\n\n\nvolition. He has denied the allegation of torture. According to him, if the police\n\nhas not acted on the basis of the complaint lodged by the petitioner the Court of\n\nWrit instead of interfering ought to direct the petitioner to pursue her remedy\n\nunder                                                                         the\n\nCr. P.C. He has, however, not disputed the petitioner&#x27;s right of residence. It has\n\nalso been submitted by him that the petitioner did not disclose in the petition\n\nthat proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/80360/\" id=\"a_227\">Section 144(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. was initiated by her which\n\nhas since been dropped and filed by an order dated 9.9.2009.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">        Written instructions furnished by the Officer-in-Charge, Beniapukur Police\n\nStation to Mr. Rajdeep Biswas, learned advocate for the State, has been placed\n\nbefore the Court.

The situation worsened when the petitioner applied for probate before\n\nthe Civil Court. The respondent no.5 has been contesting such application. Apart\n\nfrom a cursory reference to resolve the dispute between the petitioner and the\n\nrespondent no.5 through counseling on one occasion, there appears to be no\n\nindication as to how the complaints lodged by the petitioner have been dealt with\n\nby the officer-in-charge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">        I have perused the complaints annexed to the petition.

Since the\n\nrespondent no.5 has not disputed the petitioner&#x27;s right of residence, the\n\npetitioner shall be at liberty to inform the said Officer-in-Charge the date on and\n\nfrom which she would like to return and to continue to stay thereat. Once such\n\ninformation   is   received,   the   said   Officer-in-Charge   shall   extend   utmost\n\ncooperation and appropriate assistance, as is warranted in the circumstances, so\n\nthat the petitioner may henceforth live peacefully and without any disturbance\n\nfrom the side of the respondent no.5. The respondent no.5 shall restrain himself\n\nfrom indulging in any act which is a cause of concern for the petitioner and\n\naffects her dignity and if any subsequent complaint is lodged against him by the\n\npetitioner disclosing commission of offence punishable under the penal laws, the\n\npolice shall immediately take action.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">      There shall be no order as to costs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                        77</span><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n\n\n\nW.P.

Refusal to accede to such\n\nrequest resulted in manhandling of the petitioner no.2 by the respondent no.6 by\n\nfists and blows.

The petitioner is\n\nafter threatened for money and assaulted physically if money is not given.\n\nSometimes circumstances compelled the petitioner to accede to the requirement\n\nof the respondent no.4. He further complains of pressure being created by the\n\nrespondent no.4 to transfer the house property in his favour.

Out of love and affection the petitioners did not lodge any complaint with\n\nthe police initially but since the degree of torture increased day by day and\n\nforcible possession of the shop room was taken by the respondent no.4, a diary\n\nwas lodged with the local police station on 8.6.2009.

Feeling aggrieved thereby,\n\nthe petitioner has prayed for order on the respondent no.3 to protect his life and\n\nproperty on the basis of the various complaints including the one dated\n\n10.2.2010.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">      The private respondent was unpresented despite despatch of copy of the\n\nwrit petition by registered post.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">      Instructions furnished by the Officer-in-Charge, Habra Police Station to the\n\nlearned advocate for the State reveals existence of a long pending dispute\n\nbetween the father and the elder son. The allegation of torture could not be\n\nsubstantiated. The reason therefor is that the petitioner and the private\n\nrespondent reside in separate mess. At the same time, apprehending breach of\n\npeace over the issue, prosecution against the private respondent and his wife\n\nhave been submitted under <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_251\">Section 107</a> of the Cr.P.C. for maintaining peace vide\n\nPR No.56/2010 dated 22.2.2010. The respondent no.4 and his wife have been\n\nasked not to inflict any torture on the petitioner and to maintain peace.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">      From the writ petition it does not appear that the private respondent has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                           93</span>\n\n\nphysically harmed the petitioner. The allegations are vague and based thereon no\n\npositive direction on the police can be given. However, the police authorities are\n\ndirected to maintain peace in and around the residences of the petitioner and the\n\nprivate respondent. They shall further ensure that as a result of the ongoing\n\ndispute, there is no loss of life and limbs. If at all any complaint is received by the\n\npolice authorities in future from the petitioner disclosing commission of\n\ncognizable offence, they shall proceed to discharge their statutory duty without\n\ncompelling the petitioner to knock the doors of the Court for justice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"12655987\" id=\"span_50\">The writ petition stands disposed of, without any order for costs.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.15344 (W) of 2009 (<a href=\"/doc/12655987/\" id=\"a_252\">Manindra Nath Santra v. State of W.B.</a> &amp; ors.)\n\n\n\n      The petitioner is a septuagenarian and father of three sons and a daughter.\n\nHe claims to have spent his earnings for bringing up his children and also for\n\nconstruction of a dwelling house at Bhabanipore in the North 24 Parganas under</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">Police Station Bishnupur. The eldest son is a daily labourer and, therefore,\n\nunable to maintain the petitioner. His second son is in private employment and\n\nstaying at Kharagpur. The younger son is a school teacher and his wife is also a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                          94</span>\n\n\nteacher in an Anganwari Kendra, both of whom reside with the petitioner. It is\n\nalleged in paragraph 7 that the younger son being a member of the local gram\n\npanchayat drove the petitioner and his wife out of their dwelling house and\n\nforcefully occupied the rooms of the petitioner. Also the belongings were thrown\n\nout. The petitioner and his wife have now been forced to take shelter at the cow-\n\nshed rooms since 2006. It is further pleaded that the ouster of the petitioner and\n\nhis wife were brought to the notice of the local gram panchayat as well as the\n\nlocal police station but to no avail. Proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/80360/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 144(2)</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C. were initiated. Ultimately, on 9.1.2009 the gram panchayat had convened\n\na meeting for amicable settlement of the dispute between the petitioner and his\n\nyounger son but the younger son denied to cooperate and, as such, the matter\n\ncould not proceed further. On 31.7.2009, a complaint was lodged which was\n\ndiarised vide GDE 2594 dated 31.7.2009. It appears from the complaint that a\n\nprayer was made before the Officer-in-Charge to ensure that the petitioner and\n\nhis wife could return to his home and spend the rest of his life peacefully.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      The respondents 4 and 5, being the younger son of the petitioner and his\n\nwife, have not appeared before this Court despite despatch of copy of writ petition\n\nby registered post.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      Written instructions furnished to the learned advocate for the State by the\n\nInspector-in-Charge, Bishnupur Police Station have been placed. It appears\n\ntherefrom that prosecution was submitted against the respondents 5 and 6\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 107</a> of the Cr.P.C. They appeared before the learned Sub-\n\nDivisional Judicial Magistrate on 29.10.2009 as well as on 1.3.2010. So far as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                          95</span>\n\n\nthe allegation of ouster is concerned, it appears that the respondents 5 and 6\n\nremoved the petitioner from the room which was being occupied by him and\n\nshifted him to a smaller room. The petitioner did not wish to occupy the smaller\n\nroom and insisted that he would stay in the room so long being occupied by him.\n\nSince his request was not accepted by the respondents 5 and 6, he started\n\nstaying in a &#x27;kacha&#x27; room which was being used as cow-shed long back. The\n\nallegations of police inaction have been disputed and reference has been made to\n\nthe prosecution that had been submitted against the respondents 5 and 6 under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_255\">Section 107</a> of the Cr.P.C.

State of W.B. &amp; ors.)\n\n\n\n      Parents of the respondent no.4 are the petitioners before this Court\n\ncomplaining of inaction of the police to mitigate their sufferings inflicted by him.\n\nIt appears that trouble started in the life of the petitioners after the respondent\n\nno.4 was given in marriage to the respondent no.5. After 2005, the respondents 4\n\nand 5 decided to live in the same house but in a different mess. The petitioners\n\ndid not object since they did not want to snatch the roof over the heads of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                           97</span>\n\n\nrespondents 4 and 5. Gradually, the respondents 4 and 5 started pressurising\n\nthe petitioners to transfer the house property in their name as well as to transfer\n\nthe proprietorship business of the petitioner no.1 in favour of the respondent\n\nno.4. Unable to bear the pressure mounted by the respondent no.4, the\n\npetitioners were compelled to complain to the police authorities at Pandua in\n\nrespect of unlawful acts. This was followed by proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 144</a> of\n\nthe Cr.P.C. before the learned Executive Magistrate, Hooghly. The police\n\nauthorities refused to act citing the dispute to be civil in nature which\n\nemboldened the respondents 4 and 5 to enhance the extent of torture finding\n\nthat the police would not act on the complaint, the petitioner no.2 initiated\n\nproceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1373165/\" id=\"a_258\">Section 12</a> of the DV Act.          It is further pleaded that the\n\nProtection Officer under the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_259\">DV Act</a> has filed a report dated 12.2.2009 finding\n\nmerit in the application filed by the petitioner no.2.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      As a counter blast, the respondent no.5 more than 7 years after her\n\nmarriage with the respondent no.4 has filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 156(3)</a>\n\nof the Cr.P.C. before the learned Judicial Magistrate, Asansol alleging offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code. The case and the\n\ncounter case are pending. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the Court of Writ\n\nhas been approached by the petitioners with a prayer to direct the police to stop\n\nphysical torture and threat at the instance of the respondent nos. 4 and 5 and to\n\ninitiate criminal proceedings against them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      Respondents 4 and 5 have refused to accept copy of the writ petition\n\ntendered to them as it appears from the affidavit of service.

Since the Protection\n\nOfficer has already enquired into the complaint of the petitioner no.2 and\n\nsubmitted his report before the Judicial Magistrate, 2nd Court, Sadar, Hooghly,\n\nlaw shall take its own course. Any observation, if made herein, is likely to affect\n\nthe merits of such proceedings and, therefore, I decline to give any positive\n\ndirection to the police to prevent the respondents 4 and 5 from acting in offensive\n\nmanner. Needless to observe, the police shall ensure that the right to life of the\n\npetitioners is not endangered by the respondents 4 and 5 so long the proceedings\n\nare not concluded according to law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      The writ petition stands disposed of, without any order for costs.\n\n\n\n\nW.P. 9389 (W) of 2010 (Sankar Kumar Chatterjee &amp; anr. v.

The\n\npolice do not appear to have taken any positive action until 5.5.2010. It is only\n\nafter a day of presentation of this petition that it submitted prosecution. The duty\n\nthe police owe to the petitioners was not duly discharged. Accordingly, it is\n\ndirected that so long the petitioners are alive, the police shall ensure that the\n\nprivate respondents do not indulge in overt acts and cause disturbance in the\n\npetitioners&#x27; day to day life. Every possible step shall be taken to protect the\n\npetitioners&#x27; right to life.

Inspite of such undertaking, the respondent no.8 continued to trouble the\n\npetitioners with the help of some antisocials. Finding no other alternative, the\n\npetitioner no.1 on 26.3.2009 submitted an application before the Sub-Divisional\n\nOfficer, Uluberia, Howrah, seeking administrative protection from the said\n\nauthority.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">      It is further claimed that on 24.4.2009, the respondents 7, 9 and 10\n\nentered the house of the petitioners and beat up the petitioner no.2. After this\n\nincident, the petitioner no.2 had to be treated in the Sub-Divisional Hospital and\n\nan injury report was issued by the attending doctor. On the self same day, the\n\npetitioners lodged a complaint with the Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Uluberia\n\nand Sub-Divisional Officer, Uluberia complaining about the reign of terror\n\nunleashed on them by the respondents 7, 8, 9 and 10 and their men and agents.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">      On 2.6.2009, the petitioners lodged a complaint with Uluberia Police\n\nStation alleging that respondent no.7 locked one of the residential rooms of the\n\npetitioners on R.S. Plot no.125 and drove them out of the said room but the\n\npolice officials refused to record such complaint.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">      On 1.6.2010, the younger son of the petitioners lodged a complaint before\n\nthe Sub-Divisional Officer, Uluberia praying that the petitioners stayed at their\n\nresidential house peacefully may be ensured.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">      When both the Sub-Divisional Officer, Uluberia and the Sub-Divisional\n\nPolice Officer, Uluberia did not pay heed to the application filed by the\n\npetitioners&#x27; younger son, he filed an application before the District Magistrate for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                         103</span>\n\n\ntaking necessary action by breaking the padlock of the door put by respondent\n\nno.7 so that the petitioners may stay there peacefully.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">       However, despite approaching the police officers for breaking open the\n\npadlock so as to enable the petitioners to stay there, no action was initiated.\n\nSince then, the petitioners have been running from pillar to post without the\n\ndesired result having yielded. Finding no other alternative, this petition dated\n\n30.3.2010 has been presented before this Court, inter alia, praying for direction\n\non the respondents/police officers to investigate the complaints lodged against\n\nthe respondents 7 to 10 as well as to remove the padlock of the room at plot\n\nno.125 and to put the petitioners in possession thereof by rendering necessary\n\nassistance.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_84\">       It also appears from the petition that the petitioner no.1 addressed a\n\nrepresentation dated 15.2.2010 to the District Magistrate Howrah complaining of\n\ninvolvement of Sri Tanmoy Bhattacharya, A.S.I. The said representation was\n\nforwarded to the Superintendent of Police, Howrah for conducting an enquiry into\n\nsuch complaint. The Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural), Howrah on\n\n12.3.2010 sent a message to the petitioner no.1 requesting him to attend his\n\noffice chamber on 16.3.2010 in connection with an enquiry. It is, however,\n\nalleged that the said police officer did not meet the petitioners when they went to\n\nhis office.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">       None appeared for the private respondent no.7 despite service as it appears\n\nfrom the affidavit-of-service.

It appears therefrom that few days after their\n\nmarriage, respondents 7 and 8 jointly started creating pressure upon the\n\npetitioner no.1 and insisted on handing over share of the property to them which\n\nwas flatly refused by the petitioner no.1. This led to differences between them. It\n\nappears therefrom that both the petitioner no.1 and the respondent no.7 are\n\ndesperate and dangerous and have no respect for each other. More than a year\n\nback prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 107</a> of the Cr.P.C. was submitted against both of\n\nthem. No evidence was found against A.S.I.

The police observed that the dispute between the\n\npetitioner no.1 and the respondent no.7 is civil in nature.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">      The petitioners have relied on an order dated 11.12.2009 passed by a\n\nlearned Judge of this Court directing the police authorities to provide necessary\n\nassistance to the petitioner therein so that she could stay at her residence\n\npeacefully. It was also observed therein that if any obstruction is created by the\n\nprivate respondents, the police officers would take stern action in the matter.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">      In so far as the prayer of the petitioners as reflected in prayer (b) of the\n\npetition is concerned, I do not consider it proper to make any order to that effect.\n\nThe police are not supposed to interfere in civil dispute; therefore, it shall be\n\nopen to the petitioners to seek relief by pursuing the channel of civil litigation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">      I have considered the order of this Court dated 11.12.2009 <a href=\"/doc/12655987/\" id=\"a_264\">referred to\n\nabove</a>.

Prior to filing this writ petition on 24.3.2010, the\n\npetitioner appears to have approached the said officer-in-charge once again on\n\n10.3.2010. The petitioner referred to earlier complaint which was diarised vide\n\nGDE No.1793 dated 21.2.2010 and the fact that the respondent no.3 has not\n\nbeen abiding by a settlement which had been arrived at between the parties. The\n\npetitioner sought for advice from the said officer-in-charge as to how and in what\n\nmanner he could divest the respondent no.3 of his property.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">        None has appeared for the said officer-in-charge despite despatch of copy\n\nof the writ petition by registered post on 29.3.2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">        I have heard learned advocate for the petitioner and the respondent no.3.\n\nOn perusal of the petitioner&#x27;s representation dated 10.3.2010, I do not find that\n\nthe same refers to any offence having been committed by the respondent no.3.\n\nLearned advocate for the respondent no.3 is right in his submission that the\n\npetitioner had sought for an advice from the said officer-in-charge and that there\n\nis no allegation of commission of offence by the respondent no.3 in the recent\n\npast.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                         110</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">      The petitioner has prayed for an order on the police authority to consider\n\nthe complaint lodged by him dated 31.3.2009.

Having perused the\n\ncontents of the writ petition, it appears to me that strained relationship between\n\nthe petitioner and the respondent no.3 has resulted in the former presenting in\n\nthe petition out of anguish. In the event the said officer-in-charge has not\n\ntendered advice to the petitioner in terms of his request dated 31.3.2010, a writ\n\npetition would not lie since it is no part of the duty of the Officer-in-Charge of a\n\npolice station to advice on matters pertaining to civil law.

Follow up steps taken by the petitioner\n\nby addressing further representation dated 6.2.2010 to various administrative\n\nauthorities not having yielded any result, this petition dated 8.3.2010 was\n\npresented, inter alia, praying for order on the official respondents to extend\n\nnecessary protection so that the petitioner can reside in his own house.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">      There is no proof of service on the respondent no.8.

The dispute primarily centers\n\non withdrawal of maturity proceeds from the said accounts. It has been alleged\n\nby the petitioner that the respondent no.6 has fraudulently withdrawn the\n\nproceeds to her utter prejudice and detriment. It has also been alleged that the\n\nrespondent no.6 had been inflicting severe torture on the petitioner for which she\n\nlodged a complaint with the Officer-in-Charge, Shyampukur Police Station dated\n\n20.2.2010 biut no fruitful action yielded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_130\">      The petition has been opposed by Mr. Biswaroop Bhattacharya, learned\n\nadvocate for the respondent no.6. According to him, someone else has provoked\n\nthe petitioner to file the writ petition and money is the only consideration. He has\n\nreferred to the reply sent by the respondent no.6 upon receipt of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nlawyer&#x27;s notice dated 19.12.2009. The respondent no.6 claimed that the\n\ninvestments   were    made    by   him    out   of   his   own   earning   and   the\n\ncertificates/receipts were all along with him. Since the accounts could be\n\noperated by either of the account holders or the survivor, no wrong was\n\ncommitted by the respondent no.6 in withdrawing the maturity proceeds. Mr.\n\nBhattacharya, however, denied that the respondent no.6 is not looking after his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                           116</span>\n\n\nmother or that he has been torturing her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_131\">      From the written instructions furnished to the learned advocate for the\n\nState, it appears that the petitioner is the step mother of the respondent no.6.\n\nThe respondent no.6 happens to be a teacher.

It is the\n\nrespondent no.6 who on maturity of the accounts has been withdrawing the\n\nproceeds.. Enquiry further revealed that the wife of the respondent no.6 lodged a\n\ncomplaint against the petitioner alleging torture. However, nothing has been\n\nstated in such instructions regarding the action taken by the police on the basis\n\nof the complaints of the petitioner dated 18.12.2009 and 20.2.2010.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">      I have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">      Considering the contents of the writ petition, I do not find any reason to\n\ninterfere.
