After the said\n\n                    meeting, the third accused called the fourth accused and told that the first\n\n                    accused demanded a disclosure of Rs.12 crores and the same was confirmed\n\n                    by the fifth accused to the fourth accused, namely his father.

It is\n\n                    also evident from the above circumstances that in cases of corruption at high\n\n                    places, economic and organised crimes, conspiracies are hatched in the most\n\n                    secretive manners.

The expression “public emergency” has not been\n\n                    defined in the statute.
