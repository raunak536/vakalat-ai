Noise is more than just a nuisance. It constitutes a real\n        and present danger to people&#x27;s health. Day and night, at home,\n\n\n\n\n                                 of\n        at work, and at play, noise can produce serious physical and\n        psychological stress. No one is immune to this stress. Though\n        we seem to adjust to noise by ignoring it, the ear, in fact, never\n          rt\n        closes and the body still responds-sometimes with extreme\n        tension, as to a strange sound in the night.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">        16.      Noise is a type of atmospheric pollution. It is a shadowy\n        public enemy whose growing menace has increased in the\n        modern       age    of    industrialization      and       technological\n\n\n\n        advancement. Although a soft rhythmic sound in the form of\n        music and dance stimulates brain activities, removes boredom\n\n\n\n\n        and fatigue, but its excessiveness may prove detrimental to\n        living things. Researches have proved that a loud noise during\n\n\n\n\n\n        peak marketing hours creates tiredness, irritation and impairs\n        brain activities so as to reduce thinking and working abilities.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        Noise pollution was previously confined to a few special areas\n        like factory or mill, but today it engulfs every nook and corner of\n        the globe, reaching its peak in urban areas. Industries,\n        automobiles, rail engines, aeroplanes, radios, loudspeakers,\n        tape recorders, lottery ticket sellers, hawkers, pop singers, etc.,\n        are the main ear contaminators of the city area and its market\n        place. The regular rattling of engines and intermittent blowing of\n        horns emanating from the caravan of automobiles do not allow\n        us to have any respite from irritant noise even in suburban\n        zones.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">        17.
