The Transfer Petitions in these proceedings are allowed.\n\n\n2.

The term ‘union between queer persons’ or similar terms have been used to\n\nmean relationship between parties where one or both of them have an atypical\n\ngender identity or sexual orientation.\n\n\nA.        Background\n\n\n          i.   The decision of this Court in Navtej Singh Johar\n\n\n4.        <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code 1860 1 criminalizes “carnal intercourse\n\nagainst the order of nature.” History is replete with instances of the State having\n\nused the provision to rip-off the dignity and autonomy of individuals who engaged\n\nin sexual activity with persons of the same sex. 2 A colonial provision which\n\nreflected Victorian morality continued in the statute after Independence. Section\n\n377 was also weaponized against gender non-conforming persons. 3 Intimate\n\nrelationships and activities were subject to public ridicule and judicial scrutiny. By\n\ncriminalizing sexual behavior of homosexual and gender non-conforming persons,\n\nthe State stripped them of their identity and personhood. Those who defied the\n\nmandate of the law and dodged prosecution were socially ostracized.\n\n\n\n\n1 “<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a>”\n2 Meharban Nowshirwan Irani v. Emperor, AIR 1934 Sind. 206\n3 Queen Empress v. Khairati, ILR (1884) 6 All 204\n\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\f                                                                              PART A\n\n5.      In Naz Foundation v. Government of NCTD 4, a Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt of Delhi read down <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 377</a> of the IPC to exclude consensual\n\nhomosexual sexual activity between adults. On appeal, a two-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt in Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation 5 reversed the judgment of\n\nthe High Court of Delhi. A writ petition seeking to declare the right to sexuality, the\n\nright to sexual autonomy, and the right to choice of a sexual partner as a part of\n\nthe rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and to declare <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n\n377</a> of the IPC to be unconstitutional was listed before a three-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt. The petitioners argued that the matter must be referred to a five-Judge\n\nBench in view of the decisions of this Court in National Legal Services Authority\n\nv. Union of India6 and Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) v. Union of India. 7 In\n\nNALSA (supra), this Court held that the state must recognize persons who fall\n\noutside the male-female binary as ‘third gender persons’ and that they are entitled\n\nto all constitutionally guaranteed rights. It also directed the Union and State\n\nGovernments to grant legal recognition to the self-identified gender of transgender\n\npersons, including when they identify as male and female. In Justice KS\n\nPuttaswamy (9J) (supra), this Court held that the Constitution protects the right of\n\na person to exercise their sexual orientation. The three-Judge Bench referred the\n\njudgment of this Court in Suresh Kumar Koushal (supra) to a larger Bench. The\n\nthree-Judge Bench also observed that the “order of nature” referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n\n377</a> of the IPC is not a constant but is guided by social morality as opposed to\n\n\n\n\n4 (2009) 160 DLT 277\n5 (2014) 1 SCC 1\n6 AIR 2014 SC 1863\n7 AIR 2017 SC 4161\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f                                                                                      PART A\n\nconstitutional values, and that a section of the population should not remain in a\n\nconstant state of fear while exercising their choices.\n\n\n6.        This Court answered the reference in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of\n\nIndia 8, holding that Section 377 is unconstitutional to the extent that it criminalizes\n\nconsensual sexual activities by the LGBTQ community. It held that: (i) Section 377\n\nviolated <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 14</a> because it discriminated between heterosexual persons and\n\nnon-heterosexual persons, although both groups engage in consensual sexual\n\nactivities 9; (ii) While <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14</a>                 permits reasonable classification based on\n\nintelligible differentia, a classification based on an ‘intrinsic and core trait’ is not\n\nreasonable; Section 377 classified individuals on the basis of the core trait of\n\n‘sexual orientation’ 10; (ii) <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 15</a> prohibits discrimination based on ‘sex’ which\n\nincludes within its meaning sexual orientation as well11 and Section 377 indirectly\n\ndiscriminated between heterosexual persons and the LGBTQ community based on\n\ntheir sexual orientation; and (iii) Section 377 violated <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> because\n\nSection 377 inhibited sexual privacy. 12\n\n\n7.        One of us (DY Chandrachud, J.) observed that the right to sexual privacy\n\nalso captures the right of the LGBTQIA+ community to navigate public places free\n\nfrom State interference. The community does not face discrimination merely based\n\non their private ‘sexual’ activities. It extends to their identity, expression, and\n\nexistence. The Court declared that the members of the LGBTQIA+ community are\n\nentitled to the full range of constitutional rights including the right to choose whom\n\n\n8 2018 1 SCC 791\n9 Chief Justice Dipak Misra in Navtej Singh Johar\n10 Justice Indu Malhotra in Navtej (supra)\n11   Justice DY Chandrachud in Navtej (supra)\n12 Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice DY Chandrachud in Navtej (supra)\n\n\n\n\n                                                       10\n\f                                                                                 PART A\n\nto partner with, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimacies, the benefit of equal\n\ncitizenship, and the right not to be subject to discriminatory behaviour. This Court\n\nin Navtej (supra) went beyond decriminalizing the sexual offence. It recognized\n\nthat persons find love and companionship in persons of the same gender;\n\nprotected the class against discriminatory behavior; and recognized the duty of the\n\nState to end the discrimination faced by the queer community.\n\n\n      ii.   Societal violence against the queer community\n\n\n8.     Despite the de-criminalization of queer relationships and the broad sweep\n\nof the decision in Navtej, members of the queer community still face violence and\n\noppression, contempt, and ridicule in various forms, subtle and not so subtle, every\n\nsingle day. The State (which has the responsibility to identify and end the various\n\nforms of discrimination faced by the queer community) has done little to\n\nemancipate the community from the shackles of oppression. The ghost of Section\n\n377 lives on in spite of the decriminalization of the sexual offence and the\n\nrecognition of the rights of queer persons in Navtej (supra).\n\n\n9.     The law, in the form of Section 377, imposed social morality on homosexual\n\nrelationships. The legal regime was the chariot which propels social norms on love\n\nand unions. The impact of Section 377 on society must be viewed in terms of its\n\neffect on the social conceptions of love and companionship. Section 377 enforced\n\nmorality through law by shaping beliefs about queer identity. This far-reaching\n\nimpact of the legal regime is one of the primary reasons for the continuing,\n\nwidespread revulsion against the LGBTQIA+ community even after homosexual\n\nsexual acts have been decriminalized. The lack of sensitization and the ensuing\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                                                                                                  PART A\n\ndiscrimination has pushed the members of the community into the proverbial\n\ncloset. For many members of the LGBTQIA+ community, expressing their sexual\n\norientation and gender identity is an act of defiance which requires strength and\n\ncourage. The ostracism extends across the full range of social values, from\n\nparenting to public office.\n\n\n10.     The discrimination faced by the LGBTQIA+ community in various forms is,\n\nin so many ways, a product of social morality as much as it is a product of the lack\n\nof effort from the State to sensitize the general public about issues concerning\n\nqueer rights. Social norms and beliefs which were internalised over centuries were\n\nnot overhauled at the stroke of midnight when the nation became the source of its\n\ndestiny and when the Constitution was adopted in 1950. Similarly, the stigma\n\nagainst the members of the LGBTQIA+ community did not end with a stroke of the\n\npen when this Court decriminalized consensual homosexual sexual activity.\n\n\n11.     Despite this Court recognizing that sexual orientation is a core and innate\n\ntrait of an individual, the members of the queer community continue to face\n\neconomic, social and political oppression in both visible and invisible ways. At a\n\nprimary level, they face oppression because of their inability to express their\n\ngender identity due to the fear of public disapproval. Researchers have recorded\n\nincidents where the public has subjected members of the queer community to\n\nviolence for publicly displaying affection towards one another. A woman who\n\neloped with another woman was beaten, stripped and paraded around the village\n\nwithin a blackened face and a garland of shoes around her neck. 13                                 Queer\n\n\n\n13 Maya Sharma, Loving Women: Being Lesbian in Underprivileged India (2nd edn, Yoda Press 2021)\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\f                                                                                                  PART A\n\nindividuals who are from socio-economically marginalised backgrounds are at an\n\neven greater risk of being subject to harassment.\n\n\n12.     The LGBTQIA+ community also faces discrimination in the public space\n\nbecause of the lack of accommodation in the public sphere for persons who do not\n\nconform to the gender binary. All the services provided by the State including public\n\nwashrooms, security check points, and ticket counters at railway stations and bus\n\ndepots are segregated based on a strict gender binary. Transwomen have\n\nrecounted experiences of being asked to shift to the men’s queue in security check\n\npoints. 14 Although they are women and identify with the female gender, they are\n\nforced to accept a third party’s assessment of their gender as being male. Just as\n\na cisgender woman may feel intensely uncomfortable at using facilities meant for\n\nmen, transgender women too may feel very uncomfortable. Over time,\n\nmisgendering a person can have deleterious effects on their mental health and\n\nnegatively impact their ability to function in the world.\n\n\n13.     Places of education and employment are also not spaces where gender\n\nidentity and sexual orientation may be expressed devoid of discriminatory attitudes.\n\nThe members of the queer community may be forced to quit their education or their\n\njob if they face oppression in these spaces. This would mean that they do not have\n\nequal opportunity. In professional environments, members of the queer community\n\nmay face various forms of discrimination which may range from being denied\n\nopportunities to secure jobs to not being invited to office gatherings and to being\n\npassed over for promotions.

In another study conducted by the National Human Rights\n\nCommission (NHRC) it was revealed that seventy-five percent of transgender\n\npersons in the National Capital Region and eighty-two percent of transgender\n\npersons in Uttar Pradesh never attended school or dropped out before tenth grade.\n\nFurther, members of the transgender community face difficulty in obtaining proper\n\nidentification documents which prevents them from accessing even those\n\nopportunities which are available to them.\n\n\n14.      The biological family is often the first site of violence and oppression for the\n\nqueer community. It begins with family members rejecting the gender identities of\n\ntheir transgender children or consenting to “gender normalizing surgeries” for their\n\nintersex children (that is, those who have reproductive or sexual anatomy that does\n\nnot fit into an exclusive male or female sex classification) without giving the child\n\nan opportunity to choose for themselves 16. At a very young age, they face familial\n\nrejection. Instead of being nurtured with love and affection, they face contempt\n\nbecause of their identity which in turn makes them vulnerable and inexpressive.\n\nThe natal families of some homosexual persons force them to marry a person of\n\n\n\n\n15 Shreya Raman, ‘Denied Visibility in Official Data, Millions of Transgender Indians Cant Access Benefits’ (India\n\nSpend, 11 June 2021)\n16 Also see Arunkumar v.

A person\n\nfrom the queer community recounted being forced to undergo ‘conversion therapy’\n\nwhere they were given electroconvulsive shocks. 20 Another queer person recounts\n\nthe harrowing experience that they underwent at a rehabilitation centre:\n\n\n                   “It was only later that I realised that I had been shifted to\n                   another rehabilitation centre [...]. Here, I was undressed and\n                   checked by a female warden. Afterward, I went to sleep for\n                   the night.\n\n\n                   There was one bathroom in this rehabilitation centre, which\n                   everyone used together. There was no door, and there was\n                   no question of privacy. I have never been to jail in my life, but\n                   I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s better than this.”\n\n\n15.        The transgender community is also discriminated against in other ways. The\n\nmembers of the community are not treated in a dignified manner in the healthcare\n\nsector for reasons which range from administrative formalities which are not\n\ngender-inclusive to a lack of knowledge about gender-related diseases. 21 Similarly,\n\n\n\n17   Shakthi Shalini, “The Unspoken: A qualitative research on natal family violence” 23\n18 Ibid.\n19 ibid\n20 Ibid,110.\n21 Lakshya Arora, ‘PM Bhujang, Muthusamy Sivakami, Understanding discrimination against LGBTQIA+ patients\n\nin hospitals using human rights perspective: an exploratory qualitative study’ Sex Reprod Health Matters’ 2022\n29(2) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9423841/.\n\n\n\n                                                         15\n\f                                                                                                      PART A\n\nthe community also faces discrimination in the housing sector. Studies have shown\n\nthat it is very difficult for members of the queer community to rent a house. 22 Some\n\nmembers of the queer community recounted that they have shifted houses twice\n\nin four years because of neighbours who assumed that they had parties and\n\ncaused disturbances. 23\n\n\n16.      Often, instruments of the State which are tasked with protecting human\n\nrights, perpetuate violence. Police and prison officials exhibit violence towards the\n\nqueer community. Research conducted by the National Institute of Epidemiology\n\ninvolving around 60,000 transgender participants revealed that the law\n\nenforcement agencies are the largest perpetrators of violence against the\n\ntransgender community. 24                A    trans-woman lodged in a prison housing two\n\nthousand male inmates recounted the violence that she faced during her\n\nimprisonment. She reported that the male prisoners sexually assaulted and\n\nmentally harassed her. 25 Lesbian and gay couples often approach the police for\n\nprotection from family violence. However, instead of granting protection to the\n\ncouple, the police ‘hand over’ the couple to their families.26 In one such case, the\n\npolice colluded with the family despite court orders granting protection to a couple\n\nfrom the queer community.

This Court in NALSA (supra) declared that the transgender community must\n\nnot be subsumed within the gender binary and must be treated as a “third gender”\n\nin the eyes of the law. This Court also directed the Central and the State\n\ngovernments to take steps to address the stigma and oppression faced by the\n\ncommunity and create public awareness about the community and their struggles.\n\nParliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_23\">Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act</a> 2019 30 to\n\nprotect the rights of the transgender community and provide welfare measures for\n\ntheir betterment.

The grievance of the petitioners (who are members of the LGBTQIA+\n\ncommunity) is not that society discriminates against them in an informal (and\n\ninvisible) manner. That is a secondary but an equally important stage of how\n\ndiscrimination pans out against a marginalised class. The petitioners claim that\n\nthey are discriminated on a more formal (and visible) level. The petitioners contend\n\nthat the State through the operation of the current legal regime discriminates\n\nagainst the queer community by impliedly excluding the queer community from a\n\ncivic institution: marriage. The petitioners have invoked the equality code of the\n\nConstitution to seek legal recognition of their relationship with their partner in the\n\nform of marriage.

Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners made the submissions\n\ndetailed below. Since this Court is a court of record, the submissions of each of the\n\ncounsel are set out.\n\n\n20.    Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    This Court’s existing jurisprudence on LGBTQIA+ rights declares that\n\n      LGBTQIA+ persons are entitled to dignity, equality, and privacy, which\n\n      encompasses the fundamental right of LGBTQIA+ persons to marry a person\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                                                                               PART B\n\n      of their choice. Accordingly, statutory recognition of such fundamental rights\n\n      of LGBTQIA+ persons is merely a consequence of this Court’s\n\n      jurisprudence 31;\n\n\nb.    <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_24\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">21</a> of the Constitution guarantee all persons the right to marry\n\n      a person of their choice, including LGBTQIA+ persons;\n\n\nc.    <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_26\">The Special Marriage Act</a> (SMA) violates the right to dignity and decisional\n\n      autonomy of LGBTQIA+ persons and therefore violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21 32;</a>\n\n\nd.    Excluding LGBTQIA+ persons from the SMA discriminates against them on\n\n      the basis of their sexual orientation and the sex of their partner. This violates\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\ne.    The SMA is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution because:\n\n\n      i.        It denies LGBTQIA+ persons equal protection of the laws. Non-\n\n                recognition of same-sex and gender-non conforming marriage causes\n\n                prejudice to LGBTQIA+ persons and denies them rights under social\n\n                welfare and beneficial legislations;\n\n\n      ii.       It is manifestly arbitrary to exclude LGBTQIA+ persons from the SMA.\n\n                There is no fair or reasonable justification to exclude LGBTQIA+\n\n                couples from the institution of marriage;\n\n\n\n\n31 Reliance was placed on K.S.

There is no constitutionally valid, intelligible differentia between\n\n                LGBTQIA+ and non-LGBTQIA+ persons. The classification in the\n\n                present case is based only on the sexual orientation and gender\n\n                identity of the parties to a marriage, which is constitutionally\n\n                impermissible. Further, there is no rational nexus with the object\n\n                sought to be achieved by the SMA. The object of the SMA is to provide\n\n                a civil form of marriage for couples who cannot or choose not to marry\n\n                under their personal law. The exclusion of LGBTQ couples from the\n\n                SMA has no rational nexus with this object;\n\n\nf.    There is no &#x27;legitimate state interest&#x27; promoted or safeguarded by denying\n\n      LGBTQ+ individuals the fundamental right of marriage;\n\n\ng.    Recognizing the right of LGBTQIA+ couples to marry upholds constitutional\n\n      morality. Constitutional morality urges the organs of the state, including the\n\n      judiciary, to preserve the heterogeneous nature of our society and encourage\n\n      it to be pluralistic and inclusive;\n\n\nh.    Every person is entitled to marry someone of their choice. Queer people are\n\n      equally entitled to the exercise of this right 33.;\n\n\ni.    Denying LGBTQ+ individuals the right to marry inflicts personal harm on them\n\n      and also inflicts a significant economic cost on the country;\n\n\n\n\n33 Reliance was placed on Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M. (2018) 16 SCC 368, Shakti Vahini (supra), Laxmibai\n\nChandaragi B. v. State of Karnataka (2021) 3 SCC 360, Deepika Singh (supra)\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\nj.   Denial of the right to marry amounts to a deprivation of the entitlement to full\n\n     citizenship as well as a denial of the right to intimacy;\n\n\nk.   The Constitution is a living document and ought to adapt to changing social\n\n     realities. Notions of marriage equality are not necessarily opposed to social\n\n     morality.;\n\n\nl.   If a statute appears to violate the Constitution, then this Court may either\n\n     declare it unconstitutional, or read it expansively to save its constitutionality.\n\n     Matrimonial as well as other statutes can be read in a gender-neutral manner\n\n     to include LGBTQIA+ couples within their ambit;\n\n\nm.   There is growing international consensus (including judicial consensus) which\n\n     recognizes same-sex and gender non-conforming marriages, and this is in\n\n     line with India’s international obligations;\n\n\nn.   <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution vests in persons or citizens a fundamental right\n\n     to approach this Court for the enforcement of the rights guaranteed in Part III\n\n     of the Constitution. It is therefore incorrect to argue that queer people must\n\n     wait for Parliament to enact a law granting marriage equality;\n\n\no.   Consequential reliefs must necessarily follow a declaration that the right to\n\n     marry is vested equally in all persons including LGBTQIA+ persons;\n\n\np.   The SMA ought to be read in a gender-neutral manner. Gendered terms such\n\n     as “husband” and “wife” ought to be read as “spouse.” The language used in\n\n     the SMA facilitates a gender neutral interpretation. <a href=\"/doc/37311261/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 4</a> of the SMA is\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f                                                                                PART B\n\n      with reference to “any two persons,” <a href=\"/doc/180803532/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 4(1)(a)</a> refers to a “spouse” and\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/128069179/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 4(1)(b)</a> refers to a “party”;\n\n\nq.    The age that must be attained before a person is eligible to marry under the\n\n      SMA ought to be twenty-one years for all persons; and\n\n\nr.    Transgender persons may fall into the categories of either “man” or “woman”\n\n      in the SMA, depending on the gender they identify with.\n\n\n21.    Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n\na.    The SMA is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the grounds of sexual\n\n      orientation by preventing same-sex couples from solemnizing their marriages.\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 15(1)</a> of the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex,\n\n      which subsumes sexual orientation. The requirement in the SMA that a couple\n\n      should consist of a man and a woman is one which is based on ascriptive\n\n      characteristics (attributes that are pre-determined or designated by society or\n\n      other external norms) and is an exclusion based on a marker of identity;\n\n\nb.    Marriage is not simply a benefit or privilege. Rather, it forms the very basis of\n\n      a couple’s ability to fully participate in society. Marriage is a source of social\n\n      validation, dignity, self-respect, fulfilment, security (financial and otherwise),\n\n      and other legal and civil benefits including in the domain of tax, inheritance,\n\n      adoption, etc.;\n\n\nc.    The exclusion of same-sex couples from the SMA is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 14</a> of\n\n      the Constitution. While there is an intelligible differentia for the classification\n\n\n                                             22\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n      in that the sexual orientation of heterosexual and homosexual persons is\n\n      different, there is no rational nexus with any legitimate state purpose. A\n\n      legislative purpose cannot itself be discriminatory or unconstitutional;\n\n\nd.    The exclusion of same-sex couples from the SMA is violative of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19</a> of\n\n      the Constitution. The act of entering into a marital relationship is protected\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, and is a socially valuable form of\n\n      expression. The restriction on the right of queer persons to marry is not a\n\n      reasonable restriction under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 19(2)34;</a>\n\n\ne.    The exclusion of same-sex couples from the SMA is violative of their right to\n\n      dignity and is therefore violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The exclusion\n\n      of same-sex couples from the institution of marriage is being used to send a\n\n      public message about their worth as unequal moral members of society and\n\n      is inter alia akin to caste-based restrictions on temple entry and the refusal to\n\n      accommodate disability in public examinations;\n\n\nf.    The SMA authorizes the solemnisation of same-sex marriages, when\n\n      interpreted consistent with the Constitution. It can be read down in the\n\n      following manner to include the solemnization of marriages between non-\n\n      heterosexual persons:\n\n\n        i.      The word &quot;man&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/33559921/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2(b)</a> includes &quot;any person&quot;, and that\n\n                correspondingly, the word &quot;woman&quot; includes &quot;any person&quot;;\n\n\n\n\n34 Reliance was placed on Union of India v. Naveen Jindal (2004) 2 SCC 510\n\n\n\n\n                                                   23\n\f                                                                                PART B\n\n        ii.     The words &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; include trans-men and trans- women,\n\n                intersex and non-binary individuals as the case may be 35;\n\n\n        iii.    <a href=\"/doc/37311261/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 4(c)</a> enacts only an age-based exclusion for persons\n\n                otherwise eligible to marry under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/37311261/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 4</a>, and shall\n\n                not be construed to impose any disabilities based on gender, sexual\n\n                orientation, or sexual identity of the parties. For same sex couples in\n\n                particular, <a href=\"/doc/37311261/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 4(c)</a> can be read as a single age-restriction, be it\n\n                eighteen or twenty-one. In the alternative, <a href=\"/doc/37311261/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 4(c)</a> may be read\n\n                as prescribing the minimum age as eighteen for both parties in the\n\n                case of a lesbian relationship and twenty-one for both parties in the\n\n                case of a gay relationship. For non-binary and inter-sex persons, the\n\n                SMA may be read as imposing no restriction beyond that imposed by\n\n                other laws which stipulate the age at which persons become capable\n\n                of binding themselves under law i.e., eighteen years. In the\n\n                alternative, this Court may lay down guidelines as an interim measure\n\n                while leaving it open to Parliament to fill the vacuum in due course of\n\n                time;\n\n\n        iv.     The reference to &quot;widow&quot; and &quot;widower&quot; in Schedules II and III must\n\n                be read as &quot;widow or widower&quot; and &quot;widower or widow,&quot; as the case\n\n                may be, and shall not be construed to impose any disabilities based\n\n                on gender, sexual orientation, or sexual identity of the parties;\n\n\n\n\n35 Reliance was placed on National Legal Services Authority (supra)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    24\n\f                                                                                PART B\n\n           v.   References to “bride” and “bridegroom” in Schedules III and IV must\n\n                be read as “bride or bridegroom”, as the case may be, and shall not\n\n                be construed to impose any disabilities based on gender, sexual\n\n                orientation, or sexual identity of the parties.\n\n\ng. <a href=\"/doc/660591/\" id=\"a_45\">The Foreign Marriage Act</a> 1969 can similarly be read down;\n\n\nh. The relief sought by the petitioners is workable;\n\n\ni.   In reading down the SMA and the FMA to achieve a constitutionally compliant\n\n     interpretation, neither the text of the statute nor the intention of Parliament act\n\n     as a limitation. Only the underlying thrust of the legislation and the institutional\n\n     capacity of this Court are relevant. The underlying thrust of the SMA is that it\n\n     was designed to facilitate marriages lying outside the pale of social\n\n     acceptability. Reliance was placed on Ghaidan v. Godin-Mendoza [2004]\n\n     UKHL 30;\n\n\nj.   In the alternative, the principle of updating construction ought to be applied to\n\n     the SMA. Courts may expand the existing words of a statute to further the\n\n     march of social norms and contemporary realities;\n\n\nk. Some laws (such as the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_46\">Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act</a>\n\n     2005, the <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_47\">Dowry Prohibition Act</a> 1961, provisions pertaining to cruelty in the\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_48\">Indian Penal Code</a> 1860 36) were enacted to address structural imbalances of\n\n     power between men and women in a heteronormative setting. These\n\n     provisions of law do not impact whether same-sex couples have a right to\n\n\n36 “<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_49\">IPC</a>”\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\n     marry. These provisions are beyond the scope of the petitions and need not be\n\n     interpreted in favour of either spouse in a non-heterosexual marriage;\n\n\nl.   There is no timeless and immutable conception of marriage. The SMA itself\n\n     was enacted contrary to the cultural and social understanding of marriage\n\n     which prevailed at the time. Further, the SMA is a secular and areligious law\n\n     which was meant to serve as an alternative for those who could not or did not\n\n     want to solemnize their marriages under the applicable personal law, which is\n\n     rooted in religion. The conditions for the solemnization of a marriage under the\n\n     SMA need not, therefore, conform to the cultural, social, or religious\n\n     understandings of marriage;\n\n\nm. The principles of equality and non-discrimination cannot be trumped by societal\n\n     values. These principles, by definition, require a challenge to majoritarian\n\n     social norms;\n\n\nn. This Court is not being asked to act as a substitute for the legislature or to alter\n\n     the “concept of marriage.” Rather, this Court is being asked to find that the\n\n     exclusion of a group of people from the SMA solely by virtue of their ascriptive\n\n     characteristics is unconstitutional. A constitutionally compliant reading of the\n\n     SMA to allow for marriage equality is within the bounds of legitimate statutory\n\n     interpretation and is not judicial legislation; and\n\n\no. Civil unions are not an equal alternative to the legal and social institution of\n\n     marriage. Relegating non-heterosexual relationships to civil unions would send\n\n     the queer community a clear message of subordination – that their\n\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n      relationships are inferior to relationships that comply with the entrenched\n\n      heteronormative social order.\n\n\n22.     Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n\na.     The petitioners have a fundamental right to marry a person of one&#x27;s own\n\n       choice under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_50\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_51\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_52\">, 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_54\">25</a> of the Constitution, and any\n\n       exclusion or discrimination, as incorporated in <a href=\"/doc/37311261/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 4(c)</a> and other\n\n       provisions of the SMA, is ultra-vires the Constitution. The denial of their right\n\n       to marry violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_57\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_58\">, 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_60\">25.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 21</a> encompasses the\n\n       right to happiness, which includes a fulfilling union with a person of one’s\n\n       choice;\n\n\nb.     The exclusion of the petitioners from the institution of civil marriage under\n\n       SMA, 1954, is inconsistent with the very object of the law, i.e., to facilitate any\n\n       marriage between two Indians, irrespective of caste, creed or religion;\n\n\nc.     The systemic nature of natal family violence against LGBTQIA+ persons,\n\n       owing to their sexual or gender identity, and the misuse of the criminal law\n\n       machinery by the families, often in collusion with local police, makes it\n\n       imperative for this Court to frame guidelines concerning the police action in\n\n       dealing with cases of adult and consenting queer and transgender persons37.\n\n\nd.     The special provisions for a wife in a heterosexual marriage under the SMA\n\n       need not be interpreted by this Court while deciding this batch of petitions\n\n\n37 Reliance was placed on Shakti Vahini (supra)\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\n      because they are protective provisions for women in pursuance of the\n\n      constitutional mandate in <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 15(3).</a> Similarly, gender-specific laws\n\n      including penal laws need not be subject to any interpretative exercise.\n\n      Religious personal laws are also not required to be interfered with;\n\n\ne.    Declarations by the court as to rights of people are followed by legislation. For\n\n      instance, the rights declared in National Legal Services Authority (supra)\n\n      were given effect to in the Transgender Persons Act;\n\n\nf.    The doctrine of reading-in is well-recognised in Indian jurisprudence; and\n\n\ng.    The Union of India has sought to argue that only Parliament can grant a new\n\n      ‘socio-legal status of marriage’ to LGBTQ persons, after undertaking\n\n      extensive consultations and eliciting views from every part of the nation. The\n\n      rights of the LGBTQIA+ community cannot be made contingent on the opinion\n\n      of the majority.\n\n\n23.     Mr. K V Vishwanathan, learned senior counsel, submitted that:\n\n\na.    Under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, all persons have a fundamental right to\n\n      choose a partner;\n\n\nb.    International covenants to which India is a signatory including the Universal\n\n      Declaration of Human Rights 38 and the International Covenant on Economic,\n\n      Social and Cultural Rights 39 enjoin a duty upon the state to not interfere with\n\n      the right of a person to marry and have a family in terms of their own choice\n\n\n\n38 “UDHR”\n39 “ICESCR”\n\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\f                                                                                                PART B\n\n      as well as to protect the familial rights of all persons without discrimination on\n\n      the basis of inter alia sexuality, race, and religion;\n\n\nc.    Statutes regulating marriage in India must be read as inclusive of all gender\n\n      identities and sexualities in view of the pronouncements of this Hon’ble Court\n\n      in National Legal Services Authority (supra) and Navtej (supra). Such a\n\n      reading is necessary to ensure that these statutes pass muster on the\n\n      touchstone of Part III of the Constitution;\n\n\nd.    Courts across the country as well as state policies and welfare schemes have\n\n      recognised and accorded equal status to unions between LGBTQ persons. A\n\n      necessary corollary of the right to self-identify gender is to be able to express\n\n      personal preference in terms of choice of partner, and, therefore a marriage\n\n      entered into by a transgender person must be fully recognised by the State40;\n\n\ne.    This Court has previously issued guidelines to protect citizens against\n\n      discrimination in cases where there existed a lacuna in the law41.;\n\n\nf.    The freedom to choose a partner in marriage would be covered under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_64\">Article\n\n      19(1)(a)</a> as an expression, under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> as an association or union\n\n      and <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 19(1)(e)</a>, as an exercise of the right to reside and settle in any part\n\n      of the territory of India 42;\n\n\n\n40 Reliance was placed on Arunkumar v.

Excluding transgender persons from matrimonial statutes fails the reasonable\n\n      classification test under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 14;</a>\n\n\nh.    Transgender persons have a right against discrimination under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_68\">Articles 15</a>\n\n      and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_69\">16;</a>\n\n\ni.    The right of transgender persons to marry is enjoined by the Transgender\n\n      Persons Act. The classification sought to be made by the Union of India\n\n      between “biological” and transgender persons is untenable;\n\n\nj.    Procreation is not the sole purpose of marriage. Marriage is not merely the\n\n      meeting and mating of two individuals but much more - it is the union of two\n\n      souls;\n\n\nk.    If the contention of the Union of India that ‘male’ and ‘female’ as provided in\n\n      statutes are to be construed to refer to cisgender males and females, it would\n\n      lead to absurd and unjust outcomes in implementation of several laws. For\n\n      instance, the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_70\">Hindu Succession Act</a> 1956 43 defines an ‘heir’ as any person\n\n      ‘male or female’ entitled to succeed to the property of an intestate under said\n\n      Act. If the Union of India’s argument is taken to be correct, it would lead to a\n\n      situation where a transgender heir of a person who has died intestate would\n\n      not be able to inherit the property, even if they happen to be the sole heir;\n\n\nl.    The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (N<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_71\">CPC</a>R) has made\n\n      unscientific claims on the effect of puberty blocker / sex-transition therapy on\n\n      children. They are in complete disregard to the internationally accepted\n\n\n43 “<a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_72\">Hindu Succession Act</a>”\n\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\n      guidelines issued by World Profession Association for Transgender Health, 44\n\n      which are also referenced in the Transgender Persons Act; and\n\n\nm.    The petitioners&#x27; constitutional rights cannot be denied based on an argument\n\n      that it would offend the &quot;will of the people.&quot; Constitutional morality cannot and\n\n      ought not to be replaced by social morality.\n\n\n24.    Ms. Geetha Luthra, learned senior counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n\na.    The FMA is applicable to a couple if at least one of them is an Indian citizen.\n\n      The FMA travels with the citizen to a foreign jurisdiction to extend its\n\n      protection by recognizing the citizen’s marriage contracted under foreign law,\n\n      or by allowing a citizen to solemnize their marriage under Indian law even\n\n      when they are abroad. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/265370/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 17</a> of the FMA, a marriage must be\n\n      valid in terms of foreign law and consistent with international law;\n\n\nb.    All citizens including LGBTQIA+ citizens are entitled to all rights available to\n\n      Indian citizens, even if they are abroad. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_74\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">21</a> of the Constitution\n\n      guarantee all persons the right to marry a person of their choice, including\n\n      LGBTQIA+ citizens. The FMA violates the right to dignity and decisional\n\n      autonomy of LGBTQIA+ persons and is discriminatory. Reliance was placed\n\n      on National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v. Minister of Home\n\n      Affairs [2000] 4 LRC 292;\n\n\n\n\n44 “WPATH”\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\nc.   The object of the FMA in adopting the scheme of the SMA is to provide a\n\n     uniform, civil and secular marriage law for a couple, either of whom is an\n\n     Indian citizen. However, by recognizing marriages only between opposite sex\n\n     couples, the effect of the law is to deny same-sex and gender non-conforming\n\n     couples the right to marry a person of their choice, solely on grounds of their\n\n     sexual orientation and gender identity. This is violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 15</a> of the\n\n     Constitution;\n\n\nd.   The SMA and the FMA are violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution because\n\n     they deny LGBTQIA+ persons the equal protection of laws, are manifestly\n\n     arbitrary, and fail the rational nexus test. There is no intelligible differentia\n\n     between LGBTQIA+ and non-LGBTQIA+ couples. The object of the FMA is\n\n     to extend the protection of the Indian Constitution and its laws to a citizen\n\n     abroad regardless of who they choose to marry and under whichever law they\n\n     choose to do so, to provide for maximum international validity of a marriage,\n\n     and in adopting the framework of the SMA, to provide for a uniform, civil and\n\n     secular law to govern foreign marriages. The exclusion of same-sex and\n\n     gender non-conforming couples from the FMA has no rational nexus with\n\n     these objects;\n\n\ne.   The FMA is pari materia to the SMA. They must be interpreted similarly with\n\n     regard to same-sex and gender non-conforming marriages;\n\n\nf.   Recognition of marriage of same-sex and gender non-conforming couples\n\n     under the FMA furthers the comity of nations; and\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\ng.    The grant of reliefs does not render the provisions of the FMA or other statutes\n\n      employing gendered terminology unworkable.\n\n\n25.    Mr. Anand Grover, learned senior counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    Marriage remains fundamental to the functioning of the society, and to avail\n\n      important schemes under the modern nation - state, such as joint tax benefits\n\n      and rights of surrogacy;\n\n\nb.    The FMA must be interpreted liberally to advance the cause of society at\n\n      large. It must not be interpreted to cause hardship;\n\n\nc.    The failure of the SMA to recognize same-sex marriages violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_78\">Articles 14</a>\n\n      and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_79\">15</a> of the Constitution because it fails the reasonable classification test,\n\n      is manifestly arbitrary, and discriminates based on gender identity and sexual\n\n      orientation;\n\n\nd.    The failure of the SMA to recognize same-sex marriages violates <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_80\">Article\n\n      19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution because sexuality, gender expression, and\n\n      marriage are forms of expression;\n\n\ne.    The right to intimate associations is protected by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the\n\n      Constitution. Reliance was placed on Griswold v. Connecticut 381 US 479\n\n      (1965);\n\n\nf.    Same-sex marriages or gender non-conforming marriages form a part of\n\n      Indian tradition and culture. Reliance was placed on National Legal Services\n\n      Authority (supra);\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\ng.    Queerness or homosexuality is not an urban, elite conception or expression.\n\n      Numerous queer or homosexual couples from villages and towns in India\n\n      have expressed their sexuality, chosen their partner, and entered into the\n\n      institution of marriage; and\n\n\nh.    There is no traditional bar on marriage between non-heterosexual persons.\n\n      Excerpts from various scriptures support this proposition.\n\n\n26.    Ms. Jayna Kothari, learned senior counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    The SMA ought to be read to include the words “spouse” and “person” so as\n\n      to include transgender persons within its ambit. Failure to do so amounts to a\n\n      violation of the right of transgender persons to equality and to equal protection\n\n      of the laws under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\nb.    The SMA discriminates on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual\n\n      orientation, thereby violating <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\nc.    The denial of the right to marry to persons based on their gender identity is a\n\n      denial of the right to dignity, personal autonomy, and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 21</a>\n\n      of the Constitution;\n\n\nd.    Inter-sex persons have the same rights as all other persons in India, including\n\n      the right to marry; and\n\n\ne.    The right to a family is available under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 21</a>, and this right includes the\n\n      right to marry. The SMA is violative of the right of transgender persons to have\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n      a family. Reliance was placed on Oliari v. Italy Applications nos. 18766/11\n\n      and 36030/11.\n\n\n27.    Dr Menaka Guruswamy, learned senior counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n\na.    The Indian Parliament is a creature of the Constitution and does not enjoy\n\n      unfettered sovereignty. The supremacy of the Constitution is protected by this\n\n      Court by interpreting laws in consonance with constitutional values;\n\n\nb.    This Court’s power of judicial review over legislative action is part of the basic\n\n      structure of the Constitution;\n\n\nc.    Constitutional courts are empowered to review statutory law to ensure its\n\n      conformity with constitutional values. The courts do not need to wait for the\n\n      legislature to enact/amend law to recognize same-sex marriage;\n\n\nd.    The provisions of SMA, insofar as they do not recognize same-sex marriages,\n\n      are unconstitutional as being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_86\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_87\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_88\">, 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_89\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_90\">25</a> of the\n\n      Constitution. Hence, to save it from the vice of unconstitutionality, the SMA\n\n      must be read up to recognise same-sex marriages;\n\n\ne.    Recognition of same-sex marriages under the SMA is consistent with the\n\n      evolving conception of the institution of marriage;\n\n\nf.    Same-sex marriage is a time honoured tradition in the Indian society;\n\n\ng.    The gendered references in the SMA are capable of being read to recognize\n\n      same-sex marriages;\n\n\n                                           35\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\nh.    The State has no legitimate interest in restricting the institution of marriage to\n\n      heterosexual couples alone; and\n\n\ni.    The codification of Hindu personal laws commenced in 1941 with the colonial\n\n      Government appointing the Hindu Law Committee, which prepared the first\n\n      draft of the Hindu Code Bill. There was vociferous opposition to the Hindu\n\n      Code Bill, which was later enacted into four distinct legislations - the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_91\">Hindu\n\n      Marriage Act</a> 1955, 45 the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_92\">Hindu Succession Act, 1956</a>, the <a href=\"/doc/76168618/\" id=\"a_93\">Hindu Minority and\n\n      Guardianship Act</a> 1956, and the <a href=\"/doc/946025/\" id=\"a_94\">Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act</a> 1956.\n\n      Inter-caste marriages, sagotra marriages, the prescription of monogamy, and\n\n      the introduction of divorce were met with great opposition. Despite vehement\n\n      opposition, these reforms have stood the test of time and society has\n\n      prospered overall as a result. Today, the objections raised on behalf of the\n\n      Union of India opposing the recognition of same-sex marriage are akin to the\n\n      opposition to the Hindu Code Bill.\n\n\n28.        Mr. Saurabh Kirpal, learned senior counsel, submitted that:\n\n\na.    Depriving LGBTQ+ individuals of the right to marry violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_95\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_96\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_97\">,\n\n      19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_98\">21</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\nb.    The right to marry a person of one&#x27;s choice is itself a Fundamental Right under\n\n      the Constitution;\n\n\n\n\n45 “HMA”\n\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\nc.    The SMA is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to exclude access to LGBTQ\n\n      individuals from its ambit;\n\n\nd.    The intent of Parliament when it enacted the SMA is not relevant. The doctrine\n\n      of reading in does not aim to discover the intention of Parliament. The\n\n      jurisprudential basis of the doctrine is that courts read something in to save a\n\n      statute from the vice of unconstitutionality;\n\n\ne.    Having found a right to marry, this Court cannot hold that there is no remedy\n\n      or a real possibility for the exercise of that right; and\n\n\nf.    By virtue of <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 13</a>, the Constitution trumps a statute which violates the\n\n      Constitution. Analysis under <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 13</a> does not extend to whether or not a\n\n      statute or a system of law is workable after it is read up or after certain words\n\n      or phrases are read in to save it from being unconstitutional. It cannot be that\n\n      a complex statute can defeat a fundamental right by virtue of its complexity.\n\n\n29.    Ms. Vrinda Grover, learned senior counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    Interference, opposition and violence from natal families, irrespective of\n\n      marital status, violates the fundamental right to life and personal Liberty under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\nb.    Non-recognition of ‘atypical families’ or ‘chosen families’ beyond constraints\n\n      of marriage, blood or adoption violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_103\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_104\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">21;\n\n\n\n\n                                            37</a>\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\nc.     Non-recognition of marriage between two consenting adults on the basis of\n\n       gender identity or sexual orientation under the SMA violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_106\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_107\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_108\">,\n\n       19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_109\">21;</a>\n\n\nd.     Constitutional courts sometimes accord undue deference to the natal family.\n\n       This ignores the coercion and violence that queer and transgender persons\n\n       face within their homes. Reference was made to Devu G v. State of Kerala,\n\n       SLP (Criminal) No. 5027/2023, Order dated 6 February 2023;\n\n\ne.     This Court ought to issue directions to all state governments to instruct police\n\n       officers to compulsorily follow the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_110\">Sections 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_111\">41-A</a> of the\n\n       Code of Criminal Procedure 197346 when responding to complaints involving\n\n       queer and transgender adults who voluntarily leave natal homes;\n\n\nf.     Issues of ‘workability’ in statutory provisions do not preclude this Court from\n\n       protecting rights under Part III of the Constitution.\n\n\n30.

This Court cannot supply a casus omissus into a statute by judicial\n\n      interpretation, except in circumstances of clear necessity;\n\n\nb.    The recognition of a foreign marriage between two non-citizens is a mere\n\n      ministerial Act. Only the substantive law of the foreign jurisdiction is relevant;\n\n\nc.    It would be manifestly arbitrary and contrary to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 14</a>, for the law to accord\n\n      a larger ambit for registration of marriages to an OCI than to a citizen of the\n\n      country married in a foreign jurisdiction, and to the extent of the inconsistency\n\n      a harmonious construction of the FMA with the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_116\">Citizenship Act</a> is required;\n\n\nd.

The requirement of proof of a ‘marital relationship’ by a ‘married couple’ for\n\n       the purpose of joint adoption under Regulations 5(2)(a) and 5(3) is beyond\n\n       the remit of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 57</a> of the JJ Act that extends joint adoption to relationships\n\n       that are ‘marriage like’ including marriages between same-sex couples\n\n       solemnized overseas;\n\n\nd.

Ms. Amritananda Chakravorty, learned counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n\na.    The Office Memorandum issued by CARA on 16 June 2022 51 is\n\n      unconstitutional because they prevent same-sex couples and gender non-\n\n      conforming couples from availing of joint adoption; and\n\n\nb.    The requirements prescribed in the CARA Circular travel beyond the remit of\n\n      the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_137\">JJ Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 2(49)</a> of the JJ Act defines the term “prospective adoptive\n\n      parents” to mean “a person or persons eligible to adopt a child as per the\n\n      provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_139\">section 57</a>.” <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 2(49)</a> does not require the prospective\n\n      adoptive parents to be heterosexual. Further, <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 57</a> does not specify\n\n      marital status as a relevant factor to be considered while determining the\n\n      eligibility of prospective adoptive parents.\n\n\n34.     Mr. Raghav Awasthi, learned counsel, sought to make submissions\n\nregarding the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_142\">Hindu Marriage Act</a>. This Court declined to hear arguments on this\n\nissue in the present proceedings.\n\n\n35.     Mr. Shivam Singh, learned counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\n        a.    It is unconstitutional for the state to discriminate against persons\n\n              because of their innate characteristics;\n\n\n        b.    Upholding the heterosexual notion of marriage as the only\n\n              constitutionally and legally sanctioned notion of marriage will serve to\n\n\n\n\n51 CARAICA013/1/2022Administration; “CARA Circular”\n\n\n\n\n                                                  42\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n           perpetuate gender-based stereotypes proscribed by the Constitution\n\n           and is therefore violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 15;</a> and\n\n\n      c.   Resorting to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_144\">General Clauses Act</a> 1897, <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_145\">Section\n\n           4(c)</a> of the SMA (which otherwise appears to be unconstitutional) can\n\n           be read down such that the singular “male” and “female” includes the\n\n           plural as well.\n\n\n36.   Manu Srinath, learned counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\n      a.   Persons whose fundamental rights are violated are entitled to seek\n\n           judicial review of the violating act;\n\n\n      b.   It is permissible for judicial review to result in an increase in the size of\n\n           the intended pool of beneficiaries of a legislation. Such an exercise will\n\n           not amount to legislation by courts; and\n\n\n      c.   Judicial review is a tool to achieve social justice. It is also a tool by\n\n           which constitutional aspirations and ideals are achieved.\n\n\n37.   Jaideep Gupta, learned counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n\n      a.   If recognition is accorded to marriage by queer persons, they will be\n\n           protected from so-called “conversion therapies” which attempt to\n\n           “convert” the sexual orientation of queer people into a heterosexual\n\n           orientation as well as forced marriages;\n\n\n      b.   Queer marriages do not fall within the degrees of prohibited\n\n           relationships; and\n\n\n                                          43\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\n      c.   The classification on the basis of age in the SMA ought to be declared\n\n           unconstitutional insofar as it mandates a different minimum age\n\n           requirement for men and women. This Court ought to declare twenty-\n\n           one years as the ideal age for all marriages. The Prohibition of Child\n\n           Marriage (Amendment) Bill 2021, which seeks to raise the legally\n\n           permissible age of girls to marry from eighteen years to twenty-one\n\n           years is currently pending in Parliament.\n\n\n38.   Thulasi Raj, learned counsel, submitted that:\n\n\n      a.   The exclusion of the LGBT community from the institution of marriage\n\n           is “demeaning” as defined by Deborah Hellman; and\n\n\n      b.   Prejudicial notions about sexuality inform the SMA although its\n\n           provisions may not expressly contain words which indicate such\n\n           prejudices.\n\n\n39.   Tanushree Bhalla, learned counsel, submitted that:\n\n\n      a.   The word “man” in the SMA ought to be read as meaning a cisgender\n\n           man, a transgender man, and any person who assumes a role in the\n\n           marriage that the statute or society or the institution of marriage confers\n\n           on men. The word “woman” must be interpreted in a similar fashion;\n\n\n      b.   <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 4(c)</a> of the SMA excludes intersex persons; and\n\n\n      c.   A minimum age at which persons of the “third gender” may marry may\n\n           be read in, in <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 4(c)</a> of the SMA.\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\n40.    In addition to the above submissions, some senior counsel and counsel\n\nsought to address this Court on the ‘notice and objections regime’ in the SMA (i.e.,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_148\">Sections 5</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1850073/\" id=\"a_149\">9</a> of the SMA which stipulate a set of procedural preconditions to the\n\nsolemnization of marriages under the SMA). This Court has not heard arguments\n\non this issue in the present proceedings.\n\n\n41.    Mr. R. Venkataramani, learned Attorney General of India appearing for the\n\nUnion of India, made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    This Court has already issued constitutional declarations on the right to form\n\n      a family, and the right to marry of non-heterosexual persons in Navtej (supra).\n\n      The issue in this batch of petitions relates to fitting the constitutional\n\n      declaration into relevant laws;\n\n\nb.    The SMA is a species of the general marriage laws. Marriage is conceived to\n\n      be a union between heterosexuals across all laws on marriage and\n\n      procreation is an essential aspect of marriage;\n\n\nc.    At the time when the SMA was enacted, an alternative conception of a union\n\n      of persons (other than heterosexuals) did not exist. The SMA is intended to\n\n      regulate marriage between heterosexuals irrespective of caste and religion.\n\n      Thus, the omission of non-heterosexual unions from the purview of the\n\n      enactment would not render the enactment unconstitutional because of\n\n      under-inclusiveness. The SMA will be underinclusive only when a class of\n\n      heterosexuals is excluded by the statute;\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f                                                                          PART B\n\nd.   There would be no internal cohesion in the SMA if <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 4</a> is read in a\n\n     gender-neutral   manner.    Such   an   interpretation   would   render   the\n\n     implementation of <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_151\">Sections 19</a> to 21A which link the SMA with other personal\n\n     and non-personal laws difficult;\n\n\ne.   Courts can use the interpretative tool of reading-in only when the stated\n\n     purpose of the law is not achieved. Since the purpose of SMA is to regulate\n\n     heterosexual marriages, this Court cannot read words into the enactment to\n\n     expand its purview beyond what was originally conceptualized;\n\n\nf.   It is up to Parliament to enact a special code regulating non-heterosexual\n\n     unions and the specific issues that such unions would face during and after\n\n     the partnership, after comprehensively engaging with all stakeholders;\n\n\ng.   The course adopted by this Court in Vishaka (supra) cannot be replicated for\n\n     two reasons: one, there is no legislative vacuum in the instant case, and\n\n     second, the non-inclusion of all possible kinds of unions cannot be construed\n\n     as a constitutional omission;\n\n\nh.   Courts cannot issue directions granting legal recognition to non-heterosexual\n\n     marriages because it would require the redesigning of several enactments\n\n     and rules. Marriage rights must be given only through the parliamentary\n\n     process after wide consultation; and\n\n\ni.   A declaration by this Court granting legal recognition to non-heterosexual\n\n     marriages accompanied with a scheme of rights would be anathema to\n\n\n\n\n                                        46\n\f                                                                            PART B\n\n      separation of powers. This Court must not venture into the realm of policy\n\n      making and law making.\n\n\n42.    Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing for the Union of\n\nIndia, made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    The institution of marriage occupies a central role in the sustenance and\n\n      progression of humankind. The prominent components of a marriage are\n\n      companionship, sexual intimacy, and most importantly, procreation. Marriage\n\n      (from an individual perspective) serves the purpose of sustaining an\n\n      individual’s gene pool. From a societal perspective, marriage contributes\n\n      towards the proliferation of future generations for the sustenance of\n\n      humankind;\n\n\nb.    The Constitution does not recognize a right to marry. An expression of a\n\n      person’s sexuality is protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.\n\n      However, marriage cannot be traced to the right to freedom of expression or\n\n      the right to form unions under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 19(1)(c);</a>\n\n\nc.    This Court has not previously recognized the right to marry under the\n\n      Constitution. The observations of this Court in Shafin Jahan (supra) and\n\n      Shakti Vahini (supra) that the petitioners’ right to marry has been violated\n\n      must be read in the specific context of these judgments. In these cases, the\n\n      right to marry which is conferred by the legislature to inter-caste and inter-\n\n      religious couples was violated by State and non-State actors;\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\nd.   Marriage is a creation of statutes. The State by virtue of Entry 5 of List III of\n\n     the Seventh Schedule has the power to regulate the institution of marriage.\n\n     In exercise of this power, the legislature has prescribed various conditions\n\n     which must be fulfilled before legal recognition can be given to a union. These\n\n     conditions inter alia include the minimum age to be able to consent to a\n\n     marriage, the prohibition of bigamy, and the bar against marrying within the\n\n     degrees of prohibited relationship;\n\n\ne.   The State is not under an obligation to grant legal recognition to every type of\n\n     relationship. The State only recognizes relationships when there exists a\n\n     legitimate state interest. The State has a legitimate State interest in legally\n\n     recognizing heterosexual relationships for the sustenance of society;\n\n\nf.   After the decriminalization of homosexuality in Navtej (supra), members of\n\n     the LGBTQIA+ community have the freedom and autonomy to choose their\n\n     partners without restraints on gender and sexuality. However, the\n\n     decriminalization of the sexual offence does not cast an obligation on the\n\n     State to grant legal recognition to such relationships or unions. Marriage is a\n\n     legal privilege. It is conditional upon statutory or societal conditions. The right\n\n     to choose a partner does not necessarily imply that there is a right to marry a\n\n     partner of choice;\n\n\ng.   The Courts do not have the power to decide if legal recognition can be granted\n\n     to a union of non-heterosexual individuals. This is an issue which must\n\n     necessarily be decided by the legislature, being the elected representatives\n\n     of the citizens;\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\nh.   It would become impossible to deny legal recognition to practices such as\n\n     incest or polygamy if non-heterosexual couples are granted the right to marry;\n\n\ni.   Marriage is a public institution. It falls in the outer-most zone of privacy and is\n\n     thus, susceptible to the highest degree of State regulation. This Court in\n\n     Navtej (supra) only granted protection to the intimate and intermediate zone\n\n     of privacy of non-heterosexual couples;\n\n\nj.   Both the father and the mother have a significant and unique role in the\n\n     upbringing of children. In non-heterosexual unions, the child born out of\n\n     surrogacy or artificial reproductive technology or adopted by the couple would\n\n     feel the absence of either a father or a mother. The State does not grant legal\n\n     recognition to homosexual unions in the form of marriage to protect the\n\n     interest of the children. This is a legitimate State interest. The petitioners have\n\n     not submitted sufficient data to back their claim that the interest of a child\n\n     brought up by a non-heterosexual couple is protected;\n\n\nk.   Granting legal recognition to non-heterosexual unions would dilute\n\n     heterosexual marriages. For example, in Netherlands, more heterosexual\n\n     couples have opted for domestic partnerships and cohabitation after legal\n\n     recognition was granted to non-heterosexual unions. Non-heterosexual\n\n     unions are not granted legal recognition to protect the institution of marriage;\n\n\nl.   The impugned provisions of the SMA are constitutional because:\n\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f                                                                          PART B\n\n i.    The legislative debates during the introduction of the SMA indicate that\n\n       Parliament made a conscious decision to exclude non-heterosexual\n\n       unions from the ambit of the SMA;\n\n\nii.    The object of the SMA is to grant (and regulate) legal recognition to\n\n       inter-faith and inter-caste unions of heterosexual couples. The\n\n       provisions of the SMA have a reasonable nexus to this object;\n\n\niii.   There is an intelligible differentia in classifying unions into heterosexual\n\n       and non-heterosexual partnerships because heterosexual couples\n\n       sustain a society through precreation. In fact, the Transgender Persons\n\n       Act also classifies persons into homosexuals and heterosexuals and\n\n       grants substantive rights to the members of the LGBTQIA+ community\n\n       in furtherance of the mandate of substantive equality. The Transgender\n\n       Persons Act recognizes the autonomy of the members of the LGBTQI+\n\n       community to choose a partner of their choice;\n\n\niv.    The constitutionality of a statute cannot be challenged on the ground\n\n       of under-inclusion;\n\n\nv.     An emerging body of evidence indicates that homosexuality may be an\n\n       acquired characteristic and not an innate characteristic. Children who\n\n       have been exposed to homosexual experiences are more likely to\n\n       identify as a homosexual on attaining adulthood. Thus, this Court must\n\n       not approach this issue from a “linear reductionist perspective.”\n\n       Further, the argument of the petitioners that the SMA is unconstitutional\n\n\n\n\n                                     50\n\f                                                                           PART B\n\n            because it is excludes a class based on innate characteristics is\n\n            erroneous;\n\n\n      vi.   The SMA would become unworkable if it is read in a gender-neutral\n\n            manner. It would also amount to this Court re-drafting a large number\n\n            of provisions:\n\n\n             A. <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 2(b)</a> read with the First Schedule prescribes distinctive\n\n                 degrees of prohibited relationships for the bride and the groom;\n\n\n             B. According to <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 4(c)</a>, the male must have completed twenty-\n\n                 one years of age and the female must have completed eighteen\n\n                 years of age at the time of marriage. Reading the phrase ‘spouse’\n\n                 in place of ‘male’ and ‘female’ would render the distinctive\n\n                 minimum age requirement for marriage based on gender otiose;\n\n\n             C. The form of the statutory oath which the parties are required to\n\n                 take for the solemnization of their marriage expressly uses the\n\n                 phrases ‘wife’ and ‘husband’;\n\n\n             D. According to <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 21</a>, the rules of succession provided in the\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1450343/\" id=\"a_157\">Indian Succession Act</a> 192552 govern the succession of property\n\n                 of any person who is married under the SMA. The ISA prescribes\n\n                 different rules and procedures for succession based on gender.\n\n\n\n\n52 “ISA”\n\n\n\n\n                                        51\n\f                                                                            PART B\n\n                Reading the provisions of the SMA in a gender-neutral manner\n\n                would impact the interpretation of the provisions of the ISA as well;\n\n\n             E. By virtue of Section 21A, the rules of succession under the HMA\n\n                shall apply for marriages solemnized between a male and female\n\n                professing the Hindu, Buddist, Sikh or Jain religion. The HSA\n\n                prescribes different rules for succession based on gender.\n\n                Reading the provisions of the SMA in a gender-neutral manner\n\n                would render the HSA unworkable; and\n\n\n             F. Other provisions of the SMA such as <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_158\">Sections 27</a>, <a href=\"/doc/175453/\" id=\"a_159\">31</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1515822/\" id=\"a_160\">36</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1167708/\" id=\"a_161\">37</a>\n\n                cater to the needs and requirements of a woman in a heterosexual\n\n                marriage. A reading of the SMA in a gender-neutral manner would\n\n                impact the interpretation of these provisions.\n\n\nm. By declaring that non-heterosexual couples have a right to marry, this Court\n\n   would be granting legal recognition to a new social relationship. Such a\n\n   declaration by this Court could also pre-empt debates on this issue in the\n\n   legislature; and\n\n\nn. The term ‘spouse’ in <a href=\"/doc/116997114/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 7A</a> of the Citizenship Act 1955 cannot be read in\n\n   a gender neutral manner. <a href=\"/doc/116997114/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 7A</a> of the Citizenship Act applies to the same\n\n   class of persons to whom the FMA applies. The FMA expressly uses the\n\n   phrases ‘bride’ and ‘bridegroom.’ <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 4</a> of the FMA prescribes the same\n\n   conditions for the registration of a marriage as <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 4</a> of SMA.\n\n\n\n\n                                        52\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n43.    Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for intervenor made the\n\nfollowing submissions:\n\n\na.    Marriage was defined by the social acceptability of a relationship even before\n\n      it was codified. The heterosexual nature of a marriage was not introduced by\n\n      law. Law merely regulated unions which were socio-historically recognised.\n\n      The law has always differentiated between heterosexual and non-\n\n      heterosexual unions;\n\n\nb.    A legal recognition of a union is premised on the recognition of a relationship\n\n      on an individual level, family level, and societal level;\n\n\nc.    The right of a person to choose a partner of their choice is protected under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 21.</a> However, the legislative recognition of such a choice is not a\n\n      fundamental right;\n\n\nd.    The right to marry cannot be traced to the right to privacy. The right to privacy\n\n      postulates the right to be left alone. There is a negative obligation on the State\n\n      and the society to not interfere with choices of individuals. However, if the\n\n      exercise of the right to privacy has a public dimension, the State must regulate\n\n      the exercise of the right in the larger interest of the community. The State has,\n\n      in the past, regulated the parameters of choice within the realm of marriage\n\n      with respect to the number of partners and the age of marriage. Thus, the\n\n      right to the recognition of non-heterosexual unions is not traceable in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_167\">Article\n\n      21;\n\n\n\n\n                                           53</a>\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\ne.     The South African Supreme Court in Minister of Home Affairs v. Fourie 53\n\n       and the United States Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges, Director,\n\n       Department of Health 54 while recognising the right to marry acknowledged\n\n       the importance and relevance of social debate and public discourse on the\n\n       issue. The courts observed that the public has become more accepting of\n\n       non-heterosexual unions. While it may not be necessary to reach public\n\n       consensus on social issues, it is still important to have some form of discourse\n\n       on the issue be it through law commissions, referendums, bills in the\n\n       legislature, or even High Court decisions;\n\n\nf.     Public engagement also goes hand-in-hand with an incrementalistic approach\n\n       by the courts or the legislature. For example, Mexico City recognised\n\n       cohabitation partnership of homosexual unions in 2006. Three years later,\n\n       their right to marry was recognised. In South Africa, before the judgment in\n\n       Fourie (supra), the constitutional court had dealt with the criminalisation of\n\n       sodomy, 55 the rights of same-sex immigrant partners56, the right to adoption\n\n       of same-sex partners 57, and the non-inclusion of same-sex partners in a\n\n       statute providing pension rights 58;\n\n\ng.     This Court instead of limiting its judgment to the reliefs sought by the\n\n       petitioners, must also address the following issues:\n\n\n\n\n53 (2006) 1 SA 524\n54 576 US 644 (2015)\n55 Sodomy Case, 1999(1) SA 6 (CC)\n56 Home Affairs case, 2000(2) SA 1 (CC)\n57 Du Troit, 2003 (2) SA 198 (CC)\n58 Satchwell, 2002 (6) SA 1 (CC)\n\n\n\n\n                                              54\n\f                                                                            PART B\n\n      (i)    Whether the LGBTQIA+ community, being a sexual minority, is entitled\n\n             to be protected even in the absence of a law;\n\n\n      (ii)   The recognition of the hindrances faced by LGBTQIA+ unions and the\n\n             procedure to resolve the difficulties; and\n\n\n      (iii) The necessity of administrative procedures and guidelines recognizing\n\n             that sexual orientation is a physiological phenomenon and that same\n\n             sex unions must not be discriminated against.\n\n\nh.   The assumption of the petitioners that both law and society must consider\n\n     non-heterosexual unions as belonging to the same class as heterosexual\n\n     unions without distinction based on sexual orientation is wrong. The exclusion\n\n     of non-heterosexual unions from the SMA is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_168\">Articles 14</a> and\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_169\">15</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\ni.   Marriage between “any two persons” as provided in <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 4</a> of SMA and\n\n     FMA cannot include non-heterosexual unions for the following reasons:\n\n\n      (i)    <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 4(a)</a> states that marriage cannot be solemnised if either party\n\n             has a spouse living at the time of marriage. The SMA, when it was\n\n             enacted, referred to marriages which had taken place before it came\n\n             into force. In that case, the word ‘spouse’ could have only been used\n\n             in the context of heterosexual marriages; and\n\n\n      (ii)   The mere usage of a gender-neutral term does not indicate the\n\n             legislative will to include non-heterosexual unions within the ambit of\n\n             the enactment.\n\n\n                                          55\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\nj.   The statute is not underinclusive for impliedly excluding non-heterosexual\n\n     unions from its purview because Parliament did not contemplate the inclusion\n\n     of non-heterosexual marriages at the time of enactment. A statute will be\n\n     under-inclusive only where a statute which must necessarily cover a category\n\n     excludes them from the benefits it confers. The principle will not apply to\n\n     persons who are not ex-facie covered by the statute;\n\n\nk.   The interpretative tool of “reading-in” means reading into the text of the statute\n\n     and not altering it. Reading the word “spouse” into SMA where the words\n\n     “husband” and “wife” are used would render provisions which are enacted\n\n     based on conventional ideas about a heterosexual relationship redundant;\n\n\nl.   The legislative regime related to marriage and other allied issues has been\n\n     enacted in response to the unique challenges that heterosexual marriages\n\n     face. Even if this Court finds that the Constitution grants a right to legal\n\n     recognition of non-heterosexual unions, a new legislative regime regulating\n\n     non-heterosexual marriages must be introduced to respond to the unique\n\n     challenges they face; and\n\n\nm.   This Court can use its power under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 142</a> to fill legislative vacuums to\n\n     the limited extent of laying down procedural guidelines. The court cannot\n\n     create substantive rights and obligations to fill a legislative vacuum because\n\n     it would amount to judicial legislation. This Court can neither direct the\n\n     legislature to enact a law nor direct the legislature when to enact a law. These\n\n     are established parameters of separation of powers and must be respected.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\n44.     Mr. Arvind P Datar, learned senior counsel appearing for one of intervenors\n\nmade the following submissions:\n\n\na.    This Court has recognised the right to marry in KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra),\n\n      Shafin Jahan (supra), Shakti Vahini (supra) and Navtej (supra). However,\n\n      only Justice Nariman’s opinion in Navtej (supra) held that non-heterosexual\n\n      couples also have a right to marry;\n\n\nb.    A statute can be struck down after a passage of time only if the rationale of\n\n      the law ceases to exist as in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 377</a> of the IPC where medical\n\n      research indicated that same sex relationships are not unnatural or against\n\n      the order of nature;\n\n\nc.    This Court while interpreting provisions of a statute can “iron out the creases\n\n      but not alter the fabric.” The exercise of reading up can only be undertaken\n\n      by the Courts when it would be consistent with legislative intention, when it\n\n      would not alter the nature of the enactment, and when the new state of affairs\n\n      would be of the same kind as the earlier state of affairs to which the enactment\n\n      applies;\n\n\nd.    The judgment of the High Court of Madras in Arunkumar (supra) interpreting\n\n      the word “bride” in the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_174\">Hindu Marriage Act</a> to include transgender and intersex\n\n      persons is contrary to the judgment of this Court in Madhu Kishwar v. State\n\n      of Bihar 59 where it was held that male pronouns must not be expansively\n\n      interpreted to include female pronouns within their ambit;\n\n\n\n59 (1996) 5 SCC 125\n\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\f                                                                                   PART B\n\ne.    The legal recognition of non-heterosexual unions is a polycentric issue which\n\n      cannot be resolved solely by the judiciary;\n\n\nf.    Unenumerated rights or derivate rights, which are recognised by courts\n\n      through judicial interpretation are inchoate rights because they are an\n\n      exception to the rule of ubi jus ibi remedium. 60 Thus, even if this Court\n\n      recognises the petitioners’ right to marry, it is not enforceable.\n\n\n45.     Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for one\n\nof the intervenors made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 21</a> guarantees that every child will have the best upbringing. The\n\n      petitioners have not submitted any data to prove that the interests of the child\n\n      would be protected if they are raised by non-heterosexual parents. A child\n\n      born to a heterosexual couple is innately adaptable to a similar family\n\n      environment and naturally seeks out a family environment which is\n\n      comparable to their birth family;\n\n\nb.    <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_176\">Chapter II of the JJ Act</a> which lays down the General Principles of Care and\n\n      Protection of Children stresses upon the best interest of the child. Principle\n\n      xiii states that every child in the juvenile justice system has a right to be\n\n      restored to the same socio-economic and cultural status as they were earlier\n\n      in;\n\n\nc.    Men and women are differentiated for the purpose of adoption, assisted\n\n      reproduction, and surrogate reproduction. For example, the law does not\n\n\n60 HM Seervai, The Privy Purse Case: A Criticisum, (1972) 74 Bom LR (journal) 37\n\n\n\n\n                                                     58\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\n      permit a man to adopt a girl child. The scheme of the laws relating to adoption\n\n      and surrogacy must be revamped for the inclusion of any of the excluded\n\n      categories of intending parents; and\n\n\nd.    The law protects a child by assuming that they are incapable of entering in\n\n      contracts, of committing an offence, and of consenting to a sexual\n\n      relationship. Thus, children cannot be imposed upon with emerging and\n\n      evolving notions of gender fluidity. Children cannot be made guinea pigs of\n\n      an evolving social experiment. The state is justified in prescribing reasonable\n\n      restrictions for adoption, assisted reproductive technology, and surrogacy\n\n      based on the welfare of children.\n\n\n46.    Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    Only thirty-four of the one hundred and ninety-four countries have recognised\n\n      marriage between non-heterosexual individuals. Out of the thirty-four\n\n      countries, the legislature has recognized it in twenty-four of them. At least\n\n      twenty of the twenty-four countries enacted a framework for registered\n\n      partnerships or civil unions for granting legal recognition to non-heterosexual\n\n      unions. In ten countries, the courts have directed the State to recognise non-\n\n      heterosexual marriages. The approach taken by the courts in these ten\n\n      countries is not uniform. The approach is specific to social complexities and\n\n      legal arrangements in each of the countries;\n\n\nb.    The laws relating to marriage, and the benefits (and rights) which accrue\n\n      because of marriage are not uniform. The laws take into account religious and\n\n\n                                          59\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n     regional differences. The principle of non-discrimination in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_177\">Article 14</a> and\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_178\">15(1)</a> does not mandate that marriage must be organised and recognised in\n\n     a uniform manner. The principle of equality does not postulate uniformity;\n\n\nc.   The principle of non-discrimination in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 14</a> is not violated if the law is not\n\n     “all-embracing.” The legislature can choose to remedy certain degrees of\n\n     harm;\n\n\nd.   It is for the legislature to decide if non-heterosexual unions must be legally\n\n     recognised, and what benefits and entitlements must be conferred to the\n\n     union;\n\n\ne.   Legislations governing unions and the benefits which accrue because of\n\n     unions do not become unconstitutional after the decriminalisation of\n\n     homosexuality in Navtej (supra). Decriminalisation of a sexual offence does\n\n     not automatically confer legal recognition to a union;\n\n\nf.   The opinion of the majority in Navtej (supra) held that homosexuals have a\n\n     right to form a union under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 21.</a> This Court specifically observed that a\n\n     union does not mean marriage. Thus, Navtej (supra) has ruled out the\n\n     possibility of non-heterosexual marriages; and\n\n\ng.   The observation in Puttaswamy (9J) (supra) that the State has a positive\n\n     obligation to provide legal protection to enable the exercise of choice was\n\n     limited to the specific context of data protection. Such an obligation can be\n\n     imposed on the State only when a right is infringed because of actions of the\n\n     State.\n\n\n\n                                          60\n\f                                                                           PART B\n\n47.    Mr. Maninder Singh, learned senior counsel, submitted that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 112</a> of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act 1872 which provides that birth during the sustenance of\n\nmarriage or two hundred and eighty days after the dissolution of marriage is a\n\nconclusive proof of legitimacy establishes that procreation is a chief component of\n\nmarriage. He further submitted that an alteration of the chief component of\n\nmarriage would render other laws which are premised on the heteronormative\n\nnature of marriage unworkable.\n\n\n48.    Mr. Atamaram Nadkarni, senior counsel appearing for an intervenor (Akhil\n\nBharatiya Sant Samiti) submitted that the SMA is interwoven with personal law. He\n\nargued that the recognition of non-heterosexual marriages under the SMA would\n\nimpact personal laws on succession, and adoption.\n\n\n49.    Ms. Manisha Lavkumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of\n\nGujarat made the following submissions:\n\n\na.    Though the rules of marriage continue to evolve, they are still grounded in\n\n      heterosexual relationships;\n\n\nb.    There is an overarching State interest in excluding non-heterosexual unions\n\n      from the ambit of marriage because it: (a) regulates matrimonial conduct; (b)\n\n      preserves social order; and (c) ensures the progression of society in a\n\n      legitimate manner;\n\n\nc.    The State can impose reasonable restrictions on individual autonomy and\n\n      consent by introducing conditions such as the number of marriages, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        61\n\f                                                                            PART B\n\n      minimum age for marriage and the degrees of prohibited relationship. The\n\n      heterosexual nature of a relationship is one such reasonable restriction; and\n\n\nd.    The FMA is modelled on the SMA. The FMA also envisages a heterosexual\n\n      union. <a href=\"/doc/1773422/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 23</a> of the FMA states that the Central Government may\n\n      recognise marriages solemnised in a foreign country as valid in India only if\n\n      the law in the foreign country on marriage is similar to the FMA. Since the\n\n      FMA only includes heterosexual unions, a non-heterosexual marriage\n\n      solemnised in a foreign country cannot be recognised in India.\n\n\n50.    Mr. J Sai Deepak, learned counsel appearing on behalf of an intervenor\n\nmade the following submissions:\n\n\na.    A judicial sanctioned legal recognition of non-heterosexual union would be a\n\n      colonial top-down imposition of morality. Such an approach would diminish\n\n      democratic voices in the process;\n\n\nb.    The issue of lack of legal recognition of non-heterosexual unions is placed\n\n      differently as opposed to the legislative vacuum on sexual harassment at\n\n      workplaces. The history and purpose of the SMA does not permit the Court\n\n      to issue guidelines under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 141</a> as it did in Vishaka (supra). The power\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 141</a> to issue guidelines must be used sparingly. The power must\n\n      not be used to take over the functions of the other organs of the State;\n\n\nc.    The judgments of this Court in NALSA (supra) and the Madras High Court in\n\n      Arun Kumar (supra) suffer from internal and external inconsistencies; and\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\nd.      The LGBTQIA+ community is not a homogenous class. The court cannot\n\n        cater to the interests of a heterogenous class which they constitute. The\n\n        legislature would be better placed to cater to their needs.\n\n\n51.      Mr. MR Shamshad, learned counsel appearing for an intervenor submitted\n\nthat a declaration that non-heterosexual couples have a right to marry would\n\nconflict with the tenets of religion where marriage is considered a heterosexual\n\nunion.\n\n\n52.      Ms. Priya Aristotle, learned counsel appearing for an intervenor submitted\n\nthat granting non-heterosexual couples parental rights would affect the children of\n\nheterosexual couples.\n\n\n53.      Mr. Sasmit Patra, learned counsel appearing for the intervenor submitted\n\nthat:\n\n\na.      Granting legal recognition to non-heterosexual unions would require wide\n\n        ranging amendments to various laws. It is only the legislature which has the\n\n        capacity and functionality to deal with matters of such wide implication;\n\n\nb.      A declaration by this Court that non-heterosexual unions have a right to marry\n\n        cannot be implemented without the aid of the legislature and executive; and\n\n\nc.      A social change of this magnitude will not be fructified if the role of the polity\n\n        in the process is negligent.\n\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\f                                                                             PART C\n\n54.    Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, learned counsel appearing for an intervenor (Ex-\n\nServicemen Advocates Welfare Association) submitted that non-heterosexual\n\nmarriages must not be permitted particularly for personnel working in the armed\n\nforces because <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 33</a> permits restrictions on their fundamental rights. It was\n\nsubmitted that granting legal recognition to non-heterosexual marriages may dilute\n\nthe disciplinary code in the army, the navy, and the air force, would create conflicts\n\nin the workplace over personal and religious beliefs, and would raise concerns\n\nabout shared facilities such as communal showers and shared rooms.\n\n\n55.    Ms. Manisha Narain Agarwal, learned counsel appearing for an intervenor\n\nsubmitted that the petitioners are seeking social acceptance of their relationships\n\nthrough an order the Court. This Court does not have powers of such magnitude.\n\n\n56.    Mr. Atulesh Kumar, Ms. Sanjeevani Agarwal, and Mr. Som Thomas\n\nappearing on behalf of various intervenors adopted the above arguments.\n\n\nC.     Reliefs sought in the proceedings\n\n\n57.    The petitioners in this batch of petitions have made certain general prayers,\n\nin addition to the prayers specific to the facts of their case. The general reliefs\n\nsought are summarized below.

Analysis\n\n\n       i.    This Court is vested with the authority to hear this case\n\n\n59.    The respondents argued that this Court should not decide the issue of\n\nwhether legal recognition in the form of marriage can be given to non-heterosexual\n\nrelationships. It was argued that this issue must necessarily be decided by the\n\npeople by themselves or through the elected representatives. It was also submitted\n\nthat this Court, by deciding the issue one way or the other, would pre-empt any\n\ndebate in the legislature.\n\n\n60.    The respondent’s submission is two-fold: first, the Court does not have the\n\npower to decide this issue; and second, such a decision can be arrived at only\n\nthrough a process that reflects the electoral will.\n\n\n            a. <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 32</a> vests this Court with the power to enforce the rights in Part\n\n              III of the Constitution\n\n\n61.    Part III of the Constitution of India enshrines the fundamental rights of the\n\npeople of India. <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 13</a> of the Constitution stipulates that the State shall not\n\nmake any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred in Part III and that\n\nany law made in contravention of this condition, shall, to the extent of the\n\n\n\n\n                                           68\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\ncontravention, be void. <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 32</a> complements <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 13</a> and provides the right to\n\na constitutional remedy for the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III:\n\n\n                    “Article 32. Remedies for the enforcement of rights\n                    conferred by this Part.\n\n\n                    (1) The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate\n                    proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred\n                    by this Part is guaranteed.\n\n\n                    (2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue\n                    directions or orders or writs, including writs in the\n                    nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo\n                    warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for\n                    the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.”\n\n\n                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n62.     The Constitution of India is unique in that its provisions expressly accord the\n\njudiciary with the power to review the actions of the legislative and executive\n\nbranches of government, unlike in many other countries. <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 32</a> makes\n\nfundamental rights justiciable and is worded broadly. The right to approach this\n\nCourt for the enforcement of the fundamental rights embodied in Part III is itself a\n\nfundamental right by virtue of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_217\">Article 32.</a> It states that this Court may\n\nbe moved “by appropriate proceedings.” This expression means that the\n\nappropriateness of the proceedings depends on the relief sought by the\n\npetitioner. 61 Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_218\">Article 32</a> does not place any constraints on the power\n\nof this Court to entertain claims that the rights enumerated in Part III have been\n\nviolated.\n\n\n\n\n61 Daryao v. State of U.P, (1962) 1 SCR 574\n\n\n\n\n                                                  69\n\f                                                                                      PART D\n\n63.     Similarly, Clause (2) is worded expansively and enlarges the scope of the\n\npowers of this Court to enforce fundamental rights. This is evident from two parts\n\nof the clause:\n\n\na.    First, Clause (2) provides this Court with the power to issue “directions,\n\n      orders, or writs,” which indicates that this Court may mould the relief\n\n      according to the requirements of the case before it and that it is not\n\n      constrained to a particular set of cases in which a particular relief or set of\n\n      reliefs may be granted. This expression indicates that the power of this Court\n\n      is not limited to striking down an offending statute, rule, or policy. Rather, it\n\n      extends to issuing directions or orders or writs for the enforcement of\n\n      fundamental rights. Put differently, this means that the power of this Court is\n\n      not only ‘negative’ in the sense that it may restrain the state from doing\n\n      something which infringes upon the fundamental rights of people but is also\n\n      ‘positive’ in the sense that it may compel the state to do something or act in a\n\n      manner which gives effect to such rights; and\n\n\nb.    Second, the word “including” in Clause (2) indicates that the five writs\n\n      mentioned in that clause are illustrative. The word “including” is used as a\n\n      word of enlargement. This Court may issue directions, orders, or writs other\n\n      than the five writs specified. 62\n\n\nTherefore, the manner in which <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 32</a> has been drafted does not limit the\n\npowers of this Court. To the contrary, it clearly and unambiguously vests this Court\n\n\n\n\n62 State of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571\n\n\n\n\n                                                      70\n\f                                                                                              PART D\n\nwith the power to conduct judicial review and give effect to the fundamental rights\n\nenumerated in Part III.\n\n\n64.     The extent of the powers vested in this Court by <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 32</a> as envisaged by\n\nthe framers of the Constitution can be understood from the Constituent Assembly’s\n\ndiscussion of the provision which was eventually adopted as <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 32.63</a> Mr. H V\n\nKamath was of the opinion that it was unwise to particularize the writs which this\n\nCourt ought to issue, and that this Court should have the power to issue any\n\ndirections it considered appropriate in a case.64 In service of this idea, he moved\n\nan amendment to substitute clause (2) of the provision which is now <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 32.</a> The\n\nsubstituted clause was to read:\n\n\n                “The Supreme Court shall have power to issue such directions\n                or orders or writs as it may consider necessary or appropriate\n                for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this\n                part.” 65\n\n\n65.     Responding to this proposal, Dr. B R Ambedkar underscored that this Court\n\nhad been endowed with wide powers of a general nature:\n\n\n                “…what has been done in the draft is to give general power\n                as well as to propose particular remedies. The language of\n                the article is very clear … These are quite general and wide\n                terms.\n\n                … these writs … ought to be mentioned by their name in the\n                Constitution without prejudice to the right of the Supreme\n                Court to do justice in some other way if it felt it was\n                desirable to do so. I, therefore, say that Mr. Kamath need\n                have no ground of complaint on that account.” 66\n\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n63 Vikram Aditya Narayan and Jahnavi Sindhu, ‘A historical argument for proportionality under the Indian\nConstitution’ (2018) Vol. 2(1) ILR 51\n64 Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 7, 9 December 1948.\n65 Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 7, 9 December 1948.\n66 Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume 7, 9 December 1948.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  71\n\f                                                                                           PART D\n\nThe power of this Court to do justice is not, therefore, limited either by the manner\n\nin which <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 32</a> has been constructed or by any part of the Constitution. It is\n\namply clear from both the plain meaning of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 32</a> as well as the Constituent\n\nAssembly Debates that this Court has the power to issue directions, orders, or writs\n\nfor the enforcement of the rights incorporated in Part III of the Constitution.\n\n\n            b. Judicial review and separation of powers\n\n\n66.     The doctrine of separation of powers, as it is traditionally understood, means\n\nthat each of the three organs of the state (the legislature, the executive, and the\n\njudiciary) perform distinct functions in distinct spheres. No branch performs the\n\nfunction of any other branch. The traditional understanding of this doctrine (also\n\ntermed the “pure doctrine” 67) does not animate the functioning of most modern\n\ndemocracies. That our Constitution does not reflect a rigid understanding of this\n\ndoctrine has long been acknowledged by this Court. 68 In practice, a functional and\n\nnuanced version of this doctrine operates, where the essential functions of one\n\narm of the state are not taken over by another arm and institutional comity guides\n\nthe actions of each arm. 69 In other words, the functional understanding of the\n\nseparation of powers demands that no arm of the state reigns supreme over\n\nanother.\n\n\n67.     Thu Union of India suggested that this Court would be violating the doctrine\n\nof separation of powers if it determines the lis in this case. The separation of\n\npowers undoubtedly forms a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, but\n\n\n67 MJC Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers (2nd ed. Liberty Fund 1967).\n68 Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab, (1955) 2 SCR 225\n69 Kalpana Mehta v. Union of India, (2018) 7 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                      72\n\f                                                                                      PART D\n\nequally, the power of courts to conduct judicial review is also a basic feature of the\n\nConstitution. 70 The doctrine of separation of powers certainly does not operate as\n\na bar against judicial review. 71 In fact, judicial review promotes the separation of\n\npowers by seeing to it that no organ acts in excess of its constitutional mandate. It\n\nensures that each organ acts within the bounds of its remit. Further, as discussed\n\nin the previous segment of this judgment, the Constitution demands that this Court\n\nconduct judicial review and enforce the fundamental rights of the people. The\n\nframers of our Constitution were no doubt conscious of this doctrine when they\n\nprovided for the power of judicial review. Being aware of its existence and what it\n\npostulates, they chose to adopt <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 32</a> which vests this Court with broad powers.\n\nThe doctrine of separation of powers cannot, therefore, stand in the way of this\n\nCourt issuing directions, orders, or writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights.\n\nThe directions, orders, or writs issued for this purpose cannot encroach upon the\n\ndomain of the legislature. This Court cannot make law, it can only interpret it and\n\ngive effect to it.\n\n\n68.     The existence of the power of judicial review cannot be conflated with the\n\nmanner in which the power is exercised. The exercise of the power of judicial\n\nreview abides by settled restraints which acknowledge that the power of law\n\nmaking is entrusted to democratically elected legislative bodies and that the\n\nformulation and implementation of policy is entrusted to a government which is\n\naccountable to the legislature. In the exercise of its the legislative function the\n\nlegislature may incorporate policies which will operate as binding rules of conduct\n\n\n\n70 S P Sampath Kumar v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 124\n71 State of W.B. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571\n\n\n\n\n                                                      73\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nto operate in social, economic and political spaces. Judicial review is all about\n\nadjudicating the validity of legislative or executive action (or inaction) on the anvil\n\nof the fundamental freedoms incorporated in Part III and on the basis of\n\nconstitutional provisions which structure and limit the exercise of power by the\n\nlegislative and executive arms of the State.\n\n\n69.     Judicial review is a constitutionally entrenched principle which emanates\n\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 13.</a> It is not a judicial construct. The power of judicial review has been\n\nexpressly conferred by the Constitution. In the exercise of the power of judicial\n\nreview, the Court is cognizant of the fact that the legislature is a democratically\n\nelected body which is mandated to carry out the will of the people. It is in\n\nfurtherance of this mandate that Parliament and the State legislatures enact laws.\n\nCourts are empowered to adjudicate upon the validity of legislation and\n\nadministrative action on the anvil of the Constitution. In the exercise of the power\n\nof judicial review, the Court does not design legislative policy or enter upon the\n\nlegislative domain. This Court, will hence not enter into the legislative domain by\n\nissuing directions which for all intents and purposes would amount to enacting law\n\nor framing policy.\n\n\n           c. The power of this Court to enforce rights under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_227\">Article 32</a> is different\n\n              from the power of the legislature to enact laws\n\n\n70.     In Powers, Privileges and Immunities of State Legislatures, In re, 72 a seven-\n\nJudge Bench of this Court held:\n\n\n\n\n72 (1965) 1 SCR 413\n\n\n\n\n                                          74\n\f                                                                                  PART D\n\n               “…whether or not there is distinct and rigid separation of\n               powers under the Indian Constitution, there is no doubt that\n               the Constitution has entrusted to the Judicature in this country\n               the task of construing the provisions of the Constitution and of\n               safeguarding the fundamental rights of the citizens … If the\n               validity of any law is challenged before the courts, it is never\n               suggested that the material question as to whether legislative\n               authority has been exceeded or fundamental rights have been\n               contravened, can be decided by the legislatures themselves.\n               Adjudication of such a dispute is entrusted solely and\n               exclusively to the Judicature of this country…”\n\n\nHence, it falls squarely within the powers of this Court to adjudicate whether the\n\nfundamental rights of queer persons have been infringed, as claimed by the\n\npetitioners.\n\n\n71.    This Court will not issue a mandamus to Parliament but will determine the\n\nscope and effect of certain fundamental rights. What do these rights mean and\n\nwhat are their incidents? What do they require of the state? What are their\n\nboundaries? In answering these questions, this Court is not enacting law or framing\n\npolicy but is performing its constitutionally mandated function of interpreting the\n\nConstitution and enforcing the rights it recognizes. This Court cannot ignore its duty\n\nto fulfil the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_228\">Articles 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_229\">32.</a> The distinction between law-making and\n\nadjudicating the rights of the people by interpreting the Constitution and enforcing\n\nthese rights, as required by <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_230\">Article 32</a>, cannot be forgotten.\n\n\n72.    This Court has previously utilized its power under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 32</a> to issue\n\ndirections or orders for the enforcement of fundamental rights. This power does not\n\nextend only to striking down an offending legislation but also to issuing substantive\n\ndirections to give effect to fundamental rights, in certain situations. In Common\n\n\n\n\n                                                75\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\nCause v. Union of India, 73 a Constitution Bench of this Court (of which one of us,\n\nJustice D Y Chandrachud was a part) found that the right to life, dignity, self-\n\ndetermination, and individual autonomy meant that people had a right to die with\n\ndignity. This Court delineated guidelines and safeguards in terms of which Advance\n\nDirectives could be issued to cease medical treatment in certain circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, in Vishaka (supra) this Court issued guidelines for the protection of\n\nwomen from sexual harassment at the workplace. These guidelines were grounded\n\nin the fundamental rights to equality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_232\">Article 14</a>, to practise any profession or\n\nto carry out any occupation, trade or business under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>, and to life\n\nand liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_234\">Article 21.</a> The decisions of this Court in Common Cause (supra)\n\nand Vishaka (supra) are significant because this Court issued directions for the\n\nenforcement of fundamental rights in the absence of a law which was impugned\n\nbefore it.\n\n\n             d. The power of judicial review must be construed in terms of the\n\n               Constitution of India and not in terms of the position of law in other\n\n               jurisdictions\n\n\n73.     A common mistake in the legal community is to refer to the doctrines and\n\ndecisions of other jurisdictions regardless of the context in which they arose. The\n\njurisprudence of other countries no doubt facilitates an exchange of ideas and\n\nacquaints us with the best practices in the field. It illuminates the potential benefits\n\nand pitfalls of a particular approach and enables us to dwell on whether to accept\n\nand if we do so, whether to improve on that approach. However, a particular\n\n\n\n73 (2018) 5 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                           76\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\ndoctrine or legal standard ought not to be borrowed blindly. The first and foremost\n\nauthority is the Constitution or any law in India. An appropriate tool of interpretation\n\nmust be used to discern the law as laid down by the Constitution or by any statute,\n\nrule, or regulation. This precept applies with equal force to the question of judicial\n\nreview in India. Judicial review has to be conscious of our own social and cultural\n\nmilieu and its diversity.\n\n\n74.     Parliament being sovereign in England, the courts of England do not have\n\nthe power to strike down a statute as being contrary to its basic law. This status of\n\naffairs cannot, of course, be superimposed on the relationship between our\n\nlegislative bodies and courts. In Powers, Privileges and Immunities of State\n\nLegislatures, In re (supra), this Court held that the Constitution is supreme and\n\nsovereign in India and that legislative bodies in India are not sovereign in the same\n\nway as Parliament is in England. Hence, the limitations which apply to the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United Kingdom while it conducts judicial review do not apply to this\n\nCourt. Similarly, the restrictions on judicial review in the United States of America\n\ncannot be imported without any regard to our Constitution.\n\n\n75.     The Union of India relied on various decisions of the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States of America including the decisions in Day-Brite Lighting Inc. v.\n\nMissouri 74 and the dissenting opinion of Oliver Wendell Holmes, J. in Lochner v.\n\nNew York 75 for the proposition that this Court would be in danger of becoming a\n\n“super legislature” if it decided the issues which arise in the present proceedings.\n\nThis argument misses the crux of the matter. The Supreme Court of the United\n\n\n74 342 US 421 (1952)\n75 198 US 45 (1905)\n\n\n\n\n                                          77\n\f                                                                                        PART D\n\nStates of America established its power of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison. 76\n\nThe text of the US Constitution does not vest their courts with this power, unlike in\n\nIndia. The Constitution of India expressly authorises judicial review. While doing\n\nthis the Constitution confers broad powers on this Court as discussed in the\n\nprevious segment of this judgment. This being the case, it is injudicious to borrow\n\nfrom the jurisprudence of the US on judicial review, its boundaries, legitimacy, and\n\nthe type of cases which warrant deference to legislative bodies. In State of Madras\n\nv. V.G. Row, 77 a Constitution Bench of this Court held:\n\n\n                  “20. …we think it right to point out, what is sometimes\n                  overlooked, that our Constitution contains express provisions\n                  for judicial review of legislation as to its conformity with the\n                  Constitution, unlike as in America where the Supreme Court\n                  has assumed extensive powers of reviewing legislative Acts\n                  … If, then, the courts in this country face up to such important\n                  and none too easy task, it is not out of any desire to tilt at\n                  legislative authority in a crusader&#x27;s spirit, but in discharge of a\n                  duty plainly laid upon them by the Constitution.”\n\n\nSimilarly, in Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras,78 this Court held that there was\n\nno remedy in the US which was analogous to the one provided by <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_235\">Article 32</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. Therefore, the contours of the power of this Court to conduct\n\njudicial review must be construed in terms of the Constitution of India and not in\n\nterms of the position of law in other jurisdictions.\n\n\n           e. The role of courts in the democratic process\n\n\n76.     The argument of the respondents that any decision by this Court on this\n\nissue would be anti-democratic is not an argument that is specific to the issues\n\n\n\n76 5 US 137 (1803)\n77 (1952) 1 SCC 410\n78 1950 SCC 436\n\n\n\n\n                                                     78\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nwhich have been raised before us in this batch of petitions. Rather, it is an\n\nargument which strikes at the legitimacy of the judicial branch. The argument that\n\nthe decision of the elected branch is democratic and that of the judicial branch is\n\nnot is premised on the principle of electoral representation. The proposition is that\n\nthe exercise of the power of judicial review would constrain the right of citizens to\n\nparticipate in political processes. This is because courts are vested with the power\n\nto overturn the will of the people which is expressed through their elected\n\nrepresentatives.\n\n\n77.   This is a narrow definition of democracy, where democracy is viewed\n\nthrough electoral mandates and not in constitutional terms. Additionally, it\n\noverlooks the importance of a Constitution which prescribes underlying values and\n\nrules of governance for the sustenance of a democratic regime. If all decisions of\n\nthe elected wing of the State are considered to be democratic decisions purely\n\nbecause of the manner in which it is vested with power, what then, is the purpose\n\nof the fundamental rights and the purpose of vesting this Court with the power of\n\njudicial review? Framing the argument on the legitimacy of the decisions of this\n\nCourt purely in terms of electoral democracy ignores the Constitution itself and the\n\nvalues it seeks to engender.\n\n\n78.   Electoral democracy – the     process of elections based on the principle of\n\n‘one person one vote’ where all citizens who have the capacity to make rational\n\ndecisions (which the law assumes are those who have crossed the age of\n\neighteen) contribute towards collective decision making is a cardinal element of\n\nconstitutional democracy. Yet the Constitution does not confine the universe of a\n\n\n\n\n                                         79\n\f                                                                                                          PART D\n\nconstitutional democracy to an electoral democracy. Other institutions of\n\ngovernance have critical roles and functions in enhancing the values of\n\nconstitutional democracy.                The Constitution does not envisage a narrow and\n\nprocedural form of democracy. When the people of India entered into a social\n\ncontract in the form of a Constitution, they chose the conception of democracy\n\nwhich not only focused on rule by elected bodies but also on certain substantive\n\nvalues and on institutional governance. The Constitution defined democracy in\n\nterms of equal rights in political participation and of self-determination.\n\n\n79.      When democracy is viewed in this substantive and broad manner, the role\n\nof courts is not democracy-disabling but democracy-enabling.                                     Much like the\n\nelected branch, the legitimacy of courts is also rooted in democracy. It is rooted in\n\nnot operating in a democratic manner because if it was, then courts may be swayed\n\nby considerations which govern and guide electoral democracy.79 By vesting the\n\njudicial branch with the power to review the actions of other institutions of\n\ngovernance (including the legislature and the executive) on the touchstone of\n\nconstitutional values, the Constitution assigns a role to the judiciary. 80 The\n\ninstitutions of governance place a check on the exercise of power of the other\n\ninstitutions to further constitutional values and produce better, more democratic\n\noutcomes.\n\n\n80.      Courts contribute to the democratic process while deciding an issue based\n\non competing constitutional values, or when persons who are unable to exercise\n\n\n\n79 Robert M Cover, ‘The Origins of Judicial Activism in the Protection of Minorities’, 1982 Yale law journal, Vol 1(7)\n\nJune 1982\n80 Mathew EK Hall, Judicial Review as a Limit on Government Domination: Reframing, resolving, and replacing the\n\ncounter-majoritarian difficulty, 2016 Perspectives on politics, Volume 14(2) June 2016 , 391\n\n\n\n                                                         80\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\ntheir constitutional rights through the political process knock on its doors.

Is queerness ‘un-Indian’? Who is an Indian? What practices are Indian?\n\n\n            a. Queerness is a natural phenomenon which is known to India since\n\n              ancient times\n\n\n81.   The question of whether homosexuality or queerness is unnatural is no\n\nlonger res integra, in view of the decision in Navtej Singh Johar (supra) where\n\nthis Court held that it is innate and natural. The contention of the Union of India\n\nthat heterosexual unions precede law while homosexual unions do not cannot be\n\naccepted in view of the decision in Navtej Singh Johar (supra) where this Court\n\nheld that queer love has flourished in India since ancient times.\n\n\n82.   The respondents have also averred that homosexuality or gender\n\nqueerness is not native to India. This contention does not hold any water. In India,\n\npersons with a gender queer identity who do not fit into the binary of ‘male’ and\n\n‘female’ have long been known by different names including hijras, kothis,\n\naravanis, jogappas, thiru nambis, nupi maanbas and nupi maanbis. In fact, the\n\nterm ‘transgender person’ as it is understood in English or the ‘third gender’ does\n\nnot always fully or accurately describe the gender identity of those who are known\n\nby some of these terms. Additionally, the social structure of the communities of\n\ntransgender persons in India is unique and does not mirror ‘western’ structures. It\n\nis native to our country. The judgment of this Court in NALSA (supra) also explored\n\n\n                                          81\n\f                                                                                                      PART D\n\nthe presence of the transgender identity and other forms of gender queerness in\n\nIndian lore.\n\n\n83.       In With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India, 81 Gayatri\n\nReddy documents the different manifestations of kinship in hijra communities,\n\nincluding the guru-chela (or teacher-disciple) relationship, the mother-daughter\n\nrelationship, and the ‘jodi’ (or bond) with a husband. She describes how many\n\nhijras enter into unions with men, who are referred to as their ‘pantis.’ These unions\n\nspan over many months or many decades, depending on the couple in question.\n\nMany men in such unions have made their natal families aware about their\n\nrelationship with their partner, and in some cases, the hijras would sometimes meet\n\ntheir partner’s natal family. They sometimes referred to their relationship as one of\n\n‘marriage.’ Men also assaulted their partners and displayed other violent\n\ntendencies. Some hijras maintained contact with their biological family, most\n\nnotably the mother. Although many hijras were in romantic, long-lasting\n\npartnerships with men or in touch with their natal family, they considered other\n\nhijras as constituting their family as opposed to their ‘pantis’ or their biological\n\nfamilies. 82 In many communities, hijras are customarily invited to auspicious events\n\n(such as the birth of a child) to bless the family in question.\n\n\n84.       Like the English language, some English words employed to describe queer\n\nidentities may have originated in other countries. However, gender queerness,\n\ntransgenderism, homosexuality, and queer sexual orientations are natural, age-old\n\n\n\n81 Gayatri Reddy, With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India (The University of Chicago Press\n\n2005)\n82 ibid\n\n\n\n\n                                                       82\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nphenomena which have historically been present in India. They have not been\n\n‘imported’ from the ‘west.’ Moreover, if queerness is natural (which it is), it is by\n\ndefinition impossible for it to be borrowed from another culture or be an imitation of\n\nanother culture.\n\n\n            b. Queerness is not urban or elite\n\n\n85.     The respondents, including the Union of India, have contended that\n\nhomosexuality and queer gender identities or transgenderism are predominantly\n\npresent in urban areas and amongst the elite sections of society. They assert that\n\nvariations in gender and sexual identity are largely unknown to rural India and\n\namongst the working classes. Nothing could be further from the truth. While they\n\nmay not use the words “homosexuality,” “queer,” “lesbian,” “gay” or any other term\n\nwhich populates the lexicon of English-speaking persons, they enter into unions\n\nwith persons of the same sex as them or with gender queer persons; these unions\n\nare often long-lasting, and the couple performs a marriage ceremony. The\n\nincidence of queerness amongst the rural and working-class communities has\n\nbeen documented in academic scholarship as well as newspaper reports. In the\n\nabsence of evidence aliunde, the details narrated in newspaper reports are not\n\nfacts which are proved in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_236\">Indian Evidence Act</a> 1872. 83 However, in\n\ncases (such as the present one) which require this Court to examine social\n\nphenomena and their incidence, newspaper reports serve as a useful tool in the\n\nexercise of illuminating social realities.\n\n\n\n\n83 Laxmi Raj Shetty v.

This Court need look no further than the petitioners in this case to illustrate\n\nthe point that queerness is neither urban nor elite:\n\n\na.    One of the petitioners grew up in Durgapur, West Bengal and Delhi and states\n\n      that she came to terms with her sexuality when she was an adult. Another\n\n      petitioner in the same case grew up in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh and states\n\n      that she knew that she was a lesbian from a young age;\n\n\nb.    One of the petitioners hails from Muktsar, Punjab and happens to be OBC.\n\n      Another petitioner in the same case happens to be Dalit. They come from\n\n      working class backgrounds;\n\n\nc.    Another petitioner was born in Mumbai to Catholic parents. She attempted to\n\n      die by suicide and later had to beg on the streets in order to survive;\n\n\nd.    Some petitioners before this Court are transgender persons and activists.\n\n      One of them is a public personality – Akkai Padmashali. She hails from a non-\n\n      English speaking, working class background. At a young age, she left home.\n\n      She worked as an assistant in a shop selling ceramics but quit because she\n\n      unable to hide her true gender identity. Circumstance forced her to become a\n\n      sex worker to sustain herself. Later, she was awarded the Karnataka\n\n      Rajyotsava Award, Karnataka’s second highest civilian award, for her\n\n      contribution to social service.\n\n\ne.    Yet another petitioner who is a transgender person was born in a family of\n\n      farmers who grew coconuts and betel leaves. She later worked in a factory.\n\n\n\n\n                                          84\n\f                                                                                                  PART D\n\n       In her case, too, circumstance forced her to become a sex worker.

Ruth Vanita, an academician, studied the history of queer marriage in India\n\nin her scholarly works.

Two young women who were classmates fell in love. One of them underwent\n\n       a sex reassignment surgery in 1989. The two then married each other but one\n\n       of their fathers (a wireless operator) opposed their union. He filed a complaint\n\n       stating that the partner of his child had abducted her. When the young woman\n\n       was produced in court, she stated that she wished to live with her husband.\n\n       She was then released and the couple proceeded to live together;\n\n\nb.

Also in 2004, a twenty-one year old Christian woman and a twenty-three year\n\n      old Hindu woman from a southern state in India declared their life-long\n\n      commitment to one another after a tabloid alleged that they were lesbians;\n\n\ng.    Two young Muslim men (one aged twenty-two and the other aged twenty-\n\n      eight) married in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.

Two nurses in Patel Nagar, Delhi met as students, fell in love, declared that\n\n      they were life partners, and decided to live together.

In its attempt to address whether\n\nhomosexuality is a ‘western’ concept or is restricted to the socioeconomically\n\nprivileged classes, it asserts that the queer community is not a “coherent, easily\n\ndefinable group.”91 The report details the various lived experiences of gay men and\n\nlesbian women, information regarding which was collected by interviewing them.

In Loving Women: Being Lesbian in Unprivileged India, 94 Maya Sharma\n\ngives an account of various persons (most of whom are women) in same-sex or\n\nqueer relationships. The book was written after detailed interviews with its subjects,\n\n\n\n\n92 ibid\n93 Vanita (n 85)\n94 Maya Sharma, Loving Women: Being Lesbian in Unprivileged India (Yoda Press, 2006)\n\n\n\n\n                                                   88\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nand focuses on working class persons. The author explains that one of the\n\npurposes of the book was to:\n\n\n             “… dispel the myth that lesbians in India were all urban,\n             Westernised and came from the upper and middle classes.”\n\n\nThe author also highlights that public discourse has not created space for the\n\nvoices and experiences of persons from the LGBTQ community who also belong\n\nto marginalized communities:\n\n\n             “… the lives of most of our subjects are equally distant and\n             alienated from upperclass, urban Indian as well as all Western\n             representations of homosexuality, and their personal\n             struggles, which cannot be separated from their\n             socioeconomic struggles and traditional contexts, are largely\n             unmirrored and therefore remain largely unknown.”\n\n\nThe book variously gives accounts of women in queer relationships from different\n\nreligions and communities, hailing from different parts of the country. They or their\n\nfamily members worked as domestic workers, factory workers, construction\n\nlabourers, and Home Guards, amongst other professions.\n\n\n92.   The discussion in this segment has not scratched the surface of the rich\n\nhistory of the lives of LGBTQ persons in India, which continue into the present. Yet,\n\neven the limited exploration of the literature and reportage on the subject makes it\n\nabundantly clear that homosexuality or queerness is not solely an urban concept,\n\nnor is it restricted to the upper classes or privileged communities. The discussion\n\nin the preceding paragraphs reveals the diversity of the queer population. People\n\nmay be queer regardless of whether they are from villages, small towns, or semi-\n\nurban and urban spaces. Similarly, they may be queer regardless of their caste\n\nand economic location. It is not just the English-speaking man with a white-collar\n\n\n                                             89\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\njob who lives in a metropolitan city and is otherwise affluent who can lay claim to\n\nbeing queer but also (and equally) the woman who works in a farm in an agricultural\n\ncommunity. Persons may or may not identify with the labels ‘queer,’ ‘gay,’ ‘lesbian,’\n\n‘trans,’ etc. either because they speak languages which are not English or for other\n\nreasons, but the fact remains that many Indians are gender queer or enter into\n\nrelationships with others of the same sex. In the words of a person (assigned\n\nfemale at birth) who worked at a factory in Ajmer:\n\n\n                “You ask if I have heard the word “lesbian”. No, I have not\n                heard it. … I consider myself a male. I am attracted to women.\n                Why create categories, such deep differences between male\n                and female? Only our bodies make us different. We are all\n                human beings, aren&#x27;t we? … When a human being is born, he\n                does not know anything. He is told, “These are your parents,\n                sisters, father and brothers”. Similarly we are told, “You are\n                boys, and you are girls”. But I say I am a man. I choose to be\n                one. Despite our physical differences, we can be who we want\n                to be and do what we want to do. … But the final analysis, we\n                are all the same, we are all human beings, we are all equal,\n                regardless of what kind of bodies we have. This common\n                factor should be considered, not the ways in which we are\n                different.” 95\n\n\n93.       To imagine queer persons as existing only in urban and affluent spaces is\n\nto erase them even as they exist in other parts of the country. It would also be a\n\nmistake to conflate the ‘urban’ with the ‘elite.’ This renders invisible large segments\n\nof the population who live in urban spaces but are poor or otherwise marginalized.\n\nUrban centres are themselves geographically and socially divided along the lines\n\nof class, religion, and caste and not all those who live in cities can be termed elite\n\nmerely by virtue of their residence in cities.\n\n\n\n\n95 ibid\n\n\n\n\n                                                90\n\f                                                                                                       PART D\n\n94.      Finally, it is essential to recognize that expressions of queerness may be\n\nmore visible in urban centres for a variety of reasons. For one, cities may afford\n\ntheir inhabitants a degree of anonymity, which permit them to live their true lives or\n\nexpress themselves freely. This may not always be possible in smaller towns or\n\nvillages, where the families or communities of queer persons may subject them to\n\ncensure and disapprobation, or worse.96 The experiences of queer persons may\n\nalso be more visible in urban spaces because such persons have greater access\n\nto the various resources required to make one’s voice heard. This only means that\n\nthe marginalized are yet to be heard when they speak and not that they do not\n\nexist. This is not to say that society does not inflict violence upon the LGBTQ\n\ncommunity in cities but only to indicate potential reasons for their increased\n\nvisibility in cities. In conclusion, queerness is not urban or elite. Persons of any\n\ngeographic location or background may be queer.\n\n\n            c. The rise of Victorian morality in colonial India and the reasons for the\n\n                re-assertion of the queer identity\n\n\n95.      In pre-colonial times, the Indian subcontinent was home to a diverse\n\npopulation with its own, unique understanding of sexuality, companionship,\n\nmorality and love. Stories, history, myths, and cultural practices in India indicate\n\nthat what we now term ‘queerness’ was present in pre-colonial India. It would not\n\nbe a faithful description of the times to say that queerness was “accepted” by the\n\npopulace. Rather, society did not often view (many manifestations of) the queer\n\n\n\n96 For instance, many transmen migrate from villages to metropolitan cities to escape violence and discrimination.\n\nAgaja Puthan Purayil, ‘“Families We Choose”: Kinship Patterns among Migrant Transmen in Bangalore, India’ in\nDouglas A Vakoch (ed.), Transgender India: Understanding Third Gender Identities and Experiences (Springer\n2022)\n\n\n\n                                                       91\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nidentity as something that required acceptance to begin with because it formed a\n\npart of ordinary, day-to-day life, similar to the heterosexual or cisgender identities.\n\nThis was true for many parts of the country at many points of time, though perhaps\n\nnot everywhere and at all times. This is not to suggest that society did not inflict\n\nany violence upon members of the LBGTQ community in pre-colonial times.\n\nRather, it is to highlight that current beliefs, attitudes, and practices which are\n\nhostile to the LGBTQ community are not necessarily natural successors of the\n\npast.\n\n\n96.      The native way of life gradually changed with the entry of the British, who\n\nbrought with them their own sense of morality. It was not their morality alone that\n\nthey brought with them but also their laws. This Court discussed the legal legacy\n\nof the colonizers at length in National Legal Services Authority (supra) and\n\nNavtej Singh Johar (supra). To recapitulate, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 377</a> of the IPC inter alia\n\ncriminalized queer sexual acts and in so doing, imposed the morality of the British\n\non the Indian cultural landscape. The British also enacted the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_238\">Criminal Tribes Act</a>\n\n1871 97 to provide for the “registration, surveillance and control of certain criminal\n\ntribes and eunuchs.” 98 It permitted the government to declare a group of persons\n\na “criminal tribe” if it was of the opinion that the group was “addicted to the\n\nsystematic commission of non-bailable offences.” 99 <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_239\">Part II of the Criminal Tribes\n\nAct</a> regulated transgender persons (which it referred to as ‘eunuchs’) and subjected\n\nthem to enormous indignity inter alia by permitting the government to medically\n\nexamine them, providing for harsh penalties if they dressed “like a woman” or\n\n\n97 “<a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_240\">Criminal Tribes Act</a>”\n98 Preamble, Criminal Tribes Act\n99 <a href=\"/doc/26818820/\" id=\"a_241\">Section 2</a>, Criminal Tribes Act\n\n\n\n\n                                          92\n\f                                                                                                    PART D\n\ndanced or played music, preventing them from making gifts, and rendering their\n\nwills invalid. Although the Criminal Tribes Act was repealed by the government\n\nafter independence, its underlying prejudices seem to continue in various central\n\nand state enactments on ‘habitual offenders.’\n\n\n97.     The criminalization of the LGBTQ community and their resultant prosecution\n\nand conviction under these laws 100 coupled with the violence enabled by these\n\nlaws drove large sections of the community underground and into the proverbial\n\ncloset. Society stigmatized any sexual orientation which was not heterosexual and\n\nany gender identity which was not cisgender. Persons with an atypical gender\n\nidentity and / or sexual orientation were therefore compelled to conceal their true\n\nselves from the world. Their presence in the public sphere gradually shrunk even\n\nas homophobia and transphobia flourished. Despite their alienation from\n\nmainstream society, many queer persons continued to live their lives in ways that\n\nwere visible to the public eye. Indeed, many of them (such as hijras) often did not\n\nhave a choice but to do so. Others expressed their sexual orientation only in the\n\ncomfort of their homes, in the presence of their families and friends. Yet others led\n\ndouble lives – they pretended to be heterosexual in public and while with their\n\nfamilies and made their sexual orientation known to a select few persons, who\n\nwere often themselves of an atypical sexual orientation. Some people entered into\n\n‘lavender marriages’ or ‘front marriages’ which are marriages of convenience\n\nmeant to conceal the sexual orientation of one or both partners.\n\n\n\n\n100 See, for instance, Queen Empress v. Khairati, ILR (1884) 6 All 204; (Meharban) Nowshirwan Irani v. Emperor,\n\nAIR 1934 Sind. 206; D P Minwalla v. Emperor, AIR 1935 Sind. 78.\n\n\n\n                                                      93\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n98.    It is evident that it is not queerness which is of foreign origin but that many\n\nshades of prejudice in India are remnants of a colonial past. Colonial laws and\n\nconvictions engendered discriminatory attitudes which continue into the present.\n\nThose who suggest that queerness is borrowed from foreign soil point to the\n\nrelatively recent increase in the expression of queer identities as evidence of the\n\nfact that queerness is ‘new,’ ‘modern,’ or ‘borrowed.’ Persons who champion this\n\nview overlook two vital details. The first is that this recent visibility of queerness is\n\nnot an assertion of an entirely novel identity but the reassertion of an age-old one.\n\nThe second factor is that establishment of a democratic nation-state and the\n\nconcomitant nurturing of democratic systems and values over six decades has\n\nenabled more queer persons to exercise their inherent rights. An environment has\n\nbeen fostered which is conducive to queer persons expressing themselves without\n\nthe fear of opprobrium. This Court also recognizes that queer persons have\n\nthemselves been crucial in the project of fostering such an environment. The\n\nconstitutional guarantees of liberty and equality have gradually been made\n\navailable to an increasing number of people. This seems to be true across the\n\nworld – the global turn towards democracy has created the conditions for the\n\nempowerment of queer people everywhere. Progress has perhaps been\n\ninconsistent, non-linear, and at a less than ideal pace but progress there has been.\n\nWe must recognize the vital role of Indian society in contributing to the evolving\n\nsocial mores. The evolution may at times seem imperceptible, but surely it is.\n\n\n\n\n                                           94\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\n             d. Who is an Indian and what practices are Indian?\n\n\n99.    The tenor of the arguments put forth by some of the respondents implied\n\nthat a union between two persons of the same sex is not Indian. To determine\n\nwhether this contention is correct, it is necessary to query when something or\n\nsomeone is ‘Indian.’ This question is all the more important in a country as diverse\n\nas ours, with twenty-eight States, eight Union Territories, a population of more than\n\none billion persons, twenty-two languages recognized by the Constitution and\n\nscores more which are spoken by its people, at least eight religions, tribal and non-\n\ntribal populations, and varying cultures which are sometimes at odds with one\n\nanother.\n\n\nA thing, an occurrence, or a practice is ‘Indian’ when it is present in India, takes\n\nplace here, or is practised by Indian citizens. Something which is Indian could be\n\npresent from time immemorial or it could be a recent development. Regardless,\n\nthis is not a game of numbers. The constitutional guarantee certainly does not fade\n\nbased on the level of acceptability that a particular practice has achieved. Sexual\n\nand gender minorities are as Indian as their fellow citizens who are cisgender and\n\nheterosexual.\n\n\n      iii.    Understanding the institution of marriage\n\n\n             a. There is no universal conception of marriage\n\n\n100. There is no universal definition of marriage. Marriage is understood\n\ndifferently in law, in religion, and in culture. Some religions consider marriage a\n\nsacrament while others consider it a contract. The law defines the conditions for a\n\n\n\n                                           95\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\nvalid marriage, such as the minimum age required of a party to the marriage,\n\nwhether both parties have consented to the marriage, or whether the parties are\n\nwithin the degrees of prohibited relationship. A marriage is valid in the eyes of the\n\nlaw as long as the preconditions in the concerned law(s) are satisfied. A\n\nprecondition is different from a feature or characteristic in that the former is a\n\nprerequisite to a valid marriage whereas the latter is not. The law provides\n\nremedies which either party may avail of in the presence or absence of certain\n\nfeatures or characteristics. For example, <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 27</a> of the SMA provides that a\n\nparty to a marriage may present a petition for divorce on the ground that the other\n\nparty is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for seven years or more for an\n\noffence as defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_243\">IPC</a>. However, it does not automatically render a marriage\n\nvoid if one of the parties is imprisoned.\n\n\n101. Once a couple marries, it is left to them to give meaning ang content to their\n\nrelationship. It is their prerogative to determine the characteristics of their marriage\n\nand give meaning to their relationship. These aspects of a marriage vary with each\n\nrelationship, and it is impossible for this Court to authoritatively state that a\n\nparticular idea of marriage is the only valid understanding of marriage. This being\n\nthe case, any attempt to formulate a general and universally applicable definition\n\nof marriage is fraught with difficulty. With this qualification, this Court will list some\n\nfeatures of marriage that are considered its core components.\n\n\n102. Marriage is a voluntary union – of the mind, the body, and the soul. Marriage\n\nsignifies a deep and abiding commitment to one another and a devotion to the\n\nrelationship. When two people marry, they intend to be in a life-long relationship.\n\n\n\n\n                                            96\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\nBoth the parties to the marriage provide emotional, financial, and spiritual support\n\nto the other. Each is an intellectual partner of the other, as also a friend. Love,\n\nrespect and companionship are said to be the hallmarks of a successful marriage.\n\nMarriage is a gateway into the creation of a family through childbearing and\n\nchildrearing, although it is not a precondition to the creation or existence of a family.\n\nThe sole purpose of marriage is not to facilitate sexual relations or procreation,\n\nalthough that may be one of the main motivations for entering into a marriage.\n\nMarriage has emotional and associational components to it, which cannot be\n\nrelegated to the background even as the sexual component is foregrounded.\n\nImportant as they are, sexual relations and procreation alone are not the exclusive\n\nfoundation for marriage. Although the aspects of marriage discussed in this\n\nparagraph are considered to be core components of marriage, the existence of a\n\nvalid marriage (by legal, religious, or cultural definitions) is not predicated upon the\n\nexistence of any of these elements. This may be due to choice or circumstance or\n\neven some combination of the two.\n\n\n103. A married couple may not have biological children because of their age,\n\nproblems with fertility, or simply because they choose not to. Many couples who\n\nchoose to have children may do so through assisted reproductive technologies,\n\nsurrogacy, adoption or other methods which are not traditional. Many married\n\ncouples may choose not to engage in sexual relations for various reasons. In some\n\nmarriages, the couple may not reside in the same home or even city, temporarily\n\nor permanently. The emotional, financial, or spiritual contribution to a marriage may\n\nvary with each couple. While the law identifies certain conduct or behaviour as\n\ngrounds for divorce they do not render a marriage void in and of themselves. The\n\n\n                                           97\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\nmarriage continues to be a marriage, even if it is atypical or runs contrary to the\n\nnotion of an ‘ideal marriage’ that a person may have. This is not only true for the\n\nlegal conception of marriage, but also of the cultural and social conceptions.\n\nSociety continues to consider a marriage to be a marriage even if, say, a married\n\ncouple decides to live apart because they work in different cities or countries or if\n\nthey do not have children. This is equally true of the other facets of marriage\n\ndiscussed in this paragraph. The exercise of defining the content of the institution\n\nof marriage as well as delineating its purpose is a subjective exercise undertaken\n\nby the couple in question.\n\n\n104. The respondents suggested that an ‘ideal marriage’ has many or all of the\n\ncomponents discussed in the preceding paragraphs. This argument acknowledges\n\nthat many of these components are not necessarily present in the institution of\n\nmarriage but places them in the realm of normative or aspirational values. In other\n\nwords, the argument is that marriages ought to fit with these components even if a\n\ngiven marriage does not fit with them. The answer to this argument is\n\nstraightforward – there is no legal basis to elevate these personals ideals to the\n\nstatus of normative requirements. To the contrary, every effort must be made to\n\npractice and inculcate constitutional ideas – the ideals of human dignity, liberty,\n\nequality, and fraternity – in our everyday lives. These constitutional ideals demand\n\nthat we respect the autonomy and dignity of each person. We must respect their\n\ndecisions and choices. It is only when a particular decision or action is contrary to\n\nthe law or an affront to constitutional values that this Court may step in. In all other\n\ninstances, citizens are empowered to define the content of their lives and find\n\nmeaning in their relationships.\n\n\n                                          98\n\f                                                                          PART D\n\n105. Different religions may have different understandings of marriage, for\n\ninstance, whether marriage is a sacrament or a contract. There may be diverse\n\nsocial constructs of marriage within a religious grouping. Similarly, there may be\n\ndifferent conceptions of marriage within a particular community. This is best\n\nunderstood with the aid of an example. <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 5(iv)</a> of the HMA stipulates that a\n\nmarriage may be solemnised between two persons if they are not within the\n\ndegrees of prohibited relationship, unless a custom or usage governing the parties\n\npermits their marriage. One of the degrees of prohibited relationship is an uncle\n\nand his niece. 101 In many communities, an uncle cannot marry his niece because\n\nthe community does not have a custom or usage which permits such a marriage.\n\nYet, in many other communities such a marriage is customary and therefore\n\npermitted in terms of the HMA. The customs of many tribes of the country similarly\n\npermit an uncle to marry his niece. Many tribal communities are governed by their\n\nown customs and usages. Such marriages are valid and recognised by tribal\n\ncustoms although they are not recognised by the law governing other communities\n\nin the country. The solemnisation of a marriage, too, takes different forms in\n\ndifferent communities. What may be customary, and therefore not only accepted\n\nbut encouraged in a particular religion or community may not have a parallel in\n\nanother religion or community.\n\n\n106. While each individual is entitled to their own conception of marriage, a\n\nuniversal conception of marriage, its purpose, and content would be difficult to\n\nencapsulate in an exhaustive enumeration. Consequently, the argument advanced\n\n\n\n\n101 <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 3(g)(iv)</a>, HMA\n\n\n\n\n                                       99\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\nby the respondents that the very conception of marriage does not permit queer\n\nindividuals to marry cannot be accepted. Each religion, each community, each\n\ncouple defines the institution of marriage for itself. The queer community is just as\n\nmuch a community as any other, though perhaps not in the traditional sense in\n\nwhich the term is used with respect to customs which govern marriage.\n\n\n107. There is no gainsaying the fact that procreation and the human desire to\n\nhave a family constitute significant characteristics of the institution of marriage. Yet,\n\neven heterosexual couples may find themselves unable or unwilling to procreate.\n\nAge, health and a variety of circumstances may bear on the decision of a\n\nheterosexual couple to bear or not to bear children. The inability of queer couples\n\nto procreate does not act as a barrier to the entry of queer persons to the institution\n\nof marriage just as it does not prevent heterosexual couples who are unable or\n\nchoose not to procreate. Viewing marriage solely through the lens of sexual\n\nrelations or procreation is a disservice to married couples everywhere including\n\nheterosexual couples because it renders invisible the myriad other aspects of a\n\nmarriage as an emotional union. It relegates the aspects of companionship and\n\nlove in a marriage to an inferior status. Such a conception of marriage is narrow\n\nand factually incorrect.\n\n\n        b. The conception of marriage is not static\n\n\n108. The understanding of marriage – socially, culturally, and legally – has\n\nundergone a sea change over time. Some changes which are specific to India are\n\ndiscussed in this segment. This segment is not an exhaustive discussion of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          100\n\f                                                                                             PART D\n\nchanges to the institution of marriage in India. It illustrates some changes in service\n\nof the point that the conception of marriage is not static.\n\n\n        I.   Sati\n\n\n109. Although far from a universal practice, sati was once permitted and practiced\n\nin India. This abhorrent practice was inextricably intertwined with the institution of\n\nmarriage because a widow was either tied to the funeral pyre of her deceased\n\nhusband or pressed upon to jump into it. Various rules and regulations restricted\n\nand later, barred the practice in the colonial era. In modern day <a href=\"/doc/160312812/\" id=\"a_246\">India, the\n\nCommission of Sati (Prevention) Act</a> 1987 criminalizes attempts to commit sati, the\n\nabetment of sati, as well as its glorification.\n\n\n      II.    Widow remarriage\n\n\n110. In accordance with long-standing custom, women (mostly from the dominant\n\ncastes) were not permitted to remarry if their husbands died. In many communities,\n\nthe heads of widows were shaved and they were prohibited from wearing jewellery\n\nor colourful clothes. This was considered a ‘living death.’ Many (including Mahatma\n\nJyotirao Phule, the Brahmo Samaj, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Tarabai\n\nShinde) attempted to reform the institution of marriage to permit widows to remarry.\n\nCivil society offered tremendous resistance to their attempts at reform. 102\n\nUltimately, the Hindu Widows’ <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_247\">Remarriage Act</a> 1856 was enacted, permitting\n\nwidows to remarry.\n\n\n\n\n102Rosalind O’Hanlon, Issues of Widowhood in Colonial Western India (Institute of Commonwealth Studies,\nUniversity of London, 1989)\n\n\n\n                                                 101\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\n     III.    Child marriage and the age of consent\n\n\n111. A discussion of the history of marriage in India would be incomplete without\n\nreference to child marriage and the legal age of consent. Child marriage was\n\nwidespread in most religions and communities. The age of consent for girls was\n\nfixed at ten years in 1860. In 1890, a thirty-five year old man called Hari Mohan\n\nMaity caused the death of his ten year old wife Phulmoni Das (also known as\n\nPhulomonee Das) through violent sexual intercourse with her. While this would be\n\nconsidered rape and / or aggravated penetrative sexual assault of a child by\n\nprevailing legal standards, the concerned court ruled that Hari Mohan Maity had a\n\nlegal right to engage in sexual relations with Phulmoni Das because she was above\n\nthe age of consent at the time. 103 The age of consent for girls was then raised to\n\ntwelve.\n\n\n112. Decades later, the <a href=\"/doc/323064/\" id=\"a_248\">Child Marriage Restraint Act</a> 1929 raised the minimum\n\nage of marriage for girls from twelve to fourteen. In 1949, the criminal law of the\n\ncountry stipulated that the age of consent for girls was fifteen years. The HMA set\n\nthe minimum age of marriage at fifteen for girls and eighteen for boys. In 1978, the\n\nHMA was amended to raise the minimum age of marriage to eighteen for girls and\n\ntwenty-one for boys. <a href=\"/doc/790355/\" id=\"a_249\">The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act</a> 2006 provided that child\n\nmarriages would be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child\n\nat the time of the marriage. Further, this statute criminalizes the act of performing,\n\nconducting, directing, abetting, promoting or permitting a child marriage.\n\n\n\n\n103 Flavia Agnes ‘Controversy over Age of Consent’ (2013) EPW Vol 48(29)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    102\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\n113. <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_250\">The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act</a> 2012 104 was enacted\n\nabout a decade ago. It is a child-specific legislation which inter alia criminalizes\n\nsexual abuse in its various forms. A “child” is defined as any person below the age\n\nof eighteen years. In Independent Thought v. Union of India,105 this Court was\n\nconfronted with the inconsistency between the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_251\">POCSO Act</a> which criminalized\n\nsexual relations with a child and Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 375</a> of the IPC which\n\nprovided that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife was not rape if the wife was\n\nabove fifteen years of age. As a consequence of this inconsistency, a person could\n\nhave been guilty under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_253\">POCSO Act</a> but not under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 375</a> of the IPC. This\n\nCourt held that Exception 2 was violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_255\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_256\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_257\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution and was an affront to constitutional morality. The Court read down\n\nException 2 as exempting a man from the offence of rape if his wife was above the\n\nage of eighteen. Currently, it is a punishable offence for a man to have sexual\n\nintercourse with a child, regardless of whether that child is his wife. It is evident\n\nthat the law governing marriage has come a long way from Phulmoni Das’ time.\n\n\n     IV.     Other violence in marriage\n\n\n114. Acts which were once considered the norm in a marriage are no longer\n\ncountenanced by the law. The giving and taking of dowry, which was and continues\n\nto be prevalent in most communities, was criminalised by the enactment of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_258\">Dowry Prohibition Act</a> 1961. Prior to its enactment, there was no penalty in law for\n\ndemanding, giving, or accepting dowry. The family of the bride was often expected\n\nto pay large sums of money or present “gift” items of value to the groom or his\n\n\n104 “<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_259\">POCSO Act</a>”\n105 (2017) 10 SCC 800\n\n\n\n\n                                          103\n\f                                                                           PART D\n\nfamily, as a condition of the marriage. The maternal families of innumerable women\n\nare harassed and violence is inflicted upon them, in relation to demands for dowry.\n\nParliament inserted <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 498-A</a> of the IPC in 1983. Section 498-A criminalizes\n\nthe act of a husband or his relative subjecting her to cruelty, as defined in the\n\nsection. In many cases, the matrimonial families (the husband, the mother-in-law,\n\nthe father-in-law, and other relatives) murdered the woman because of what they\n\nviewed as insufficient dowry or unmet demands for dowry. This led to Parliament\n\namending the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_261\">IPC</a> in 1986 to include Section 304-B which criminalises ‘dowry\n\ndeath.’\n\n\n115. These provisions of law did not, however, adequately account for gender-\n\nbased violence in a marriage which are unconnected to dowry. Domestic violence\n\nwas (and continues to be) prevalent. About two decades ago, the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_262\">Protection of\n\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act</a> 2005 was enacted to protect the rights of\n\nwomen who were survivors or victims of domestic violence, either by their\n\nhusbands or the relatives of their husbands. Prior to the enactment of the law,\n\nintimate partner violence which women are generally subject to was not\n\ncriminalized.\n\n\n     V.   Inter-caste and interfaith marriage\n\n\n116. Inter-caste and interfaith marriages were uncommon in the colonial era and\n\nestablished customs or usages did not govern such marriages. Then, as now,\n\nsociety subjected those who entered into inter-caste and interfaith marriages to\n\ndiscrimination and violence. There was initially no legal framework in place which\n\ngoverned such marriages. <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_263\">The Special Marriage Act</a> 1872 was enacted to enable\n\n\n\n                                       104\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nthe solemnisation of marriages independent of personal law. If two people\n\nbelonging to different religions wished to marry, they were each required to\n\nrenounce their respective religion in order to avail of its provisions. The law at the\n\ntime did not supply a framework in terms of which two persons belonging to\n\ndifferent religions could retain their association or spiritual connection to their\n\nrespective religions and still marry one another.\n\n\n117. Parliament was conscious of the limiting and restrictive character of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_264\">Special Marriage Act</a> 1872 and enacted the SMA in 1954, which was a more\n\npermissive legislation in that any two persons could marry, without having to\n\nrepudiate their respective religions. By stipulating that “a marriage between any\n\ntwo persons may be solemnized under this Act,” 106 the SMA also set out a\n\nmechanism for inter-caste marriages to be solemnized independent of personal\n\nlaw.\n\n\n118. The families or relatives of couples who entered into inter-caste or interfaith\n\nmarriages would frequently inflict violence upon them, even to the extent of brutally\n\nmurdering them. Their communities would either ordain or participate in these\n\natrocities. Such murders are colloquially referred to as “honour killings” and are\n\nmore accurately termed as caste-based murders. It is a most unfortunate truth that\n\nthis culture of violence persists to date. Couples who face this opprobrium have\n\nknocked on the doors of this Court inter alia seeking protection from their families\n\nand others who oppose their relationship 107 and this Court has otherwise been\n\n\n\n\n106 <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 4</a>, SMA\n107 See, for instance, Lata Singh v. State of U.P., (2006) 5 SCC 475.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       105\n\f                                                                                               PART D\n\nseized of cases arising from violence in this context. 108 In Shakti Vahini v. Union\n\nof India, 109 this Court took note of the violence against couples in inter-caste and\n\ninterfaith marriages. It directed the state machinery to take preventive as well as\n\nremedial measures to protect such couples who wished to marry or who were\n\nrecently married.\n\n\n119. It is beyond dispute that couples in inter-caste and interfaith relationships\n\nhave historically been forced to contend with and continue to contend with\n\nenormous difficulty while solemnizing their unions. As evident from the discussion\n\nin the preceding paragraph, large sections of society were and are fiercely opposed\n\nto such marriages. The opposition stems, at least in part, from a belief that a\n\nmarriage ought to consist of two individuals from the same religion or caste.\n\nParliament chose to enact the SMA despite the opposition to atypical marriages\n\nand has not chosen to repeal the SMA or otherwise exclude the celebration of inter-\n\ncaste marriages under personal laws despite continuing hostility from the\n\ncommunities of such couples. Parliament has presumably done so because it is\n\ncognizant of the fact that the exercise of fundamental rights is not contingent upon\n\nthe approval of the community. Similarly, this Court has carried out the\n\nconstitutional mandate by protecting the rights of individuals and couples in the\n\nface of considerable opposition from their families. In a democracy, certain rights\n\ninhere in all individuals. If the exercise of rights was contingent upon everyone else\n\nor, at least a substantial portion of the community approving of such exercise, we\n\nwould be doing a disservice to a constitutional democracy. The Constitution does\n\n\n108 See, for instance, Gang-Rape Ordered by Village Kangaroo Court in W.B., In re, (2014) 4 SCC 786; Vikas\n\nYadav v. State of U.P., (2016) 9 SCC 541.\n109 (2018) 7 SCC 192\n\n\n\n\n                                                   106\n\f                                                                                                     PART D\n\nnot require individuals to first convince others of the legitimacy of the exercise of\n\nconstitutional rights before they exercise them.\n\n\n     VI.      Divorce\n\n\n120. <a href=\"/doc/1387951/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 10</a> of the Indian Divorce Act 1869, which is applicable to Christians,\n\npreviously permitted the husband to file a petition for divorce on the ground that his\n\nwife was guilty of adultery. However, the wife was permitted to file a petition for\n\ndivorce on the ground that her husband was guilty of adultery only in conjunction\n\nwith certain other grounds (such as conversion to another religion or bigamy). In\n\nMary Sonia Zachariah v. Union of India, 110 the Kerala High Court inter alia struck\n\ndown a part of <a href=\"/doc/1273949/\" id=\"a_267\">Section 10</a> and permitted Christian women to seek divorce on the\n\nground of adultery alone. Parliament amended the <a href=\"/doc/806295/\" id=\"a_268\">Indian Divorce Act</a> 1869 in 2001\n\nby substituting <a href=\"/doc/1273949/\" id=\"a_269\">Section 10</a> with a provision that made various grounds of divorce\n\n(including adultery) available to both the husband and the wife, equally. 111 It also\n\nintroduced Section 10A, which permitted Christian marriages to be dissolved by\n\nmutual consent, for the first time.\n\n\n121. In terms of Hindu customary law, certain communities permitted divorce\n\nwhereas others did not. The HMA extended the right of divorce to all Hindus when\n\nit was enacted in 1955. In 1976, Section 13B was introduced in the HMA, permitting\n\nHindus to dissolve their marriage by mutual consent, for the first time. In Shilpa\n\nSailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan,112 this Court held that it has the authority to grant\n\ndivorce when there is a complete and irretrievable breakdown of marriage\n\n\n110 1995 SCC OnLine Ker 288\n111 The wife was permitted an additional ground of divorce, viz “the husband has, since the solemnization of the\n\nmarriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality.” See <a href=\"/doc/89426212/\" id=\"a_270\">Section 10(2)</a>, Indian Divorce Act 1869.\n112 2023 SCC OnLine SC 544\n\n\n\n\n                                                     107\n\f                                                                                                       PART D\n\nnotwithstanding the opposition of one of the parties to the marriage to its\n\ndissolution.\n\n\n122. Islamic customary law permitted divorce in certain situations and through\n\ncertain modes. One of the modes was talaq-e-biddat or triple talaq by which the\n\nhusband could instantly, irrevocably, and unilaterally divorce his wife. In Shayara\n\nBano v. Union of India, 113 this Court held that the practice of severing the marital\n\nbond through the mode of talaq-e-biddat was unconstitutional.\n\n\n     VII.     The implications of the discussion in this segment\n\n\n123. Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Pandita Ramabai,\n\nTarabai Shinde, Raja Ram Mohun Roy and countless others voiced their\n\nopposition (to varying degrees and to varying effects) to one or the other practice\n\ndiscussed in this segment. Their views were met with fierce opposition on the\n\nground that the religious and cultural values of the subcontinent did not permit a\n\ndeparture from tradition. In some cases, the opposing groups relied on scriptures\n\nto justify their respective stances. 114 When Dr. B R Ambedkar introduced the Hindu\n\nCode Bill, many opposed the provision for divorce on the ground that the Hindu\n\nreligion did not envisage divorce because it was a sacrament. 115 It is seen that\n\nthere are competing understandings of the institution of marriage at every stage of\n\nits evolution. Yet, the understanding which was grounded in justice and the rights\n\nof the people has prevailed. Injustice in the law in relation to the institution of\n\n\n113 (2017) 9 SCC 1\n114 ‘Social Reform’ and the Women’s Quest in Janaki Nair (ed),   Women and Law in Colonial India: A social history\n(1996)\n115 See, for instance, Constituent Assembly of India (Legislative) Debates, Volume II, Speech by Pandit Lakshmi\n\nKanta Maitra on 1 March 1949; Constituent Assembly of India (Legislative) Debates, Volume VI, Speech by Pandit\nMukut Bihari Lal Bhargava on 12 December 1949\n\n\n\n                                                      108\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nmarriage (in the form of demands for dowry, dowry death, or child sexual abuse)\n\nor as incidental to the institution (as in the case of sati or widow remarriage) is\n\nslowly but surely in the process of being eradicated. While these practices were\n\nonce permitted and encouraged, they are currently not only frowned upon but also\n\ncriminalized.\n\n\n124. This walk through history is not an attempt by this Court to take on the mantle\n\nof historians. The discussion demonstrates that the institution of marriage has not\n\nremained static or stagnant. To the contrary, it is change which characterizes the\n\ninstitution. All social institutions transmogrify with time and marriage is no\n\nexception. From sati and widow remarriage to child marriage and inter-caste or\n\ninterfaith marriages, marriage has metamorphosed. The institution as we know it\n\ntoday would perhaps be unrecognizable to our ancestors from two hundred years\n\nago. Despite vehement opposition to any departure from practice, the institution of\n\nmarriage has changed. This is an incontrovertible truth. Here, it is also important\n\nto take note of the fact that these changes were brought about largely by acts of\n\nParliament or the legislatures of the states. While the passage of many laws was\n\npreceded by significant social activism, it was the legislature which ultimately\n\nresponded to the call for change. Even as Parliament (and in some cases, the\n\ncourts) expand the liberties of the people to conduct their lives in a manner they\n\nsee fit (in accordance with law), many sections of society remain opposed to these\n\nchanges. Regardless of such opposition, the institution of marriage has undergone\n\na sea change. It is therefore incorrect to characterise marriage as a static, stagnant\n\nor unchanging institution.\n\n\n\n\n                                         109\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n         c. The implications of this discussion for the right of queer persons to\n\n           marry\n\n\n125. From the discussion in this segment of the judgment, it is evident that the\n\ninstitution of marriage is built and re-built by societies, communities, and\n\nindividuals. A universal conception of marriage is not present nor is the conception\n\nof marriage static over time. The only facet of marriage which is constant across\n\nreligion, community, caste, and region is that the couple is in a legally binding\n\nrelationship – one which recognizes an emotional bond of togetherness, loyalty\n\nand commitment - that is recognised by the law. The law recognises the\n\ncommitment that the couple has for one another by regulating the institution of\n\nmarriage and conferring certain rights and privileges on them.\n\n\n126. In Shafin Jahan (supra), a three-Judge Bench of this Court held:\n\n\n             “84. … Our choices are respected because they are ours.\n             Social approval for intimate personal decisions is not the basis\n             for recognising them. Indeed, the Constitution protects\n             personal liberty from disapproving audiences.”\n\n\n127.   The consequence of the judgment of this Court in National Legal Services\n\nAuthority (supra) and Navtej Singh Johar (supra) is that the members of the\n\nqueer community are no longer second-class citizens of our country. Their\n\nindividual and group rights are on par with any other citizen of this country. Their\n\ngender identity or sexual orientation cannot be a ground on which they are\n\ndiscriminated against.\n\n\n128. Mr. Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General, submitted during the\n\ncourse of his arguments that two persons from the LGBTQ community have the\n\n\n\n                                              110\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\nright and the liberty to celebrate their union and label the union with any term they\n\nsee fit, including ‘marriage.’ The Union of India does not, however, wish to accord\n\nlegal recognition to such ceremonies and unions. If the marriages of queer people\n\nwere to be recognized by law enacted by Parliament, it would be the next step in\n\nits progression.\n\n\n     iv.   The significance of marriage as a socio-legal institution\n\n\n129. One of us (DY Chandrachud, J.) in Navtej (supra) held that the members of\n\nthe LGBTQIA+ community have a right to navigate public spaces without the\n\ninterference of the State. The claim of the petitioners in this case, however, is on a\n\nslightly different footing. The petitioners seek the active involvement of the State in\n\ntheir relationships through conferring recognition. Through marriage, the State\n\nconfers legal recognition to a relationship between two heterosexual persons. By\n\ndoing so, it recognises that relationships in the form of marriage are not merely a\n\nlifestyle but an important constituent unit for the sustenance of social life. The State\n\nconfers innumerable benefits, both tangible and intangible, to a family unit\n\nconstituted by marriage. The petitioners seek that the State grant legal recognition\n\nto the relationship between non-heterosexual persons in the form of marriage\n\nbecause they are otherwise excluded from the express and implied benefits of\n\nmarriage. They claim that non-heterosexual unions have not been able to attain\n\nsocial sanctity because their relationship is invisible in the eyes of the law.\n\n\n130. Before we discuss the State’s interest in regulating the personal relationship\n\nbetween two persons to understand the necessity of its interference in the private\n\n\n\n\n                                          111\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\nsphere, it is important to discuss the manner in which the State regulates\n\nmarriages.\n\n\n131. The State: firstly, prescribes conditions with respect to who can enter into a\n\nvalid marriage; secondly, regulates the marital relationship during its sustenance;\n\nand thirdly, regulates the repercussions of the breakdown of a relationship of\n\nmarriage.\n\n\n132. The State prescribes various conditions for the solemnization of a valid\n\nmarriage which inter alia includes the conditions of consent, a minimum age\n\nrequirement, and whether the parties are within the degrees of prohibited\n\nrelationship. The law regulates the conduct of the parties to a marriage in\n\nnumerous ways. For example, the law penalises the husband and his family\n\nmembers if they treat the wife cruelly, including demands for dowry. 116 <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_271\">Similarly,\n\nthe Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act</a> 2005 117 penalises persons\n\nfor domestic violence in the course of a domestic relationship which has been\n\ndefined to include marriage.118 The grounds for divorce prescribed in various\n\nmarriage laws also regulate the conduct of parties because their actions during the\n\nsustenance of a marriage may be a ground for the legal dissolution of that\n\nmarriage. The valid grounds for divorce include where one of the parties has a\n\nsexual relationship outside of marriage, 119 or has deserted their spouse, 120 or treats\n\nthe spouse with cruelty. 121 The State regulates the relationship between the parties\n\n\n\n116 <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 498A</a> of IPC\n117 “<a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_273\">DV Act</a>”\n118 Sections 2(f) and 3 of the DV Act,\n119 <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_274\">Section 27(1)(a)</a> of the SMA\n120 <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_275\">Section 27(1)(b)</a> of the SMA\n121 <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_276\">Section 27(1)(d)</a> of the SMA\n\n\n\n\n                                          112\n\f                                                                                                     PART D\n\nafter the divorce by prescribing the payment of maintenance. Under the SMA, the\n\nwife can claim alimony or maintenance and under the HMA, both the husband and\n\nthe wife can claim maintenance. The above discussion elucidates that the State\n\nplays a crucial role in regulating marriage. Marriage has attained both social and\n\nlegal significance because of the active involvement of the State at every stage of\n\nthe marital relationship – during entry into it, during its subsistence, and in its\n\naftermath.\n\n\n133. Marriage was earlier a purely social institution unregulated by the State.\n\nWhat prompted the State to regulate personal relationships? There are two\n\nprominent reasons. The first reason was to regulate the social order. The State\n\nregulated social order by firstly, regulating the sexual conduct of persons through\n\nmarriage, and secondly, by prescribing a legal mechanism for the devolution of\n\nproperty based on the legitimacy of the heir.\n\n\n134. With respect to the first of the reasons, the State used marriage as a tool to\n\nregulate sexual behaviour. 122 The State prescribed social rules through the vehicle\n\nof law by devising marriage as an exclusive relationship. Engaging in sexual\n\nconduct outside of marriage is a ground for divorce under personal marriage laws\n\nand the civil marriage law. It is also crucial to note that impotency and not sterility\n\nis a ground for divorce. 123 Impotency is the inability of a man to engage in sexual\n\nintercourse. On the other hand, sterility is the inability of a man or a woman to\n\nprocreate. By prescribing impotency as a ground for declaring a marriage void (and\n\nnot sterility), the State emphasised the centrality of sexual relations in a marriage\n\n\n122 Laurence Drew, Sex, ‘Procreation and the State Interest in Marriage, (2002) Columbia Law Review, Vol. 102(4)\n123 <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_277\">Section 27(1)(ii)</a> of the SMA\n\n\n\n\n                                                     113\n\f                                                                                                   PART D\n\nas opposed to procreation. In this way, the State governs the conduct of society by\n\nregulating sexual conduct in a marital relationship.\n\n\n135. Another manner in which the State intended to regulate social order by\n\nregulating marriage is by placing marriage at the centre of property devolutions.\n\nOwnership and control over property was viewed as being important for the\n\nestablishment of a just social order. One of the reasons for the establishment of a\n\nsocial contract for the creation of a State by which individuals gave up their right to\n\nlive as unregulated free individuals in exchange of protection of their rights and\n\nfreedom is for safeguarding of property rights.\n\n\n136. There must be rules for the devolution of property to avoid conflicts. These\n\nrules may vary in nature. Societies may establish rules for a common property\n\nsystem, or private property system, or a mixture of both. These legal rules have\n\ntwo primary components which concern how the title over the property is secured\n\nand how the title further devolves in case of intestate succession. Legal rules for\n\nthe devolution of title are premised on marriage in modern societies.\n\n\n137. Brian H Bix in the paper “State interest and Marriage” argues that there is\n\nsufficient material to establish that the State regulates marriage to respond to the\n\nspecial interests of specific social groups. 124 It has been argued that the propertied\n\nclasses wanted to reduce any uncertainty about succession, which may have\n\narisen because of a lack of clarity regarding the line of succession. It has also been\n\nargued that noble families desired to prevent their children’s marriages with\n\n\n\n124 Brian H Bix, State Interest and Marriage- The Theoretical perspective, (2003) 32 HOFSTRA L. REV. 93\n\n\n\n\n                                                    114\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\npartners of lower social status. Irrespective of whether the State regulated marriage\n\nto further entrench the existing social order or to transform the existing social order\n\nbased on constitutional values, it is clear that property also plays a prominent role\n\nin the regulation of marriage.\n\n\n138. The second reason for the State to be involved in the regulation of personal\n\nrelationships was to remodel society, premised on the constitutional value of\n\nequality. A constitutional order premised on equality, dignity, and autonomy would\n\nbe unworkable if personal relationships which are the building blocks of a just\n\nsociety are grounded on values that are antithetical to the Constitution. The\n\nConstitution declares that there shall be no discrimination on the grounds of\n\nreligion, race, caste, and sex. How would it be a just society if on the one hand the\n\nConstitution declares that there shall be no discrimination, and on the other hand,\n\ninter-faith and inter-caste relationships bear the brunt of a brutal society through\n\nostracization and “honour” killings or caste-based murders? How just would society\n\nreally be if in spite of the constitutional guarantees of equality of women in public\n\nposts and educational institutions, they suffer patriarchal attitudes in the private\n\nsphere?\n\n\n139. The State regulates marriage to create a space of equal living where neither\n\ncaste, religion, and sex prevent any person from forming bonds for eternity nor do\n\nthey contribute to the creation of an unequal relationship. The State’s regulation of\n\nmarriage recognised that even though a married couple is a ‘unit’ for the purposes\n\nof laws, they still retain their individual identity and are entitled to constitutional\n\nguarantees. For example, one of the parties need not necessarily be at fault for the\n\n\n\n\n                                         115\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\ncouple to secure divorce. Our laws recognise divorce by mutual consent. They\n\nrecognise that the parties to a marriage are in the best position to decide if they\n\nshould continue with the marital relationship. Divorce by mutual consent is\n\ngrounded on the principle of autonomy. The involvement of the State in the\n\nregulation of marriage opened up the space for inter-caste marriages and inter-\n\nfaith marriages, and secured prominent constitutional rights.\n\n\n140. The regulation by the State and its attempts to create a more equal personal\n\nsphere also contribute towards factual equality where women are empowered to\n\ndefy patriarchal notions of gender roles in daily life. The impact of the State’s\n\ninvolvement in creating a more just personal space by reforming the institution of\n\nmarriage on the basis of constitutional ideals can be seen when a wife chooses to\n\nretain her surname after her marriage or where the partners equally contribute\n\ntowards raising their child.\n\n\n141. The State recognised that a Constitution which upholds the values of\n\nfreedom, liberty, and equality cannot permit the sustenance of a feudal institution\n\nundermining the rights of marginalised communities. Thus, it is important to view\n\nthe involvement of the State in regulating the institution of marriage in terms of its\n\ntransformative potential in ensuring equality in the personal sphere and in family\n\nlife.\n\n\n142. Having discussed why and how the State regulates the institution of\n\nmarriage, it is important that this Court recognise the effect of such regulation.\n\nApart from the benefits of the State’s involvement which are recognised above (that\n\nis, in creating a social order in consonance with the principles laid down in the\n\n\n\n                                         116\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nConstitution), there are other benefits. These benefits can be segregated into\n\ntangible and intangible benefits.\n\n\n143. The intangible benefits of marriage are guided by hidden law. Hidden law\n\ncomprises of norms and conventions which organize social expectations and\n\nregulate everyday behaviour. 125 The benefits which are conferred by a legal\n\ninstitution must not be measured solely in terms of the benefits which are conferred\n\nby the law. It must also include the benefits which are conferred by hidden law.\n\nThese are benefits which are not traceable to law but which are created by norms.\n\nOne such benefit of marriage which is traceable to hidden law is the social validity\n\nand recognition which marriage as an institution confers upon relationships.\n\n\n144. It is pertinent to note that the State only regulates heterosexual marriages.\n\nThe law confers numerous rights and benefits which flow from a marriage but\n\nignores the existence of any other form of relationship. The invisibilization of\n\nrelationships which are not in the form of marriage on the one hand bestows\n\nsanctity and commitment to marriages and on the other hand strengthens the\n\nperception that any other form of relationship is fleeting and non-committal.\n\n\n145. <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_278\">The DV Act</a> has come the closest to recognising the existence of\n\nrelationships in forms other than marriage. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_279\">The Act</a> defines “domestic relationship”\n\nas a relationship between two persons who live together in a shared household,\n\nwhen they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or ‘through a relationship in the\n\nnature of marriage. In Indra Sarma v. VKV Sarma 126, the issue before this Court\n\n\n\n125 Jonathan Rauch, ‘Conventional Wisdom’, (Reasons, February 2000)\n126 (2013) 15 SCC 755\n\n\n\n\n                                                   117\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nwas whether live-in relationships can be considered to be a relationship in the\n\nnature of marriage. A two-Judge Bench of this Court observed that a relationship\n\nin the nature of marriage is distinct from a marriage. It was further observed that\n\nfor a relationship to be considered to be in the nature of marriage, factors such as\n\nthe duration of the relationship, whether the couple live in a shared household, the\n\npooling of resources and financial arrangements such as long-term investment\n\nplans which indicate the existence of a long standing relationship, and domestic\n\narrangements such as entrusting the responsibility especially on women to run the\n\nhousehold and do household activities, the sexual relationship, procreation,\n\nsocialisation in public, and the intention and conduct of the parties must be\n\nconsidered.\n\n\n146. The observations of this Court in Indra Sarma (supra) elucidate that a\n\nrelationship is in the nature of marriage only when an inference can be drawn from\n\nthe surrounding circumstances that it will be a long-lasting relationship. Thus, while\n\nthere is a positive presumption that marriages are long-lasting, there is also a\n\nnegative inference that all other relationships which are not in the form of marriage\n\nare short-lived.\n\n\n147. In addition, the observations of this Court in Indra Sarma (supra) indicate\n\nthat marriage has always been understood and continues to be understood in\n\nterms of the stereotyped traditional gender roles. The wife is entrusted with the\n\nresponsibility of taking care of household chores and the husband is expected to\n\nbe the breadwinner of the family. The public-private divide is stark. Women are\n\nrelegated to the private sphere where their contribution towards running the\n\n\n\n\n                                         118\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nhousehold is diminished. An inherent feature of the institution of marriage is the\n\nunequal heteronormative setting in which it operates. It is important for us to\n\nobserve that the State while recognising the relationship between two heterosexual\n\nindividuals in the form of marriage does not recognise or promote the gendered\n\ndivision of labour in the home. The State by regulating marriage has sought to\n\nredefine heterosexual relationships by emphasising on the autonomy of both\n\nparties.\n\n\n148. The intangible benefits of marriage extend beyond the conferment of social\n\nrecognition to the relationship of the couple. It also confers benefits which cannot\n\nbe measured in tangible form to the children born of the marital relationship. The\n\nlaw confers on children who are born of wedlock with benefits in succession. In\n\naddition, the law’s recognition of the concepts of legitimate and illegitimate children\n\nhave social repercussions in that illegitimate children are shunned by the society.\n\nThese intangible benefits of marriage indicate that society regards marriage as the\n\nprimary and sole unit through which familial relationships can be forged. As\n\nMarshall CJ observed in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health,127 in a very\n\nreal sense, there are three partners in a civil marriage: two willing partners and an\n\napproving State.\n\n\n149. There are numerous tangible benefits conferred by the State which flow from\n\nmarriage and touch upon every aspect of life. Tangible benefits conferred by\n\nmarriage can be classified into (i) matrimonial and child care related benefits; (ii)\n\n\n\n\n127 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 20003)\n\n\n\n\n                                         119\n\f                                                                                                              PART D\n\nproperty benefits; (iii) monetary benefits; (iv) evidentiary privilege; (v) civic benefits;\n\nand (vi) miscellaneous benefits.\n\n\n150. Matrimonial and child care related benefits include the provisions of\n\npermanent alimony and maintenance,128 maintenance if a person with sufficient\n\nmeans refuses to maintain his wife 129, to adopt a child as a couple 130, and to avail\n\nrights related to surrogacy 131. Property benefits would include securing a share in\n\ncase of intestate succession 132. Legislation such as <a href=\"/doc/573539/\" id=\"a_280\">Section 16</a> of the HMA has\n\nconferred legitimacy on children born from void or voidable marriages with a\n\nconsequential right to or in the property of the parents (and not of any other\n\nperson). Monetary or financial benefits which flow from marriage include the\n\nprovisions to be nominated for the payment of gratuity 133, to receive funeral\n\nexpenditure for the deceased spouse, 134 for the payment of medical benefits to the\n\nspouse of the insured person, 135 and to claim provident fund as the dependent of\n\n\n\n\n128 <a href=\"/doc/95286/\" id=\"a_281\">Section 25</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955; <a href=\"/doc/1708335/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 37</a> of Special Marriage Act 1954 stipulates that the court\n\ncan direct the husband to pay maintenance to his wife; <a href=\"/doc/519340/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 40</a> of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act 1936;\n<a href=\"/doc/1799408/\" id=\"a_284\">Section 37</a> of the Divorce Act 1869 where the District Court is conferred with the power to secure maintenance to\nthe wife from the husband.\n129 <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_285\">Section 125</a> of CrPC\n130 <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_286\">Section 57</a> of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 prescribes eligibility criteria for\n\nthe adoption of children.

The nature of fundamental rights: positive and negative postulates\n\n\n153. Before we embark on an analysis of whether the Constitution recognises the\n\nright to marry, it is imperative that we discuss how the courts recognise\n\nunenumerated rights or derivative rights. The Ninth Amendment to the US\n\nConstitution states that the “enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall\n\nnot be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people”. Though the\n\nIndian Constitution does not contain such a provision, it is implied that the rights\n\nenumerated in Part III are not exhaustive. The fundamental rights recognised in\n\nPart III are identified in the level of abstraction- that is, equality, liberty, and\n\nexpression. The Constitution does not provide a detailed enumeration of the facets\n\nof each enumerated right. The Courts, while determining the scope of an\n\nenumerated right, lay down its facets and conceptions. For example, Courts have\n\nheld that the true essence of the right to equality is not encompassed in formal\n\nequality where all persons are treated alike irrespective of the unequal socio-\n\neconomic status but in substantive equality. 141 Similarly, this Court has in\n\nnumerous judgments held that the right to life and liberty recognised under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_309\">Article\n\n21</a> would be obscure if other crucial facets of liberty are not recognised. It is in this\n\n\n\n\n140 Martha C. Nussbam, A right to marry? (2010) California Law Review Vol 98(3)\n141 State of Kerala v.

Fundamental rights are characterized as positive rights and negative rights.\n\nIn fact, some draw a distinction between fundamental rights (Part III) and the\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy (Part IV) by arguing that the former consists of\n\nnegative rights and the latter of positive rights. In constitutional theory, negative\n\nrights are understood to involve freedom from governmental action whereas,\n\npositive rights place a duty on the State to provide an individual or a group with\n\nbenefits which they would not be able to access by themselves.\n\n\n155. Indian jurisprudence on the scope of fundamental rights can be divided into\n\ntwo thematical facets. In the first facet, the distinction between negative rights and\n\npositive rights faded with the harmonious reading of fundamental rights and\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy by the courts. 145 The Courts used the Directive\n\nPrinciples to inform the scope of fundamental rights. In Unnikrishnan v. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh 146, the issue before this Court was whether the Constitution\n\nguarantees a fundamental right to education to its citizens. This Court held in the\n\naffirmative and traced the right to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 21</a> and the Preamble of the Constitution.\n\nJeevan Reddy, J. writing for the majority observed that education is of\n\ntranscendental importance in the life of an individual without which the objectives\n\nset forth in the Preamble cannot be achieved. It was further emphasised that the\n\nConstitution expressly refers to education in <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_311\">Articles 41</a><a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_312\">, 45</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/352126/\" id=\"a_313\">46</a> of the\n\n\n142 Olega Tellis v.

State of AP, 1959 SCR 629\n146 (1993) 1 SCC 645\n\n\n\n\n                                                    123\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nConstitution which indicates the importance conferred to it. However, this Court\n\nlimited the scope of the right to education in view of <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_314\">Article 45</a> which states that the\n\nState shall endeavour to provide free and compulsory education for all children\n\nuntil they complete the age of fourteen years. Thus, this Court held that the\n\nConstitution guarantees a right to free education for all children until they complete\n\nthe age of fourteen years.\n\n\n156. In the second facet, the Courts read fundamental rights to include both\n\nnegative and positive postulates independent of the Directive Principles of State\n\npolicy. YV Chandrachud, C.J. writing the opinion for the majority in Minerva Mills\n\nv. Union of India, 147 observed that fundamental rights deal with both negative and\n\npositive postulates. In Indibily Creative Private limited v. Government of West\n\nBengal 148, one of us (DY Chandrachud, J. as he then was) observed that <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_315\">Article\n\n19</a> imposes a negative restraint on the State to not interfere with the freedoms of\n\nall citizens and a duty on the State to ensure that conditions for the free and\n\nunrestrained exercise of the freedom are created. In Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J)\n\n(supra), a nine-Judge Bench of this Court held that the Constitution guarantees the\n\nright to privacy. This Court expressly held that the right to privacy includes both\n\nnegative and positive postulates. The negative postulate consists of the right to be\n\nleft alone and the positive postulate places a duty on the State to adopt measures\n\nfor protecting and safeguarding individual privacy. 149\n\n\n\n\n147 AIR 1980 C 1789\n148 (2020) 12 SCC 436\n149 Plurality opinion authored by Justice DY Chandrachud (paragraph 158)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    124\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\n157. The second facet on the scope of fundamental rights is now cemented in\n\nIndian constitutional jurisprudence. Fundamental rights consist of both negative\n\nand positive postulates preventing the State from interfering with the rights of the\n\ncitizens and creating conditions for the exercise of such rights respectively. This\n\nunderstanding of fundamental rights is unique to Indian constitutional\n\njurisprudence. Fundamental rights have been construed in this wide manner by\n\nIndian Courts because of the constitutional conception of the role of the State.\n\nViewing fundamental rights purely as negative rights runs the risk of undermining\n\nthe role of the State.\n\n\n158. Fundamental rights are not merely a restraint on the power of the State but\n\nprovisions which promote and safeguard the interests of the citizens. They require\n\nthe State to restrain its exercise of power and create conducive conditions for the\n\nexercise of rights. If such a positive obligation is not read into the State’s power,\n\nthen the rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution would become a dead\n\nletter. This is because the question of whether the State is curtailing the rights of\n\ncitizens would only arise if the citizens have the capacity and capability to exercise\n\nsuch rights in the first place.\n\n\n159. Thus, if the Constitution guarantees a fundamental right to marry then a\n\ncorresponding positive obligation is placed on the State to establish the institution\n\nof marriage if the legal regime does not provide for it. This warrants us to inquire if\n\nthe institution of marriage is in itself so crucial that it must be elevated to the status\n\nof a fundamental right. As elucidated in the previous section of this judgment,\n\nmarriage as an institution has attained social and legal significance because of its\n\n\n\n\n                                           125\n\f                                                                                               PART D\n\nexpressive and material benefits. This Court while determining if the Constitution\n\nguarantees the right to marry must account for these considerations as well.\n\n\n      vi.    Approaches to identifying unenumerated rights\n\n\n160. The courts identify unenumerated rights by tracing them either to specific\n\nprovisions of Part III of the Constitution or to the chief values which the Constitution\n\nespouses. The premise of this exercise undertaken by courts is that the rights\n\nguaranteed in Part III of the Constitution can only be effectively secured if certain\n\nother entitlements are safeguarded. That is, the rights guaranteed expressly by the\n\nConstitution would remain parchment rights, if conditions for the effective exercise\n\nof them are not created. To put it differently, rights will only be secured if citizens\n\npossess capabilities to exercise the right.150 In fact, the positive and negative\n\npostulations of fundamental rights arise from this broad understanding of the\n\npurpose served by fundamental rights. In this method of deriving rights, the court\n\ntraces unenumerated rights to specific provisions of the Constitution such as liberty\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_316\">Article 21</a>) or freedom of expression (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_317\">Article 19</a>) or equality (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_318\">Article 14</a>).\n\n\n161. In the second method used by courts to derive unenumerated rights, rights\n\nare not traced to specific fundamental rights but to the values or the identity of the\n\nConstitution. This method of deriving unenumerated rights attained prominence\n\nafter the judgment of this Court in RC Cooper v. Union of India151 which held that\n\nfundamental rights are not water-tight compartments and that the thread of\n\nreasonableness contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 14</a> runs through <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_320\">Article 21</a> aswell.

However, constitutional\n\nidentity is not readily borrowed from preambular values. Constitutional identity is\n\nsecured by a gradual process which is characterized by a dialogue between the\n\ninstitutions of governance (such as the legislature, the executive, the courts, and\n\nthe statutory commissions) and the public over internal and external\n\ndissonances. 152 There is external dissonance when there is an apparent conflict\n\nbetween a Constitution’s aspirational ideals and the socio-political reality. 153 It is\n\ncharacterized by internal dissonance when there is a conflict between the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution. The Indian jurisprudence on the equality code is an\n\napt example of how constitutional identity has evolved through dialogue between\n\nvarious stakeholders to advance the conception of factual equality. This Court has\n\nbeen using both the above mentioned approaches to identify unenumerated rights.\n\nFor example, this Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) held that the Constitution\n\nguarantees the right to privacy by using both the specific rights approach and the\n\nidentity approach. This Court grounded the right to privacy in the concepts of\n\nliberty, 154 freedom,155 dignity, 156 and the idea of individual self-development which\n\nruns through the provisions of the Constitution. 157\n\n\n\n\n152 Gary Jeffrey Jacobson, Rights and American Constitutional identity, (2011) Vol. 43 (4) 409\n153 ibid\n154 Opinion of Justice Chelameshwar\n155 Opinion of Justice DY Chandrachud\n156 Opinion of Justice Bobde\n157 Opinions of Justice RF Nariman and Justice Sapre\n\n\n\n\n                                                       127\n\f                                                                                                        PART D\n\n      vii.    The scope of the State’s regulation of the ‘intimate zone’\n\n\n162. The learned Solicitor General made the following two arguments: (i) Intimate\n\nrelationships, whether between homosexual or a heterosexual couples cannot be\n\nsubject to State regulation because it falls in the ‘intimate zone of privacy’; (ii) The\n\nState regulates heterosexual marriages only because there is public interest in\n\nsustaining the human population through procreation.\n\n\n163. For this Court to determine if the State has a duty to confer recognition upon\n\nall relationships, it must firstly delineate the contours of the State’s regulation of\n\nintimate relationships vis-à-vis privacy concerns. The plurality opinion authored by\n\none of us (Justice D.Y. Chandrachud) in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra),\n\nwhile discussing the scope of the right to privacy, refers to an article titled “A\n\ntypology of privacy” 158 which classifies privacy into nine categories.\n\n\n164. In addition to listing various forms of privacy, the authors have also classified\n\nthe forms of privacy based on those which are necessary for the fulfilment of the\n\nfreedom to be let alone and the freedom to self-development. The intimate zone of\n\nprivacy subsumes spatial privacy (which corresponds to the freedom to let alone)\n\nand decisional privacy (which corresponds to the freedom of self-development).\n\nThe formation of human relationships falls within the intimate zone because\n\nrelationships are relegated to the sphere of the home or the private zone and they\n\ninvolve intimate choices.\n\n\n\n\n158 Bert-Jaap Koops et al., “A Typology of Privacy”, (2017) University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law\n\n(2017), Vol. 38(2) 566\n\n\n\n                                                       128\n\f                                                                                                            PART D\n\n165. The intimate zone is shielded from State regulation because relationships\n\noperate in a ‘private space’ and decisions taken in a private space in exercise of\n\nan individual’s autonomy (such as the choice of partner, or procreation) are ‘private\n\nactivities.’ This Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra) held that privacy is\n\nintrinsic to the realization of constitutional values and entrenched fundamental\n\nrights. The judgment emphasized the importance of being left alone and the\n\nautonomy of individuals to take crucial decisions affecting their personhood, such\n\nas procreation and abortion. 159\n\n\n166. At this juncture, it must be noted that the Indian Constitution does not\n\nrecognize family or partnerships as a unit for securing rights. For example, the Irish\n\nConstitution recognizes the family as a natural unit of society and a moral institution\n\npossessing inalienable rights. 160 The Constitution by not recognizing the family as\n\na rights bearing unit has rejected the school of thought where rights of individuals\n\nin a family or partnership are subsumed within the larger unit of the family. The\n\nConstitution does not promote a framework of rights where the rights of a family\n\nare given precedence over individual rights of citizens constituting that family.\n\n\n167. Relegating actions to the ‘private’ zone has certain shortcomings. The\n\ndisadvantage must be understood in consequentialist terms, that is, by identifying\n\nthe effect of classifying certain activities as ‘private.’ One of the prominent effects\n\nof classifying actions as ‘private’ is that such actions are protected from regulation\n\nby the State.\n\n\n\n159 Paragraphs 90 and 157 and conclusion (F) of Justice DY Chandrachud’s opinion; paragraph 46 of Justice RF\n\nNariman’s opinion; paragraph 78 of Justice SK Kaul opinion 8\n160 <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 41</a> of the Irish Constitution stipulates that the State pledges to guard with special care the institution of\n\nmarriage on which the family is founded.\n\n\n\n                                                         129\n\f                                                                                                  PART D\n\n168. Depending on how relationships are organized and managed, they can be\n\n“a beacon of freedom, or a prison.”161 While there are relationships which are\n\ncharacterized by love, mutual-respect, and devotion to one another, certain\n\nrelationships are also characterized by the hierarchical power structure in which\n\nthey operate. Identities such as caste, religion, gender and sexuality more often\n\nthan not contribute towards the unequal power structure in the private sphere. To\n\nrecall, in a segment above, we observed that the State’s interest in regulating\n\nrelationships in the form of marriage is to democratize the private space by\n\nensuring that actions in the intimate space are in consonance with constitutional\n\nvalues. For the reasons in the preceding paragraph, the argument of the learned\n\nSolicitor General that the State regulates relationships in the form of marriage\n\nsolely because they result in procreation is erroneous. The State’s interest in\n\ndemocratizing personal relationships is not specific to the institution of marriage.\n\nThe State’s regulation of marriage is merely one of the many ways by which it can\n\nfulfill these State aims. However, it is open to the State to use other forms of\n\nregulation to fulfill the interests identified above. There is public interest in the\n\nState’s regulation of all relationships because relationships involving two persons\n\nmay be unequal by their very nature.                      Scholars have emphasized that the\n\ndemocratization of personal relationships serves two purposes. First, it contributes\n\ntowards eliminating the inequality of the power structure in a relationship thereby\n\npreventing exploitation and subjugation; and second, it contributes towards\n\n\n\n\n161 Tammy R Pettinato, “Transforming Marriage: The Transformation of Intimacy and the Democratizing Potential\n\nof Love” JL &amp; Fam.

The withdrawal of the State from the domestic space leaves the\n\ndisadvantaged party unprotected since classifying certain actions as being private\n\nhas different connotations for those with and without power. In the case of personal\n\nrelationships which are characterized by inequality, the actions of the more\n\npowerful person gains immunity from scrutiny and a degree of legitimacy. 163 Thus,\n\nall activities in the ‘private space’ dealing with intimate choices must not readily\n\nand blindly be categorized to be beyond the scope of the State’s regulation. The\n\nState must assess if its interest in democratizing the private space overrides the\n\ninterests of privacy in a given situation.\n\n\n170. The State has identified specific areas in the private sphere where the\n\ninterest in democratizing that space overrides the interests of privacy. For example,\n\nthe State regulates relationships which are in the nature of marriage through the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_322\">DV Act</a>. The preamble to the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_323\">DV Act</a> provides that the statute was enacted to\n\nprotect the rights of women “who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within\n\na family.” <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_324\">The Act</a> regulates the conduct of persons in a domestic relationship which\n\nhas been defined as a relationship between two persons who live together in a\n\nshared household where they are related by marriage, a relationship in the nature\n\nof marriage, adoption, or consanguinity. By criminalizing actions of domestic\n\nviolence against women, the State recognizes that there is an unequal power\n\n\n\n162 ibid\n163Frances Olsen, “Constitutional law: Feminist Critique of the public/private distinction” Vol. 10 (1993),\nConstitutional Commentary, p. 319 (1990)\n\n\n\n                                                   131\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nstructure which operates in heterosexual relationships. The State also recognizes\n\nthat the party with lesser power and autonomy may be subjected to violence and\n\nsuppression and consequently, seeks to democratize the space through\n\nregulation.\n\n\n171. However, in certain other circumstances, the State and the Courts have\n\nrecognized that there is no State interest in regulating the personal space. For\n\nexample, this Court has recognized that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 21</a> protects a woman’s reproductive\n\nchoices which includes whether she wants to terminate her pregnancy.164 <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_326\">The\n\nMedical Termination of Pregnancy Act</a> 1971 recognizes the decisional autonomy\n\nof women over procreation, which is an intimate aspect of their lives. In very narrow\n\ncircumstances, the State regulates intimate choices about child birth and\n\nprocreation. For example, the <a href=\"/doc/13125684/\" id=\"a_327\">Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic\n\nTechniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act</a> 1994 regulates the intimate zone by\n\nprohibiting sex-selection before and after conception. In this case, the State\n\nrecognizes that the interest in preventing female foeticide and infanticide overrides\n\nthe privacy interests and decisional autonomy of individuals.\n\n\nThe argument that the State has an interest in regulating heterosexual marriages\n\nonly to sustain society through procreation is fallacious because the state does not\n\nimpose a compelled choice of procreation on married heterosexual couples.\n\nMoreover, heterosexual couples need not be married to procreate nor is marriage\n\na criteria for procreation.\n\n\n\n\n164 See Deepak Gulati v.

The right to marry\n\n\n            a. Have the courts recognised the right to marry?\n\n\n172. The petitioners submit that this Court has held that the Constitution\n\nguarantees the right to marry in Shafin Jahan (supra) and Shakti Vahini (supra).\n\nIn Shafin Jahan (supra), Ashokan, the father of Akhila alias Hadiya moved a\n\nhabeas corpus petition before the High Court of Kerala with the apprehension that\n\nhis daughter was likely to be transported out of the country. During the course of\n\nthe hearing, the High Court was informed that she had married the petitioner.\n\nHowever, the High Court allowed the petition and directed that (i) Hadiya shall be\n\nescorted from the hostel in which she was residing to the house of the father; and\n\n(ii) the marriage between Hadiya and Shafin Jahan was void. The High Court\n\nobserved that twenty-four year old Hadiya was capable of being exploited and that\n\nthe Court is concerned with her welfare in exercising parens patriae jurisdiction.\n\nOn appeal, this Court set aside the judgment of the High Court. Dipak Misra, C.J.\n\nwriting for the majority observed that Hadiya was entitled to choose a partner of\n\nher choice and curtailing the expression of choice would amount to clipping a\n\nperson’s identity. One of us (D.Y. Chandrachud, J. as he then was) authoring the\n\nconcurring judgment observed that the High Court’s exercise of jurisdiction to\n\ndeclare the marriage null and void amounted to judicial overreach. This Court\n\nobserved that the choice of a partner, whether within or outside of marriage lies in\n\nthe exclusive domain of the individual, and that the State cannot dictate or limit the\n\nfreedom to choose a partner. In this context, this Court observed that the right to\n\n\n\n\n                                          133\n\f                                                                                  PART D\n\nmarry a person of one’s choice is integral to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The\n\nrelevant observations are extracted below:\n\n\n             “84. […] The absolute faith of an individual to choose a life\n             partner is not in the least affected by matters of faith. The\n             Constitution guarantees to each individual the right freely to\n             practise, profess and propogate religion. Choices of faith and\n             belief as indeed choices in matters of marriage lie within an\n             areas where individual autonomy is supreme. The law\n             prescribes conditions for a valid marriage. It provides\n             remedies when relationships run aground. Neither the\n             State not the law can dictate a choice of partners or limit\n             the free ability of every person to decide on these\n             matters.\n\n\n             86. The right to marry a person of one&#x27;s choice is integral to\n             <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The Constitution guarantees the\n             right to life. This right cannot be taken away except through a\n             law which is substantively and procedurally fair, just and\n             reasonable. Intrinsic to the liberty which the Constitution\n             guarantees as a fundamental right is the ability of each\n             individual to take decisions on matters central to the pursuit of\n             happiness. Matters of belief and faith, including whether to\n             believe are at the core of constitutional liberty. […] Society has\n             no role to play in determining our choice of partners.\n\n\n             […]\n\n\n             88.[…] Intimacies of marriage, including the choices which\n             individuals make on whether or not to marry and on whom to\n             marry, lie outside the control of the State. Courts as upholders\n             of constitutional freedoms must safeguard these freedoms.”\n\n\n              (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n173. In Shakti Vahini (supra), proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution\n\nwere instituted seeking directions (i) to State Governments and the Central\n\nGovernment to initiate steps to combat “honour crimes” or caste-based or religion-\n\nbased murder and submit a national plan of action and a State plan of action to\n\ncurb such crimes; (ii) to direct State Governments to constitute special cells in each\n\ndistrict; and (iii) to launch prosecutions in each case of “honour killing” or caste-\n\n\n                                               134\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nbased or religion-based murder. This Court disposed of the writ petition by directing\n\npreventive steps, remedial measures, and punitive measures to curb honour\n\nkillings. Writing for a three-Judge Bench, Dipak Misra, C.J. observed that the ability\n\nof an individual to make choices is an inextricable part of dignity and “that when\n\ntwo adults choose to marry out of their own volition […] they have a right to do\n\nso.” 165\n\n\n174. In Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra), Justice Nariman (in his concurring\n\nopinion) observed that the right to privacy extends beyond the right to be let alone\n\nto recognising the vital personal choices such as the right to abort a fetus, and the\n\nright of same sex to marry. In Navtej (supra), this Court while decriminalising\n\nhomosexuality did not hold that the Constitution recognises a right to marry. Dipak\n\nMisra, C.J. writing for the majority held that an individual has a right to a union\n\nwhich encompasses physical, mental, sexual or emotional companionship under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_331\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n175. In Shafin Jahan (supra) and Shakti Vahini (supra), the issue before this\n\nCourt was whether State or non-State actors could interfere with a person’s choice\n\nof whom to marry. The law prescribes certain essential conditions for a valid\n\nmarriage. In both these cases, this Court dealt with situations where State or non-\n\nState actors prevented a couple which was otherwise entitled to marry, from\n\nmarrying. In the case of Shafin Jahan (supra), the restriction was sought to be\n\nimposed because the partners belonged to different religions and in Shakti Vahini\n\n(supra), this Court dealt with the issue of restraints placed by the society on the\n\n\n\n165 Paragraph 45 of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                         135\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nexercise of a person’s right to marry a person of a difference caste and religion. In\n\nShafin Jahan (supra) this Court held that religion and caste cannot be\n\nimpediments in the exercise of a person’s right to choose whom to marry. In Shafin\n\nJahan (supra) this Court held that no State or non-State entity can interfere with\n\ntheir right to marry a person of their choice.\n\n\n176. Neither the majority in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra) nor the majority\n\nin Navtej (supra) hold that the Constitution guarantees the right to marry.\n\nMoreover, the opinion of Justice Nariman in Justice KS Puttawamy (9J) (supra)\n\nonly made a passing reference to the right to marry. It did not trace the right to\n\nmarry to any of the entrenched fundamental rights nor did it comment on the scope\n\nof such a right. In Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J), the issue before this Court was\n\nwhether the Constitution recognises a right to privacy. Thus, this case did not\n\naddress the issue of whether the Constitution recognises the right to marry. It now\n\nfalls upon this Court for the first time to decide if the Constitution recognises such\n\na right.\n\n\n           b. There is no fundamental right to marry\n\n\n177. The petitioners relied on the judgment of the US Supreme Court in\n\nObergefell (supra) in which the right to marry was recognised as a fundamental\n\nright. In Obergefell (supra), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States imposes a positive\n\nobligation on the State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex.\n\nIn Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, marriage was defined as a union\n\nbetween one man and one woman. The petitioners (who were same-sex couples)\n\n\n\n                                         136\n\f                                                                                                          PART D\n\nclaimed that their exclusion from the institution of marriage violated the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment of the US Constitution. 166 The petitioners filed suits in US district\n\ncourts in their home States. The district courts ruled in their favour. On appeal, the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeal consolidated the cases and reversed the judgment\n\nof the District Court holding that the State has no constitutional obligation to license\n\nsame-sex marriages or to recognise same-sex marriages performed out of State.\n\n\n178. The issue before the US Supreme Court was not whether the Constitution\n\nrecognises the right to marry but whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a\n\nState to license a marriage between two people of the same-sex. Various decisions\n\nof the US Supreme Court had already recognised the right to marry.167 Justice\n\nKennedy (writing for the majority) observed that the right to marry consists of the\n\nfollowing four components: (i) the right of choice; (ii) the protection of intimate\n\nassociation by supporting the union of two persons; (iii) safeguards for children and\n\nfamilies, and (iv) cornerstone of social order because marriage is the basis for\n\ngovernmental rights, benefits, and responsibilities.\n\n\n179. The opinion of the majority held that the components of marriage are not\n\nexclusive to heterosexual couples. Thus, the State by not recognising a same-sex\n\nunion (which is legal) and by not granting benefits which accrue from a marriage\n\nwas held to be treating same-sex couples unequally, violating the equal protection\n\nclause.\n\n\n\n166 <a href=\"/doc/1836975/\" id=\"a_332\">Section 1</a> to the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution states that no State shall deprive any person of\n\nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law and equal protection of the laws.\n167 In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S 1, 12 (1967), the US Supreme Court invalidated bans on inter-racial unions holding\n\nthat marriage is one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men; In Turner\nv. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95(1987) the US Supreme Court held that the right to marry was abridged by regulations\nlimiting the privilege of prison inmates to marry.\n\n\n\n                                                        137\n\f                                                                                      PART D\n\n180.      Earlier judgments of the US Courts had held that marriage is a civic right\n\nbecause it is fundamental to existence and survival168, is part of the fundamental\n\nright to privacy 169, and essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness.170 It was also\n\nheld that without the right to marry, one is excluded from the full range of human\n\nexperience and is denied “full protection of the laws for one’s avowed commitment\n\nto an intimate and lasting relationship.” 171 The jurisprudence which has emanated\n\nfrom the US Courts indicates that the right to marry is recognised as a fundamental\n\nright because of the benefits (both expressive and material) attached to it.\n\n\n181. Entry 5 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution\n\ngrants both the State legislature and Parliament the power to enact laws with\n\nrespect to marriage. The provision reads as follows:\n\n\n                  “Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills,\n                  intestacy and succession; joint family and partition; all matters\n                  in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were\n                  immediately before the commencement of this Constitution\n                  subject to their personal law.”\n\n\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n182. In pursuance of the power conferred by <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_333\">Articles 245</a> and <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_334\">246</a> read with Entry\n\n5 of the Concurrent List, Parliament has enacted laws creating and regulating the\n\nsocio-legal institution of marriage. The State legislatures have made amendments\n\nto such laws with the assent of the President, since the subject of marriage is in\n\nthe Concurrent list. The petitioners seek that the Court recognise the right to marry\n\nas a fundamental right. As explained above, this would mean that even if\n\n\n168 Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S 535\n169 Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S 374\n170 Loving v. Virginia, 388 US 1\n171 Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass.2003)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    138\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\nParliament and the State legislatures have not created an institution of marriage in\n\nexercise of their powers under Entry 5 of the Concurrent list, they would be\n\nobligated to create an institution because of the positive postulate encompassed\n\nin the right to marry. This argument cannot be accepted.\n\n\n183. As explained in the previous section, the State through the instrument of law\n\ncharacterises marriage with two constituent elements: the expressive component\n\nand the material component. Marriage may not have attained the social and legal\n\nsignificance it currently has if the State had not regulated it through law. Thus, while\n\nmarriage is not fundamental in itself, it may have attained significance because of\n\nthe benefits which are realised through regulation.\n\n\n184. This Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra) while holding that\n\nprivacy is a fundamental right was not guided by the content given to privacy by\n\nthe State. This Court was of the opinion that if the right to privacy is not secured,\n\nthe full purport of the rights entrenched in the Constitution could not be secured.\n\nSimilarly, this Court in Unnikrishnan (supra) held that the right to education is a\n\nfundamental right. The right to education was derived from the provisions of the\n\nDirective Principles of the State Policy and their centrality to development of an\n\nindividual. Entry 25 of the Concurrent list authorizes Parliament and State\n\nlegislatures to enact laws on “education.” The State in pursuance of this power\n\nhas enacted numerous legislations relating to education such as laws establishing\n\nand regulating universities and colleges. However, the right to education was held\n\nto be a fundamental right, not because of any statute or law but because of its\n\ncentrality to the values that the Constitution espouses. The arguments of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          139\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\npetitioners that the Constitution recognises a right to marry is hinged on the\n\nmeaning accorded to marriage by statutes, which cannot be accepted.\n\n\n185. The Constitution does not expressly recognize a fundamental right to marry.\n\nYet it cannot be gainsaid that many of our constitutional values, including the right\n\nto life and personal liberty may comprehend the values which a marital relationship\n\nentails. They may at the very least entail respect for the choice of a person whether\n\nand when to enter upon marriage and the right to choose a marital partner.\n\n\n         c. The challenge to the SMA\n\n\n            I.      The scheme of the SMA\n\n\n186. The SMA was enacted to provide a special form of marriage for couples\n\nbelonging to different religions and castes. <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_335\">Section 4</a> of the SMA prescribes\n\nconditions relating to the solemnization of special marriages. The relevant portion\n\nof the provision is extracted below:\n\n\n                 “4. Conditions relating to solemnization of special\n                 marriages.―Notwithstanding anything contained in any other\n                 law for the time being in force relating to the solemnization of\n                 marriages, a marriage between any two persons may be\n                 solemnized under this Act, if at the time of the marriage the\n                 following conditions are fulfilled, namely:―\n\n\n                 (a) neither party has a spouse living;\n\n\n                 [(b) neither party―\n\n\n                 (i) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence\n                 of unsoundness of mind; or\n\n\n                 (ii) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been\n                 suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an\n\n\n\n\n                                                  140\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n             extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of\n             children; or\n\n\n             (iii) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity\n\n\n             (c) the male has completed the age of twenty-one years and\n             the female the age of eighteen years;\n\n\n             (d) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited\n             relationship:\n\n\n             Provided that where a custom governing at least one of the\n             parties permits of a marriage between them, such marriage\n             may be solemnized, notwithstanding that they are within the\n             degrees of prohibited relationship;\n\n\n             […] ”\n\n\n             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n187. <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_336\">Section 4(a)</a> and (b) use the gender-neutral word ‘party.’ However, <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_337\">Section\n\n4(c)</a> stipulates that the male must have completed twenty-one years and the\n\nfemale must have completed eighteen years. <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_338\">Section 4(d)</a> stipulates that the\n\nparties should not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship. <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_339\">Section 2(b)</a>\n\ndefines “degrees of prohibited relationship: as follows:\n\n\n             “(b) “degrees of prohibited relationship”-a man and any of the\n             persons mentioned in Part I of the First Schedule and a\n             woman and any of the persons mentioned in Part II of the\n             said Schedule are within the degrees of prohibited\n             relationship.\n\n\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n188.

Chapter IV of the enactment lays down the consequences of marriage under\n\nthe SMA. <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_342\">Section 19</a> stipulates that the marriage solemnized under the SMA of any\n\nmember of an undivided family who professes the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, or Jain\n\nreligions shall be deemed to effect their severance from such family. <a href=\"/doc/497797/\" id=\"a_343\">Section 20</a>\n\nprovides that subject to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_344\">Section 19</a>, any person whose marriage\n\nis solemnized under this Act shall have the same rights and shall be subject to the\n\nsame disabilities in regard to the right of succession as a person to whom the <a href=\"/doc/1508011/\" id=\"a_345\">Caste\n\nDisabilities Removal Act</a> 1850 applies. <a href=\"/doc/1508011/\" id=\"a_346\">The Caste Disabilities Removal Act</a> 1950\n\nprovides that any law or usage which inflicts the forfeiture of rights or property, or\n\nwhich would affect the right of inheritance because of renouncing religion, having\n\nbeen excluded from the communion of religion, or being deprived of caste shall\n\ncease to be enforced by law. Thus, subject to <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_347\">Section 19</a> of the Act, a person’s\n\nright to inheritance shall be not forfeited because they married a person of another\n\nreligion or caste.\n\n\n190. <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_348\">Section 21</a> states that succession to the property of any person whose\n\nmarriage is solemnized under this Act shall be regulated by the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1450343/\" id=\"a_349\">Indian Succession Act</a> 1925. Section 21A provides a special provision in certain\n\ncases. The provision states that <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_350\">Sections 19</a>, <a href=\"/doc/497797/\" id=\"a_351\">20</a> (to the extent that it creates a\n\ndisability), and 21 shall not apply when a marriage is solemnized between a person\n\nwho professes the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, or Jain religion with a person who\n\nprofesses the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain religion.

Section 21A was introduced in\n\n1976 as a progressive provision. Section 21A links the SMA with the HSA if both\n\nthe parties belong to a religion to which the HSA applies. Section 21A was\n\nintroduced to remedy the disability brought in by <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_353\">Section 21</a>.\n\n\n191. <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_354\">Section 27</a> deals with divorce. <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 27(1A)</a> grants the wife additional\n\ngrounds of divorce. <a href=\"/doc/175453/\" id=\"a_356\">Section 31</a> stipulates the Court to which a petition for divorce\n\nmust be made. Sub-Section (2) of the Section is a special provision available to\n\nthe wife for the presentation of a divorce petition. <a href=\"/doc/1515822/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 36</a> stipulates that the\n\nhusband may be directed to pay expenses of the proceedings and such sum based\n\non the income of the husband when the wife has no independent income, sufficient\n\nto support herself and necessary for divorce proceedings. <a href=\"/doc/1167708/\" id=\"a_358\">Section 37</a> stipulates\n\nthat the court may order the husband to pay the wife permanent alimony and\n\nmaintenance.\n\n\n192. The petitioners argue that <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 4</a> of the SMA is unconstitutional not\n\nbecause it expressly excludes or bars the marriage between two persons of the\n\nsame-sex but because it excludes the solemnization of marriage between non-\n\nheterosexual persons by implication since it only governs a heterosexual union.\n\n\n       II.   The decision of the South African Constitutional Court in Fourie\n\n\n193. The petitioners have relied on Fourie (supra), a case which emanated from\n\nSouth Africa, to argue that provisions of the SMA must be read in a gender-neutral\n\n\n                                       143\n\f                                                                                   PART D\n\nmanner. In Fourie (supra), the common law definition of marriage and <a href=\"/doc/867182/\" id=\"a_360\">Section\n\n30(1)</a> of the Marriage Act (Act 25 of 1961)172 were challenged. The common law\n\ndefinition of marriage in South Africa is that it is a “union of one man with one\n\nwoman, to the exclusion, while its lasts, of all others.” The formula for marriage\n\nprescribed by <a href=\"/doc/867182/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 30(1)</a> of the Marriage Act is extracted below:\n\n\n                 “Do you, A.B., declare that as far as you know there is no\n                 lawful impediment to your proposed marriage with C.D. here\n                 present, and that you call all here present to witness that you\n                 take C.D. as your lawful wife (or husband)?’, and thereupon\n                 the parties shall give each other the right hand and the\n                 marriage officer concerned shall declare the marriage\n                 solemnized in the following words: ‘I declare that A.B. and\n                 C.D. here present have been lawfully married.”\n\n\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n194. The petitioners in Fourie (supra) argued that the reference of “husband or\n\nwife” in <a href=\"/doc/377920/\" id=\"a_362\">Section 30(1)</a> excluded same-sex couples. The South African\n\nConstitutional Court allowed the petition by holding that <a href=\"/doc/377920/\" id=\"a_363\">Section 30(1)</a> was\n\nunconstitutional because it excluded same-sex couples. The opinion of the majority\n\nauthored by Justice Albie Sachs suspended the declaration of invalidity for one\n\nyear to cure defects in view of Section 172(1)(b) of the South African Constitution.\n\nIf the defect was not cured within the time frame stipulated, the word ‘spouse’ was\n\nto be read in the place of “wife (or husband)”. Justice Kate O Regan who authored\n\nthe minority opinion disagreed with the majority on the question of the remedy. The\n\nlearned Judge observed that the scales of justice and equity necessitate immediate\n\nrelief and not a suspended declaration of invalidity.\n\n\n\n\n172 “South African Marriage Act”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 144\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n195. The Court observed that Section 30(1) of the South African Marriage Act\n\nwas underinclusive because it excluded same-sex unions by silence and omission.\n\nSuch omission was as effective in law and practice as if effected by express\n\nlanguage. The Court held that it would be discriminatory if same-sex couples were\n\nnot given the benefits (both tangible and intangible) which were available to\n\nheterosexual couples through marriage. The State justified the exclusion of same-\n\nsex couples from the institution of marriage because of the social nature of\n\nmarriage and strong religious beliefs. The Court rejected this argument on the\n\nground that the reasons which were used to justify the exclusion were grounded in\n\nprejudice and that it was not a valid justification for the violation of fundamental\n\nrights.\n\n\n196. On the question of relief, the Court made the following observations:\n\n\n     a. Parliament had expressly and impliedly recognised same-sex partnerships.\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_364\">The Domestic Violence Act</a> 116 of 1998 defined a domestic partnership as\n\n          a relationship between a complainant and a respondent who are of the\n\n          same or opposite sex and who live/lived together in a relationship in the\n\n          nature of marriage. <a href=\"/doc/988436/\" id=\"a_365\">The Estate Duty Act</a> 45 of 1955 stipulated that the\n\n          spouse in relation to a deceased person includes a person who at the time\n\n          of death of the deceased person was a partner of such person in a same-\n\n          sex or heterosexual union;\n\n\n     b. Section 172(1)(b) of the Constitution granted the Court the power to issue\n\n          such order including suspending the declaration of invalidity for any period\n\n\n\n\n                                          145\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\n        and on any conditions, to allow the competent authority to correct the\n\n        defect;\n\n\n    c. There was extensive consultation with the public on the issue of same-sex\n\n        marriage. The South African Law Reform Commission’s memorandum on\n\n        domestic partnership harmonised family law principles with the Bill of\n\n        Rights which was preceded by extensive public consultation; and\n\n\n    d. The Court instead of reading in must grant the remedy of suspended\n\n        declaration because reading in would be a temporary remedial measure\n\n        which would be far less likely to achieve equality. Legislative action was\n\n        well-suited for this purpose.\n\n\n197. Though facially the case mounted by the petitioners before us is similar to\n\nthe case mounted by the petitioners in Fourie (supra), the legal and the\n\nconstitutional regime in South Africa and India varies. First, it must be noticed that\n\nunlike the SMA, there was only one provision in the South African Marriage Act\n\n(that is, <a href=\"/doc/377920/\" id=\"a_366\">Section 30(1)</a>) which made a reference to heterosexual relationships.\n\nHowever, as indicated above, various provisions of the SMA (<a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_367\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_368\">27(1A)</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/175453/\" id=\"a_369\">31</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1515822/\" id=\"a_370\">36</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1167708/\" id=\"a_371\">37</a>) confine marriage to a union between heterosexual persons.\n\nSecond, various enactments in South Africa already recognised same-sex unions\n\nunlike the Indian legal landscape where no law even remotely recognises the union\n\nbetween a same-sex couple. Thus, the canvas of the challenge before the South\n\nAfrican Constitutional Court in Fourie (supra) and the legal and constitutional\n\nregime in place varies widely from that in India.\n\n\n\n\n                                         146\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\n            III.   The decision of the UK House of Lords in Ghaidan\n\n\n198. Learned counsel for the petitioners argued that this Court ought to interpret\n\nthe SMA to make it ‘constitutionally compliant.’ They relied on the decision of the\n\nHouse of Lords of the United Kingdom in Ghaidan (supra) and urged this Court to\n\nadopt the principle of interpretation which had been adopted in that case.\n\n\n199. In that case, the respondent was in a stable and monogamous homosexual\n\nrelationship with his partner who was a tenant in the house that the couple shared.\n\nThe respondent and his partner were living together when the latter died. The\n\nappellant (being the landlord) claimed possession of the house. The respondent\n\nresisted the claim on the ground that he ought to be considered a ‘statutory tenant’\n\nin terms of UK’s <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_372\">Rent Act</a> 1977. 173 This enactment provided that a surviving spouse\n\nof the original tenant shall be the statutory tenant if the surviving spouse was\n\nresiding in the house in question immediately before the death of the original\n\ntenant. It also stipulated that a person who was living with the original tenant “as\n\nhis or her wife or husband” shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant. In\n\nessence, the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_373\">Rent Act</a> protected the tenancy rights of a heterosexual couple when\n\nthe couple was in a relationship that was of a similar character as marriage. The\n\nsurviving partner in a homosexual relationship could have become entitled to an\n\n‘assured tenancy’ which was less advantageous than a statutory tenancy.\n\n\n200. The respondent contended that the difference in the treatment of\n\nheterosexual couples and homosexual couples was based on their sexual\n\norientation alone, and lacked justification, infringing <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_374\">Article 14 (prohibition of\n\n\n173 “<a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_375\">Rent Act</a>”\n\n\n\n\n                                         147\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\ndiscrimination)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_376\">Article 8 (right to respect for private</a> and family life) of the\n\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. 174 He further argued that the court had a\n\nduty under <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_377\">Section 3</a> of the UK’s <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_378\">Human Rights Act</a> 1998175 to read and give effect\n\nto the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_379\">Rent Act</a> in a way which was compliant with the ECHR. In other words, he\n\nurged the court to read the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_380\">Rent Act</a> such that it granted the surviving partner in a\n\nclose and stable homosexual relationship the same rights as the surviving partner\n\nin a heterosexual relationship of a similar nature – the right to succeed the tenancy\n\nas a statutory tenant. The court of first instance rejected the respondent’s\n\narguments. The first appellate court allowed the appeal, leading to proceedings\n\nbefore the final appellate authority, the House of Lords (now, the Supreme Court\n\nof the UK).\n\n\n201. The House of Lords accepted the respondent’s arguments.176 It noted that\n\nthe rationale of the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_381\">Rent Act</a> was that the security of tenure in a house which a\n\ncouple had made their home ought not to depend upon which of them dies first. It\n\nheld that there was no legitimate state aim which justified the difference in\n\ntreatment of heterosexual and homosexual couples, and found that the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_382\">Rent Act</a>\n\ntherefore violated the rights of the respondent under the ECHR. Having so found,\n\nit relied on <a href=\"/doc/842137/\" id=\"a_383\">Section 3</a> of the Human Rights Act to interpret the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_384\">Rent Act</a> to mean\n\nthat the survivor of a homosexual couple would have rights on par with the survivor\n\nof a heterosexual relationship for the purposes of succession as a statutory tenant.\n\n\n\n\n174 “ECHR”\n175 “<a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_385\">Human Rights Act</a>”\n176 By a majority of 4-1.\n\n\n\n\n                                          148\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n202. <a href=\"/doc/842137/\" id=\"a_386\">Section 3</a> of the Human Rights Act reads as follows:\n\n\n             “3. Interpretation of legislation\n\n\n         (1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and\n             subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way\n             which is compatible with the Convention rights.”\n\n\nAs noticed by the House of Lords in Ghaidan (supra):\n\n\n  a.   This provision was one of the primary means by which rights under the\n\n       ECHR were brought into the law of the UK;\n\n\n  b.   <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_387\">Section 3</a> permitted courts in the UK to depart from the unambiguous\n\n       meaning of a statute, if required;\n\n\n  c.   It also authorized courts in the UK to depart from legislative intent in\n\n       interpreting the language used in a statute, if required;\n\n\n  d.   It allowed courts to read in words to a statute which changed the meaning\n\n       of that statute, to make it compliant with the ECHR as long as the new\n\n       meaning was compatible with the underlying thrust of that enactment; and\n\n\n  e.   <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_388\">Section 3</a> did not authorize courts to make decisions for which they were\n\n       not equipped, such as when there were many ways of making a particular\n\n       provision compliant with the ECHR.\n\n\nThe House of Lords also noted that difficult problems could arise in some cases.\n\n\n203. It is not open to this Court to adopt the interpretative principle laid down in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/842137/\" id=\"a_389\">Section 3</a> of the Human Rights Act for a simple reason: the House of Lords derived\n\nthe power to depart from legislative intent and read words into a statute such that\n\n\n                                                 149\n\f                                                                                                         PART D\n\nit was compliant with the ECHR from the Human Rights Act, a statute enacted by\n\nthe Parliament of UK. It did not rely on a common law principle or fashion a principle\n\nof interpretation based on common law. The House of Lords itself noted that “the\n\ninterpretative obligation decreed by <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_390\">section 3</a> is of an unusual and far-reaching\n\ncharacter.” 177 In India, there is no legislation which permits this Court to depart from\n\nlegislative intent and read words into a legislation such that it is compliant with the\n\nConstitution. 178 As discussed in the previous segment of this judgment on the\n\npower of judicial review, courts in India must be circumspect in relying on the law\n\nin other jurisdictions, torn from the context in which those decisions have been\n\ncrafted. It is not permissible for this Court to exercise a power which the Parliament\n\nof another country conferred on its courts, absent a similar conferment of power\n\nunder the Indian Constitution. This Court must exercise those powers which it has\n\nby virtue of the Constitution of India or any other Indian law. In any event, as the\n\nHouse of Lords held, courts may not exercise this power to make decisions for\n\nwhich they are ill equipped. This Court is not equipped to recognize the right of\n\nqueer persons to marry under the SMA for reasons discussed in subsequent\n\nsegments.\n\n\n       IV.      Institutional limitations with respect to the interpretation of SMA\n\n\n204. It must be noted that this Court in the beginning of the hearing restricted the\n\nbreadth of the challenge to non-personal marriage law. However, on a careful\n\nperusal of the provisions of the SMA, it is evident that Section 21A links the SMA\n\n\n177 Opinion of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Ghaidan (supra).\n178 Principles of interpretation which are well accepted in India must guide this Court’s decision. For example, when\n\ntwo constructions of a provision are possible, courts ought to prefer the construction which gives effect to the\nprovision rather than the one which renders it inoperative. M. Pentiah v. Veeramallappa Muddal, 1961 (2) SCR\n295; Tinsukhia Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam, (1989) 3 SCC 709\n\n\n\n                                                        150\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nto personal and non-personal laws of succession. In fact, such is the complexity of\n\nthe SMA that the petitioners themselves had to submit lengthy charts on\n\nworkability, which in effect reworked the structure of the SMA to include non-\n\nheterosexual unions.\n\n\n205. Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for one of the petitioners submitted\n\nthat there are three plausible interpretations of Section 21A in its application to\n\nmarriages between two Hindus under the provisions of the SMA:\n\n\n  a.   The Court may choose not to decide on the applicability of Section 21A to\n\n       non-heterosexual Hindu couples in the present litigation and leave the\n\n       question of succession open for future litigation;\n\n\n  b.   The succession of Hindu non-heterosexual couples will be governed by the\n\n       HSA and that of other interfaith non-heterosexual couples will be governed\n\n       by the ISA (similar to interfaith heterosexual couples or heterosexual\n\n       couples of other religions). This requires a gender-neutral reading of the\n\n       HSA and the ISA. The words “widow” and “widower” in the ISA and “male\n\n       Hindu”, “female Hindu”, “widow”, and “widower” in the HSA can be\n\n       interpreted in a gender neutral manner. This interpretation must only be\n\n       limited to issues related to marriage. To include transgender persons, the\n\n       Court may hold that the words “male” and “female” under <a href=\"/doc/1772285/\" id=\"a_391\">Sections 8</a> and\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_392\">15</a> of the HSA may be read as “persons”; or\n\n\n  c.   Since by agreement of parties, religious and personal law related issues\n\n       are beyond the scope of this litigation, it follows that provisions of secular\n\n       law that relate back to personal laws (like Section 21A) are excluded from\n\n\n                                        151\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\n        consideration. Since Section 21A was introduced as an exception to the\n\n        regime under <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_393\">Sections 19</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_394\">21</a>, non-consideration of the issue would\n\n        revert the law to the position before the introduction of Section 21A which\n\n        is that ISA would apply to all marriages under the SMA.\n\n\n206. In addition to the ‘reading in’ of the provisions of other statutes such as ISA\n\nand HSA, the petitioners argue that the Court must also read into the following\n\nprovisions of the SMA:\n\n\n  a.    The words &quot;widow&quot; and &quot;widower&quot; in Schedules II and III of SMA must be\n\n        read as &quot;widow or widower&quot; and &quot;widower or widow&quot;; and\n\n\n  b.    <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_395\">Section 4(c)</a> of SMA may be interpreted in the following way:\n\n\n        i.    For same-sex couples, the provision may be read as prescribing\n\n              eighteen years as the minimum age for both parties in a lesbian\n\n              relationship, and twenty-one years for both parties in a gay\n\n              relationship;\n\n\n       ii.    For transgender persons, the minimum age requirement would\n\n              depend on whichever gender/sex they identify as. So, a trans-man\n\n              would be eligible to marry at twenty one years of age while a trans-\n\n              woman would be eligible to marry at eighteen years; and\n\n\n       iii.   For those who do not identify either as a man or a woman, the\n\n              following approach shall be adopted to ensure the inclusion of non-\n\n              binary and intersex individuals:\n\n\n\n\n                                        152\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\n                      A.      The silence of the SMA on the minimum age qualification for\n\n                              persons other than ‘men’ and ‘women’ may be read as\n\n                              imposing no restriction other than the restriction imposed by\n\n                              other laws that stipulate the age at which persons are capable\n\n                              of making decisions for themselves, which is eighteen years;\n\n                              and\n\n\n                      B.      Alternatively, the Court may lay down guidelines as an interim\n\n                              measure and until Parliament fills the legislative vacuum.\n\n\n207. If the Court finds that a provision is contrary to Part III of the Constitution, it\n\nshall declare that it is void, 179 or read it down (by deleting phrases) or read words\n\nin (by adding or substituting phrases) to save it from being declared void. If, in the\n\npresent batch of petitions, this Court holds that <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_396\">Section 4</a> is unconstitutional\n\nbecause it is underinclusive to the extent that it excludes, by implication, the\n\nmarriage between same-sex couples, the court could either strike down <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_397\">Section 4</a>\n\nof the SMA or follow the workability model submitted by the petitioners. If the Court\n\nfollows the first approach, the purpose of a progressive legislation such as the SMA\n\nwould be lost. The SMA was enacted to enable persons of different religions and\n\ncastes to marry. If the SMA is held void for excluding same-sex couples, it would\n\ntake India back to the pre-independence era were two persons of different religions\n\nand caste were unable to celebrate love in the form of marriage. Such a judicial\n\nverdict would not only have the effect of taking the nation back to the era when it\n\nwas clothed in social inequality and religious intolerance but would also push the\n\n\n\n179 <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_398\">Article 13</a> of the Constitution\n\n\n\n\n                                                 153\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\ncourts to choose between eradicating one form of discrimination and prejudice at\n\nthe cost of permitting another.\n\n\n208. If this Court takes the second approach and reads words into the provisions\n\nof the SMA and provisions of other allied laws such as the ISA and HSA, it would\n\nin effect be entering into the realm of the legislature. The submissions of the\n\npetitioners indicate that this Court would be required to extensively read words into\n\nnumerous provisions of the SMA and other allied laws. The Court is not equipped\n\nto undertake an exercise of such wide amplitude because of its institutional\n\nlimitations. This Court would in effect be redrafting the law(s) in the garb of reading\n\nwords into the provisions. It is trite law that judicial legislation is impermissible. We\n\nare conscious that the court usually first determines if the law is unconstitutional,\n\nand then proceeds to decide on the relief. However, in this case, an exercise to\n\ndetermine whether the SMA is unconstitutional because of under-inclusivity would\n\nbe futile because of the limitations of this Court’s power to grant a remedy. Whether\n\na change should be brought into the legislative regime of the SMA is for Parliament\n\nto determine. Parliament has access to varied sources of information and\n\nrepresents in itself a diversity of viewpoints in the polity. The Court in the exercise\n\nof the power of judicial review must be careful not to tread into the legislative\n\ndomain. It is clarified that this Court has not adjudicated upon the validity of any\n\nlaws other than the SMA, the FMA, the Adoption Regulations, and the CARA\n\nCircular.\n\n\n\n\n                                          154\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\n        d.      The challenge to the FMA\n\n\n209. Some petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the FMA and have\n\nsought a declaration that it applies to any two persons who seek to get married,\n\nregardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation. The FMA applies to two\n\ncategories of persons – to parties who seek to solemnize their marriage under the\n\nFMA in a foreign country 180 and to those who seek to register their marriage under\n\nthe FMA when their marriage has been solemnized in a foreign country in\n\naccordance with the law of that country.181 In both cases, at least one of the parties\n\nto the marriage must be a citizen of India. 182 <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_399\">Section 4</a> of the FMA specifies certain\n\nconditions which must be fulfilled before the parties can avail of its provisions:\n\n\n                  “4. Conditions relating to solemnization of foreign marriages.\n                  — A marriage between parties one of whom at least is a\n                  citizen of India may be solemnized under this Act by or before\n                  a Marriage Officer in a foreign country, if, at the time of the\n                  marriage, the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:—\n\n\n                  (a) neither party has a spouse living,\n\n\n                  (b) neither party is an idiot or a lunatic,\n\n\n                  (c) the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years\n                  and the bride the age of eighteen years at the time of the\n                  marriage, and\n\n\n                  (d) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited\n                  relationship:\n\n\n                  Provided that where the personal law or a custom governing\n                  at least one of the parties permits of a marriage between\n                  them, such marriage may be solemnized, notwithstanding that\n                  they are within the degrees of prohibited relationship.”\n\n\n\n180 Chapter II, FMA\n181 Chapter III, FMA\n182 <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_400\">Section 4</a>, FMA; <a href=\"/doc/1461791/\" id=\"a_401\">Section 17(2)</a>, FMA\n\n\n\n\n                                                     155\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\n210. Clauses (c) and (d) contain requirements which prevent this Court from\n\ninterpreting the FMA as applying to persons regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nClause (c) requires the bridegroom to be at least twenty-one years and the bride\n\nto be at least eighteen years of age. If this Court were to interpret <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_402\">Section 4</a> as\n\napplying to same-sex relationships, the question of how clause (c) would apply to\n\nsuch relationships would arise. Various approaches were proposed including\n\nreading the provision as requiring a minimum age of twenty-one for all men and\n\neighteen for all women, such that two men who sought to marry would both be\n\nrequired to be twenty-one years and two women who sought to marry would both\n\nhave to be eighteen years. Another approach that was proposed was to interpret\n\nthe provision as requiring a common minimum age for all same-sex couples. This\n\nCourt is of the opinion that such an exercise would amount to judicial legislation.\n\nWhen there are various options open for a legislative change and policy\n\nconsiderations abound, it is best left to Parliament to engage in democratic\n\ndecision-making and settle upon a suitable course of action.\n\n\n211. Clause (d) requires the parties not to be within the degrees of prohibited\n\nrelationship. <a href=\"/doc/519879/\" id=\"a_403\">Section 2(a)</a> defines the phrase ‘degrees of prohibited relationship’ as\n\nhaving the same meaning as in the SMA. The reasons why the degrees of\n\nprohibited relationship cannot be interpreted by this Court to include same-sex\n\nrelationships has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The same reasons\n\napply to Clause (d) of the FMA.\n\n\n212. The FMA recognizes the right of an Indian citizen to marry outside India or\n\nto a marry a person from a foreign country. In essence, it recognizes the right of a\n\n\n\n\n                                        156\n\f                                                                                              PART D\n\ncitizen of India to choose a life partner who is not a citizen of India. It follows that\n\ncitizens of India may enter into an abiding union with a person of their choice,\n\nincluding a person of the same sex as them, even if that person is not a citizen of\n\nIndia. It is accordingly clarified that the right of a citizen of India to enter into an\n\nabiding union with a foreign citizen of the same sex is preserved.\n\n\n       ix.    The right to enter into a union\n\n\n                     “The need to love is as important a force in human society\n                     as is the will to power. Power wants to destroy or consume\n                     or drive away the other, the one who is different, whose will\n                     is different. Love wants the other to remain, always nearby,\n                     but always itself, always other.” 183\n\n\n             a. The goal of self-development and what it means to be human\n\n\n213. Over the years, through dialogue both inside and outside the courts, it has\n\nbeen established that the negative and positive postulates of fundamental\n\nfreedoms and the Constitution as a whole inter alia secure conditions for self-\n\ndevelopment at both an individual and a group level. This understanding can be\n\ntraced to numerous provisions of Part III of the Constitution, the preambular values,\n\nand the jurisprudence which has emanated from Courts. For example, this Court\n\nhas held that the right to live under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_404\">Article 21</a> secures more than the right of\n\nphysical existence. It includes, inter alia, the right to a quality life which has been\n\ninterpreted to include the right to live in an environment free from smoke and\n\npollution, 184 the right to access good roads, 185 and a suitable accommodation which\n\nwould enable them to grow in every aspect – mental, physical, and intellectual. 186\n\n\n183 Margaret Trawick, Notes on Love in a Tamil Family (University of California Press 1992)\n184 MC Mehta v. Union of India, (2019) 17 SCC 490\n185 State of Himachal Pradesh v. Umed Ram Sharma, (1986)      2 SCC 68\n186Shantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal Totame (1990) 1 SCC 520\n\n\n\n\n                                                      157\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\nSimilarly, it has been established that a free exchange of ideas recognized under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_405\">Article 19</a> is an integral aspect of the right to self-development. 187 The rights against\n\nexploitation 188 and against discrimination and untouchability189 secure the creation\n\nof equal spaces in public and private spheres, which is essential for self-growth.\n\nThe right to quality education without discrimination 190 also ensures that every\n\ncitizen secures basic education to develop themselves. The freedom to profess\n\nand practice religion 191 also enables individuals to evolve spiritually.\n\n\n214. This understanding of the Constitution is substantiated on a reading of Part\n\nIV of the Constitution. To illustrate, <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_406\">Article 38</a> states that the State shall strive to\n\npromote the welfare of the people, <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_407\">Article 42</a> stipulates that the State shall\n\nendeavour to secure just and humane conditions of work, and <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_408\">Article 47</a> places a\n\nduty on the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living. The\n\nConstitution, through both positive and negative postulations, inter alia capacitates\n\ncitizens in their quest to develop themselves. Such capacity-building enables them\n\nto achieve their full potential in both the private and the public space, and to be\n\nhappy. The Indian Constitution (unlike, say, the South African Constitution) does\n\nnot expressly provide that the Constitution seeks to improve the quality of life and\n\nfree the potential of each person. However, such an understanding can be gleaned\n\nfrom the provisions of Part III and Part IV of the Constitution. Thus, one of the\n\npurposes of the rights framework is to enable the citizenry to attain the goal of self-\n\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\n187 D.C Saxena v.

Martha C. Nussbaum laid down a list of ten capabilities which are central\n\nrequirements to live a quality life. 192 Two of the identified capabilities are crucial for\n\nour discussion. 193 The first is ‘emotions’ which is characterized as follows:\n\n\n                  “5. Emotions: Being able to have attachments to things and\n                  people outside ourselves; to love those who love and care for\n                  us, to grieve at their absence; in general, to love, to grieve, to\n                  experience longing, gratitude, and justified anger. Not having\n                  one’s emotional development blighted by fear and anxiety.\n                  (Supporting this capability means supporting forms of human\n                  association that can be shown to be crucial in their\n                  development)”\n\n\n                                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThe second is ‘affiliation’ which is characterized as follows:\n\n\n                  “7.

The capabilities of ‘emotions’ and ‘affiliations’ identified by Nussbaum for\n\nself-development and sustaining a quality life are crucial for two important reasons.\n\nFirst, both capabilities focus on the human side of a person, that is, the ability and\n\nnecessity of a person to emote and form relationships and associations. Second,\n\nthe distinction between the capabilities of ‘emotions’ and ‘affiliation’ is that in the\n\nformer, the emphasis is upon the agency of the individual and the freedom they\n\n\n\n192 Martha (n 150)\n193 The other capabilities listed by Martha C.

Humans are unique in many respects. We live in complex societies, are able\n\nto think, communicate, imagine, strategize, and do more. However, that which sets\n\nus apart from other species does not by itself make us human. These qualities are\n\nnecessary elements of our humanity but taken alone, they paint an incomplete\n\npicture. In addition to these qualities, our ability to feel love and affection for one\n\nanother makes us human. We may not be unique in our ability to feel the emotion\n\nof love but it is certainly a fundamental feature of our humanity. We have an innate\n\nneed to see and to be seen – to have our identity, emotions, and needs fully\n\nacknowledged, recognized, and accepted. The ability to feel emotions such as\n\ngrief, happiness, anger, and affection and the need to share them with others\n\nmakes us who we are. As human beings, we seek companionship and most of us\n\nvalue abiding relationships with other human beings in different forms and\n\ncapacities. These relationships may take many forms – the natal family, cousins\n\nand relatives, friends, romantic partnerships, mentors, or students. Of these, the\n\nnatal family as well as the family created with one’s life partner form the\n\nfundamental groups of society. 194 The need and ability to be a part of a family forms\n\na core component of our humanity. These relationships which nourish the\n\nemotional and spiritual aspects of our humanity are important in and of themselves.\n\nFurther, they are as important to self-development as the intellectual (and\n\n\n\n\n194 The Preamble of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the importance of the\n\nfamily in the following terms: “…Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural\nenvironment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the\nnecessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community…”\n\n\n\n                                                     160\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\neventually, financial) nourishment we receive through education. Self-development\n\ncannot be measured solely in terms of educational qualifications and financial\n\ncapabilities. Such a description is to forget what makes as human.\n\n\n218. It is insufficient if persons have the ability and freedom to form relationships\n\nunregulated by the State. For the full enjoyment of the such relationships, it is\n\nnecessary that the State accord recognition to such relationships. Thus, the right\n\nto enter into a union includes the right to associate with a partner of one’s choice,\n\naccording recognition to the association, and ensuring that there is no denial of\n\naccess to basic goods and services is crucial to achieve the goal of self-\n\ndevelopment.\n\n\n          b. The rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_415\">Article 19</a>\n\n\n     I.    The right to freedom of speech and expression and to form intimate\n\n           associations\n\n\n219. <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_416\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution recognizes the right to freedom of speech\n\nand expression. Freedom postulates within its meaning, both, an absence of State\n\ncontrol as well as actions by the State which create the conditions for the exercise\n\nof rights and freedoms. <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_417\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution recognizes the freedom\n\nto form associations or unions or co-operative societies. The freedom of speech\n\nand expression is not limited to expressive words. It also includes other forms of\n\nexpression such as the manifestation of complex identities of persons through the\n\nexpression of their sexual identity, choice of partner, and the expression of sexual\n\ndesire to a consenting party. Earlier judgments of this Court have held that\n\nexpression of gender identity is a protected freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_418\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In\n\n\n                                           161\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nNALSA (supra), this Court held that the expression of gender identity is a form of\n\nprotected expression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_419\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In Navtej (supra), this Court held that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_420\">Section 377</a> of the IPC infringes upon the freedom of expression of queer persons,\n\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_421\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n\n\n220. Courts have traditionally interpreted the right to form an association\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_422\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> to mean associations formed by workers or\n\nemployees for collective bargaining to attain equitable working conditions.\n\nHowever, the entire gamut of the freedom protected under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_423\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> cannot\n\nbe restricted to this singular conception. The ambit of the freedom under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_424\">Article\n\n19(1)(c)</a> is much wider. The provision does not merely protect the freedom to form\n\nan association to create spaces for political speech or for espousing the cause of\n\nlabour rights. While that is a very crucial component of the freedom protected under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_425\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>, the provision also protects the freedom to engage in other forms\n\nof association to realize all forms of expression protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_426\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n\n\n221. In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 195 the US Supreme Court read\n\n‘freedom of association’ widely to include the freedom to form intimate\n\nassociations. The factual matrix before the Court was that regular membership to\n\nthe respondent-corporation was restricted to men between the ages of fifteen to\n\nthirty-five. Associate membership was offered to those to whom regular\n\nmembership was not available. Complaints were filed alleging that the exclusion of\n\nwomen from full membership violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act which\n\nmade it discriminatory to deny to any person the full and equal enjoyment of the\n\n\n\n195 468 U.S 609 (1984)\n\n\n\n\n                                        162\n\f                                                                                                   PART D\n\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place\n\nof public accommodation because of race, color, creed, religion, disability, national\n\norigin or sex. The US Supreme Court had to decide if any interference with the\n\norganization’s membership policy would violate the respondent’s freedom of\n\nassociation guaranteed under the First Amendment. Justice Brennan, writing for\n\nthe majority, observed that the freedom of association constitutes two facets. First,\n\nthe freedom to enter into intimate human relationships secure from undue state\n\ninterference (“the intrinsic element”); and second, the freedom to form associations\n\nto engage in activities protected by the First Amendment such as speech,\n\nassembly, and the exercise of religion (“the instrumental element”). The Court\n\nobserved that individuals have the freedom to form intimate associations because\n\nindividual liberty can be secured only when the State does not unjustifiably interfere\n\nwith the formation and preservation of certain kinds of highly personal\n\nrelationships. The Constitution protects such relationships because individuals\n\ndraw emotional enrichment from close ties such as those created by marriage,\n\nchildren, and cohabitation, which contribute towards identity building and self-\n\ndevelopment. Justice Brenan qualified the freedom by observing that only personal\n\nrelationships (which are characterized by their attributes such as relative\n\nsmallness, a high degree of selectivity in decisions to begin and maintain the\n\naffiliation, the seclusion from others in critical aspects of the relationship) are\n\nprotected. 196\n\n\n\n\n196 The right to form an intimate association has been expanded upon by the Supreme Court of US in Lawrence v.\n\nTexas, 539 U.S 558 (2003) by which the sodomy laws were held unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n                                                    163\n\f                                                                                                     PART D\n\n222. Kenneth L. Karst, who developed the idea of the freedom of intimate\n\nassociation 197 argues that the Courts have traditionally not permitted the State to\n\ninterfere or regulate in certain kinds of personal relationships, thereby elevating it\n\nto a distinct freedom. Intimate association is characterized by a sense of collectivity\n\nwhich exists beyond two individuals. One of the prominent ideas embraced by the\n\nfreedom of intimate association is the opportunity it affords to enjoy the society of\n\nthe other person who is a part of the relationship and the ability to choose to form\n\nand maintain such a relationship. 198 The opportunity to enjoy the society of one’s\n\npartner may be denied either directly or indirectly. It could be denied directly when\n\nthe law prohibits such an association. The operation of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_427\">Section 377</a> of the IPC\n\ncriminalizing homosexual activity is a form of direct restriction on the freedom of\n\nassociation.\n\n\n223. On the other hand, the State could indirectly infringe upon the freedom when\n\nit does not create sufficient space to exercise that freedom. A formal associational\n\nstatus or recognition of the association is necessary for the free and unrestricted\n\nexercise of the freedom to form intimate associations. Needless to say, there may\n\nbe reasonable restrictions on this right. However, other than legally valid and\n\nbinding restrictions, the right to intimate associations must be unrestricted. The\n\nState by not endorsing a form of relationship encourages certain preferences over\n\nothers. 199 In a previous segment of this judgment, we have discussed the tangible\n\nand intangible benefits of recognizing relationships in the form of marriage. While\n\nthe tangible benefits of marriage are traceable to the content of law, the intangible\n\n\n197 Kenneth L Karst, The freedom of intimate association, (1980) The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 89 (4) 624-692\n198 ibid\n199 Evan Gerstmann, Same-sex marriage and the Constitution, (Cambridge University Press 2017)\n\n\n\n\n                                                     164\n\f                                                                                   PART D\n\nbenefits are secured merely because State recognises the relationship through the\n\ninstrument of law. Intangible benefits in the form of expressive advantages exist\n\nirrespective of the content of the law. Even if the law does not grant any special\n\nmaterial benefits to a relationship, the relationship would still be considered to be\n\nlegitimate in the eyes of the society. The freedom to choose a partner and the\n\nfreedom to enjoy their society which are essential components of the right to enter\n\ninto a union (and the freedom of intimate association) would be rendered otiose if\n\nthe relationship were to be discriminated against. For the right to have real\n\nmeaning, the State must recognise a bouquet of entitlements which flow from an\n\nabiding relationship of this kind. A failure to recognise such entitlements would\n\nresult in systemic discrimination against queer couples. Unlike heterosexual\n\ncouples who may choose to marry, queer couples are not conferred with the right\n\nto marry by statute. To remedy this, during the course of the hearing, the Solicitor\n\nGeneral of India made a statement that a Committee chaired by the Cabinet\n\nSecretary will be constituted to set out the rights which will be available to queer\n\ncouples in unions. The Committee shall set out the scope of the benefits which\n\naccrue to such couples.\n\n\n      II.   The right to settle in any part of India\n\n\n224. <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_428\">Article 19(1)(e)</a> of the Constitution stipulates that all citizens shall have the\n\nright to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. In exercise of this right,\n\ncitizens may reside in any village, town, or city in any state or union territory\n\nirrespective of the state in which they were born or are domiciled. <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_429\">Article 19(1)(e)</a>\n\nproscribes differentiation on the basis of the native place of a person. As with other\n\n\n\n\n                                            165\n\f                                                                                                        PART D\n\nfundamental rights, it is subject to reasonable restrictions. In Maneka Gandhi v.\n\nUnion of India,200 this Court observed that it was a historical fact that there were\n\nrivalries between some states in the country. It was therefore not beyond the realm\n\nof possibility that a particular state would restrain individuals domiciled in another\n\nstate from residing or settling in the first state. In view of this, the Court held that\n\nthe intention behind <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_430\">Article 19(1)(d) (the right to move freely throughout the territory\n\nof India)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_431\">Article 19(1)(e)</a> was to prevent the states from imposing such\n\nrestrictions. In this way, the provision was thought to emphasize the unity and\n\noneness of India.\n\n\n225. <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_432\">Article 19(1)(e)</a> uses the expressions “reside” and “settle.” The term “reside”\n\ncan mean either a temporary residence or a permanent residence but there is a\n\ncertain level of permanency attached to the word “settle” in India. One can reside\n\nin a particular place in the course of their education or employment but to settle\n\ndown in that place means to build one’s life there and reside their permanently.201\n\nIn P. Ramanatha Aiyar’s Law Lexicon (1997 edition), it is stated:\n\n\n                  “The word “settled” has no precise or determinate meaning.\n                  In popular language, it intends going into a town or place to\n                  live and take up one’s abode. A person is said to be settled\n                  where he has his domicile or home.”\n\n\nColloquially, people say that a person has “settled down” when they are well\n\nestablished in their careers or when they have chosen a life partner or married\n\nsomebody.\n\n\n\n\n200 (1978) 1 SCC 248\n201 The term “settle down” has previously been used by this Court in this sense. See, for instance, Pradeep Jain v.\n\nUnion of India, (1984) 3 SCC 654\n\n\n\n                                                       166\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\n226. Citizens of India have the right to settle in any part of the territory of India in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_433\">Article 19(1)(e).</a> They, like all other citizens, may exercise this right in two\n\nways:\n\n\n  a. First, they may build their lives in a place of their choosing (in accordance with\n\n       law) either by themselves or with their partner. They may reside in that place\n\n       permanently (subject to other reasonable restrictions including those intended\n\n       to protect the rights of tribal communities). This right is uniquely significant to\n\n       persecuted groups (such as queer persons, inter-caste couples, or interfaith\n\n       couples) who migrate from their hometowns to other places in the country,\n\n       including cities; 202 and\n\n\n  b. Second, they may “settle down” with another person by entering into a lasting\n\n       relationship with them. In fact, this mode of the exercising the right under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_434\">Article 19(1)(e)</a> is encompassed by the first mode because to many people,\n\n       building a life includes choosing their life partner.\n\n\nHence, the right to enter into a union is also grounded in <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_435\">Article 19(1)(e).</a>\n\n\n           c. Facets of the right to life and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_436\">Article 21</a>\n\n\n                I.   The atypical family\n\n\n227. One’s natal family usually consists of one’s immediate relatives. The people\n\nwho constitute one’s ‘immediate relatives’ vary from society to society. For\n\ninstance, many Indians grow up in a Hindu Undivided Family which is commonly\n\n\n\n\n202 Purayil (n 96)\n\n\n\n\n                                            167\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\nknown as a ‘joint family’ and which is recognised by the law. The family is typically\n\nthought of as comprising a mother and a father, to which a life partner is added\n\n(usually in a heterosexual relationship). Later, children join this family, and so the\n\ncycle continues. While this conception of a family dominates our collective\n\nunderstanding, it is not the only valid mode by which a family can be formed. Myriad\n\npersons do not follow this blueprint for the creation of a family. They instead have\n\ntheir own, atypical blueprint.\n\n\n228. In Deepika Singh (supra), this Court rightly acknowledged the existence of\n\natypical families:\n\n\n             “26. The predominant understanding of the concept of a\n             “family” both in the law and in society is that it consists of a\n             single, unchanging unit with a mother and a father (who\n             remain constant over time) and their children. This\n             assumption ignores both, the many circumstances which may\n             lead to a change in one&#x27;s familial structure, and the fact that\n             many families do not conform to this expectation to begin with.\n             Familial relationships may take the form of domestic,\n             unmarried partnerships or queer relationships. A household\n             may be a single parent household for any number of reasons,\n             including the death of a spouse, separation, or divorce.\n             Similarly, the guardians and caretakers (who traditionally\n             occupy the roles of the “mother” and the “father”) of children\n             may change with remarriage, adoption, or fostering. These\n             manifestations of love and of families may not be typical but\n             they are as real as their traditional counterparts. Such atypical\n             manifestations of the family unit are equally deserving not only\n             of protection under law but also of the benefits available under\n             social welfare legislation. The black letter of the law must not\n             be relied upon to disadvantage families which are different\n             from traditional ones.”\n\n\n229. Queer relationships may constitute one’s family. Persons in such\n\nrelationships are fulfilling their innate and human need to be a part of a family and\n\nto create their family. This conception of a family may be atypical but its atypical\n\nnature does not detract from the fact that it is a family. Further, queer persons are\n\n\n                                              168\n\f                                                                                                 PART D\n\noften rejected by their natal families and have only their partner or their chosen\n\ncommunity to fall back on. In addition to the different forms of kinship recognized\n\nin Deepika Singh (supra), the guru-chela bond of transgender persons (discussed\n\nin the previous section of this judgment) may also be a familial bond. Unlike hijras\n\nwho often have the option of joining the hijra community and forming the guru-\n\nchela bond, transmen do not have traditions or customs which may lead to the\n\ncreation of non-biological familial bonds with other transmen as a group.\n\nRegardless, they form close bonds with other transmen and many consider these\n\nbonds to be familial. 203 These atypical manifestations of the family unit equally\n\nconstitute the fundamental groups of society. The Constitution accounts for plural\n\nidentities and values. It protects the right of every person to be different. Atypical\n\nfamilies, by their very nature, assert the right to be different. Difference cannot be\n\ndiscriminated against simply because it exists. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_437\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_438\">21</a> protect the rights\n\nof every citizen and not some citizens.\n\n\n230. Some petitioners have suggested that the atypical family is a queer person’s\n\n‘chosen family.’ Chosen families comprise people who are selected to be one’s kin,\n\nwith the exercise of one’s agency. 204 Some have argued that the entire spectrum\n\nof queer relationships in India may not always be based on choice, with guru-chela\n\nrelationships often assigned rather than chosen. 205 Hence, while some queer\n\nrelationships may accurately be described as the ‘chosen family,’ all of them are\n\nthe ‘atypical family.’\n\n\n\n\n203 Purayil (n 96)\n204 See generally, Kath Weston, Families We Choose: Lesbians, Gays, Kinship (Columbia University Press 1997)\n205 Reddy (n 81)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    169\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n          II.   The right to dignity, autonomy, and privacy\n\n\n231. It is not only formal freedom which is significant but also substantive freedom\n\nor the opportunity to achieve what one sets out to achieve and the conditions which\n\nenable this. The freedom guaranteed under the Constitution is realised in\n\nsubstance only when the conditions for their effective exercise are created. Formal\n\nfreedom is translated into substantive freedom through the formulation of schemes\n\nand policies. When citizens are prevented from exercising their rights, the courts\n\nof the country create the conditions for their exercise by giving effect to the laws\n\nenacted by the legislative wing or the schemes formulated by the executive wing.\n\nIn the process, courts interpret the Constitution and the rights and freedoms it\n\nrecognizes. This exercise lies at the core of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_439\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, which\n\nguarantees the right to life and personal liberty.\n\n\n232. A few paragraphs ago, this Court discussed what it means to be human. The\n\nquestion of what it means to be free – or to have liberty – is of equal significance.\n\nIt is a question which has plagued philosophers, ethicists, and economists alike.\n\nThe answer may mean different things to different people and may change\n\ndepending on the circumstances in which the question is asked. Simply put, the\n\nability to do what one wishes to do and be who one wishes to be (in accordance\n\nwith law) lies at the heart of freedom.\n\n\n233. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_440\">Article 21</a> is available to all persons including queer persons. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_441\">Article 21</a>\n\nencompasses the rights to dignity, autonomy, and privacy. Each of these facets\n\nanimates the others. It is not possible to speak of the right to enter into a union\n\nwithout also speaking of the right to intimacy,      which emanates    from    these\n\n\n\n                                          170\n\f                                                                                     PART D\n\nrights. These rights demand that each individual be free to determine the course\n\nof their life, as long as their actions are not barred by law. Choosing a life partner\n\nis an integral part of determining the course of one’s life. Most people consider this\n\ndecision to be one of the most important decisions of their lives – one which defines\n\ntheir very identity. Life partners live together, spend a significant amount of time\n\nwith one other, merge their respective families, create a family of their own, care\n\nfor each other in times of sickness, support one another and much more. Hence,\n\nthe ability to choose one’s partner and to build a life together goes to the root of\n\nthe right to life and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_442\">Article 21.</a> Undoubtedly, many persons choose not\n\nto have a life partner – but this is by choice and not by a deprivation of their agency.\n\nThe law constrains the right to choose a partner in certain situations such as when\n\nthey are within prohibited degrees of relationships or are in a consanguineous\n\nrelationship.\n\n\n234. Principle 24 of the Yogyakarta Principles (on the application of international\n\nhuman rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity) 206 states that\n\nall people have the right to found a family:\n\n\n                  “Everyone has the right to found a family, regardless of sexual\n                  orientation or gender identity. Families exist in diverse forms.\n                  No family may be subjected to discrimination on the basis of\n                  the sexual orientation or gender identity of any of its\n                  members.”\n\n\nWhile India is not a signatory to the Yogyakarta Principles, this Court has\n\nrecognized their relevance to the adjudication of cases concerning sexual\n\nminorities. 207 Depriving someone of the freedom to choose their life partner robs\n\n\n206 “Yogyakarta Principles&quot;\n207 NALSA (supra); Navtej Singh Johar (supra)\n\n\n\n\n                                                   171\n\f                                                                                                 PART D\n\nthem of their autonomy, which in turn is an affront to their dignity. Preventing\n\nmembers of the LGBTQ community from entering into a union also has the result\n\nof denying (in effect) the validity of their sexuality because their sexuality is the\n\nreason for such denial. This, too, would violate the right to autonomy which extends\n\nto choosing a gender identity and sexual orientation. The act of entering into an\n\nintimate relationship and the choices made in such relationships are also protected\n\nby the right to privacy. As held by this Court in Navtej (supra) and Justice KS\n\nPuttaswamy (9J) (supra), the right to privacy is not merely the right to be left alone\n\nbut extends to decisional privacy or privacy of choice.\n\n\n             III.      The right to health\n\n\n235. The right to health is also a crucial component of the right to life and\n\nliberty. 208 The health of a person includes both, their physical and their mental\n\nwellbeing. Parliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_443\">Mental Healthcare Act</a> 2017 209 to regulate the\n\nprovision of mental healthcare services. An assessment of the mental health of a\n\nperson cannot be limited to considering whether they have a mental illness or\n\ndisease but must also include an assessment of whether their mental health is\n\nthriving. The Constitution of the World Health Organization declares that:\n\n\n                    “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-\n                    being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”\n\n\nMental health is therefore a state of complete mental wellbeing and not merely the\n\nabsence of mental illnesses. Parliament is also cognizant of this fact as evident\n\n\n\n208 Common Cause v. Union of India, (2018) 5 SCC 1; Union of India v. Moolchand Kharaiti Ram Trust, (2018) 8\n\nSCC 321\n209 “<a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_444\">Mental Healthcare Act</a>”\n\n\n\n\n                                                     172\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nfrom the overall scheme and provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_445\">Mental Healthcare Act</a>. Though this\n\nstatute is primarily concerned with mental illnesses and access to healthcare,\n\nChapter VI recognizes the value of complete mental wellbeing by providing for the\n\npromotion of and awareness about mental health. A person’s mental well-being\n\ncan only be secured if they are allowed the freedom and liberty to make choices\n\nabout their lives. If their choices are restrained, their overall mental well-being\n\nwould undoubtedly be degraded. Choices may be restrained by expressly denying\n\nthem their freedom or by failing to create conditions for the exercise of such\n\nfreedom.\n\n\n236. The right of queer persons to access mental healthcare is recognized by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/945558/\" id=\"a_446\">Section 18</a> which stipulates that persons have a right to access mental healthcare\n\nwithout being discriminated against on the basis of their sex, gender, or sexual\n\norientation. This is undoubtedly a progressive step in line with constitutional ideals.\n\nThe mental health of members of the LGBTQ community may suffer not only\n\nbecause of the discrimination they may face at the hands of their families or society\n\nin general but also because they are prevented from choosing their life partner and\n\nentering into a meaningful, long-lasting relationship with them. The effect of the\n\nright to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_447\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/51895923/\" id=\"a_448\">Section 18</a> of the Mental Healthcare Act is\n\nthat queer people have the right to complete mental health, without being\n\ndiscriminated against because of their sex, gender, or sexual orientation. A natural\n\nconsequence of this is that they have the right to enter into a lasting relationship\n\nwith their partner. They also have a right not to be subjected to inhumane and cruel\n\npractices or procedures.\n\n\n\n\n                                         173\n\f                                                                                     PART D\n\n          d.     The right to freedom of conscience under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_449\">Article 25\n\n\n237.</a> <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_450\">Article 25(1)</a> of the Constitution is as follows:\n\n\n                 “25. Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and\n                 propagation of religion\n\n\n                 (1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other\n                 provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to\n                 freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise\n                 and propagate religion.”\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_451\">Article 25(1)</a> has four components – the first component makes the right available\n\nto all persons. The second component indicates that all persons are equally\n\nentitled to the rights it codifies. The third component deals with two distinct\n\nconcepts: the right to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice\n\nand propagate religion. While the freedom of conscience subsumes within its fold\n\nthe right to profess, practice and propagate religion, it is not restricted to this right\n\nalone. The rights with respect to religion are one aspect of the freedom of\n\nconscience. The fourth component makes the rights codified in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_452\">Article 25</a> subject\n\nto public order, morality, health, and the other provisions of Part III. The right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_453\">Article 25</a> is an individual right because conscience inheres in an individual. 210\n\n\n238. The right under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_454\">Article 25</a> is also available to members of the LGBTQ\n\ncommunity since it is available to all persons. But what does this freedom entail,\n\nbeyond religious rights? Black’s Law Dictionary defines conscience in the following\n\nterms:\n\n\n                 “Conscience. The moral sense; the faculty of judging the\n                 moral qualities of actions, or of discriminating between right\n                 and wrong; particularly applied to one’s perception and\n\n210 Indian Young Lawyers Assn. v. State of Kerala &amp; Ors. (2019) 11 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                    174\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\n                  judgment of the moral qualities of his own conduct, but in a\n                  wider sense, denoting similar application of the standards of\n                  morality to the acts of others. The sense of right and wrong\n                  inherent in every person by virtue of his existence as a social\n                  entity. …” 211\n\n\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n239. All persons, including members of the queer community, have the right to\n\njudge the moral quality of the actions in their own lives, and having judged their\n\nmoral quality, have the right to act on their judgment in a manner they see fit. This\n\nattribute is of course not absolute and is capable of being regulated by law. In the\n\nsegment of this judgment on the right to life and liberty, this Court noticed that the\n\nmeaning of liberty is – at its core – the ability to do what one wishes to do and be\n\nwho one wishes to be, in accordance with law. All persons may arrive at a decision\n\nregarding what they want to do and who they want to be by exercising their freedom\n\nof conscience. They may apply their sense of right and wrong to their lives and live\n\nas they desire, in accordance with law. Some of the decisions the moral quality of\n\nwhich they will judge include the decision on who their life partner will be and the\n\nmanner in which they will build their life together. Each individual is entitled to\n\ndecide this for themselves, in accordance with their conscience.\n\n\n240. The right under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_455\">Article 25</a> is subject to four exceptions – public order,\n\nmorality, health, and the other provisions of Part III. The respondents have not\n\ndemonstrated that public order will be in peril or that the health of the public at large\n\nor of individuals will be adversely impacted, if queer persons enter into a union with\n\ntheir partners. As for morality, it is settled law that <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_456\">Article 25</a> speaks of constitutional\n\n\n\n211 Black’s Law Dictionary (5th edn.; 1979)\n\n\n\n\n                                                  175\n\f                                                                                  PART D\n\nmorality and not societal morality. In Indian Young Lawyers Assn. v. State of\n\nKerala, 212 a five-Judge Bench of this Court (of which one of us, DY Chandrachud,\n\nJ. was a part) held:\n\n\n                “Morality for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_457\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_458\">26</a> cannot have\n                an ephemeral existence. Popular notions about what is moral\n                and what is not are transient and fleeting. Popular notions\n                about what is or is not moral may in fact be deeply offensive\n                to individual dignity and human rights. Individual dignity\n                cannot be allowed to be subordinate to the morality of the\n                mob. Nor can the intolerance of society operate as a\n                marauding morality to control individual self-expression in its\n                manifest form. … The expression has been adopted in a\n                constitutional text and it would be inappropriate to give it a\n                content which is momentary or impermanent. Then again, the\n                expression &#x27;morality&#x27; cannot be equated with prevailing social\n                conceptions or those which may be subsumed within\n                mainstream thinking in society at a given time. … The content\n                of morality is founded on the four precepts which emerge from\n                the Preamble. The first among them is the need to ensure\n                justice in its social, economic and political dimensions. The\n                second is the postulate of individual liberty in matters of\n                thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. The third is\n                equality of status and opportunity amongst all citizens. The\n                fourth is the sense of fraternity amongst all citizens which\n                assures the dignity of human life.”\n\n\nHence, the content of morality must be determined on the basis of the preambular\n\nprecepts of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. None of these principles are an\n\nimpediment to queer persons entering into a union. To the contrary, they bolster\n\nthe proposition that queer persons have the right to enter into such a relationship.\n\nFinally, the other provisions in Part III (which may also restrict the exercise of the\n\nright under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_459\">Article 25</a>) do not act as a bar to the exercise of the right in the present\n\ncase. Similar to the preambular values, they give rise to the right to enter into a\n\nunion.\n\n\n\n212 (2019) 11 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                176\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\n241. A union may emerge from an abiding, cohabitational relationship of two\n\npersons – one in which each chooses the other to impart stability and permanence\n\nto their relationship. Such a union encapsulates a sustained companionship. The\n\nfreedom of all persons (including persons of the queer community) to form a union\n\nwas recognised by this Court in Navtej (supra):\n\n\n                “167. … There can be no doubt that an individual also has a\n                right to a union under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_460\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. When we\n                say union, we do not mean the union of marriage, though\n                marriage is a union. As a concept, union also means\n                companionship in every sense of the word, be it physical,\n                mental, sexual or emotional. The LGBT community is seeking\n                realisation of its basic right to companionship, so long as such\n                a companionship is consensual, free from the vice of deceit,\n                force, coercion and does not result in violation of the\n                fundamental rights of others.”\n\n\nSuch a union has to be shielded against discrimination based on gender or sexual\n\norientation.\n\n\n242. In K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-9J.) v. Union of India,213 one of us (Dr. DY\n\nChandrachud, J.) held that discrimination against an individual on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation is offensive to their dignity and self-worth:\n\n\n                “144. … Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of\n                discrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or\n                way of life does not accord with the “mainstream”. Yet in a\n                democratic Constitution founded on the Rule of Law, their\n                rights are as sacred as those conferred on other citizens to\n                protect their freedoms and liberties. … Discrimination\n                against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is\n                deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the\n                individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation\n                of each individual in society must be protected on an\n                even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of\n\n\n\n\n213 (2017) 10 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                 177\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\n             sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights\n             guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_461\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_462\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_463\">21</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n\n                                                   (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n243. This Court recognized that equality demands that queer persons are not\n\ndiscriminated against. An abiding cohabitational relationship which includes within\n\nits fold a union of two individuals cannot be discriminated against on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation. Material and expressive entitlements which flow from a union\n\nmust be available to couples in queer unions. Any form of discrimination has a\n\ndisparate impact on queer couples who unlike heterosexual couples cannot marry\n\nunder the current legal regime.\n\n\n244. As a consequence of the rights codified in Part III of the Constitution, this\n\nCourt holds that all persons have a right to enter into an abiding union with their\n\nlife partner. This right, undoubtedly, extends to persons in queer relationships. At\n\nthis juncture, it is necessary to clarify the difference between relationships and\n\nunions of the kind which this Court speaks of, and unions and marriages. Any\n\nperson may enter into a consensual romantic or sexual relationship with another\n\nperson. This may last for a few months or for years. Regardless of the period for\n\nwhich the relationship continues, no legal consequences attach to it, except where\n\nprovided by law (such as in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_464\">DV Act</a>). However, when two persons\n\nenter into a union with a person whom they consider to be their life partner, certain\n\nlegal consequences will follow. For instance, if one of them happens to die, their\n\npartner will have the right to access the body of the deceased.\n\n\n\n\n                                           178\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\n      x.   Restrictions on the right to enter into a union\n\n\n           a. The right to enter into a union cannot be restricted based on sexual\n\n              orientation\n\n\n245. In Navtej (supra), the concurring opinion authored by one of us (Justice DY\n\nChandrachud) noted that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_465\">Article 15</a> prohibits discrimination, direct or indirect, which\n\nis founded on a stereotypical understanding of the role of sex. It was observed that\n\nthe usage of the word ‘sex’ in <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_466\">Article 15(1)</a> encapsulates stereotypes based on\n\ngender. The judgment expanded on this understanding of the provision by holding\n\nthat sexual orientation is also covered within the meaning of ‘sex’ in <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_467\">Article 15(1)</a>\n\nbecause (i) non-heterosexual relationships question the male-female binary and\n\ngendered roles which are attached to them; and (ii) discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation indirectly discriminates based on gender stereotypes which is\n\nprohibited by <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_468\">Article 15.</a> Thus, a law which, directly or indirectly, discriminates\n\nbased on sexual orientation is constitutionally suspect. In Navtej (supra), Justice\n\nIndu Malhotra observed that <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_469\">Article 15(1)</a> prohibits discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation because it is analogous to the other grounds on which discrimination is\n\nprohibited. The learned Judge observed that the common thread which runs\n\nthrough the grounds mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_470\">Article 15</a> is that they impact the personal\n\nautonomy of an individual.\n\n\n246. We find it necessary to supplement the observations of this Court in Navtej\n\n(supra) on the impermissibility of discrimination based on sexual orientation. The\n\ncausal relationship between homophobia and gender stereotypes is not the only\n\nconstitutional approach to grounding the prohibition of discrimination based on\n\n\n\n                                         179\n\f                                                                                                        PART D\n\nsexual orientation in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_471\">Article 15.</a> Subsuming the discrimination faced by queer\n\npersons into the sex-gender debate runs the risk of being reductionist. Gender\n\ntheory only captures one part of the complex construction of sexual deviance.\n\nOver-emphasizing gender norms as a reason for the discrimination faced by the\n\nqueer community will be at the cost of reducing their identity.\n\n\n247. At this juncture, it is important to address the argument of the learned\n\nSolicitor General that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_472\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution does not include sexual\n\norientation because it is not an ‘ascriptive’ characteristic since there is a degree of\n\n‘choice’ in identifying as a queer person. This submission is premised on the\n\nerroneous understanding that the common thread which runs through the grounds\n\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_473\">Article 15</a> is that they are all ascriptive characteristics.\n\n\n248. <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_474\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution states that no citizen shall be discriminated\n\nagainst based on “religion, race, sex, place of birth, or any of them.” Ascribed status\n\nis described to be “assigned to individuals without reference to their innate\n\ndifferences or abilities” and achieved status is described as “acquiring special\n\nqualities” and “open to individual achievement.” 214 Thus, characteristics attained\n\non birth are termed as ascribed status and characteristics or qualities achieved\n\nafter birth are termed as achieved status. Before proceeding further, a preliminary\n\npoint must be made. Status is not a biological phenomenon. It is a social\n\nphenomenon.215 The status of a person is identified based on how a person is\n\n\n\n\n214 Ralph Linton, The Study of Man: An introduction (1936)\n215 Irving S. Falodare, A Clarification of “Ascribed Status” and “Achieved Status”, The Sociological Quarterly, Vol.\n\n10, No. 1 (Winter, 1969), pp 53-61\n\n\n\n                                                       180\n\f                                                                                                    PART D\n\nperceived. It depends on how the society (conditioned by social norms) sees an\n\nindividual as a part of a group.\n\n\n249. This Court has in many judgments held that caste is an ascribed status. 216\n\nThe argument of Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_475\">Article 15</a> prohibits discrimination\n\non the ground of sexual orientation because it is an ascribed characteristic, and\n\nthe argument of the learned Solicitor General that sexual orientation is not a\n\nascribed characteristic (and is thus, not protected under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_476\">Article 15</a>) fails to give\n\neffect to the full purport of the anti-discrimination principle encompassed in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_477\">Article\n\n15.</a> A core difference between ascribed and achieved status is that the former is\n\nconsidered to be irreversible (where a person is born with it) but the latter is\n\nreversible. 217 The assumption that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_478\">Article 15</a> only protects the status that a person\n\nis born with and not an identity they choose runs the risk of viewing persons as\n\nhelpless individuals. It also misses the crucial point that a person who chooses an\n\nidentity can also be discriminated against. A few of the grounds stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_479\">Article\n\n15</a> may be reversed by the exercise of choice. For example, persons undergo sex-\n\nreassignment surgeries to alter their body to align it with their gender. When a\n\nperson wishes to choose a different label for their gender, they face other forms of\n\ndiscrimination and stigma different from the discrimination that they faced earlier.\n\nMerely because a person by exercise of choice changes their sex, it cannot be\n\nargued that the protection provided under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_480\">Article 15</a> is not available to them.\n\n\n\n\n216 See Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar, (1996) 5 SCC 125; Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, (2008) 6\n\nSCC 1; Indian Medical Assn. v. Union of India, (2011) 7 SCC 179; Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3)\nSCC 217\n217 Ibid.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     181\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n250. The Court must also be conscious of the fact that a person may face\n\ndiscrimination both due to their chosen identity and imposed identity. For example,\n\neven after a person changes their religion, it is possible that they face\n\ndiscrimination due to their new religious identity and their old caste or religious\n\nidentity. This is not to say that all persons choose to change the characteristics that\n\nthey are born with. While a few people by exercising their choice (successfully and\n\nunsuccessfully) alter what is assumed by the society to be their ascribed status, a\n\nfew others may not wish to change their trait.\n\n\n251. The discussion above clearly elucidates that the distinction between\n\nascribed and achieved status is not as clear-cut as it may seem. The understanding\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_481\">Article 15(1)</a> cannot be premised on the distinction between ascribed and\n\nachieved status. Such an understanding does not truly capture the essence of the\n\nanti-discrimination principle. The anti-discrimination principle incorporated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_482\">Article 15</a> identifies grounds on the basis of which a person shall not be\n\ndiscriminated. These grounds are markers of identity. The reason for\n\nconstitutionally entrenching these five markers of identity (that is, religion, caste,\n\nrace, sex, and place of birth) is that individuals (and groups) have historically and\n\nsocially been discriminated against based on these markers of identities. These\n\nidentities must be read in their historical and social context instead of through the\n\nnarrow lens of ascription.\n\n\n252. When <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_483\">Article 15</a> is read in the broader manner indicated above, the word\n\n“sex” in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_484\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution takes within its meaning “sexual orientation”\n\nnot only because of the causal relationship between homophobia and sexism but\n\n\n\n\n                                         182\n\f                                                                                              PART D\n\nalso because ‘sex’ is used as a marker of identity. The word ‘sex’ cannot be read\n\nindependent of the social and historical context. Thus, ‘sex’ in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_485\">Article 15</a> includes\n\nwithin its fold other markers of identity which are related to sex and gender such\n\nas sexual orientation. Thus, a restriction on the right to enter into a union based on\n\nsexual orientation would violate <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_486\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n         b. Recognizing the right of queer persons to enter into a union will not lead\n\n              to social chaos\n\n\n253. The Union of India submitted that if non-heterosexual couples are permitted\n\nto enter into a union, then the State will also have to extend the right to incestuous,\n\npolygamous, or polyandrous relationships. To answer this question, this Court has\n\nto deal with the issue of whether the State has the power to place restrictions on\n\nthe right to enter into a union and if so, what is the extent of such restrictions.\n\n\n254. The right to enter into a union like every other fundamental right can be\n\nrestricted by the State. It is now established that the Courts must use the four-\n\nprong proportionality test to assess if the infringement or restriction of a right is\n\njustified. 218 The courts must use the integrated proportionality standard formulated\n\nin Akshay N Patel v. Reserve Bank of India 219 to test a violation of the right to\n\nenter into a union because the right is traceable to more than one provision of Part\n\nIII. However, if the State restricts the right or has the effect of restricting the right\n\n(both directly and indirectly) based on any of identities mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_487\">Article 15</a>,\n\nsuch a restriction would be unconstitutional.\n\n\n218 See Modern Dental College &amp; Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2016) 4 SCC 346; Puttaswamy\n\n(9J) (supra)\n219 Civil Appeal No. 6522 of 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                                  183\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\n255. We do not accept the argument of the Union of India that permitting non-\n\nheterosexual unions would lead to allowing incestuous, polyandrous, and\n\npolygamous unions for all communities (the personal laws of some religious and\n\ntrial communities currently permit polygamy or polyandry). The restriction on the\n\nground of sexual orientation will violate <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_488\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution. On the other\n\nhand, the restriction on incestuous, polygamous or polyandrous unions would be\n\nbased on the number of partners and the relationships within the prohibited degree.\n\nThe Court in that case will determine if the State’s interest in restricting the right\n\nbased on the number of partners and prohibited relationships is proportionate to\n\nthe injury caused due to the restriction of choice. In view of the discussion above,\n\na restriction based on a marker of identity protected by <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_489\">Article 15</a> cannot be\n\nequated to a restriction based on the exercise of choice. For this reason, we find\n\nthat the apprehension of the Union of India is unfounded when tested on\n\nconstitutional principles.\n\n\n     xi.   The right of transgender persons to marry\n\n\n256. Some petitioners have sought a declaration that the right to marry a person\n\nof their choice applies to transgender persons. The Union of India seems to have\n\na mixed response to this claim. On one hand, it asserts that marriage must only be\n\nbetween ‘biological’ men and ‘biological’ women. On the other hand, the written\n\nsubmissions of the learned Attorney General state that “The issues relating to\n\ntransgender persons arising out of <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_490\">The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights)\n\nAct, 2019</a> stand on a different footing and can be addressed without reference to\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_491\">Special Marriage Act</a>.” Before addressing the issue, it is necessary to briefly\n\n\n\n\n                                         184\n\f                                                                                                PART D\n\nadvert to the difference between sex, gender, and sexual orientation, as well as to\n\nnote the development of the law in relation to transgender persons.\n\n\n            a. Sex, gender, sexual orientation\n\n\n257. The term ‘sex’ refers to the reproductive organs and structures that people\n\nare born with.220 Intersex persons are those whose sex characteristics do not fit\n\nthe typical notions of ‘male’ and ‘female.’ 221 Sex and gender are not the same. The\n\nYogyakarta Principles describe one’s gender identity as:\n\n\n                “each person’s deeply felt internal and individual experience\n                of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex\n                assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body\n                (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily\n                appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means)\n                and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and\n                mannerisms.” 222\n\n\nThe gender of a person may not correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nA transgender person is one whose gender identity does not conform with their\n\nsex. Transgender people may choose to undergo hormonal therapy or surgery\n\n(commonly known as gender affirming surgery or sex reassignment surgery) to\n\nalter their bodies to make them conform to their gender. People may be\n\ntransgendered regardless of whether they choose to or are able to undergo a\n\nsurgery. As noted in preceding segments of this judgment, the term ‘transgender’\n\ndoes not fully capture the rich variation in gender identities in India. Historically and\n\nsocio-culturally, Indian persons 223 with a genderqueer identity go by different\n\n\n\n220 “Sex.” Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster &lt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex&gt;\n221   ‘Intersex people,’ Office of the United Nations High Commissioner               for   Human   Rights\n&lt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/intersex-people&gt;\n222 Introduction to the Yogyakarta Principles, Yogyakarta Principles\n223 As also persons in other South Asian countries\n\n\n\n\n                                                   185\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\nnames including hijras, kothis, aravanis, jogappas, thiru nambis, nupi maanbas\n\nand nupi maanbis. Persons who are known by these names may identify as male,\n\nfemale, or the ‘third gender.’ Intersex persons are not the same as transgender\n\npersons. They have atypical reproductive characteristics. Intersex people may\n\nidentify as male, female, or transgender.\n\n\n258. Sexual orientation differs from both sex and gender. The Yogyakarta\n\nPrinciples describe sexual orientation as:\n\n\n                “each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectional\n                and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations\n                with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or\n                more than one gender.” 224\n\n\nThe sex of a person is determined by their reproductive organs and structure, their\n\ngender identity depends on their internal experience of gender, and their sexual\n\norientation is defined by the gender of the people that they are attracted to. The\n\npresent batch of petitions seeks the recognition of the right of persons to marry\n\nregardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. While previous segments\n\nof this judgment dealt with the rights of all persons regardless of gender identity or\n\nsexual orientation, this segment deals exclusively with the rights of persons who\n\nare transgender or intersex.\n\n\n           b. The judgment of this Court in NALSA and the Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n259. The judgment of this Court in NALSA (supra) recognized the right of\n\ntransgender persons to be identified by the gender identity of their choice, as well\n\nas their right to full protection under the Constitution, on equal terms with any other\n\n\n224 Ibid\n\n\n\n\n                                               186\n\f                                                                                                      PART D\n\ncitizen of the country. The government was enjoined to recognize what the Court\n\ntermed the ‘third gender.’ The Court also noticed the absence of a suitable\n\nlegislation dealing with the rights of the transgender community. It issued directions\n\nto the Union and State Governments to take steps to ensure that the transgender\n\ncommunity was able to realize its rights to the fullest extent. The judgment in\n\nNALSA (supra) was affirmed by this Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (supra) and\n\nagain, in Navtej (supra). The judgement in NALSA (supra) was critiqued for\n\ngeneralizing the gender identities of hijras as belonging to the third gender alone. 225\n\nThe directions at paragraphs 135.1 and 135.2 of NALSA (supra) must be read as\n\nrecognizing the right of all transgender persons (including hijras and those who are\n\nsocio-culturally known by other names) to be recognized by a gender of their\n\nchoice.\n\n\n260. In 2019, Parliament enacted the Transgender Persons Act to provide for the\n\nrights of transgender persons and their welfare. This statute proscribes\n\ndiscrimination against transgender persons,226 provides for a system by which their\n\nidentity may be recognized, 227 prescribes that the appropriate government shall\n\ntake welfare measures, 228 recognizes the right of residence 229 and provides for the\n\nobligations of various parties with respect to their right to education, social security,\n\nand health. 230 It also creates a National Council for Transgender Persons. 231 A\n\nchallenge to the constitutional validity of the Transgender Persons Act is pending\n\n\n225 H.R.

We leave the challenge to the validity of the\n\nstatute to be decided in that or any other appropriate proceeding.\n\n\n261. During the course of the hearings, the Solicitor General advanced the\n\nargument that the Transgender Persons Act prohibits discrimination against any\n\nmember of the queer community and that consequently, the queer community in\n\nIndia no longer faces any stigma due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nHe argued that the Transgender Persons Act is a broad-based legislation which\n\nincludes all persons of the queer community within its ambit. This argument does\n\nnot hold any water. The legislation applies only to persons with a genderqueer or\n\ntransgender identity and not to persons whose sexual orientation is not\n\nheterosexual. This is evident from the definition of a transgender person as:\n\n\n                 “…a person whose gender does not match with the gender\n                 assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-man or\n                 trans-woman (whether or not such person has undergone Sex\n                 Reassignment Surgery or hormone therapy or laser therapy\n                 or such other therapy), person with intersex variations,\n                 genderqueer and person having such socio-cultural identities\n                 as kinner, hijra, aravani and jogta.” 232\n\n\nFrom the definition, it is clear that the enactment applies to persons whose gender\n\ndoes not match with that assigned to them at birth, which includes:\n\n\n  a. Transgender men and women;\n\n  b. Intersex persons;\n\n  c. Other genderqueer persons; and\n\n  d. Persons with socio-cultural identities such as hijras.\n\n\n\n\n232 Section 2(k), Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n\n\n                                               188\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nThe word ‘genderqueer’ in <a href=\"/doc/404852/\" id=\"a_494\">Section 2(k)</a> does not refer to sexual orientation but to\n\ngender identity. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, gender identity is not\n\nthe same as sexual orientation. The term ‘transgender’ is not commonly\n\nunderstood as referring to persons with a sexual orientation other than\n\nheterosexual, nor does the Transgender Persons Act use the word ‘transgender’\n\nto include persons of a different sexuality. The Union of India’s argument that the\n\nTransgender Persons Act applies to all queer persons including persons who are\n\nhomosexual, bisexual etc. cannot be accepted. This legislation is clearly applicable\n\nonly to those people with a gender identity that does not match the one assigned\n\nat birth.\n\n\n262. It is incorrect to state that transgender persons do not face any stigma or\n\ndiscrimination post-2020, when the Transgender Persons Act came into force.\n\nEnacting a statute does not have the same effect as waving a magic wand. For\n\ninstance, the prohibition against discrimination has not resulted in society\n\nabstaining from discrimination overnight. The ground reality is that society\n\ncontinues to discriminate against transgender persons in various ways. Consistent\n\nrespect for the rights of transgender persons may someday ensure that they are\n\ntreated as equals (as is their right) but that day is yet to arrive. Hence, the\n\ncontention of the Union of India that transgender people are no longer stigmatized\n\nin view of the enactment of the Transgender Persons Act cannot be accepted.\n\nSince the legislation does not apply to homosexual persons or persons of other\n\nsexual orientations, there is no question of such persons being free from\n\ndiscrimination or violence as a result of its enactment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        189\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n263. Pursuant to the decision in NALSA (supra), Parliament enacted the\n\nTransgender Persons Act which aims to give substance to the rights recognized\n\nby this Court in its judgment. However, no such statute was forthcoming pursuant\n\nto the decision in Navtej (supra). Although the primary issue in Navtej (supra) was\n\nwhether <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_495\">Section 377</a> of the IPC was constitutional, the ruling of this Court made it\n\namply clear that sexual orientation cannot be a valid ground for discrimination or\n\nhostile treatment. The decision in Navtej (supra) was a clear indication of the fact\n\nthat the LBGTQ community is entitled to equal treatment before law. Parliament is\n\nyet to enact a law to this effect. This Court is of the opinion that there is an urgent\n\nneed for a law which inter alia prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual\n\norientation and gives full effect to the other civil and social rights of LGBTQ\n\npersons. In the absence of such a law, members of the LGBTQ community will be\n\nunable to exercise their rights and freedoms to the fullest extent and will have to\n\napproach the courts for their enforcement on a case-by-case basis. This is not a\n\ndesirable outcome. As in this case, courts are not always equipped to deal with all\n\nissues which are brought before them. Even if the courts are institutionally\n\nequipped to address the grievances in the case before them, no citizen should\n\nhave to institute legal proceedings for the enforcement of their rights every time\n\nthey seek to exercise that right. This would be contrary to the very concept of the\n\nguarantee of rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                         190\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n         c. Transgender persons in heterosexual relationships can marry under\n\n           existing law\n\n\n264. We are in agreement with the submission of the Union of India that the issue\n\nof whether transgender persons can marry ought to be decided separately from\n\nthe issues arising under the SMA in relation to homosexual persons or those of a\n\nqueer sexual orientation. Parliament has recognized the rights of the transgender\n\ncommunity by enacting the Transgender Persons Act. This Court is therefore\n\nbound to apply this statute while adjudicating the issue of whether transgender\n\npersons can marry under existing law.\n\n\n    I.    The right against discrimination under the Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n265. The right of transgender persons to equality under the Constitution and the\n\nright against discrimination was recognized by this Court in NALSA (supra). To be\n\nequal means to be able to live without discrimination. Section 3 of the Transgender\n\nPersons Act codifies the prohibition against discrimination in the following terms:\n\n\n             “3. Prohibition against discrimination. — No person or\n             establishment shall discriminate against a transgender person\n             on any of the following grounds, namely: —\n\n\n             (a) the denial, or discontinuation of, or unfair treatment in,\n             educational establishments and services thereof;\n\n\n             (b) the unfair treatment in, or in relation to, employment or\n             occupation;\n\n\n             (c) the denial of, or termination from, employment or\n             occupation;\n\n\n             (d) the denial or discontinuation of, or unfair treatment in,\n             healthcare services;\n\n\n\n\n                                            191\n\f                                                                                     PART D\n\n                 (e) the denial or discontinuation of, or unfair treatment with\n                 regard to, access to, or provision or enjoyment or use of any\n                 goods, accommodation, service, facility, benefit, privilege or\n                 opportunity dedicated to the use of the general public or\n                 customarily available to the public;\n\n\n                 (f) the denial or discontinuation of, or unfair treatment with\n                 regard to the right of movement;\n\n\n                 (g) the denial or discontinuation of, or unfair treatment with\n                 regard to the right to reside, purchase, rent, or otherwise\n                 occupy any property;\n\n\n                 (h) the denial or discontinuation of, or unfair treatment in, the\n                 opportunity to stand for or hold public or private office; and\n\n\n                 (i) the denial of access to, removal from, or unfair treatment\n                 in, Government or private establishment in whose care or\n                 custody a transgender person may be.”\n\n\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n266.     As evident from Clauses (a) to (i), this provision is a catch-all provision\n\nwhich seeks to eliminate discrimination against the transgender community both in\n\npublic as well as private spaces. It is worded in exceptionally broad terms:\n\n\n267. The prefatory portion of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_496\">Section 3</a> states that “no person or establishment”\n\nshall discriminate against a transgender person. ‘Establishment’ is defined as any\n\nbody or authority established by or under a Central Act or a State Act or an authority\n\nor body owned or controlled or aided by the Government or a local authority or a\n\nGovernment company 233 and includes a Department of the Government.234 An\n\nestablishment also means any company or body corporate or association or body\n\nof individuals, firm, cooperative or other society, association, trust, agency, or\n\n\n\n\n233 As defined in <a href=\"/doc/14181476/\" id=\"a_497\">Section 2</a> of the Companies Act, 2013.\n234 Section 2(b)(i), Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n\n\n                                                      192\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\ninstitution. 235 ‘Establishment’ therefore includes any public or private entity,\n\nauthority, or body, including any ‘body of individuals.’ Individuals are, of course,\n\ncovered by the word ‘person.’\n\n\n268. Clauses (a) to (i) of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_498\">Section 3</a> list the spheres in which transgender persons\n\ncannot be discriminated against. They include the spheres of education,236\n\nemployment, 237 healthcare, 238 movement, 239 property, 240 public or private office, 241\n\ncare and custody. 242 It also bars any discrimination with respect to goods,\n\naccommodation, service, facility, benefit, privilege, or opportunity which is\n\ndedicated to the use of the public or customarily available to the public.243\n\n\n269. The prefatory portion of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_499\">Section 3</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_500\">Section 2(b)</a> delineates who the\n\nprohibition against discrimination operates against. In other words, it defines the\n\nactors who are prohibited from discriminating against transgender persons. The\n\nterm ‘establishment’ has been defined in the broadest possible terms to include all\n\nmanner of undertakings or groups of people. Clauses (a) to (i) of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_501\">Section 3</a> set forth\n\nthe content of the anti-discrimination principle. They describe the actions which\n\namount to discrimination as well as the sphere in which the discrimination\n\noperates. The actions which amount to discrimination vary depending upon the\n\nsphere they refer to and they include denial, discontinuation, unfair treatment,\n\ntermination, and removal. The spheres, too, are broadly defined and extend to\n\n\n\n235 Section 2(b)(ii), Transgender Persons Act\n236 Section 3(a), Transgender Persons Act\n237 Section 3(b), 3(c), Transgender Persons Act\n238 Section 3(d), Transgender Persons Act\n239 Section 3(f), Transgender Persons Act\n240 Section 3(g), Transgender Persons Act\n241 Section 3(h), Transgender Persons Act\n242 Section 3(i), Transgender Persons Act\n243 Section 3(e), Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n\n\n                                                  193\n\f                                                                                   PART D\n\npractically every aspect of life. In order to establish a violation of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_502\">Section 3</a>, an\n\naggrieved person would have to demonstrate:\n\n\na.     That the person against whom they seek a remedy is either an establishment\n\n       as defined in <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_503\">Section 2(b)</a> or a person;\n\n\nb.     That they have been discriminated against in one of the spheres listed by\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_504\">Section 3</a>; and\n\n\nc.     That the discriminatory action corresponds to that sphere (for example, a\n\n       person alleging a violation of the right to movement must prove that there has\n\n       been a denial, discontinuation of, or unfair treatment of that right244).\n\n\n        II.    Remedies for the infringement of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_505\">Section 3</a>\n\n\n270. While Section 18 of the Transgender Persons Act stipulates that certain\n\nactions amount to offences which may attract a penalty between six months and\n\ntwo years as well as a fine, violations of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_506\">Section 3</a> attract no such penalty. In fact,\n\nthe Transgender Persons Act does not expressly provide for a remedy for the\n\ninfringement of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_507\">Section 3</a>.\n\n\n271. <a href=\"/doc/1772285/\" id=\"a_508\">Section 8</a> enjoins the appropriate Government to take steps to secure “full\n\nand effective participation of transgender persons and their inclusion in society.”\n\nSince clauses (a) to (i) of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_509\">Section 3</a> are with a view to ensure the full and effective\n\nparticipation of transgender persons in all arenas of life, <a href=\"/doc/1772285/\" id=\"a_510\">Section 8</a>, properly\n\nunderstood, tasks the appropriate Government with ensuring that <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_511\">Section 3</a> is\n\n\n\n\n244 Section 3(f), Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n\n\n                                            194\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\ncomplied with by all whom it governs. Rule 10(4) of the Transgender Persons\n\n(Protection of Rights) Rules 2020 245 provides that the appropriate Government\n\nshall take adequate steps to prohibit discrimination in any Government or private\n\norganisation, or private and public educational institution under their purview, and\n\nensure equitable access to social and public spaces, including burial grounds. Rule\n\n11 of these rules requires the appropriate Government to take adequate steps to\n\nprohibit discrimination in any Government or private organisation or establishment\n\nincluding in the areas of education, employment, healthcare, public transportation,\n\nparticipation in public life, sports, leisure and recreation, and opportunity to hold\n\npublic or private office. Under <a href=\"/doc/1772285/\" id=\"a_512\">Section 8</a> read with Rule 10(4) and Rule 11, the\n\nappropriate Government has a duty not only to prevent discrimination against\n\ntransgender persons (by persons and public as well as private establishments) but\n\nalso to address it where it is found to take place.\n\n\n272. Sections 10 the Transgender Persons Act inter alia requires establishments\n\nto comply with the statute. This provision places a duty on establishments to\n\ncomply with <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_513\">Section 3</a> and ensure that they do not discriminate against transgender\n\npersons. <a href=\"/doc/784822/\" id=\"a_514\">Section 11</a> requires establishments to set up a grievance redressal\n\nmechanism by designating a person as the complaint officer to deal with\n\ncomplaints relating to the violation of the provisions of the statute. <a href=\"/doc/784822/\" id=\"a_515\">Section 11</a> is\n\none of the ways in which a person who alleges the violation of the Transgender\n\nPersons Act can seek a remedy. However, <a href=\"/doc/784822/\" id=\"a_516\">Section 11</a> only goes as far as to\n\n\n\n\n245 “Transgender Persons Rules”\n\n\n\n\n                                         195\n\f                                                                                              PART D\n\nprovide for a mechanism by which the establishment in question can be\n\napproached for a remedy.\n\n\n273. As noticed previously, the prohibition against discrimination operates\n\nagainst public as well as private bodies. If a public body or actor which falls within\n\nthe definition of ‘establishment’ in Section 2(b) of the Transgender Persons Act\n\ninfringes <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_517\">Section 3</a>, it is open to the aggrieved person to invoke the extraordinary\n\njurisdiction of the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_518\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. The High\n\nCourts are empowered to issue directions, order, or writs to any person or authority\n\nfor the enforcement of the rights codified by Part III and for any other purpose.\n\nThe body which satisfies the definition in <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_519\">Section 2(b)</a> must be a “person or\n\nauthority” under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_520\">Article 226.</a> The High Courts may exercise their jurisdiction against\n\na body which is performing a public duty as well. 246 While the jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_521\">Article 32</a> is not as expansive as that of the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_522\">Article\n\n226</a>, this Court may rely on <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_523\">Section 3</a> to guide its interpretation of the law, to enforce\n\nthe rights recognized by Part III of the Constitution.\n\n\n274. Aggrieved persons may also approach the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_524\">Article 226</a> for\n\nthe issuance of a direction, order, or writ against the appropriate Government\n\ndirecting it to fulfil the mandate of Section 8 of the Transgender Persons Act. As\n\ndiscussed in the preceding paragraphs, <a href=\"/doc/1772285/\" id=\"a_525\">Section 8</a> obligates the appropriate\n\nGovernment to prevent and address discrimination inter alia by private bodies. The\n\nHigh Court may direct the appropriate Government to perform its duties vis-à-vis\n\nprivate bodies. This is no doubt an imperfect remedy and there is a need for the\n\n\n246 Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust v. V.R.

Harmonious interpretation of the laws governing marriage and\n\n                   the Transgender Persons Act\n\n\n275. Section 3 of the Transgender Persons Act prohibits the state from\n\ndiscriminating against transgender persons. Section 20 of the Transgender\n\nPersons Act indicates that the statute is in addition to, and not in derogation from\n\nany other law for the time being in force. Parliament was no doubt cognizant of the\n\nstatutes governing marriage when it enacted the Transgender Persons Act and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_527\">Section 3(e)</a> in particular.\n\n\n276. The laws which govern marriage in the country specify conditions which the\n\nbride and the bridegroom must satisfy for their marriage to be recognized. This is\n\ntrue of personal laws 247 as well as the SMA. 248 The structure of these enactments\n\nalso regulates marriage between a husband and a wife. 249 They use the words\n\n“bride” and “bridegroom,” “wife” and “husband,” “male” and “female,” or “man” and\n\n“woman.” These legislations regulate heterosexual marriages in India. Laws which\n\nare incidental to marriage such as the DV Act, the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 or\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_528\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC seek to address the hetero-patriarchal nature of the\n\nrelationship between a man and a woman.\n\n\n\n\n247 See, for instance, <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_529\">Section 5</a>, HMA; <a href=\"/doc/1895347/\" id=\"a_530\">Section 60</a>, Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872; <a href=\"/doc/1166796/\" id=\"a_531\">Section 3</a>, Parsi Marriage\n\nand Divorce Act 1936\n248 <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_532\">Section 4</a>, SMA\n249 See, for instance, <a href=\"/doc/209038/\" id=\"a_533\">Section 2</a>, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939\n\n\n\n\n                                                      197\n\f                                                                           PART D\n\n277. The gender of a person is not the same as their sexuality. A person is a\n\ntransgender person by virtue of their gender identity. A transgender person may\n\nbe heterosexual or homosexual or of any other sexuality. If a transgender person\n\nis in a heterosexual relationship and wishes to marry their partner (and if each of\n\nthem meets the other requirements set out in the applicable law), such a marriage\n\nwould be recognized by the laws governing marriage. This is because one party\n\nwould be the bride or the wife in the marriage and the other party would be the\n\nbridegroom or the husband. The laws governing marriage are framed in the context\n\nof a heterosexual relationship. Since a transgender person can be in a\n\nheterosexual relationship like a cis-male or cis-female, a union between a\n\ntranswoman and a transman, or a transwoman and a cisman, or a transman and\n\na ciswoman can be registered under Marriage laws. The transgender community\n\nconsists of inter alia transgender men and transgender women. A transgender man\n\nhas the right to marry a cisgender woman under the laws governing marriage in\n\nthe country, including personal laws. Similarly, a transgender woman has the right\n\nto marry a cisgender man. A transgender man and a transgender woman can also\n\nmarry. Intersex persons who identify as a man or a woman and seek to enter into\n\na heterosexual marriage would also have a right to marry. Any other interpretation\n\nof the laws governing marriage would be contrary to Section 3 of the Transgender\n\nPersons Act and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_534\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n278. In Kanailal Sur v. Paramnidhi Sadhu Khan, 250 this Court held that the first\n\nand primary rule of construction was that the intention of the legislature must be\n\n\n\n\n250 AIR 1957 SC 907\n\n\n\n\n                                        198\n\f                                                                                                    PART D\n\nfound in the words used by the legislature itself. The terms “bride” and\n\n“bridegroom,” “wife” and “husband,” “male” and “female,” and “man” and “woman”\n\nin the statutes which regulate marriage cannot be read as governing marriages\n\nbetween cisgender men and cisgender women alone. Nothing in these statutes\n\nindicates that their intended application is solely to cisgender men and cisgender\n\nwomen. The plain meaning of the gendered terms used in these statutes indicates\n\ntransgender persons in heterosexual relationships fall within their fold. The\n\ncontention of the Union of India that “biological” men and women alone fall within\n\nthe ambit of these statutes cannot be accepted. No law or tool of interpretation\n\nsupports the interpretation proposed by the Union of India. The provisions on the\n\nprohibited degrees of relationship in the laws governing marriage continue to apply.\n\nThe judgment in NALSA (supra) also recognized the importance of the right of\n\ntransgender persons to marry. Moreover, State Governments have formulated and\n\nimplemented schemes which encourage and support transgender persons vis-à-\n\nvis marriage. 251\n\n\n279. In Arunkumar v. Inspector General of Registration, 252 the first petitioner\n\nwas a man and the second petitioner was a woman who happened to be\n\ntransgender. They married each other at a temple in Tuticorin and sought to have\n\ntheir marriage registered by the state, which refused. They then approached the\n\nMadras High Court under its writ jurisdiction. The Court held that:\n\n\n\n\n251 For instance, the Kerala State Government announced Rs. 30,000/- by way of ‘marriage assistance’ to couples\n\nwhere at least one person was a transgender person.

The fundamental right of the petitioners under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_535\">Article 25</a> was infringed.\n\n\nThe Court directed the concerned respondent to register the marriage solemnized\n\nbetween the petitioners.\n\n\n   xii.     The conditions for the exercise of the rights of LGBTQ persons\n\n\n                a. The right of queer persons under the <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_536\">Mental Healthcare Act</a>\n\n\n280. The first segment of this judgment detailed how the families or relatives of\n\nqueer persons compel them to undergo “conversion” therapies (to “convert” their\n\nsexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual) or make them marry a person\n\nof the opposite sex to “cure” their homosexuality or for other reasons. Other\n\npseudo-medical treatments are similarly designed to “cure” queerness. Such\n\npractices violate the right to health of queer persons as also their right to autonomy\n\nand dignity. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_537\">Article 5</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_538\">Article 7</a> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, no one shall be\n\nsubjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n“Conversion” therapies and other “treatments” which are aimed at altering sexual\n\norientation amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of queer persons.\n\nThey have the effect of denying their full humanity. The mental well-being suffers\n\nto no end because cruel techniques are used in these so-called treatments. The\n\ntreatment is by its very nature cruel. It is the duty of the state to ensure that these\n\n\n\n                                         200\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\ninhumane practices do not continue. The deleterious effects of discrimination on\n\nthe mental health of queer persons was also noticed by this Court in Navtej (supra).\n\nOther segments of this judgment discussed instances of queer persons and\n\ncouples being driven to die by suicide as a result of the discrimination and violence\n\nmeted out to them. This phenomenon is undoubtedly related to the mental health\n\nof queer persons and the state is equally under an obligation to prevent suicides\n\nbecause of one’s gender identity or sexual orientation. <a href=\"/doc/140691300/\" id=\"a_539\">Section 29</a> of the Mental\n\nHealthcare Act stipulates that:\n\n\n             “(1) The appropriate Government shall have a duty to plan,\n             design and implement programmes for the promotion of\n             mental health and prevention of mental illness in the country.\n\n\n             (2) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions\n             contained in sub-section (1), the appropriate Government\n             shall, in particular, plan, design and implement public health\n             programmes to reduce suicides and attempted suicides in the\n             country.”\n\n\nThe programmes for the promotion of mental health (envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/1196567/\" id=\"a_540\">Section 29(1)</a>)\n\nmust include provisions for the mental health of queer persons. Programmes to\n\nreduce suicides and attempted suicides (envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/227439/\" id=\"a_541\">Section 29(2)</a>) must include\n\nprovisions which tackle queer identity and oppression arising from that identity as\n\ncauses for suicidal tendencies or feelings. We direct the Union Government as well\n\nas the State Governments or governments of Union Territories (where they exist)\n\nto carry out the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/684377/\" id=\"a_542\">Section 29</a> in terms of the observations in this\n\nparagraph and to include appropriate modules or provisions which address the\n\nunique concerns of the queer community.\n\n\n\n\n                                             201\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\n281. In exercise of the rights to dignity, autonomy, privacy and health an\n\nindividual (regardless of their gender identity) may choose to enter into a union with\n\na person (who may be of the same sex as them). Once they enter into an\n\nrelationship as life partners, a couple has the right and the freedom to determine\n\nthe significance of that relationship as well as its consequences. A denial of this\n\nfreedom would be a denial of the many facets of Article 21.\n\n\n      b.    The right of LGBTQ persons to freedom from coercion from their\n\n            families, the agencies of the state, and other persons\n\n\n282. The right to enter into a union would be an illusion without the conditions\n\nwhich permit the unrestricted exercise of that right. Various parts of this judgment\n\nhave detailed the violence and discrimination meted out to members of the LGBTQ\n\ncommunity, either because of their gender identity or because of their sexual\n\norientation. One form of this violence is that society often attempts to prevent\n\nLGBTQ persons from being with their partner, in a short-term relationship, a long-\n\nterm relationship, a relationship where they choose to live together or any other\n\nkind of union. This happens in different ways – the couple may be forcibly\n\nseparated from one another, their families may file complaints with the police which\n\nlead to the registration of FIRs and the consequent harassment of one or both of\n\nthem, or they may be married off to third parties without their consent. The families\n\nof LGBTQ persons as well as the police are the primary actors in such violence.\n\n\n283. The fundamental rights and freedoms codified by the Constitution demand\n\nthat the LGBTQ community be left alone so that its members can live their lives as\n\nthey see fit, in accordance with law. This Court has discussed these rights and\n\n\n\n                                         202\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nfreedoms in detail in this judgment. It is the duty of the state machinery (acting\n\nthrough any authority including the police) to protect these rights instead of\n\nparticipating in their violation. Unfortunately, the police often acts in concert with\n\nthe parents of LGBTQ persons to prevent the latter from exercising their rights.\n\nThis Court finds this to be unacceptable.\n\n\n284. In Mansur Rahman v. Superintendent of Police, Coimbatore District,253\n\nthe petitioner was a man who had married a woman who happened to be\n\ntransgender. He claimed that his parents and some persons who belonged to a\n\npolitical outfit were harassing and threatening him and approached the Madras\n\nHigh Court seeking police protection. The Court allowed the petition and directed\n\nthe police to ensure that no harm befalls the petitioner and his wife.\n\n\n285. In Latha v. Commissioner of Police, 254 the Madras High Court dismissed\n\na writ petition for the issuance of a habeas corpus filed by the petitioner for the\n\nproduction of her sibling, who happened to be a transgender person. The Court\n\nfound that the sibling had attained the age of majority and had voluntarily joined\n\nother transgender persons.\n\n\n286. Sushma v. Commissioner of Police 255 concerned a lesbian couple whose\n\nfamilies opposed their relationship. Both their families filed complaints with the\n\npolice that they were missing and an FIR was registered. The police visited the\n\ncouple and interrogated them. The couple then filed a writ petition before the\n\nMadras High Court seeking a direction to the police not to harass them as well as\n\n\n253 2018 SCC OnLine Mad 3250\n254 2021 SCC OnLine Mad 7495\n255 WP 7248 of 2021, Madras High Court\n\n\n\n\n                                         203\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\nfor protection from any form of threat or danger to their safety and security from\n\ntheir families. The Court directed the parties to undergo counselling (and the judge\n\npersonally underwent counselling to understand queerness). Counsel informed the\n\nCourt that the FIR would be closed and the parents agreed to let their daughters\n\nlive their lives as they wished to. The Court also issued directions to ensure the\n\nprotection of LGBTQ couples.\n\n\n287. We affirm the approach adopted in these cases, which protects the\n\nfundamental rights of LGBTQ persons.\n\n\n    xiii.   The right of queer persons to adopt children\n\n\n               a. Challenge to the Adoption Regulations\n\n\n288. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_543\">The JJ Act</a> was enacted to consolidate and amend the law catering to the\n\nbasic needs of children. Chapter VIII (<a href=\"/doc/587943/\" id=\"a_544\">Sections 56</a> to 73) deals with the provisions\n\nrelating to adoption. <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_545\">Section 2(49)</a> of the JJ Act defines “prospective adoptive\n\nparents” to mean a person or persons eligible to adopt a child according to the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_546\">Section 57</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_547\">Section 57</a> prescribes the eligibility criteria for prospective\n\nadoptive parents:\n\n\n              “57. Eligibility of prospective adoptive parents.—\n\n\n              (1) The prospective adoptive parents shall be physically fit,\n              financially sound, mentally alert and highly motivated to adopt\n              a child for providing a good upbringing to him.\n\n\n              (2) In case of a couple, the consent of both the spouses for\n              the adoption shall be required.\n\n\n              (3) A single or divorced person can also adopt, subject to\n              fulfilment of the criteria and in accordance with the provisions\n              of adoption regulations framed by the Authority.\n\n\n                                               204\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\n             (4) A single male is not eligible to adopt a girl child.\n\n\n             (5) Any other criteria that may be specified in the adoption\n             regulations framed by the Authority.”\n\n\n\n             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n289. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_548\">Section 57(1)</a> prescribes general conditions to do with the physical, mental,\n\nand financial well-being of the prospective parents as well as their motivations.\n\nSub-Section (2) states that the consent of both the parties is required if a couple is\n\nadopting a child. Sub-Sections (3) and (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_549\">Section 57</a> state that single and\n\ndivorced persons are not precluded from adopting. The only restriction is that a\n\nsingle male cannot adopt a girl child.\n\n\n290. The Ministry of Women and Child Development notified the Regulations\n\nframed by the Central Adoption Resource Authority 256 in exercise of the powers\n\nconferred under <a href=\"/doc/1600778/\" id=\"a_550\">Section 68(c)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_551\">Section 2(3)</a> of the JJ Act. <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_552\">Regulation 5</a> of\n\nthe Adoption Regulations prescribes the eligibility criteria for prospective adoptive\n\nparents. The relevant portion of the provision is extracted below for reference:\n\n\n             “5. Eligibility criteria for prospective adoptive parents.―\n             (1)The prospective adoptive parents shall be physically,\n             mentally, emotionally and financially capable, they shall not\n             have any life threatening medical condition and they should\n             not have been convicted in criminal act of any nature or\n             accused in any case of child rights violation.\n\n\n             (2) Any prospective adoptive parent, irrespective of their\n             marital status and whether or not they have biological son or\n             daughter, can adopt a child subject to the following, namely:―\n\n\n\n\n256 “CARA”\n\n\n\n\n                                               205\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n             (a) the consent of both the spouses for the adoption shall be\n             required, in case of a married couple;\n\n\n             (b) a single female can adopt a child of any gender;\n\n\n             (c) a single male shall not be eligible to adopt a girl child.\n\n\n             (3) No child shall be given in adoption to a couple unless they\n             have at least two years of stable marital relationship except in\n             the cases of relative or step-parent adoption.”\n\n\n                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n291. Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_553\">Regulation 5</a> states that prospective adoptive parents must be\n\nphysically, mentally, emotionally, and financially stable. In addition, they must also\n\nnot have any life-threatening medical condition or should not have been convicted\n\nin a criminal act or should not have been accused in a case concerning a violation\n\nof child rights. The general conditions in clause (1) are aimed at securing the best\n\ninterest of the child. The conditions focus on physical, emotional, and financial\n\nstability. Clause (2) stipulates that any person irrespective of their marital status\n\nand irrespective of whether they already have a biological child can adopt. To this\n\nextent, the provision is expansive. However, clause 2(a) states that: (a) in case of\n\na married couple, the consent of both the spouses is required; and (b) though a\n\nsingle female can adopt a child of any gender, a single male shall not be eligible to\n\nadopt a girl child. Clause (3) prescribes a further restriction on the conditions to be\n\nmet before someone can adopt. The provision states that a child shall be given in\n\nadoption to a couple only if they have at least two years of a stable marital\n\nrelationship (except in cases of relative or step-parent adoption).\n\n\n292. Though <a href=\"/doc/942886/\" id=\"a_554\">Regulation 5(2)(a)</a> taken alone does not preclude unmarried\n\ncouples from being prospective adoptive parents, a combined reading of\n\n\n                                               206\n\f                                                                              PART D\n\nRegulations 5(2)(a) and 5(3) elucidates that: (a) only married couples can be\n\nprospective adoptive parents; and (b) such couples must be in “at least two years\n\nof stable marital relationship”. A reading of the Adoption Regulations indicates that\n\nwhile a person can in their individual capacity be a prospective adoptive parent,\n\nthey cannot adopt a child together with their partner if they are not married.\n\n\n293. The Adoption Regulations are framed in exercise of the power conferred\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_555\">JJ Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_556\">Section 57(5)</a> of the JJ Act grants the Authority (which means\n\nCARA in terms of <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_557\">Section 2(3)</a> of the JJ Act) the power to specify any other criteria.\n\nSet out below is a table comparing the criteria to be prospective adoptive parents\n\nprescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_558\">JJ Act</a> and the Adoption Regulations:\n\n\n                 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_559\">JJ Act</a>                            Adoption Regulations\n\n  The prospective adoptive parents       In addition to the criteria prescribed under\n  must be physically fit, financially    the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_560\">JJ Act</a>, the prospective parents should\n  sound, mentally alert and highly       not have been convicted of a criminal act\n  motivated to provide a good            and should not have a life-threatening\n  upbringing.                            medical condition.\n\n  Couples can adopt.

The petitioners submitted that the Adoption Regulations are ultra vires the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_561\">JJ Act</a> because they bar unmarried couples from adopting. It was\n\n\n\n\n                                         207\n\f                                                                                                   PART D\n\nalso submitted that the distinction between married and unmarried persons for the\n\npurpose of adoption is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_562\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n295. It is settled law that delegated legislation must be consistent with the parent\n\nact and must not exceed the powers granted under the parent <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_563\">Act (JJ Act</a>).257 The\n\nrule making authority must exercise the power for the purpose for which it is\n\ngranted. The provisions of the delegated legislation will be ultra vires if they are\n\nrepugnant to the parent Act or exceed the authority which is granted by the parent\n\nAct. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_564\">Section 57(5)</a> delegates to CARA the power to prescribe any other criteria in\n\naddition to the criteria prescribed by the provision. However, in view of the line of\n\ncases on subordinate law-making, this power cannot be read expansively. CARA’s\n\npower to prescribe additional criteria is limited by the express provisions and\n\nlegislative policy of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_565\">JJ Act</a>.\n\n\n296. The Adoption Regulations place two restrictions on a couple who wish to\n\nadopt: first, the couple must be married, and second, the couple must have been\n\nin a stable marital relationship. We will now determine if the prescription of these\n\ntwo additional conditions is violative of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_566\">JJ Act</a> and the\n\nConstitution.\n\n\n       I.      <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_567\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations exceeds the scope of\n\n               the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_568\">JJ Act</a>\n\n\n297.        <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_569\">Section 3</a> of the JJ Act prescribes the general principles to be followed in\n\nthe administration of the Act. The provision, inter alia, includes the principle of best\n\n\n257 See J K Industries Limited v. Union of India, (2007) 13 SCC 673; Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) P Ltd.\n\nV. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641\n\n\n\n                                                    208\n\f                                                                                                     PART D\n\ninterest, which stipulates that all the decisions regarding the child shall be based\n\non the best interest of the child which will help the child develop their full potential.\n\n\n298. The provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_570\">JJ Act</a> promote the best interest of the child and ensure\n\ntheir development.258 In fact, the eligibility criteria prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_571\">Section 57</a> are an\n\nextension of that principle. The legislative intent behind prescribing the conditions\n\nof physical and mental fitness is to ensure that the parents are able to prioritise the\n\nwell-being of the child. Similarly, the condition requiring the consent of both\n\nspouses ensures that the child is able to receive the attention and care of both\n\npartners. The intent is not to give a child for adoption to a couple where one of\n\nthem is unwilling to take up the responsibility of being a parent. Similarly, the\n\ncriterion prohibiting a single male from adopting a girl child is in the State’s interest\n\nof preventing child sexual abuse. It can be garnered that the State has prescribed\n\nthe criteria in <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_572\">Section 57</a> keeping in mind the welfare of the child.\n\n\n299. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_573\">Section 57(2)</a> does not stipulate that only married couples can adopt. It\n\nstates that “in case of a couple” the consent of both the spouses must be secured.\n\nThis is a clear indicator that adoption by a married couple is not a statutory\n\nrequirement. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_574\">Section 57(2)</a> provides that the consent of both the parties must be\n\nreceived if the prospective adoptive parents are in a married relationship. The\n\nusage of the phrase spouse in <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_575\">Section 57(2)</a> does not mean that it excludes\n\nunmarried couples from adopting.\n\n\n\n\n258 See Gaurav Jain v. Union of India, (1997) 8 SCC 114; Karan v. State of M.P., (2023) 5 SCC 504; Barun Chandra\n\nThakur v. Bholu, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 870; Shilpa Mittal v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2020) 2 SCC 787\n\n\n\n                                                     209\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\n300. However, <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_576\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations bars unmarried\n\npartners from being prospective adoptive parents. These Regulations only permit\n\npersons to adopt in an individual capacity and not jointly as an unmarried couple.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/942886/\" id=\"a_577\">Regulation 5(2)</a> states that every person irrespective of whether they are married\n\nor unmarried will be able to be prospective adoptive parents. The subsequent\n\ncriteria in clause (a) (that is, the requirement for the consent of both spouses if they\n\nare married) does not exclude an unmarried couple from adopting. It only states\n\nthat if the couple is married, then the consent of both the parties shall be secured.\n\nHowever, <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_578\">Regulation 5(3)</a> in express terms excludes unmarried couples from\n\nadopting by prescribing the condition that the couple must have been in two years\n\nof a ‘stable marital relationship.’ As observed in the previous paragraph, the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_579\">JJ\n\nAct</a> does not preclude unmarried couples from adopting. Though <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_580\">Section 57</a> of the\n\nJJ Act grants CARA the power to prescribe additional criteria, the criteria must not\n\nexceed the scope of the legislative policy. Neither the general principles guiding\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_581\">JJ Act</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_582\">Section 57</a> in particular preclude unmarried couples from adopting\n\na child. In fact, all the other criteria ensure the child’s best interests. The Union of\n\nIndia has not proved that precluding unmarried couples from adopting a child (even\n\nthough the same people are eligible to adopt in their individual capacity) is in the\n\nchild’s best interests. Thus, CARA has exceeded its authority by prescribing an\n\nadditional condition by way of <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_583\">Regulation 5(3)</a>, which is contrary to tenor of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_584\">JJ\n\nAct</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_585\">Section 57</a> in particular.\n\n\n301. Further, the usage of the phrase ‘stable’ in <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_586\">Regulation 5(3)</a> is vague. It is\n\nunclear if the provision creates a legal fiction that all married relationships which\n\nhave lasted two years automatically qualify as a stable relationship or if there are\n\n\n                                          210\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nspecific characteristics in addition to those prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/33946/\" id=\"a_587\">Regulation 5(1)</a> (that is,\n\nphysical, mental, and emotional wellbeing) which would aid in the characterization\n\nof a married relationship as a stable one. Hence, <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_588\">Regulation 5(3)</a> exceeds the\n\nscope of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_589\">JJ Act</a>.\n\n\n     II.   <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_590\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_591\">Article 14</a> of\n\n           the Constitution\n\n\n302. <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_592\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations has classified couples into\n\nmarried and unmarried couples for the purpose of adoption. The intent of CARA to\n\nidentify a stable household for adoption is discernible from <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_593\">Regulation 5(3)</a>.\n\nHowever, CARA has proceeded under the assumption that only married couples\n\nwould be able to provide a stable household for the child. Such an assumption is\n\nnot backed by data. Although married couples may provide a stable environment,\n\nit is not true that all couples who are married will automatically be able to provide\n\na stable home. Similarly, unmarried relationships cannot be characterized as\n\nfleeting relationships which are unstable by their very nature. Marriage is not\n\nnecessarily the bedrock on which families and households are built. While this is\n\nthe traditional understanding of a family, we have already elucidated above that\n\nthis social understanding of a family unit cannot be used to deny the right of other\n\ncouples who are in domestic partnerships or live-in relationships to found a family.\n\n\n303. It is now a settled position of law that classification per se is not\n\ndiscriminatory and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_594\">Article 14.</a> <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_595\">Article 14</a> only forbids class legislation\n\n\n\n\n                                        211\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nand not reasonable classification. A classification is reasonable, when the following\n\ntest is satisfied: 259\n\n\n  a. The classification must be based on an intelligible differentia which\n\n      distinguishes the persons or things that are grouped, from others left out of\n\n      the group; and\n\n\n  b. The differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved\n\n      by the statute.\n\n\n304. The Adoption Regulations use marriage as a yardstick to classify couples.\n\nThere is an intelligible differentia in using marriage as an indicator to classify\n\ncouples in the sense that married couples can easily be distinguished from\n\nunmarried couples. However, the differentia does not have a rational nexus with\n\nthe object sought to be achieved by the CARA Regulations which is to ensure that\n\nthe best interest of the child is protected. Placing a child in a stable family is\n\nundoubtedly in pursuance of a child’s interest. However, the respondents have not\n\nplaced any data on record to support their claim that only married relationships can\n\nprovide stability. It is true that separating from a married partner is a cumbersome\n\nprocess when compared to separating from a partner with whom a person is in a\n\nlive-in relationship. This is because separation from a married partner is regulated\n\nby the law while live-in relationships are unregulated by law (other than for the\n\nlimited purpose of domestic violence). For instance, the law deters a person from\n\nsecuring a divorce immediately by prescribing conditions such as a six-month\n\n\n\n\n259 See Anwar Ali Sarkar v. State of West Bengal, 1952 SCR 284\n\n\n\n\n                                                    212\n\f                                                                                                        PART D\n\nwaiting period after a petition for divorce by mutual consent is filed. 260 Merely\n\nbecause a marriage is regulated by the law, it cannot be assumed that marriage\n\nalone or that every marriage accords stability to a relationship. Similarly, it can also\n\nnot be inferred that couples who are not in a married relationships are not ‘serious’\n\nabout the relationship. The stability of the household depends on various factors\n\nsuch as the effort and involvement of the partners in establishing and running a\n\nhousehold, creating a safe space at home, creating a healthy work-life balance,\n\nand a household where mental, physical, and emotional violence is not inflicted on\n\none another. There is no single form of a stable household. There is no material\n\non record to prove the claim that only a married heterosexual couple would be able\n\nto provide stability to the child. In fact, this Court has already recognized the\n\npluralistic values of our Constitution which guarantee a right to different forms of\n\nassociation.\n\n\n305. The Union of India is required to submit cogent material to support its claim\n\nthat only married partners are able to provide a stable household. However, it has\n\nnot done so. The Union of India has submitted four studies titled “Child Attention-\n\nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in same sex parents families in the United\n\nStates: Prevalence and Comorbidities,” 261 “High School graduation rates amongst\n\nchildren of same sex households,” 262 “Children in planned lesbian families:\n\n\n\n\n260 <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_596\">Section 13(B) (2)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955; A Constitution bench of this Court in Shilpa Sailesh v.

The studies neither indicate\n\nthat only married (and not unmarried) couples can be in a stable relationship nor\n\nthat only married couples have the ability to effectively parent children. Thus, the\n\nUnion of India has not submitted any cogent material to substantiate the claim that\n\nunmarried couples cannot be in a stable relationship. The Union of India has not\n\nbeen able to demonstrate that a single parent who adopts a child will provide a\n\nmore stable environment for a child who is adopted than an unmarried couple.\n\nFor all these reasons, Regulations 5(2)(a) and 5(3) of the Adoption Regulations\n\nare violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_598\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n306. Further, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/168928387/\" id=\"a_599\">Section 58(2)</a> of the JJ Act, the Specialised Adoption\n\nAgency is required to prepare a home study report of the prospective adoptive\n\nparents. It is only when the prospective adoptive parents are found eligible after\n\nthe home study report that a child is referred to them for adoption. <a href=\"/doc/1650896/\" id=\"a_600\">Section 58(5)</a>\n\nprovides that the progress and wellbeing of the child shall be ascertained after the\n\nadoption. The procedure for adoption provides for the assessment of a couple and\n\ntheir capacity and ability to care for a child. Any areas of concern relating to a\n\ncouple’s capability as a parent would be discernible in the home study. This is true\n\n\n\n\n263 Henry M.W Bos &amp; Frank Van Balen, Children in planned lesbian families: Stigmatisation, psychological\nadjustment and protective factors, Culture, Health and Sexuality: An International Journal for Research,\nIntervention and Care, 10:3, 221-236.\n264 Solirios Sarantakos, Children in three contexts: Family, education, and social development, Children Australia\n\nVolume 21, No. 3, 1996\n\n\n\n                                                      214\n\f                                                                                    PART D\n\nof both heterosexual couples as well as queer couples.

Ms. Aishwarya Bhati referred to the judgment of this Court in Shabnam\n\nHashmi v. Union of India265 to argue that the fundamental right to adopt is not\n\nrecognised under the Constitution and thus, the exclusion of queer persons from\n\nthe scheme for adoption is not violative of Part III of the Constitution. In Shabnam\n\nHashmi (supra), a petition was filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_603\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution seeking a\n\ndeclaration that the Constitution guarantees the right to adopt, and in the\n\nalternative, requesting the court to law down guidelines enabling adoption by\n\npersons irrespective of religion, caste, and creed. This Court disposed of the\n\npetition by observing that the adjudication of the question of whether adoption must\n\nbe elevated to the status of a fundamental right must await the “dissipation of\n\nconflicting thought processes”:\n\n\n                “16. […] While it is correct that the dimensions and\n                perspectives of the meaning and content of the fundamental\n                rights are in a process of constant evolution as is bound to\n                happen in a vibrant democracy where the mind is always free,\n                elevation of the right to adopt or to be adopted to the status of\n                a fundamental right, in our considered view, will have to await\n                a dissipation of the conflicting thought processes in this\n                sphere of practices and belief prevailing in the country. The\n                legislature which is better equipped to comprehend the mental\n                preparedness of the entire citizenry to think unitedly on the\n                issue has expressed its view, for the present, by the\n                enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_604\">JJ Act</a> 2000 and the same must receive due\n                respect. … All these impel us to take the view that the present\n                is not an appropriate time and stage where the right to adopt\n\n\n265 (2014) 4 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                                 215\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n                 and the right to be adopted can be raised to the status of a\n                 fundamental right and/or to understand such a right to be\n                 encompassed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_605\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n\n\n\n308. The observations of this Court in Shabnam Hashmi (supra) that it is not the\n\nappropriate time to recognise a right to adopt and to be adopted does not affect\n\nthe case of the petitioners. The petitioners’ challenge to <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_606\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of\n\nAdoption Regulations is mounted on the ground that is discriminates against the\n\nqueer community. The challenge is not on the ground that it violates the right to\n\nadopt nor is it the petitioners case that they have a fundamental right to adopt. The\n\ncrux of the petitioners case is that <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_607\">Regulation 5(3)</a> discriminates against the queer\n\ncommunity because it disproportionately affects them.\n\n\n309. <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_608\">Regulation 5(3)</a>, though facially neutral, indirectly discriminates against\n\natypical unions (such the relationship between non-heterosexual partners) which\n\nhave not been recognised by the State. Queer marriages have not been\n\nrecognized by the state and queer persons in atypical unions cannot yet enter into\n\na marriage which is recognized by the state. Though the additional criteria\n\nprescribed by the Adoption Regulations would also affect a heterosexual person’s\n\neligibility to adopt a child, it would disproportionately affect non-heterosexual\n\ncouples. 266 This is because the State has not conferred legal recognition to the\n\nunions between queer persons, in the form of marriage. Consequently, an\n\nunmarried heterosexual couple who wishes to adopt a child has the option of\n\nmarrying to meet the eligibility criteria for adoption. However, this option is not\n\navailable to queer couples. When <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_609\">Regulation 5(3)</a> is understood in light of this\n\n266 See Lt. Col. Nitisha v. Union of India, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 261\n\n\n\n\n                                                     216\n\f                                                                                                        PART D\n\nposition, a queer person who is in a relationship can only adopt in an individual\n\ncapacity. This exclusion has the effect of reinforcing the disadvantage already\n\nfaced by the queer community.\n\n\n310. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (‘N<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_610\">CPC</a>R’) has\n\nsubmitted that excluding queer persons from adopting children is backed by cogent\n\nreasons. As stated above, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati submitted four studies to support\n\nthe claim that permitting non-heterosexual couples to adopt is not in the best\n\ninterest of the child. The paper titled “Child Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n\n(ADHD) in same-sex parent families in the United States: Prevalence and\n\nComorbidities,” 267 examines a sample of 1,95,240 children including 512 children\n\nwith same-sex parents. The paper concluded that children with same-sex parents\n\nin the United States were twice as likely to suffer from ADHD than children with\n\nopposite-sex parents. The paper titled “High School graduation rates among\n\nchildren of same-sex households” 268 uses the 2006 Canada census to study high\n\nschool graduation probabilities of children of parents belonging to the queer\n\ncommunity. The paper concluded that children living with parents belonging to the\n\nqueer community perform more poorly in school when compared to children living\n\nwith married heterosexual parents. The paper titled “Children in planned lesbian\n\nfamilies: stigmatisation, psychological adjustment and protective factors” 269\n\nconducted a study to assess the extent to which children between eight and twelve\n\n\n\n267 D Paul Sullins, Child Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in same-sex parent families in the United\n\nStates: Prevalence and Comorbidities, British Journal of Medicine &amp; Medical Research 6(10):987-998, 2015\n268 Douglas W.Allen, High School graduation rates among children of same sex households, Rev Econ Household\n\n(2013) 11:635-658\n269Henry M.W Bos &amp; Frank Van Balen, Children in planned lesbian families: Stigmatisation, psychological\n\nadjustment and protective factors, Culture, Health and Sexuality: An International Journal for Research,\nIntervention and Care, 10:3, 221-236.\n\n\n\n                                                       217\n\f                                                                                                       PART D\n\nyears in planned lesbian families in the Netherlands experience stigmatization. For\n\nthe purpose of this assessment, data was collected from questionnaires filled out\n\nby mothers and by children. It was concluded that higher levels of stigmatization\n\nwere associated with such children. Boys were found to be more hyperactive and\n\ngirls were found to suffer from a lower self-esteem. The paper titled “Children in\n\nthree contexts: Family, education, and social development” 270 collected a sample\n\nof 174 primary school children living with married heterosexual couples, cohabiting\n\nheterosexual couples, and homosexual couples to explore the relationship\n\nbetween family environment and the behaviour of primary school children. The\n\nstudy concluded that the children of married couples are more likely to do well at\n\nschool, in academic and social terms, than children of cohabiting heterosexual and\n\nhomosexual couples. However, the author cautions that there may be additional\n\nfactors such as biases which the teachers may have held while assessing the\n\nchildren, based on their cultural beliefs.\n\n\n311. On the other hand, Dr. Menaka Guruswamy appearing for the intervenor,\n\nDelhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights argued that there is no evidence\n\nor empirical data to show that non-heterosexual couples are unfit to be parents or\n\nthat the psychosocial development of children brought up by same-sex couples will\n\nbe compromised. The learned counsel relied on the paper titled “Lesbian and Gay\n\nParenting” by the American Psychological Association 271 in which it was concluded\n\nthat the home environment provided by non-heterosexual couples is not different\n\nfrom that provided by heterosexual parents. In another study titled “Same-sex\n\n\n270 Solirios Sarantakos, Children in three contexts: Family, education, and social development, Children Australia\n\nVolume 21, No. 3, 1996\n271 American Psychological Association, ‘Lesbian and Gay Parenting’\n\n\n\n\n                                                      218\n\f                                                                                               PART D\n\nparenting in Brazil and Portugal: An integrative review”,272 the authors found that\n\nthe adoption of children by one of the individuals in a non-heterosexual partnership\n\nbecause of the delay in the recognition of same-sex marriage became a weakness\n\nto such families on the issues of health, education, and other responsibilities. In\n\nanother paper titled, “Academic achievement of children in same and different sex\n\nparented families: A population-level analysis of linked administrative data from the\n\nNetherlands”, 273 it was concluded that the children raised by same-sex couples\n\nperformed at least as well as children of heterosexual parents in socio-political\n\nenvironments characterised by high levels of legislative or public support, and that\n\nthe children living in same-sex parented families experience no educational\n\ndisadvantage relative to children living in heterosexual parented families. The\n\nlearned counsel also relied on a study which was conducted based on the data\n\nderived from Netherlands where same-sex marriages were formalised in 2011. 274\n\nThe study found that the academic results of children indicated that children raised\n\nby non-heterosexual parents outperformed children raised by heterosexual parents\n\nby 0.139 standard deviations, and that they are 4.8 percentage points more likely\n\nto graduate. The studies which have been submitted by the counsel on either sides\n\nsupport their respective arguments. The studies submitted by Ms Bhati support the\n\nargument that even if <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_611\">Regulation 5(3)</a> discriminates against the queer community,\n\nit is justified because the interest of the child would suffer if they are parented by\n\n\n\n272 Biasutti, CM; Nascimento CRR, Gato J, Bortolozzo ML, Same-sex parenting in Brazil and Portugal: An\nintegrative review.

Of course, while the Court is assessing if the provision under challenge\n\ndiscriminates in effect based on identity, it must also evaluate whether the provision\n\nin question is a protective provision meant to achieve the guarantee of substantive\n\nequality.\n\n\n\n\n275 See Navtej (supra)\n\n\n\n\n                                         220\n\f                                                                                                       PART D\n\n313. For example, it cannot be argued that the Transgender Persons Act is\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_620\">Article 15</a> because it provides special provisions to safeguard the\n\ninterest of the transgender community in exclusion of cis-gender persons. A\n\nclassification based on the identities protected by <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_621\">Article 15</a> does not automatically\n\nlead to discrimination. This Court in State of Kerala v. NM Thomas 276 held that\n\nprotective provisions (such as for reservation) were not an exception to the anti-\n\ndiscrimination law but are in furtherance of the principle of equality (of which anti-\n\ndiscrimination is a facet). The Court examines if the law is discriminatory not based\n\non whether there is a classification based on the identity but whether there is\n\ndiscrimination based on the identity. While doing so it determines if it is a\n\nprotective provision. However, once it is established that the law discriminates\n\nbased on protected identities, it cannot be justified based on state interest. Thus,\n\nonce it is proved that the law discriminates based on sexual orientation as in this\n\ncase (because it disproportionately affects queer persons), no amount of evidence\n\nor material submitted by the State that such discrimination is based on state’s\n\ninterest can be used as a justification.\n\n\n314. We are of the opinion that if the children of persons from the queer\n\ncommunity suffer it is because of the lack of recognition (at a legal and social plane)\n\nto same-sex unions. In fact, one of the studies submitted by Ms. Aishwarya Bhati\n\nhighlights this aspect. 277 The stigmatization (if any) faced by the children parented\n\nby persons of the queer community is because of the inherent biases that the\n\n\n\n\n276 (1976) SCC 2 310\n277 Solirios Sarantakos, Children in three contexts: Family, education, and social development, Children Australia\n\nVolume 21, No. 3, 1996\n\n\n\n\n                                                      221\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\nsociety holds against the queer community, and in this context, biases about their\n\nfitness to be parents. Thus, it is in the interest of children that the State endeavours\n\nto take steps to sensitise the society about queer relationships.\n\n\n315. In fact, the Indian Psychiatric Society which consists of 7000 mental health\n\nprofessionals in India released a statement stating that children brought up by non-\n\nheterosexual parents may face stigmatization and that it is important that the civic\n\nsociety is adequately sensitized:\n\n\n                “The Indian Psychiatric Society is very cognizant that a child\n                adopted into a same gendered family may face challenges,\n                stigma and/or discrimination along the way. It is imperative\n                that, once legalized, such parents of the LGBTQA spectrum\n                bring up the children in a gender neutral, unbiased\n                environment. It is also of utmost importance, that the family,\n                community, school and society in general are sensitized to\n                protect and promote the development of such a child, and\n                prevent stigma and discrimination at any cost.”\n\n\n\n316. The law cannot make an assumption about good and bad parenting based\n\non the sexuality of individuals. Such an assumption perpetuates a stereotype\n\nbased on sexuality (that only heterosexuals are good parents and all other parents\n\nare bad parents) which is prohibited by <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_622\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution. This\n\nassumption is not different from the assumption that individuals of a certain class\n\nor caste or religion are ‘better’ parents. In view of the above observations, the\n\nAdoption Regulation is violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_623\">Article 15</a> for discriminating against the queer\n\ncommunity.\n\n\n317. In view of the observations above, <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_624\">Regulation 5(3)</a> is ultra vires the parent\n\nAct for exceeding the scope of delegation and for violating <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_625\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_626\">15</a> of\n\n\n\n\n                                            222\n\f                                                                                              PART D\n\nthe Constitution. It is settled that courts have the power to read down a provision\n\nto save it from being declared ultra vires. 278 <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_627\">Regulation 5(3)</a> is read down to exclude\n\nthe word “marital”. It is clarified that the reference to a ‘couple’ in <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_628\">Regulation 5</a>\n\nincludes both married and unmarried couples including queer couples. In bringing\n\nthe regulations in conformity with this judgment, CARA is at liberty to ensure that\n\nthe conditions which it prescribes for a valid adoption subserve the best interest\n\nand welfare of the child. The welfare of the child is of paramount importance.\n\nHence, the authorities would be at liberty to ensure that the familial circumstances\n\nprovide a safe, stable, and conducive environment to protect the material well-\n\nbeing and emotional sustenance of the child. Moreover, CARA may insist on\n\nconditions which would ensure that the interest of the child would be protected\n\neven if the relationship of the adoptive parents were to come to an end in the future.\n\nThose indicators must not discriminate against any couple based on sexual\n\norientation. The criteria prescribed must be in tune with constitutional values. The\n\nprinciple in <a href=\"/doc/942886/\" id=\"a_629\">Regulation 5(2)(a)</a> that the consent of spouses in a marriage must be\n\nobtained if they wish to adopt a child together is equally applicable to unmarried or\n\nqueer couples who seek to jointly adopt a child.\n\n\n318. The forms in Schedules II (child study report), III (medical examination report\n\nand classification of special needs of a child), VI (online registration form) and VII\n\n(home study report) use the phrases “male applicant” and “female applicant”. We\n\nhave already concluded above that both married and unmarried couples can adopt\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_630\">Regulation 5</a> of the Adoption Regulations. After the judgments of this Court\n\n\n\n278 Gita Hariharan v. Reserve Bank of India, (1999) 2 SCC 228; State Bank of Travancore v. Mohammed Khan\n\n(1981) 4 SCC 82; Indra Das v. State of Assam, (2011) 3 SCC 380\n\n\n\n                                                   223\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nNavtej (supra) and NALSA (supra) recognising non-binary identity and their\n\nfreedom to choose a partner irrespective of the sexual identity, reference to a\n\n‘couple’ cannot be restricted to heterosexual relationships. It will include all forms\n\nof queer relationships. The phrases “male applicant” and “female applicant (in case\n\nof applicant couples)” in Schedules II, III, VI and VII of the Adoption Regulations\n\nlimit reference to only heterosexual couples and have the effect of precluding\n\npersons in queer relationships from adopting, violating the anti-discrimination\n\nprinciple in <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_631\">Article 15(1).</a> Thus, the phrases “male applicant” and “female applicant\n\n(in case of applicant couples)” in Schedules II, III, VI and VII of the Adoption\n\nRegulations are substituted with the phrases “prospective adoptive parent 1” and\n\n“prospective adoptive parent 2 (in case of applicant couples).”\n\n\n        b. Challenge to the CARA Circular\n\n\n319. In 2022, CARA issued an Office Memorandum stipulating that a single\n\nprospective adoptive parent in a live-in relationship will be ineligible to adopt a\n\nchild. The Office Memorandum further provides that this decision is taken in line\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_632\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations which stipulates that a child can\n\nonly be placed with a stable family and that a single applicant in a live-in\n\nrelationship cannot be considered to be a part of a stable family. The relevant\n\nportion of the Office Memorandum is extracted below:\n\n\n             “It has been noticed from Home study Reports (HSRs) that\n             some single PAPs registered with CARA for the adoption\n             process are in relationship with their live-in partner.\n\n\n             2. The cases of single PAPs engaged in live-in relationship\n             have been discussed in the Steering Committee of Central\n             Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) during its 31st Meeting\n             held on 18th April, 2022. It has been decided to go with the\n\n\n                                           224\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\n             earlier decision of 14th Steering Committee Meeting held on\n             10th May, 2018 that the cases of single PAP in a live-in\n             relationship with a partner will not be considered eligible\n             to adopt a child and their registration from concerned\n             agencies/authorities will not be considered for approval.\n\n\n             3. The decision has been taken in line with <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_633\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of\n             the Adoption regulations 2017. The authority would like the\n             children to be placed only with the stable family and single\n             applicant in a live-in relationship cannot be considered\n             as stable family.”\n\n\n\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n320. CARA in its 31st meeting held on 18 April 2022 in terms of the decision taken\n\nin the Steering Committee Meeting held on 10 May 2018 resolved that an\n\napplication received by a prospective adoptive parent who is in a live-in relationship\n\nmay not be considered on the basis of <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_634\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations.\n\nThe resolution is extracted below:\n\n\n             “14. Reference is drawn to Steering Committee Meeting, held\n             on 10th May 2019 wherein the Steering Committee had not\n             approved adoption to prospective adoptive parents staying in\n             Live-in relationship. However, NOC section has received\n             three cases of children reserved from Special Need portal and\n             on examination of the HSR it has been observed that the\n             parents have been in live-in relationship.\n\n\n             15. In this regard the NOC committee had not approved inter-\n             country cases of the children on the basis of Reg. 5(3) which\n             states that no child shall be given in adoption to a couple\n             unless they have atleast two years of stable marital\n             relationship. Since the matter involves cases of special needs\n             children, the issue may be kindly be discussed in the Steering\n             Committee.\n\n\n             Decision: It was decided to go with the earlier decision of the\n             Steering committee and the same rule should be applicable\n             as that of the domestic PAPs. Any application received from\n             live in PAPs may not be considered on the basis of Reg. 5(3)\n             of the Adoption Regulations.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             225\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n321. The CARA Circular prescribes a condition in addition to the conditions\n\nprescribed in the Adoption Regulations. While the Adoption Regulations exclude\n\nunmarried couples from jointly adopting a child, the CARA Circular restricts the\n\nability of a person who is in a live-in relationship to adopt in their individual\n\ncapacity. The CARA Circular stipulates that the decision is in pursuance of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_635\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations which requires couples to be in a\n\n‘stable’ relationship.\n\n\n322. <a href=\"/doc/33946/\" id=\"a_636\">Regulation 5(1)</a> of the Adoption Regulations prescribes a general criteria (in\n\nthe form of a guiding principle) for prospective adoptive parents which is that they\n\nmust be physically, mentally, and emotionally fit, they must not be convicted of a\n\ncriminal act, and they must not have a life-threatening disease. These criteria are\n\nequally applicable to couples and persons who wish to adopt in their individual\n\ncapacity. All the other subsequent provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_637\">Regulation 5</a> are specific to couples\n\n(that is, the requirement of a stable relationship and the consent of both parties)\n\nand individuals (that is, that a male cannot adopt a girl child). Hence, the additional\n\ncriterion prescribed by the CARA circular for a person to adopt in an individual\n\ncapacity must be traceable to the principles in Regulations 5(1) and 5(2)(c). The\n\ncondition imposed by CARA circular is neither traceable to the principles in\n\nRegulations 5(1) and 5(2)(c) nor is it traceable to any of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_638\">JJ\n\nAct</a>. The CARA Circular has exceeded the scope of the Adoption Guidelines and\n\nthe JJ Act.\n\n\n323. According to the Adoption Regulations, unmarried couples cannot jointly\n\nadopt a child. Though the additional criteria prescribed by the CARA Circular would\n\n\n\n\n                                         226\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\nalso affect a heterosexual person’s eligibility to adopt a child, it would\n\ndisproportionately affect 279 non-heterosexual couples since the State has not\n\nconferred legal recognition in the form of marriage to the union between non-\n\nheterosexual persons. When the CARA Circular is read in light of this legal position,\n\na person of the queer community would be forced to choose between their wish to\n\nbe an adoptive parent and their desire to enter into a partnership with a person\n\nthey feel love and affinity with. This exclusion has the effect of reinforcing the\n\ndisadvantage already faced by the queer community. For these reasons and the\n\nreasons recorded in Section D (xiii)(a)(III), the CARA Circular is violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_639\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\nE.    Response to the opinion of Justice Ravindra Bhat\n\n\n324. In the opinion authored by him, my learned brother, Justice Ravindra Bhat\n\nstates that unenumerated rights are recognised by Courts in response to State\n\naction “that threaten the freedom or right directly or indirectly.” With due respect,\n\nsuch a narrow understanding of fundamental rights turns back the clock on the rich\n\njurisprudence that the Indian courts have developed on Part III of the Constitution.\n\nThis Court has held in numerous cases held that the rights of persons are infringed\n\nnot merely by overt actions but also by inaction on the part of the State. Some of\n\nthese precedents are referred to below.\n\n\n\n\n279 See Lt. Col. Nitisha v. Union of India, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 261\n\n\n\n\n                                                227\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\n325. In NALSA (supra), this Court held that the State by rendering the\n\ntransgender community invisible and failing to recognize their gender identity\n\ndeprived them of social and cultural rights. This Court recognised the duty of the\n\nState to enable the exercise of rights by the transgender community and issued a\n\nslew of directions to enforce this duty. Justice AK Sikri in his opinion issued the\n\nfollowing declarations and directions:\n\n\n             “129. We, therefore, declare:\n\n\n         1. Hijras, Eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as “third\n            gender” for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part\n            III of our Constitution and the laws made by the Parliament\n            and the State Legislature.\n\n\n         2. Transgender persons’ right to decide their selfidentified\n            gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments\n            are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity\n            such as male, female or as third gender.\n\n\n         3. We direct the Centre and the State Governments to take steps\n            to treat them as socially and educationally backward classes\n            of citizens and extend all kinds of reservation in cases of\n            admission in educational institutions and for public\n            appointments.\n\n\n         4. Centre and State Governments are directed to operate\n            separate HIV Sero-surveillance Centres since Hijras/\n            Transgenders face several sexual health issues.\n\n\n         5. Centre and State Governments should seriously address the\n            problems being faced by Hijras/Transgenders such as fear,\n            shame, gender dysphoria, social pressure, depression,\n            suicidal tendencies, social stigma, etc. and any insistence for\n            SRS for declaring one’s gender is immoral and illegal.\n\n\n         6. Centre and State Governments should take proper measures\n            to provide medical care to TGs in the hospitals and also\n            provide them separate public toilets and other facilities.\n\n\n         7. Centre and State Governments should also take steps for\n            framing various social welfare schemes for their betterment.\n\n\n\n                                             228\n\f                                                                                    PART E\n\n            8. Centre and State Governments should take steps to create\n               public awareness so that TGs will feel that they are also part\n               and parcel of the social life and be not treated as\n               untouchables.\n\n\n            9. Centre and the State Governments should also take\n               measures to regain their respect and place in the society\n               which once they enjoyed in our cultural and social life.”\n\n\n326. In Union of India v. Association of Democratic Reforms280, proceedings\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_640\">Article 136</a> were initiated against the judgment of the High Court of Delhi\n\nwhich recognised the rights of citizens to receive information regarding criminal\n\nactivities of a candidate to the legislative assembly. The High Court directed the\n\nElection Commission to inter alia secure information on whether the candidate is\n\naccused of any offence and the assets possessed by a candidate. A three-Judge\n\nBench of this Court dismissed the appeal and held that it is imperative that the\n\nelectorate possesses sufficient information to enable them to exercise their right to\n\nvote. The observations are extracted below:\n\n\n                “34. From the afore quoted paragraph, it can be deduced that\n                the members of a democratic society should be sufficiently\n                informed so that they may influence intelligently the decisions\n                which may affect themselves and this would include their\n                decision of casting votes in favour of a particular candidate. If\n                there is a disclosure by a candidate as sought for then it would\n                strengthen the voters in taking appropriate decision of casting\n                their votes.\n\n\n                45. Finally, in our view this Court would have ample power to\n                direct the Commission to fill the void, in the absence of\n                suitable legislation covering the field and the voters are\n                required to be well informed and educated about contesting\n                candidates so that they can elect a proper candidate by their\n                own assessment. It is the duty of the executive to fill the\n                vacuum by executive orders because its field is coterminous\n                with that of the legislature, and where there is inaction by the\n                executive, for whatever reason, the judiciary must step in, in\n                exercise of its constitutional obligations to provide a solution\n\n280 (2002) 5 SCC 294\n\n\n\n\n                                                 229\n\f                                                                                                          PART E\n\n                  till such time the legislature acts to perform its role by enacting\n                  proper legislation to cover the field. The adverse impact of\n                  lack of probity in public life leading to a high degree of\n                  corruption is manifold. Therefore, if the candidate is directed\n                  to declare his/her spouse&#x27;s and dependants&#x27; assets —\n                  immovable, movable and valuable articles — it would have its\n                  own effect.”\n\n\n327. While the precedents on the subject are not multiplied in the text of the\n\njudgment, some of the judgments on this point are footnoted. 281 In view of the\n\ndiscussion above, the observation of Justice Bhat that an overt action of the State\n\nis necessary for the court to direct the State to create enabling conditions has no\n\njurisprudential basis. Neither the provisions of the Constitution nor the earlier\n\ndecisions of this Court create such a distinction. In fact, as I have discussed in\n\ndetail, <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_641\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court shall have the\n\npower to issue directions for the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III without\n\nmaking any distinction between action and inaction by the State.\n\n\n328. I also disagree with the observations of Bhat J that in the absence of a legal\n\nregime, the power of this Court to issue directions to enable the facilitation of rights\n\nis limited. In Sheela Barse v. Union of India 282, the petitioner, a social activist\n\nbrought to the attention of this court that the State of West Bengal jailed persons\n\nwith mental disabilities who are not suspected, accused, charged of, or convicted\n\nfor, committing any offence but only for the reason that they are mentally ill. The\n\ndecision to jail them was made based on an instant assessment of their mental\n\nhealth. This Court held that the admission of such mentally ill persons to jails was\n\n\n281 In the context of the right to speedy trial, see SC Advocates-on-Record Association v.

This Court also directed that hospitals shall be\n\nimmediately upgraded, psychiatric services shall be set up in all teaching and\n\ndistrict hospitals, including filling posts for psychiatrists, and integrating mental\n\nhealth care with the primary health care system. In PUCL v. Union of India283, the\n\npetitioner submitted that the right to livelihood implies that the State has a duty to\n\nprovide food to people. In a series of orders, this Court identified government\n\nschemes which constituted legal entitlements of the right to food and outlined the\n\nmanner of implementing these schemes.\n\n\n329. My learned brother relies on the example of <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_642\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> to buttress his\n\npoint. He states that in the absence of a law which casts a duty on the State to\n\nprovide transportation through roads, a citizen cannot approach the court and seek\n\nthe construction of a road to enforce the right to move freely. The opinion of my\n\nlearned brother fails to have noted the judgment of a three-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Umed Ram Sharma 284. In this case, a\n\nletter petition was written to the High Court claiming that the construction of a road\n\nwhich would benefit the residents of the village and in particular, the members of\n\nthe Dalit community was stopped by the State. The High Court directed the\n\nSuperintending Engineer of the Public Works Department to complete the\n\nconstruction of the road. This Court dismissed the appeal against the judgment of\n\nthe High Court observing that the Constitution places a duty on the State to provide\n\nroads for residents of hilly areas because access to roads is encompassed in their\n\nright to secure a quality life. This Court recognised that the right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_643\">Article 21</a> of\n\n\n\n283 WP (Civil) No. 196/2001\n284 (1986) 2 SCC 68\n\n\n\n\n                                          231\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\nthe Constitution is violated if the State does not build roads for effective\n\ncommunication and transportation. Thus, even in the absence of a law which\n\nrequires the State to build roads, such a duty was imposed on the State on an\n\ninterpretation of Part III of the Constitution. Moreover, in the precent case, the\n\npetitioners are demanding equal access to something which does exist (i.e., the\n\nentitlements which flow from the right to form an abiding cohabitational union). In\n\nfact, my learned brother himself recognizes this when he holds that the actions of\n\nthe state have the effect of discriminating against queer couples. The example\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_644\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is unconvincing for similar reasons.\n\n\n330. Bhat, J. holds that: (i) the legal dimension of marriage in USA is different\n\nfrom the legal dimension of marriage in India; (ii) the legality of a marriage in USA\n\nis solely dependent on a validly obtained license; (iii) in India, the legal status of a\n\nmarriage stems from personal law and customs; and (iv) the terms of marriage are\n\nset, to a large extent, independently of the state. While there is no doubt that\n\nmarriage predates the state and the existence of what we now consider ‘law’, I am\n\nunable to agree with the conclusion of my learned brother that the status of a\n\nmarriage in India stems only from personal law and customs and that the terms of\n\nmarriage are largely set independently of the state, for two reasons: First, the legal\n\nstatus of a married couple stems from statute. Once the state began regulating\n\nmarriage, the validity (and consequently, the ‘status’) of marriage is traceable to\n\nlaw. While law may provide that a marriage is valid if it was performed in\n\naccordance with custom, it is beyond cavil that the only reason that a custom is\n\nrelevant (for the purposes of law) is because of law itself. Therefore, it is law\n\n(through statutes) that accords significance to personal law and customs and it is\n\n\n                                          232\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\nstatutes that may (and often do) deviate from personal law and customs. Second,\n\nthe number of legislations which govern marriage as well as the detailed framework\n\nwhich they set out makes it immediately evident that the terms of marriage are not\n\nset independently of the state, but by the state itself. From divorce to custody to\n\nmaintenance to domestic violence and offences, almost every aspect of marriage\n\nis regulated by the state. I have discussed the manner in which marriage has\n\nevolved (through state regulation) in detail in Section D(iii)(b) of my judgment.\n\nThus, marriage as an institution cannot anymore be viewed as solely traceable to\n\ncustoms and traditions after the State’s interference to regulate the institution. The\n\nState’s reformation of the institution has slowly but evidently changed the nature of\n\nthe institution itself. Under the Constitution, the state is empowered to reform social\n\ninstitutions including marriage in line with constitutional values.\n\n\n331. Contrary to what is stated in the judgment of Bhat, J., the directions in my\n\njudgment do not require the state to create social or legal status, or a social\n\ninstitution. The directions are with a view to recognizing the choice that a person\n\nmakes for themselves when they choose another to be their partner for life. The\n\ndirections seek to make that choice a meaningful one. Nowhere do they create an\n\ninstitution of any kind. Rather, they give effect to the fundamental rights in Part III\n\nof the Constitution. This is the mandate of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_645\">Article 32</a> – “The\n\nSupreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs … for the\n\nenforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.” No response is forthcoming\n\nto my detailed exposition of the scope of the powers of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_646\">Article 32</a>\n\nin Section D(i) of my judgment. In fact, Bhat, J. himself recognizes that courts often\n\nenable and oblige the state to take measures. My learned brother also arrives at\n\n\n                                          233\n\f                                                                                                           PART E\n\nthe conclusion that the state is indirectly discriminating against the queer\n\ncommunity but fails to exercise the power vested in this Court by <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_647\">Article 32</a> to\n\nalleviate this discrimination in any way. This Court is not through judicial diktat\n\ncreating a legal regime exclusively for persons of the queer community but merely\n\nrecognising the duty of the State to recognise the entitlements flowing from\n\nexercising the right to choose a life partner.\n\n\n332. Bhat, J. states that no one has contended that two queer persons have the\n\nright of a sustained partnership which is traceable to <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_648\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a>, (c), (d) and\n\nthe right to conscience under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_649\">Article 25.</a> This is not true, as demonstrated by the\n\nsegment of this judgment on the submissions made by the petitioners.285\n\n\n333. Bhat, J. has held that:\n\n\n       a.     The classification in a legislation is to be discerned by gathering the\n\n              object sought to be achieved by the enactment. The object of the SMA\n\n              was to enable inter-faith heterosexual marriage. The classification is\n\n              therefore between same-faith heterosexual couples and inter-faith\n\n              heterosexual couples. It does not discriminate against queer persons;\n\n              and\n\n\n       b.     The test for discrimination is not the object of the statute but its effect\n\n              and impact. The effect of the state regulating marriage only for\n\n              heterosexual couples is that it “adversely impacts” them, “results in their\n\n\n\n285 Illustratively, see the submissions of (i) Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi (at paragraph 21(d) of this judgment); (ii) Mr.\n\nRaju Ramachandran (at paragraph 22(a) of this judgment); (iii) Mr KV Vishwanathan (at paragraph 23(f) of this\njudgment); (iv) Mr. Anand Grover (at paragraph 25(e) of this judgment); (v) Dr. Menaka Guruswamy (at paragraph\n27(d) of this judgment); (vi) Ms. Anitha Shenoy (at paragraph 31(a) of this judgment).\n\n\n\n                                                         234\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n           exclusion,” “results in denial of entitlements / benefits,” and that “this\n\n           injustice and inequity results in discrimination.” The state must address\n\n           “this deprivation” and take “remedial action.”\n\n\nMy learned brother contradicts himself when he holds that the SMA is not\n\ndiscriminatory by relying on its object, on the one hand, and that the state has\n\nindirectly discriminated against the queer community because it is the effect and\n\nnot the object which is relevant, on the other. My learned brother discusses in\n\ndetail the deprivation, exclusion, and discrimination faced by the queer community.\n\nIn effect, he: (i) recognizes that they have a right not to be discriminated against;\n\nand (ii) holds that the actions of the state have the effect of discriminating against\n\nthem. However, he does not take the step which logically follows from such a ruling\n\nwhich is to pass directions to obviate such discrimination and ensure the realization\n\nof the rights of the queer community. I cannot bring myself to agree with this\n\napproach. The realization of a right is effectuated when there is a remedy available\n\nto enforce it. The principle of ubi jus ibi remedium (that is, an infringement of a right\n\nhas a remedy) which has been applied in the context of civil law for centuries\n\ncannot be ignored in the constitutional context. Absent the grant of remedies, the\n\nformulation of doctrines is no more than judicial platitude.\n\n\n334. Bhat, J highlights that the central question which arises for the consideration\n\nof this Court is whether the absence of law or a regulatory framework, or the failure\n\nof the State to enact law, amounts to discrimination that is protected under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_650\">Article\n\n15.</a> He states that “there is no known jurisprudence or case law (yet) pointing to\n\nthe absence of law being considered as discrimination as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1345754/\" id=\"a_651\">Article\n\n\n\n\n                                          235</a>\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\n15.” Here, I would like to sound a note of caution (which, though obvious, bears\n\nrepetition) – the manner in an issue is framed impacts the analysis of the issue. In\n\nfact, Bhat, J’s reasoning deviates from the jurisprudence that this Court has\n\ndeveloped on the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_652\">Article 15.</a> Bhat, J’s reasoning assesses the\n\n‘objective’ of a law instead of its ‘effect. This is best understood with the help of an\n\nexample. Suppose the state were to enact a law which enabled only citizens of a\n\nparticular caste to avail the services of a particular government hospital but which\n\ndid not expressly prohibit members of other castes from availing its services. This\n\nlaw contains various conditions which must be satisfied before services of the\n\nhospital can be availed (such as a list of diseases which it treats or how advanced\n\na particular disease is). This law can be understood as being an “enabling law” or\n\na law which “regulates” or it can be understood (in its true sense) as a law which\n\nhas the effect of excluding certain groups on the basis of prohibited markers of\n\nidentity. This remains true not only of a hospital but of any service or scheme or\n\ninstitution that one can imagine. Hence, what is framed as the “absence of a law”\n\nor an “enabling law” can have the same restrictive effect as a law which expressly\n\nbars or prohibits certain actions or excludes certain groups.\n\n\n335. I disagree with the observations of my learned brother that the State has a\n\npositive obligation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_653\">Article 21</a> but such an obligation cannot be read into other\n\nfundamental rights other than <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_654\">Article 21.</a> I reiterate the observations made in\n\nSection D(ix)(a).\n\n\n336. Bhat, J. distinguishes the judgments in Vishaka (supra), Common Cause\n\n(supra) and NALSA (supra) from the present case by holding that in each of these\n\n\n\n\n                                          236\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\ncases, directions were passed because the “inadequacies … were acute and\n\nintolerable” and faced by “entire groups.” However, he does not explain why the\n\ninadequacies faced by the queer community in this case are mild or tolerable.\n\nThere is neither a test nor standard known to law by which discrimination, or the\n\nviolation of a fundamental right, must reach a level of intolerability for this Court to\n\nexercise its jurisdiction. Regardless of the severity of the violation, it is the duty of\n\nthis Court to protect the exercise of the right in question. Further, in this case too,\n\nthe rights of an “entire group” (being the queer community) are at issue.\n\n\n337. The opinion of Bhat, J. highlights that the reading of the Adoption\n\nRegulations to permit unmarried couples to adopt would have ‘disastrous\n\noutcomes’ because the law, as it stands today, does not guarantee the protection\n\nof the child of unmarried parents adopting jointly. A reading of the numerous laws\n\nrelating to the rights of children qua parents indicates that the law does not create\n\nany distinction between children of married and unmarried couples so long as they\n\nare validly adopted. <a href=\"/doc/1943999/\" id=\"a_655\">Section 12</a> of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956\n\nstates that an adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of their adopted\n\nparents for all purposes from the date of adoption. Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/946336/\" id=\"a_656\">Section 63</a> of the JJ\n\nAct also creates a deeming fiction. The provision states that a child in respect of\n\nwhom an adoption order is issued shall become the child of the adoptive parents\n\nand the adoptive parents shall become the parents of the child as if the child had\n\nbeen born to the adoptive parents, including for the purposes of intestacy.\n\n\n\n\n                                          237\n\f                                                                                                         PART E\n\n338. In view of the deeming fiction created by <a href=\"/doc/1943999/\" id=\"a_657\">Section 12</a> of the Hindu Adoptions\n\nand Maintenance Act 1956 and <a href=\"/doc/946336/\" id=\"a_658\">Section 63</a> of the JJ Act, an adopted child is a\n\nlegitimate child of the adopting couple. The manner of determination of legitimacy\n\n\nprescribed by <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_659\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 286 shall not apply in\n\nview of the deeming fiction created by <a href=\"/doc/1943999/\" id=\"a_660\">Section 12</a> of the Hindu Adoptions and\n\nMaintenance Act 1956 and <a href=\"/doc/946336/\" id=\"a_661\">Section 63</a> of the JJ Act. Thus, all the benefits which\n\nare available under the law to a legitimate child (who has been validly adopted) of\n\na married couple will equally be available to the legitimate child of an unmarried\n\ncouple. For example, <a href=\"/doc/17630/\" id=\"a_662\">Section 20</a> of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956\n\nwhich provides that a Hindu is to maintain their children does not make any\n\ndistinction between a legitimate child of a married and an unmarried couple.\n\nSimilarly, succession law in India does not differentiate between the child of a\n\nmarried and an unmarried couple if the child has been adopted by following the\n\ndue process of law. Further, the breakdown of the relationship of an unmarried\n\ncouple will not lead to a change in applicable law because the child will continue to\n\nbe a legitimate child even after the breakdown of the relationship. It is therefore\n\nunclear what the ‘disastrous outcomes’ referred to, are. My learned brother has\n\nalso failed to address whether <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_663\">Regulation 5(3)</a> is discriminatory for distinguishing\n\nbetween married and unmarried couples for the purpose of adoption and for the\n\ndisproportionate impact that it has on the members of the queer community while\n\nsimultaneously holding that “the State cannot, on any account, make regulations\n\nthat are facially or indirectly discriminatory on the ground of sexual orientation.”\n\n\n\n286 The provision confers legitimacy on a child born during the continuance of a valid marriage or within two eighty\n\ndays since the dissolution of marriage.\n\n\n\n                                                       238\n\f                                                                              PART F\n\nF.   Directions to obviate discrimination\n\n\n339. Counsel for the petitioners and some counsel for the respondents advanced\n\nextensive submissions on the various forms of violence and discrimination that\n\nsociety and the state machinery inflict upon the queer community, and especially\n\nqueer couples. This has been discussed in detail in the prefatory part of the\n\njudgment. Counsel sought directions to obviate such violence and discrimination.\n\n\n a. The Union Government, State Governments, and Governments of Union\n\n     Territories are directed to:\n\n\n      i.    Ensure that the queer community is not discriminated against because\n\n            of their gender identity or sexual orientation;\n\n\n     ii.    Ensure that there is no discrimination in access to goods and services\n\n            to the queer community, which are available to the public;\n\n\n     iii.   Take steps to sensitise the public about queer identity, including that it\n\n            is natural and not a mental disorder;\n\n\n     iv.    Establish hotline numbers that the queer community can contact when\n\n            they face harassment and violence in any form;\n\n\n     v.     Establish and publicise the availability of ‘safe houses’ or Garima Grehs\n\n            in all districts to provide shelter to members of the queer community who\n\n            are facing violence or discrimination;\n\n\n\n\n                                           239\n\f                                                                              PART F\n\n  vi.    Ensure that “treatments” offered by doctors or other persons, which aim\n\n         to change gender identity or sexual orientation are ceased with\n\n         immediate effect;\n\n\n  vii.   Ensure that inter-sex children are not forced to undergo operations with\n\n         regard only to their sex, especially at an age at which they are unable to\n\n         fully comprehend and consent to such operations;\n\n\n viii.   Recognize the self-identified gender of all persons including transgender\n\n         persons, hijras, and others with sociocultural identities in India, as male,\n\n         female, or third gender. No person shall be forced to undergo hormonal\n\n         therapy or sterilisation or any other medical procedure either as a\n\n         condition or prerequisite to grant legal recognition to their gender identity\n\n         or otherwise;\n\n\nb. The appropriate Government under the <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_664\">Mental Healthcare Act</a> must formulate\n\n   modules covering the mental health of queer persons in their programmes\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1196567/\" id=\"a_665\">Section 29(1)</a>. Programmes to reduce suicides and attempted suicides\n\n   (envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/227439/\" id=\"a_666\">Section 29(2)</a>) must include provisions which tackle queer\n\n   identity;\n\n\nc. The following directions are issued to the police machinery:\n\n\n    i.   There shall be no harassment of queer couples by summoning them to\n\n         the police station or visiting their places of residence solely to interrogate\n\n         them about their gender identity or sexual orientation;\n\n\n\n\n                                        240\n\f                                                                               PART F\n\n      ii.   They shall not force queer persons to return to their natal families if they\n\n            do not wish to return to them;\n\n\n     iii.   When a police complaint is filed by queer persons alleging that their\n\n            family is restraining their freedom of movement, they shall on verifying\n\n            the genuineness of the complaint ensure that their freedom is not\n\n            curtailed;\n\n\n     iv.    When a police complaint is filed apprehending violence from the family\n\n            for the reason that the complainant is queer or is in a queer relationship,\n\n            they shall on verifying the genuineness of the complaint ensure due\n\n            protection; and\n\n\n      v.    Before registering an FIR against a queer couple or one of the parties in\n\n            a queer relationship (where the FIR is sought to be registered in relation\n\n            to their relationship), they shall conduct a preliminary investigation in\n\n            terms of Lalita Kumari v. Government of U.P 287, to ensure that the\n\n            complaint discloses a cognizable offence. The police must first\n\n            determine if the person is an adult. If the person is an adult and is in a\n\n            consensual relationship with another person of the same or different\n\n            gender or has left their natal home of their own volition, the police shall\n\n            close the complaint after recording a statement to that effect.\n\n\n\n\n287 (2014) 2 SCC 1\n\n\n\n\n                                          241\n\f                                                                             PART G\n\nG.   Conclusions and orders of enforcement\n\n\n340. In view of the discussion above, the following are our conclusions:\n\n\n     a.   This Court is vested with the authority to hear this case. Under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_667\">Article\n\n          32</a>, this Court has the power to issue directions, orders, or writs for the\n\n          enforcement of the rights in Part III;\n\n\n     b.   Queerness is a natural phenomenon known to India since ancient times.\n\n          It is not urban or elite;\n\n\n     c.   There is no universal conception of the institution of marriage, nor is it\n\n          static. Under <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_668\">Articles 245</a> and <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_669\">246</a> of the Constitution read with Entry 5\n\n          of List III to the Seventh Schedule, it lies within the domain of Parliament\n\n          and the state legislatures to enact laws recognizing and regulating queer\n\n          marriage;\n\n\n     d.   Marriage has attained significance as a legal institution largely because\n\n          of regulation by the state. By recognizing a relationship in the form of\n\n          marriage, the state grants material benefits exclusive to marriage;\n\n\n     e.   The State has an interest in regulating the ‘intimate zone’ to democratize\n\n          personal relationships;\n\n\n     f.   The issue of whether the Constitution recognizes the right to marry did\n\n          not arise before this Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra),\n\n          Shafin Jahan (supra), and Shakti Vahini (supra);\n\n\n\n\n                                         242\n\f                                                                      PART G\n\ng.   The Constitution does not expressly recognize a fundamental right to\n\n     marry. An institution cannot be elevated to the realm of a fundamental\n\n     right based on the content accorded to it by law. However, several facets\n\n     of the marital relationship are reflections of constitutional values\n\n     including the right to human dignity and the right to life and personal\n\n     liberty;\n\n\nh.   This Court cannot either strike down the constitutional validity of SMA or\n\n     read words into the SMA because of its institutional limitations. This\n\n     Court cannot read words into the provisions of the SMA and provisions\n\n     of other allied laws such as the ISA and the HSA because that would\n\n     amount to judicial legislation. The Court in the exercise of the power of\n\n     judicial review must steer clear of matters, particularly those impinging\n\n     on policy, which fall in the legislative domain;\n\n\ni.   The freedom of all persons including queer couples to enter into a union\n\n     is protected by Part III of the Constitution. The failure of the state to\n\n     recognise the bouquet of entitlements which flow from a union would\n\n     result in a disparate impact on queer couples who cannot marry under\n\n     the current legal regime. The state has an obligation to recognize such\n\n     unions and grant them benefit under law;\n\n\nj.   In <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_670\">Article 15(1)</a>, the word ‘sex’ must be read to include ‘sexual\n\n     orientation’ not only because of the causal relationship between\n\n     homophobia and sexism but also because the word ‘sex’ is used as a\n\n\n\n\n                                    243\n\f                                                                        PART G\n\n     marker of identity which cannot be read independent of the social and\n\n     historical context;\n\n\nk.   The right to enter into a union cannot be restricted based on sexual\n\n     orientation. Such a restriction will be violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_671\">Article 15.</a> Thus, this\n\n     freedom is available to all persons regardless of gender identity or\n\n     sexual orientation;\n\n\nl.   The decisions in Navtej (supra) and Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J)\n\n     (supra) recognize the right of queer couples to exercise the choice to\n\n     enter into a union. This relationship is protected from external threat.\n\n     Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation will violate <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_672\">Article 15;</a>\n\n\nm.   Transgender persons in heterosexual relationships have the right to\n\n     marry under existing law including personal laws which regulate\n\n     marriage;\n\n\nn.   Intersex persons who identify as either male or female have the right to\n\n     marry under existing law including personal laws which regulate\n\n     marriage;\n\n\no.   The state must enable the LGBTQ community to exercise its rights under\n\n     the Constitution. Queer persons have the right to freedom from coercion\n\n     from their natal families, agencies of the state including the police, and\n\n     other persons;\n\n\np.   Unmarried couples (including queer couples) can jointly adopt a child.\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_673\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the Adoption Regulations is ultra vires the JJ Act,\n\n\n                                   244\n\f                                                                        PART G\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_674\">Articles 14</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_675\">15.</a> <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_676\">Regulation 5(3)</a> is read down to exclude the word\n\n     “marital”. The reference to a ‘couple’ in <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_677\">Regulation 5</a> includes both\n\n     married and unmarried couples as well as queer couples. The principle\n\n     in <a href=\"/doc/942886/\" id=\"a_678\">Regulation 5(2)(a)</a> that the consent of spouses in a marriage must be\n\n     obtained if they wish to adopt a child together is equally applicable to\n\n     unmarried couples who seek to jointly adopt a child. However, while\n\n     framing regulations, the state may impose conditions which will subserve\n\n     the best interest and welfare of the child in terms of the exposition in the\n\n     judgment;\n\n\nq.   The CARA Circular disproportionately impacts the queer community and\n\n     is violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_679\">Article 15;</a>\n\n\nr.   The Union Government, State Governments, and Governments of Union\n\n     Territories shall not discriminate against the freedom of queer persons\n\n     to enter into union with benefits under law; and\n\n\ns.   We record the assurance of the Solicitor General that the Union\n\n     Government will constitute a Committee chaired by the Cabinet\n\n     Secretary for the purpose of defining and elucidating the scope of the\n\n     entitlements of queer couples who are in unions. The Committee shall\n\n     include experts with domain knowledge and experience in dealing with\n\n     the social, psychological, and emotional needs of persons belonging to\n\n     the queer community as well as members of the queer community. The\n\n     Committee shall before finalizing its decisions conduct wide stakeholder\n\n     consultation amongst persons belonging to the queer community,\n\n\n\n                                   245\n\f                                                                                PART G\n\n             including persons belonging to marginalized groups and with the\n\n             governments of the States and Union Territories.\n\n\nThe Committee shall in terms of the exposition in this judgment consider the\n\nfollowing:\n\n\n     i.      Enabling partners in a queer relationship (i) to be treated as a part of the\n\n             same family for the purposes of a ration card; and (ii) to have the facility\n\n             of a joint bank account with the option to name the partner as a nominee,\n\n             in case of death;\n\n\n    ii.      In terms of the decision in Common Cause v. Union of India 288, as\n\n             modified by Common Cause v. Union of India 289, medical practitioners\n\n             have a duty to consult family or next of kin or next friend, in the event\n\n             patients who are terminally ill have not executed an Advance Directive.\n\n             Parties in a union may be considered ‘family’ for this purpose;\n\n\n   iii.      Jail visitation rights and the right to access the body of the deceased\n\n             partner and arrange the last rites; and\n\n\n\n\n288 (2018) 5 SCC 1\n289 2023 SCC OnLine SC 99\n\n\n\n\n                                           246\n\f                                                                          PART G\n\n  iv.     Legal consequences such as succession rights, maintenance, financial\n\n          benefits such as under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_680\">Income Tax Act</a> 1961, rights flowing from\n\n          employment such as gratuity and family pension and insurance.\n\n\nThe report of the Committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary shall be\n\nimplemented at the administrative level by the Union Government and the\n\ngovernments of the States and Union Territories.\n\n\n341.

This case presents a new path and a new journey in providing legal\nrecognition to non-heterosexual relationships.\n\n2.         I have had the benefit of the exhaustive and erudite judgment of the\nHon’ble Chief Justice Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud; which enumerates the prevalence\nof these relationships in history, the Constitutional recognition of the right to\nform unions (in other words ‘civil unions’), and the necessity of laying down\nguidelines to protect non-heterosexual unions. In a way, this is a step forward\nfrom the decriminalisation of private consensual sexual activities by the\nLGBTQ+ community in Navtej Singh Johar &amp; Ors. vs. Union of India,\nThrough Secretary, Ministry of Law &amp; Justice.1\n\n3.         The judgment penned down by the Hon’ble Chief Justice considers all\naspects of the challenge. However, the subject matter itself persuades me to pen\ndown a few words while broadly agreeing with his judgment.\n\n\nHistorical prevalence of non-heterosexual unions\n\n4.         In their submissions, the Respondents raised doubts about the social\nacceptability of non-heterosexual relationships. Before we address the same, it\n\n1\n    2018 (1) SCC 791.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                   Page 2 of 17\n\fis no longer res integra that the duty of a constitutional Court is to uphold the\nrights enshrined in the Constitution and to not be swayed by majoritarian\ntendencies or popular perceptions. This Court has always been guided by\nconstitutional morality and not by social morality.2\n\n5.         A pluralistic social fabric has been an integral part of Indian culture and\nthe cornerstone of our constitutional democracy. 3 Non-heterosexual unions are\nwell-known to ancient Indian civilisation as attested by various texts, practices,\nand depictions of art. These markers of discourse reflect that such unions are an\ninevitable presence across human experience. Hindu deities were multi-\ndimensional and multi-faceted and could appear in different forms. One of the\nearliest illustrations is from the Rig Veda itself. Agni, one of the most important\ndeities, has been repeatedly described as the “child of two births” (dvijanman),\n“child of two mothers” (dvimatri), and occasionally, “child of three mothers”\n(the three worlds).4\n\n\n6.         In Somdatta’s Kathasaritsagara, same-sex love is justified in the context\nof rebirth. Somaprabha falls in love with Princess Kalingasena and claims that\nshe loved her in her previous birth as well.5 Hindu mythology is replete with\nseveral such examples. We need not be detained in an effort to capture each of\n\n\n2\n  Navtej (Supra).\n3\n  Maqbool Fida Husain v. Rajkumar Pandey, 2008 Cri LJ 4107.\n4\n  Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai, Same-sex love in India: Readings from Literature &amp; History (Palgrave, 2001),\np. 15.\n\n5\n    Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai (Supra), p. 68.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                                            Page 3 of 17\n\fthem. The significant aspect is that same-sex unions were recognised in\nantiquity, not simply as unions that facilitate sexual activity, but as\nrelationships that foster love, emotional support, and mutual care.6\n\n7.      Even in the Sufi tradition, devotion is often constructed around the idea\nof love as expressed through music and poetry. In several instances, the human\nrelationship with the divine was expressed by mystics through the metaphor of\nsame-sex love.7 Love across genders is also reflected in the Rekhti tradition of\nLucknow. This tradition is centred around the practice of male poets writing in\na female voice and is characterised by its homoeroticism. Significantly, the\ndepictions of same-sex relationships are charged with affects such as love,\nfriendship, and companionship.8\n\n8.      Marriage as an institution developed historically and served various\nsocial functions. It was only later in its long history that it came to be legally\nrecognized and codified.9 However, these laws regulated only one type of\nsocio-historical union, i.e., the heterosexual union.\n\n9.      It would thus be misconceived to claim that non-heterosexual unions are\nonly a facet of the modern social milieu. The objective of penning down this\nsection is to provide perspective on the existence of non-heterosexual unions,\ndespite continued efforts towards their erasure by the heteronormative majority.\n6\n  Devdutt Pattnaik, The Man who was a Woman &amp; Other Queer Tales (Routledge, 2002).\n7\n  Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai (supra), p. 115.\n8\n  Manjari Shrivastava, Lesbianism in Nineteenth Century Erotic Urdu Poetry “Rekhti”, Proceedings of the Indian\nHistory Congress, 68, 965.\n9\n  Stephanie Coontz, Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage (Penguin, 2005), p. 3-5.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                                             Page 4 of 17\n\f10.        Non-heterosexual unions are entitled to protection under our\nConstitutional schema. In Maqbool Fida Husain, I had observed: “Our\nConstitution by way of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_681\">Article 19(1)</a> which provides for freedom of thought and\nexpression underpins a free and harmonious society. It helps to cultivate the\nvirtue of tolerance. It is said that the freedom of speech is the matrix, the\nindispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom. It is the\nwellspring of civilization and without it liberty of thought would shrivel.”10\n\n\nThe necessity of recognizing civil unions\n\n11.         The judgment of the Hon’ble Chief Justice notes that the right to form\nunions is a feature of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_682\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_683\">21</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, the\nprinciple of equality enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_684\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_685\">15</a> demands that this\nright be available to all, regardless of sexual orientation and gender. Having\nrecognized this right, this Court has taken on board the statement of the\nLearned Solicitor General to constitute a Committee to set out the scope of\nbenefits available to such unions. I agree with the Hon’ble Chief Justice.\n\n12.        The Petitioners’ submissions demand that the Special Marriage Act,\n187211 be tested on the touchstone of Part III of the Constitution, i.e., whether\nthey are discriminatory on the basis of sex and thus violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_686\">Articles 14</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_687\">15</a> of the Constitution. It is now settled law that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_688\">Article 14</a> contemplates a two-\npronged test: (i) whether the classification made by the SMA is based on\n10\n     Maqbool Fida Husain (supra).\n11\n     Hereinafter referred to as “the SMA”.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                     Page 5 of 17\n\fintelligible differentia; and (ii) whether the classification has a reasonable\nnexus to the objective sought to be achieved by the State.12 The first prong, i.e.,\nintelligible differentia implies that the differentia should be clear and not vague.\n<a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_689\">Section 4</a> of the SMA is clear in so far as it contemplates a marriage between a\nmale who has completed the age of twenty-one years and a female at the age\nof eighteen years. In defining the degrees of prohibited relationships, <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_690\">Section\n2(b)</a> of the SMA exclusively applies to a relationship between a man and a\nwoman. Thus, by explicitly referring to marriage in heterosexual relationships,\nthe SMA by implication creates two distinct and intelligible classes – i.e.,\nheterosexual partners who are eligible to marry and non-heterosexual partners\nwho are ineligible.\n\n13.        Under the second prong, the Court examines whether the classification is\nin pursuit of a State objective. The SMA’s Statement of Objects and Reasons\nassists us in determining the objective. It is reproduced hereunder:\n\n           “Statement of Objects and Reasons. —This Bill revises and seeks to\n           replace the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_691\">Special Marriage Act</a> of 1872 so as to provide a special form\n           of marriage which can be taken advantage of by any person in India and\n           by all Indian nationals in foreign countries irrespective of the faith which\n           either party to the marriage may profess. The parties may observe any\n           ceremonies for the solemnisation of their marriage, but certain\n           formalities are prescribed before the marriage can be registered by the\n           Marriage Officers. For the benefit of Indian citizens abroad, the Bill\n           provides for the appointment of Diplomatic and Consular Officers as\n           Marriage Officers for solemnising and registering marriages between\n           citizens, of India in a foreign country.\n12\n     D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, 1983 (2) SCR 165.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                         Page 6 of 17\n\f       2. Provision is also sought to be made for permitting persons who are\n       already married under other forms of marriage to register their\n       marriages under this Act and thereby avail themselves of these\n       provisions.\n\n       3. The bill is drafted generally on the lines of the existing <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_692\">Special\n       Marriage Act</a> of 1872 and the notes on clauses attached hereto explain\n       some of the changes made in the Bill in greater detail.” (Emphasis\n       supplied).\n\n14.    From the above, we see that the SMA postulates a ‘special form of\nmarriage’ available to any person in India irrespective of faith. Therefore, the\nSMA provides a secular framework for solemnization and registration of\nmarriage. Here, I respectfully disagree with my brother Justice Ravindra Bhat,\nthat the sole intention of the SMA was to enable marriage of heterosexual\ncouples exclusively. To my mind, the stated objective of the SMA was not to\nregulate marriages on the basis of sexual orientation. This cannot be so as it\nwould amount to conflating the differentia with the object of the statute.\nAlthough substantive provisions of the SMA confer benefits only on\nheterosexual relationships, this does not automatically reflect the object of the\nstatute. For as we are all aware, we often act in ways that do not necessarily\ncorrespond to our intent. Therefore, we cannot look at singular provisions to\ndetermine substantive intent of the statute. Doing so would be missing the\nwood for the trees.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                   Page 7 of 17\n\f15.        If the intent of the SMA is to facilitate inter-faith marriages, then there\nwould be no rational nexus with the classification it makes, i.e., excluding non-\nheterosexual relationships.\n\n16.        In any event, regulating only heterosexual marriages would not be a\nlegitimate State objective. It is settled law that the Court can also examine the\nnormative legitimacy and importance of the State objective,13 more so in a case\nsuch as this where sex (and thereby sexual orientation) is an ex-facie protected\ncategory under <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_693\">Article 15(1)</a> of the Constitution. An objective to exclude non-\nheterosexual relationships would be unconstitutional, especially after this Court\nin Navtej has elaborately proscribed discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation.14 Therefore, the SMA is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_694\">Article 14.</a>\n\n17.        However, I recognize that there are multifarious interpretive difficulties\nin reading down the SMA to include marriages between non-heterosexual\nrelationships. These have been enumerated in significant detail in the opinions\nof both the Hon’ble Chief Justice and Hon’ble Justice Bhat. I also agree that the\nentitlements devolving from marriage are spread out across a proverbial\n‘spider’s web’ of legislations and regulations. As rightly pointed out by the\nLearned Solicitor General, tinkering with the scope of marriage under the SMA\ncan have a cascading effect across these disparate laws.\n\n\n\n\n13\n     Deepak Sibal v. Punjab University, (1989) 2 SCC 145.\n14\n     (supra).\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                        Page 8 of 17\n\f18.    In fact, the presence of this web of statutes shows that discrimination\nunder the SMA is but one example of a larger, more deeper form of social\ndiscrimination against non-heterosexual people that is pervasive and structural\nin nature. Ordinarily, such an intensive form of discrimination should require\nkeener and more intensive judicial scrutiny. However, due to limited\ninstitutional capacity, this Court does not possess an adequate form of remedy\nto address such a violation. As pointed out in the judgment of Hon’ble the\nChief Justice, substantially reading into the statute is beyond the powers of\njudicial review and would be under the legislative domain. It would also not be\nprudent to suspend or strike down the SMA, given that it is a beneficial\nlegislation and is regularly and routinely used by heterosexual partners desirous\nof getting married. For this reason, this particular methodology of recognizing\nthe right of non-heterosexual partners to enter into a civil union, as opposed to\nstriking down provisions of the SMA, ought to be considered as necessarily\nexceptional in nature. It should not restrict the Courts while assessing such\ndeep-seated forms of discrimination in the future.\n\n19.    Non-heterosexual unions and heterosexual unions/marriages ought to be\nconsidered as two sides of the same coin, both in terms of recognition and\nconsequential benefits. The only deficiency at present is the absence of a\nsuitable regulatory framework for such unions. This Court in Navtej noted that:\n“history owes an apology to the members of this community and their families,\nfor the delay in providing redressal for the ignominy and ostracism that they\nhave suffered through the centuries.” I believe that this moment presents an\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                   Page 9 of 17\n\fopportunity of reckoning with this historical injustice and casts a collective\nduty upon all constitutional institutions to take affirmative steps to remedy the\ndiscrimination.\n\n20.    Thus, the next step in due course, would be to create an edifice of\ngovernance that would give meaningful realization to the right to enter into a\nunion, whether termed as marriage or a union.\n\nCharting a course: Interpreting statutes using Constitutional principles\n21.    As noted above, the benefits pertaining to marriage are spread out across\nseveral incidental legislations and regulations. These statutes presently do not\nexplicitly extend to civil unions. However, now that we have recognized the\nright to enter into civil unions; such statutes must be read in a manner to give\neffect to this right, together with the principle of equality and non-\ndiscrimination under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_695\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_696\">15.</a> In other words, statutory interpretation\nmust be in consonance with constitutional principles that are enumerated by\nthis Court. Needless to say, this should not detract from the Committee’s task\nof ironing out the nitty-gritties of the entitlements of civil unions.\n\n22.    This exercise is necessary to foster greater coherence within the legal\nsystem as a whole, both inter se statutes and between statutes and the\nConstitution. Reading statutes in this manner will facilitate ‘inter-\nconnectedness’ by allowing constitutional values to link statutes within the\nlarger legal system. Constitutional values emanate from a living document and\nthus are constantly evolving. Applying constitutional values to interpret statutes\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                     Page 10 of 17\n\fhelps update statutes over time to reflect changes since the statute’s enactment.\nOrdinarily, constitutional principles come in contact with statutes when the\nvalidity of such statutes is being tested. However, constitutional values should\nplay a more consistent role, which can be through the everyday task of\nstatutory interpretation.15\n\n\n23.        This interpretive technique has gained currency across jurisdictions. In\nthe famous Lüth case, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany recognized\nthat the constitutional right of freedom of expression as enumerated under the\nGerman Basic Law also ‘radiates’ into the statutory law of defamation. The\nCourt noted that:\n\n           “But far from being a value-free system the Constitution erects an\n           objective system of values in its section on basic rights, and thus\n           expresses and reinforces the validity of the basic rights. This system of\n           values, centring on the freedom of the human being to develop in society,\n           must apply as a constitutional axiom throughout the whole legal system:\n           it must direct and inform legislation, administration, and judicial\n           decision.”16\n\n24.        We may note that the Constitution of South Africa has an explicit\nprovision which directs that the interpretation of statutory law shall be in ‘due\nregard to the spirit, purport and objects’ of the chapter on fundamental rights. 17\n\n\n\n15\n     William N. Eskridge, Public Values in Statutory Interpretation, 137(4) UPenn Law Rev. 1007, 1009.\n\n16\n     BVerfGE 7, 198 (Lüth-decision).\n17\n     <a href=\"/doc/1164454/\" id=\"a_697\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                                              Page 11 of 17\n\fThe Constitutional Court of South Africa in Du Plessis v. De Klerk succinctly\nobserved the objective and scope of this provision:\n\n           “The common law is not to be trapped within the limitations of its past. It\n           needs not to be interpreted in conditions of social and constitutional\n           ossification. It needs to be revisited and revitalized with the spirit of the\n           constitutional values defined in Chapter 3 of the Constitution and with\n           full regard to the purport and objects of that Chapter.”18\n\n25.        Although no such provision exists in the Indian Constitution, our Courts\nare no stranger to interpreting statutory laws through fundamental rights.\nIn Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. v Brojo Nath Ganguly, the Supreme\nCourt was concerned with the interpretation of ‘public policy’ under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_698\">Section 23</a>\nof the Indian Contract Act, 1872.19 In this context, this Court observed:\n\n           “It is thus clear that the principles governing public policy must be and\n           are capable, on proper occasion, of expansion or modification. Practices\n           which were considered perfectly normal at one time have today become\n           obnoxious and oppressive to public conscience. If there is no head of\n           public policy which covers a case, then the court must in consonance\n           with public conscience and in keeping with public good and public\n           interest declare such practice to be opposed to public policy. Above all,\n           in deciding any case which may not be covered by authority our courts\n           have before them the beacon light of the Preamble to the Constitution.\n           Lacking precedent, the court can always be guided by that light and the\n           principles underlying the Fundamental Rights and the Directive\n           Principles enshrined in our Constitution.”\n\n\n18\n     1996 (3) SA 850.\n19\n     (1986) 3 SCC 156.\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                         Page 12 of 17\n\f26.    This technique of reading in Constitutional values should be used\nharmoniously with other canons of statutory interpretation. In this context,\nlegislations that confer benefits on the basis of marriage should be construed to\ninclude civil unions as well, where applicable.\n\nThe need for an anti-discrimination law\n27.    I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the opinion of the Hon’ble Chief\nJustice that there is a need for a separate anti-discrimination law which inter\nalia prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Presently, there\nare several laws that have an anti-discrimination aspect to them. However, they\nare fragmented and may fail to capture the multitudinous forms of\ndiscrimination. Another compelling reason for a law that places a horizontal\nduty of anti-discrimination is provided by the spirit of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_699\">Article 15</a>, which\nprohibits discrimination by both the State and private actors. Presently,\nalthough the Court assumes its role as the ‘sentinel on the qui vive’, the only\nmethod to enforce this Constitutional right under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_700\">Article 15</a> would be through\nits writ jurisdiction. There are significant challenges for marginalized\ncommunities to access this remedy. Therefore, the proliferation of remedies\nthrough an anti-discrimination statute can be a fitting solution. Such legislation\nwould also be in furtherance of the positive duty of the State to secure social\norder and to promote justice and social welfare under <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_701\">Article 38</a> of the\nConstitution.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                   Page 13 of 17\n\f28.     My suggestions for an anti-discrimination law are as follows. First, such\na law should recognize discrimination in an intersectional manner. That is to\nsay, in assessing any instance of discrimination, the Court cannot confine itself\nto a singular form of discrimination. Instead, discrimination must be looked at\nas a confluence of factors – as identities and individual instances of oppression\nthat ‘intersect’ and create a distinct form of disadvantage.20 Discrimination\nlaws can only be effective if they address the types of inequality that have\ndeveloped in the given society. This principle has already been recognized by\nthis Court in Navtej.21 Second, the duties under an anti-discrimination law can\nbe proportionately distributed between different actors depending on factors\nsuch as the nature of functions discharged, their control over access to basic\nresources, and the impact on their negative liberty.22 Third, an anti-\ndiscrimination statute must also enumerate methods to redress existing\ndiscrimination and bridge the advantage gap. This could be through policies\nthat distribute benefits to disadvantaged groups.23\n\n\nEqual rights to equal love\n\n29.     The principle of equality mandates that non-heterosexual unions are not\nexcluded from the mainstream socio-political framework. However, the next\nstep would be to examine the framework itself, which cannot be said to be\n\n\n20\n   Shreya Atrey, Intersectional discrimination (Oxford University Press, 2019), p. 41.\n21\n   (supra).\n22\n   Tarunabh Khaitan, A Theory of Discrimination Law (Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 212-213.\n23\n   Khaitan (supra), p. 39.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                                           Page 14 of 17\n\fneutral. On the contrary, it is inherently value-laden. One particularly\npernicious value is patriarchy, which manifests in various oppressive ways.\nGendered stereotypes and sex-based violence are lived realities of many. This\nis something both society and law recognize.\n\n30.     I believe that the legal recognition of non-heterosexual unions can\nchallenge culturally ordained gender roles even in heterosexual relationships.\nFor a long period of time, marriage has been viewed in gendered terms. That is\nto say, one’s status as husband or wife determines their duties and obligations\ntowards each other, their family, and society. Marriage enforces and reinforces\nthe linkage of gender with power by husband/wife categories, which are\nsynonymous with social power imbalances between men and women. 24 This is\nnotwithstanding the fact that there has been progressive awareness of these\nissues. Non-heterosexual unions can make an important contribution towards\ndismantling this imbalance while emphasizing alternative norms. As Eskridge\nputs it: “In a man-man marriage where tasks are divided up along traditional\nlines, a man will be doing the accustomed female role of keeping house. It is\nthis symbolism that represents the deeper challenge to traditional gender roles.\nThe symbolism can be expressed in the argot of normalization. Once female-\nfemale and male-male couples can marry, the wife-housekeeper/husband-\nbreadwinner model for the family would immediately become less normal, and\nperhaps even abnormal over time. The wife as someone who derives\n\n\n24\n  Nan. D. Hunter, ‘Marriage, Law and Gender: A Feminist Inquiry’ in Sex Wars: Sexual Dissent and Political\nCulture (Lisa Duggan and Nan. D. Hunter eds, Routledge, 2006) p. 109 – 110.\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.1011/2022                                                                        Page 15 of 17\n\findependent satisfaction from her job outside the home would immediately\nbecome a little bit more normal.”25\n\n31.     In a non-heterosexual union, duties and obligations are not primarily\ndictated by culturally ordained gender norms. In other words, both partners are\nnot limited by extant gender norms to shape their relationship, including the\ndivision of labour. For instance, studies have found that partners in non-\nheterosexual relationships share unpaid labour more equally than those in\nheterosexual relationships.26 This is not to suggest that other imbalances of\npower do not exist within non-heterosexual unions. Nevertheless, non-\nheterosexual unions are not limited by the legally and socially sanctioned\ngendered power dynamic that can be present in heterosexual unions.27\n\n32.     Legal recognition aids social acceptance, which in turn increases queer\nparticipation in public spaces. Through the medium of legal recognition, queer\npersons will have a greater opportunity to be ‘seen’ and ‘heard’ in ways not\npreviously possible. Queer expression will help facilitate an expansive social\ndialogue, cutting across communities and generations. This dialogue will help\nus reimagine all our relationships in a manner that emphasizes values such as\nmutual respect, companionship, and empathy.\n\n25\n   William Eskridge, Equality Practice: Civil Unions and the Future of Gay Rights, (Routledge, 2002) p. 322.\n26\n   Abbie E.

Is this the end where we have arrived? The answer must be an emphatic\n‘no’. Legal recognition of non-heterosexual unions represents a step forward\ntowards marriage equality. At the same time, marriage is not an end in itself.\nOur Constitution contemplates a holistic understanding of equality, which\napplies to all spheres of life. The practice of equality necessitates acceptance\nand protection of individual choices.

At the centre of the dispute, lies the definition and the content of two\nwilling individuals’ right to marry. On the one hand the petitioners assert that\nmarriage is an evolving social institution, capable of embracing the union of two\nwilling non-heterosexual, queer or LGBTQ+ (used interchangeably) individuals\nand necessitating state recognition; on the other, the respondents assert that the\ninstitution of marriage rests on certain constant and unchanging premises, the\nmost prominent of which is that it is a heterosexual union. The task of this Court\nlies in determining how the Constitution speaks on the issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">2.           Having had the benefit of reading the draft and revised opinions circulated\nby the learned Chief Justice, Dr. Chandrachud, we find it necessary to pen our\nreasoning and conclusions in this separate judgment. The learned Chief Justice\nhas recorded in detail the submissions made by counsel, and claims made; they\nconsequently do not require reiteration. Similarly, the sections addressing the\nUnion Government’s preliminary objections – i.e., the discussion on the court’s\nauthority to hear the case [Section D(i)], and that queerness is a natural\nphenomenon that is neither urban or elite [Section D(ii)], are parts we have no\nhesitation in agreeing with. However, we do not agree with the conclusions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                         4</span>\n\n\narrived at by the learned Chief Justice and the directions issued. We do agree with\ncertain premises and conclusions that he has recorded – they are: (a) that there\nexists no fundamental right to marry under the Constitution; (b) that the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_702\">Special\nMarriage Act, 1956</a> (hereafter “SMA”), is neither unconstitutional nor can it be\ninterpreted in such a manner so as to enable marriage between queer persons; and\nthat (c) transgender persons in heterosexual relationships, have the right to\nsolemnize marriage under existing legal frameworks. We have briefly highlighted\nour main points of agreement, and reasoned in more detail those aspects with\nwhich, respectfully, we cannot persuade ourselves to concur. We had the benefit\nof perusing the concurring opinion of Narasimha, J. We endorse those\nobservations and conclusions fully; the reasoning and conclusions shall be read\nas supplementing that of the present judgment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">3.      The common ground on which the batch of petitions claim relief is that\nLGBTQ+ persons are entitled to solemnize and register their marriage – in other\nwords, they claim a right to legal recognition of their unions within the marriage\nfold.    The petitioners rely on fundamental rights to equality and non-\ndiscrimination, of dignity and autonomy and of expression and association, and\nspecifically, most petitioners focus on <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_703\">Section 4(c)</a> of the SMA as well as the first\nand second schedules thereof, to state that particular references to “husband” or\n“wife” in its provisions are to be read “down”, and a neutral expression needs to\nsubstituted, instead. A few petitioners also claims that <a href=\"/doc/957667/\" id=\"a_704\">Section 4(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/33743814/\" id=\"a_705\">17</a> of the\nForeign Marriage Act, 1969 (hereafter “FMA”) need to be similarly read down.\nSome of the prayers also relate to the right of such couples to adopt under existing\nlaws in India. Some of the prayers specifically challenged Chapter II of the SMA–\nrelating to notice and objections procedure prescribed. However, during the\ncourse of hearing, the court indicated that this was not a question of law that\nnecessitated a 5 judge-bench ruling, and hence this issue was to be left for\nconsideration by a numerically smaller bench.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                          5</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"> I.   Nature of marriage as a social institution\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">4.    Marriage, as a social institution predates all rights, forms of political\nthought and laws. The institution of family has no known origin in the sense that,\nthere has been no stage of human existence, in which family was absent leading\nto another time in which it emerged. Marriage, however, has been regarded - for\nthe longest time, as a relationship of man to woman which is recognized by\ncustom, and thereafter law; it involves certain rights and duties in the case of both\npersons entering the union. It is considered to be one of the most important\nrelationships, as it is not solely the individuals’ happiness and well-being but that\nof others too, that is affected by their conduct in it. It has long been regarded as\nthe reason for society’s continuance on the one hand, and its building block on\nthe other. What is marriage and the conceptualisation of its role in society, has\nundergone change over the time; it has engaged the attention of philosophers,\nfrom Plato to Hegel, Kant and John Stuart Mill and of religious leaders, like St.\nAugustine.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">5.    Different traditions view marriage as sacraments, and indissoluble unions\n(Hindus and Catholic Christians); Islam regards marriage as both contractual and\nsacred; Parsis regard it as both a sacrament and contractual. Most – if not all,\nplace importance on procreation, creation of family, co-habitation, shared values\nas the important markers; at the same time, these traditions also recognize - in\nvarying degrees, importance of companionship, spiritual union, friendship and\ntogetherness of the spouses, in every way.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.    The respondents are right, in one sense in underlining that all conceptions\nof what constitutes marriage, all traditions and societies, have by and large,\nhistorically understood marriage as between heterosexual couples. The contexts\nof culture, social understanding of what constitutes marriage, in every social order\nare undoubtedly very important. At the same time, for the purpose of determining\nthe claims in these petitions, it is also necessary to mark the progression of what\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                         6</span>\n\n\nwere deemed constitutive and essential constituents, and essential boundaries\nwithin which marriages were accepted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.    Marriages have not always been dictated by voluntary choice. In medieval\nEuropean societies, when a girl was physically able to consummate marriage, she\nwas eligible for matrimony. Among the nobility and landed gentry, the principal\nconsideration for marriage was exchange of property- in the form of dowry. Thus,\nit was not uncommon that among the “upper classes” marriages were loveless and\nunhappy. The sole reason for marriage was touted to be procreation, which the\nchurch dictated; thus, consummation of marriage and physical sexual relations\nwere considered the most important features of every marriage, since this meant\nthe establishment of family. Among Hindus, barriers of other kinds, such as ban\non sagotra and sapinda marriages, and impermissibility of non-endogamous\nmarriages, was widely prevalent, for the longest time. Although amongst\nMuslims, marriage is both sacramental and contractual, and requires exercise of\nfree will, nevertheless, it is premised on the agreement of mehar, or the amount\nthe groom would offer, for the bride. Muslim are permitted to marry others of the\nsame faith, or from the “People of the Book” (known as Kitabiyas), such as Jews,\nSabians and Christians. No marriage with polytheists is permitted. Similarly,\nwidow re-marriage amongst Hindus was prohibited. Likewise, injunctions\nagainst inter-caste marriages were widely prevalent. Child marriages were widely\nprevalent too. Inter-religious marriages were impossible. In the USA, various\nlaws had, in the past, prohibited interracial marriages. Arranged marriages were\nvery common throughout the world until the 18th century.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">8.    It is, therefore, evident that for long periods, in many societies, the choice\nof a matrimonial partner was not free; it was bounded by social constraints. Much\nof the time, marriage was seen as an institution meant for procreation, and sexual\nunion of the spouses. In most societies marriage had cast “roles” for the spouses;\nthey were fairly inflexible, with men controlling most decisions, and women\nplaced in subordinate positions, with little or no voice, and, for the longest time,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                         7</span>\n\n\nno legal authority, autonomy or agency. For millennia, custom, tradition, and law\nsubordinated wives to husbands. Notions of equality of partners or their roles,\nwere uncommon, if not totally unheard of. All these underwent radical change.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">9.    The greater part of history shows that choice of a spouse, based on love or\nchoice played almost no role at all. Enlightenment, and Western thinkers of the\neighteenth century established that pursuit of happiness was important to life.\nThey advocated marrying for love, instead of status, or wealth or other\nconsiderations. The Industrial Revolution gave impetus to this thought. Marriages\nwere solemnized and celebrated with increasing frequency, in Western cultures,\nbased on choice, voluntary consent, and without parental approval. This\nmovement increased tremendously - as women&#x27;s-rights movement expanded and\ngained impetus in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, wives started being\nregarded as their husbands&#x27; equals, not their property. Couples were also enabled\nto choose whether to have, and if so, how many children to have. If they were\nunhappy with each other, they could divorce - a choice exercised by a large\nnumber of couples. Marriage became primarily a personal contract between two\nequals seeking love, stability, and happiness. Therefore, although social mores\nprevailed in relation to marriage, traditions and legal regimes were not static; the\nchanges that society underwent or the forces that brought change, also carried\nwinds that breathed new content, new contexts and new values, into the institution\nof marriage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">10.   Law’s progress stresses upon individual’s rights for equality. The form of\nmarriage, or the legally prescribed procedures assume a secondary role - they are\nmatters of belief and practice. They cannot be regarded as the essential content of\nmarriage. Tying thali is necessary in South India among many Hindu\ncommunities; and in some parts the exchange of rings, garlands and some rituals\nis necessary in North India. Many Hindu marriage customs and traditions insist\non the saptapadi; amongst Muslims, the nikah ceremony, witnessed by invitees,\nand other customary rituals and practices, is generally followed; Christian\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                          8</span>\n\n\ncustoms emphasize on solemnization by the couples taking marriage vows. The\nrich diversity of this country and its pluralism is reflected in customary practices\nsurrounding marriage solemnization, all – if not most of which involve the\ncouple, the members of their family, and the larger community. Ritualistic\ncelebration of marriage is considered by some as essential, while many in other\nsections may deem that the factum of marriage sufficient. For relationships that\ndid not have customary practice dating back in history, the State enacted law –\nmuch like the petitioners, seek.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">11.   Therefore, legislations governing inter-caste and inter faith marriages, and\nadoption, are two important social relations relating to the family, through which\nsecularism finds its base for an egalitarian social order under the Constitution.\nThe enactment of laws to facilitate this aspect is testimony of the right of\nindividuals to personal choice and autonomy. For instance, enactment of the\nHindu Marriage (Removal of Disabilities) Act, 1946 enabled persons from the\nsame gotra or pravara to marry. Likewise, the bar to Hindu widows’ remarriage,\nwas removed by enacting the <a href=\"/doc/144532805/\" id=\"a_706\">Hindu Widows Remarriage Act, 1856</a>. Inter-caste\nand inter-faith marriages became a possibility under the SMA after 1954.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">12.   The ‘legal’ dimension of marriage, in the US – the jurisprudence of which\nthe petitioners relied on, is markedly different from the nature of marriage in\nIndia, and its evolution. This contextual difference, is of great relevance, when\nconsidering a constitutional question of this kind. Marriage in countries like the\nUS, was earlier a sacramental institution that flowed from the Church and its\ndivine authority. However, in modern times, it flows from the State; which created\na ‘license regime’ for marriage. The result is that marriages may be performed\nand celebrated with religious traditions or rituals, that have great meaning\npersonally for the individuals – but the legality of the marriage, is solely\ndependent on a validly obtained license. This regime has since been extended to\nqueer couples as well in the US. The law relating to marriage in India, however,\nhas had a different trajectory. A deeply religious affair, it gained its legitimacy and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                         9</span>\n\n\nlegal status from personal law and customs, that govern this aspect of life – for\nmembers belonging to all faiths. The matrimonial laws that have been enacted–\nwere a result of the codification project (in the 19th and 20th century), which\nexpressly recognise these social practices, while continuing to offer space to\nunwritten customary practices as well (barring aspects like marriageable age, etc.\nwhich are regulated by law). As mentioned, the SMA is the only avenue for a\nform of secular/non-religious ‘civil marriage’ – which too still ties into personal\nlaw for succession, and other aspects. The Indian context, is elaborated in the\nfollowing Part II.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">II.   State interest in regulating social practices, through legislation\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">13.   Before undertaking a study on whether there is a fundamental right to\nmarry, and an obligation on the State to create such an avenue, it is necessary to\ntraverse the brief history of state intervention in social practices including in\nrelation to marriage. These laws were enacted in relation to different subject\nareas. However, a pattern certainly emerges, on the limited scope of interference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">14.   The social practices resulting in stigma and exclusion of large sections of\nsociety, impelled the Constitution framers to frame specific provisions like <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_707\">Article\n15(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_708\">(2)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_709\">Articles 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_710\">, 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_711\">24</a>, which was left to the Parliament to flesh out\nthrough specific legislation. This resulted in statutes such as the <a href=\"/doc/3026506/\" id=\"a_712\">Protection of\nCivil Rights Act, 1955</a>, <a href=\"/doc/25085007/\" id=\"a_713\">Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention\nof Atrocities) Act, 1989</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1189857/\" id=\"a_714\">Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976</a>, <a href=\"/doc/69064674/\" id=\"a_715\">Immoral\nTraffic (Prevention) Act, 1956</a>, the Prohibition of Employment as Manual\nScavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, and their respective amendments.\nThe laws removing barriers which prevented large sections of society from\nentering into temples and places of public worship, is another example.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">15.   In a somewhat similar vein, legislative activity, as aimed at bringing about\ngender parity through prohibiting prevailing practices that further inequality and\nsometimes even criminalizing certain customs, resulted in legislations such as the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                         10</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1399782/\" id=\"a_716\">Equal Remuneration Act, 1976</a> (which guaranteed equal pay for equal work\nregardless of the sex of the worker), the <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_717\">Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961</a> as amended\nsubsequently, introduction of provisions in criminal law which gave teeth to such\nprovisions [<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_718\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_719\">304B</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_720\">IPC</a>”), and\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_721\">Section 113A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_722\">113B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 which enabled courts to raise\npresumptions in the trial of such offences].\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">16.   Other practices aimed at realization of social goals and furthering the\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_723\">Article 15(3)</a> in respect of children such as the right to free universal\neducation under <a href=\"/doc/154644006/\" id=\"a_724\">Article 21A</a> of the Constitution, and the Right to Free Education\nAct, 2009; <a href=\"/doc/732057/\" id=\"a_725\">The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986</a>; <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_726\">Protection\nof Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012</a>, the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_727\">Juvenile Justice (Care and\nProtection) Act</a> 2016 (hereafter, “<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_728\">JJ Act</a>”), etc. In all these, the Parliament or the\nconcerned legislatures donned the role of reformers, and furthered the express\nprovisions of the Constitution, enjoining State action, in furtherance of <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_729\">Articles\n15(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_730\">, 15(3)</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_731\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_732\">, 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_733\">24.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">17.   Marriage has historically been a union solemnized as per customs, or\npersonal law tracing its origin to religious texts. Legislative activity, in the\npersonal law field, so far has been largely, though not wholly, to codify prevailing\ncustoms and traditions, and regulating them, only where needed. The instances\nthat stand out, are the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/1450343/\" id=\"a_734\">Indian Succession Act, 1925</a>, Hindu\nWomen’s Right to Property Act, 1937, <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_735\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>, the <a href=\"/doc/946025/\" id=\"a_736\">Hindu\nAdoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956</a>, the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_737\">Hindu Succession Act, 1956</a>, the\n<a href=\"/doc/76168618/\" id=\"a_738\">Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956</a>, the <a href=\"/doc/806295/\" id=\"a_739\">Indian Divorce Act, 1869</a> (as\namended in 2001), the <a href=\"/doc/1325952/\" id=\"a_740\">Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937</a>;\nand the <a href=\"/doc/125344553/\" id=\"a_741\">Anand Marriage Act, 1909</a> (as amended). These laws mostly codified\ntraditions and customs, which existed, and to an extent, regulated marriages and\nsuccession laws. These laws also sought to introduce reforms: for the first time,\nmonogamy was enacted as a norm applicable to all Hindus; likewise, the option\nof divorce was enacted, together with grounds on which or other remedies (like\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                         11</span>\n\n\njudicial separation) could be sought. Further, the minimum age of marriage was\nalso enacted, through provisions in various personal laws, and enforced through\nthe <a href=\"/doc/790355/\" id=\"a_742\">Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006</a> (which repealed the pre-existing\n<a href=\"/doc/323064/\" id=\"a_743\">Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929</a>) – this law applies to all sections of societies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">18.      Existing conditions of women, especially in respect of issues such as\nmaintenance, were considered inadequate even before the Constitution was\nbrought into force. The earliest reform introduced was through the Bengal Sati\nRegulation, 18291 (by the colonial rulers). This was later followed by the <a href=\"/doc/144532805/\" id=\"a_744\">Hindu\nWidow Remarriage Act, 1856</a> which enabled re-marriage of Hindu widows.\nThese enactments pre-date the Constitution, and can be seen as reforms, meant to\noutlaw abhorrent practices viewed as evil, and needing prohibition, to protect\nwomen’s lives; in the case of widow remarriage, it was to enable child and young\nwidows an opportunity to lead lives. Given the diversity of Hindu traditions and\nthe differing approaches in various schools of law, which prevailed in different\nparts of the country, it was considered necessary to enact the Hindu Women’s\nRight to Property Act, 19372 (later with the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_745\">Hindu Succession\nAct, 1956</a>, some rights were expanded through its provisions3). For a long time,\ndaughters were treated unequally in regard to succession to the estate of their\ndeceased father; this changed with the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_746\">Hindu Succession\nAmendment Act, 2005</a>, and the substitution of <a href=\"/doc/1089523/\" id=\"a_747\">Section 6</a>, daughters (who were\nhitherto excluded from succession to any coparcenary properties) became entitled\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">1</span>\n  Regulation XVII, A.

Unlike previously, where the property was divided\namong the surviving coparceners by the doctrine of survivorship, now it was the widow who had the sole right to\nsuch property. However, she only had limited rights (popularly called &quot;limited estate&quot;) over such property, which\nremained with her till her death.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">3</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">  After the coming of the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_749\">Hindu Succession Act, 1956</a>, any property held by a Hindu female, whether before or\nafter the commencement of that Act and which does not fall under the exception of 14(2), is held by her in an\nunrestricted and absolute manner. The word &quot;possessed&quot; as incorporated in <a href=\"/doc/1102654/\" id=\"a_750\">section 14</a> was further held by various\njudgements of this court to include any kind of remote possession, be it constructive, physical, or even a right to\npossess. The result of the incorporation of this section led to a situation whereby all the limited rights given to a\nfemale Hindu under the 1937 Act became absolute by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1871141/\" id=\"a_751\">section 14(1)</a> of the Hindu Succession Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                         12</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">to claim the share that a son was entitled to, in the case of death of a coparcener\nin relation to ancestral property.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"823221\" id=\"span_14\">19.

All married women and\nchildren of their marriage, regardless of their religious or social backgrounds,\nwere enabled to claim maintenance, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_753\">Section 488</a> of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, 1898. This provision was re-enacted, and progressively\namended through <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_754\">section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. This\ncourt, in its five-judge decision in <a href=\"/doc/823221/\" id=\"a_755\">Mohd. Ahmad Khan v. Shah Bano Begum</a>\n(hereafter, “Shah Bano”)4 upheld the right of Muslim women, including divorced\nMuslim women to claim maintenance.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"823221\" id=\"span_15\">However, soon after that decision,\nParliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/1933289/\" id=\"a_756\">Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act,\n1986</a>, which diluted the ruling in <a href=\"/doc/823221/\" id=\"a_757\">Shah Bano</a> (supra) and restricted the right of\nMuslim divorcées to alimony from their former husbands for only 90 days after\nthe divorce (the period of iddat in Islamic law).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"410660\" id=\"span_16\">The restriction imposed was\nhowever interpreted narrowly, and this court through a Constitution Bench, in\n<a href=\"/doc/410660/\" id=\"a_758\">Danial Latifi v.

It would extend to the whole life of the divorced wife unless she\ngets married for a second time”.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">20.       The Age of Consent Act in 1891, raised the age of marriage from 10 to 12\nyears. <a href=\"/doc/323064/\" id=\"a_759\">The Child Marriage Restraint Act</a> of 1929 addressed this by prescribing the\nminimum age of marriage for females to 14 years and for boys to 18 years. <a href=\"/doc/323064/\" id=\"a_760\">The\nChild Marriage Restraint Act</a> of 1929 (also known as the Sarda Act), was enacted\nas a result of prolonged pressure from social reform organisations and concerned\npeople who fought against the negative repercussions of child marriage.

The practise of marrying off children young, which prevailed\nbefore these enactments, was thus, interdicted by legislation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">21.      Similarly, even while exercising personal choice in marriage, these choices\nare regulated by law – prohibition of marriage of persons related by blood\n(consanguineous marriages)6. Other restrictions such as the requirement to be of\n“sound mind” to give valid consent or not to be “unfit for marriage and the\nprocreation of children”.7 If a spouse is “incurably of unsound mind” or on the\nground of unsoundness, the other spouse can secure divorce8. Bigamy among\nHindus was abolished by enactment of the HMA, in 1955. Reform has been the\nunderlying theme, impelling the state to intervene. The legislative trajectory, and\nindeed some of the debates that preceded enactment of measures like monogamy\nand divorce, showed a division of opinion. The first President, Rajendra Prasad,\nexpressed strong sentiments against adopting such “foreign” concepts which were\nopposed to Hindu society. There were other voices, most prominently, women in\npublic life, who supported the need to empower women.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">22.      It can thus, be seen that two kinds of legislations have regulated marriage:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">the first, like SMA, HMA, the Hindu Disabilities Removal Act, and the Hindu\nWidows Remarriage Act, removed barriers, and enabled exercise of meaningful\nchoice, specifically to women. The second kind of legislation are those which\nenacted restrictive regulations, essentially to further an orderly society and/or\nprotect women: prohibit bigamy; define minimum age for marriage; child\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">6</span>\n  Defined as “prohibited degrees” under <a href=\"/doc/1003029/\" id=\"a_762\">Section 3 (g)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 - which is not confined to\na bar against marriages related by blood, but also through non-biological ties, such as widow of brother, son’s\nwidow; mother in law, etc; <a href=\"/doc/1166796/\" id=\"a_763\">Section 3 (1) (a)</a> of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936; <a href=\"/doc/1852078/\" id=\"a_764\">Section 19</a>, Indian\nDivorce Act, 1869; <a href=\"/doc/1403877/\" id=\"a_765\">Section 88</a>, Indian Christian Marriages Act, 1872. Among Muslims, the concept of\nconsanguinity is known as qurabat, i.e. blood relationships such as marrying one’s relatives like mother,\ngrandmother, sister, aunt, niece, etc. Other grounds (affinity or mushaarat) are also prohibited relationships, i.e.\nmarriage with mother in law, daughter in law, step grandmother; step granddaughter, fosterage when a child under\nthe age of two years has been fed by a woman other than his mother, or when the woman becomes his foster\nmother, a man cannot marry his foster mother or her daughter, i.e. foster sister.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">7</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">  <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_766\">Section 5 (i) (ii) (iii)</a>, HMA [<a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_767\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>]\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">8</span>\n  <a href=\"/doc/834932/\" id=\"a_768\">Section 13</a> HMA; <a href=\"/doc/1541174/\" id=\"a_769\">Section 32 (b)</a> and (bb) <a href=\"/doc/122564/\" id=\"a_770\">Parsi Marriage Act, 1936</a>; <a href=\"/doc/41930718/\" id=\"a_771\">Section 10 (1) (iii)</a> Indian Divorce Act,\n1869; under <a href=\"/doc/127672/\" id=\"a_772\">Section 2 (v)</a> of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                                         14</span>\n\n\nmarriage restraint; marriage of individuals within prohibited degrees of\nrelationships, etc. Whereas some restrictions, in a sense codified and recognized\nexisting customs – such as by enacting prohibited degrees of relationships, rule\nagainst insanity, rules enabling declaration of nullity or divorce on ground of\nimpotence, etc., - others were meant to further interests of women and children\nand also enable exercise of choice.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">23.      Such reforming and codification, however, did not cover the entire field.\nFor instance, in the field of succession and inheritance, the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_773\">Hindu Succession Act,\n1956</a> only enacts certain broad features, leaving untouched the rights of various\ncommunities and sections of Hindus, to work out their rights in succession to joint\nfamily, Hindu Undivided Family and coparcenary property- and this unwritten,\nuncodified law, (in many cases based on customs and local traditions) is enforced\nnot only in regard to inheritance, but also in the field of taxation. Likewise, the\nlaw accommodates and accords primacy to custom [e.g., <a href=\"/doc/373978/\" id=\"a_774\">Section 2 (d)</a> which\nstates that persons other than Hindus- including Jews, Muslims and Christians\nwho may be following Hindu customs, would continue to do so9; <a href=\"/doc/1510082/\" id=\"a_775\">Section 7</a> which\nspells out the ceremonies of Hindu marriage, also states that they shall be based\non “customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto”; and similarly,\ncustomary divorce amongst Hindus is accorded primacy, by <a href=\"/doc/227439/\" id=\"a_776\">Section 29 (2)</a><a href=\"/doc/1273949/\" id=\"a_777\">10</a>].\nNeither the Hindu Marriage Act, nor the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_778\">Hindu Succession Act</a>, apply to members\nof the Scheduled Tribe communities; the <a href=\"/doc/946025/\" id=\"a_779\">Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act</a>,\napplies to them in a nuanced manner.11 The Hindu Minority and Guardianship\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">9</span>\n   <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_780\">Section 2</a> which says that the Act does not apply to “(c) to any other person domiciled in the territories to which\nthis Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion, unless it is proved that any such person\nwould not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any\nof the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">10</span>\n   “29… (2) Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect any right recognised by custom or conferred\nby any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of a Hindu marriage, whether solemnized before or after the\ncommencement of this Act.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">11</span>\n   <a href=\"/doc/1711172/\" id=\"a_781\">Section 2 (2)</a>, Hindu Marriage Act, and Hindu Succession Act, are identically worded, and state that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">“(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the\nmembers of any Scheduled tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of <a href=\"/doc/294137/\" id=\"a_782\">article 366</a> of the Constitution unless the\nCentral Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs.”\n\n<a href=\"/doc/946025/\" id=\"a_783\">The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956</a> is worded differently, and covers, inter alia,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                        15</span>\n\n\nAct, 1956, on the other hand, has a provision similar to the one under the Hindu\nMinority and Maintenance Act as well as one which excludes members of the\nscheduled tribe communities12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78213502\" id=\"span_28\">In the latest three judge bench decision of this\ncourt, in <a href=\"/doc/78213502/\" id=\"a_784\">Revanasiddappa v.

The latter, i.e., the provision enabling adoption was preceded by\ncertain guidelines which facilitated inter-country adoptions. These guidelines,\ninitially pioneered in the judgment of this court in <a href=\"/doc/551554/\" id=\"a_794\">Laxmi Kant Pandey v. UOI16</a> -\nwere accepted. Executive instructions filled in the vacuum to some extent\nassimilating the guidelines of the court but at the same time the limitation in law\nthat prevented adoption of children from different faiths and backgrounds,\npersisted. These limitations were finally overridden through the enactment of the\n<a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_795\">Juvenile Justice Act, 2016</a>. <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_796\">The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence\nAct, 2005</a> which was for the purpose of more effective protection of the rights of\nwomen guaranteed under the Constitution who are victims of violence of any kind\noccurring within the family. For the first time, a legal status was given to\nunmarried couples, which enabled women, subjected to domestic violence, to the\nright to residence (quite apart from remedies through its provisions). The culture\nof the Constitution, thus, has impelled the removal of barriers which hitherto\nexisted.

These, and other legislative interventions, are a result\nof state interest in reforms or furthering the interests of given communities or\npersons. For these reasons, we do not particularly subscribe to the characterisation\nof ‘democratizing intimate zones’ as discussed in the learned chief justice’s draft\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">16</span>\n     [1985] Supp. (3) SCR 71\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                                    17</span>\n\n\nopinion. These outcomes were driven by enacted law; furthermore, there was\nstate interest, which impelled regulation of such relationships, as for instance, in\nensuring that the minimum age for marriage of girls. Likewise, there is state\ninterest in regulating what kind of relationships, i.e. prohibited degrees of\nrelationship, should be enacted as disqualifications to marriage. Marital\n“offences” such as desertion, or “cruelty” [not confined to physical violence or\ncruelty] are also grounds afforded to spouses, to seek matrimonial remedies. The\nabsence of such legislation would have meant that children of any age, would\ncontinue to have been married off, much to the peril of the girl child’s health and\nlife; likewise, the codification and enactment of prohibited degrees of\nrelationships, were meant to further certain public health interests.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">III.

The promise of the Preamble to the Constitution is of &#x27;fraternity’ “assuring\npower, conflicts, and oppression, denial of participation. Quite naturally, these\noccupied centre-stage in our struggle for Swaraj. We did not strive merely for\nfreedom from the shackles of a foreign power; our founders realized that\nmillennia old practices of marginalization, oppression and exclusion produced\nhumiliation, resulting in dehumanization of the human “self”. The relation of self\nto other self, the dominant or powerful self to the oppressed self, ventures on the\nconcept of equality. It thus tries to eliminate untouchability, sex and caste-based\ndiscrimination, and ensure dignity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">32.     Dignity is understood to mean the intrinsic worth of a person or the inherent\nvalue of a human being which entitles one to respect. The crucial aspect of\nsubstantive dignity lies in the state’s role in providing basic conditions of life\nwhich enable individuals to fully realise the potential of intrinsic dignity by\nliving, what is called, a ‘dignified life’.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">33.     In the Indian context the idea of equality and dignity is to reach its\nconstitutional commitment to be a republic, based on democracy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_63\">In <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_817\">Francis\nCoralie Mullin v.

This court, in <a href=\"/doc/175579179/\" id=\"a_818\">Jeeja Ghosh v. Union of India30</a>, spoke about human dignity\nas a “core value” and that the “right to life is given a purposeful meaning by this\nCourt to include right to live with dignity”. The court quoted from Aharon Barak31\nthat human dignity has a “central normative role” and that as a constitutional\nvalue it is “the factor that unites the human rights into one whole.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_69\">It ensures the\nnormative unity of human rights” expressed in different ways i.e., normatively as\na basis for constitutional rights; an interpretive principle for determining the\nscope of constitutional rights and that dignity has “an important role in\ndetermining the proportionality of a statute limiting a constitutional right.” In\n<a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_819\">Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala</a> (hereafter, “Kesavananda Bharti”)32 too\nthe value of dignity was underlined: “the basic dignity of man does not depend\nupon the codification of the fundamental rights nor is such codification a\nprerequisite for a dignified way of living”.

The constitutional emphasis on dignity is not without a reason. Ambedkar,\nand several of our constitution framers, meticulously sought to carve out of the\nremnants of a socially repressive, hierarchical, and unequal society a modern\nconstitution, reflecting the aspirations of a confident people, in a vibrant\ndemocracy. The society which our constitution created was to emerge out of\ndarkness of caste and other forms of social prejudice and oppression, into the light\nof the rule of law, social justice, and egalitarianism. To Ambedkar and other\nconstitution makers, political freedom (swaraj) meant precisely the freedom to\nmake the self, to make choices with dignity, to break from historical suffering and\nhumiliation. The drafting history of the equality code (Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">18) bear poignant testimony to this aspect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">37.       Dignity has both an internal and external aspect. In its internal context,\ndignity and privacy are intrinsically twined. In its external context, dignity is\nmultidimensional: it is a right to be treated as a fellow human, with all attributes\nof a human personality, which is, the right and expectation to be accorded due\nrespect, treated with dignity and equal worth. Denial of these, has a\ndisproportionate impact on the individual: they are diminished in their own eyes,\nand the rest of the world, resulting in a loss of one’s self worth and moral worth.\nThis is the vision of equality, social justice, welfare and dignity which our\nConstitution articulates.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">              iii.

The inclusion of <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_833\">Article 17</a> enjoins the state to forbear caste discrimination,\novertly, or through classification, and looms large as a part of the equality code\nand indeed the entire framework of the Constitution. The protected attribute of\n‘sex’ has been held to include ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender expression’ by this\ncourt in NALSA (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_834\">Navtej Johar &amp; Ors. v. Union of India</a> (hereafter,\n“Navtej Johar”)37.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">39.       The rationale for enacting proscribed grounds under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_835\">Article 15</a> or 16 (or\nboth) is the awareness of Constitution makers that courts could use these markers-\nor pointers of distinction, to determine if reasonable classification were\npermissible. Hence, absent the prohibited ground of sex, gender could have been\na plausible basis for an intelligible differentia. To prevent such classifications\nspecific proscribed grounds were enacted as injunctions against State action. The\nprovisions, and the equality code, are consequently not only about the declaratory\nsweep of equality: but also about the total prohibition against exclusion from\nparticipation in specified, enumerated activities, through entrenched provisions.\nA closer look at <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_836\">Article 15</a>, especially <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_837\">Article 15(2)</a>, would further show that\nlikewise most of the proscribed grounds in <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_838\">Article 15(1)</a> were engrafted to ensure\nthat access to public resources - in some cases not even maintained by the state,\nbut available to the public generally, could not be barred. This provision was\nmade to right a historical wrong, i.e., denial of access to the most deprived\nsections of society of the most basic resources, such as water, food, etc. The aim\nof the Constitution was to act as the ultimate leveller, ensuring that equality in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">37</span>\n     (2018) 7 SCR 379\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">\f                                                        23</span>\n\n\npractice, and substance, became the constitutional culture of this great nation.\nTogether with the affirmative action provisions - <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_839\">Articles 15(3)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_840\">&amp; (4)</a><a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_841\">, 16(4)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1746393/\" id=\"a_842\">&amp;\n16(5)</a> was intended to guarantee that not mere facial discrimination was forbidden\nbut that existing inequalities were ultimately eradicated. Flowing from these, this\ncourt has, time and again, emphasized that non-discrimination is essential for\nenjoyment of all rights and freedoms of citizens of our country, to realize their\nworth and potential.38\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">40.      In the context of the present debate, in NALSA (supra), this court took note\nof the Yogyakarta Principles and principle on right to equality and non-\ndiscrimination enshrined therein which reads as:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_86\">“2.

The\ncourt also acknowledged the right to self-determination of one&#x27;s gender as\nintrinsic to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_852\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The court further declared that\nnecessarily, to realize such persons’ fundamental right to live with dignity under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_853\">Article 21</a>, extends to the right of equal access to all facilities to achieve full\npotential as human beings, such as education, social assimilation, access to public\nspaces and employment opportunities. The court also expressly alluded to their\nrights under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_854\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_855\">16</a> of the Constitution of India. The court was\ncognizant of the acutest form of discrimination of such persons, resulting in their\ndegradation. This declaration of the entitlement of the transgender persons\nsensitized the society to take measures for addressing their concerns, eventually\npaving the way for the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_856\">Transgender Persons (Protection of\nRights) Act, 2019</a> which aims to entrench the principle of non-discrimination and\nentitles transgender persons to a range of statutory rights, which they can enforce.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18303067\" id=\"span_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92846055\" id=\"span_99\">44.

Is there a fundamental right to marry?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">45.      This court has recognized that marriage is a social institution.45 As\nelaborated in Part I, marriage existed and exists, historically and chronologically\nin all of the senses - because people married before the rise of the state as a\nconcept. Therefore, marriage as an institution is prior to the state, i.e., it precedes\nit. The status is still, not one that is conferred by the state (unlike the license\nregime in the US). This implies that the marriage structure exists, regardless of\nthe state, which the latter can utilise or accommodate, but cannot be abolished as\na concept. Under this view terms of marriage are set, to a large extent,\nindependently of the state. Its source is external to the state. That source defines\nthe boundaries of marriage. This implies that state power to regulate marriage\ndoes not sit easy with the idea of marriage as a fundamental right. In attempting\nto analyse the claim to a fundamental right to marry, there are primarily two\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">43</span>\n   2021 (3) SCC 360\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">44</span>\n   2018 (11) SCR 765\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">45</span>\n   Sivasankaran v. Santhimeenal [2021] 6 SCR 169:“The norms of a marriage and the varying degrees of\nlegitimacy it may acquire are dictated by factors such as marriage and divorce laws, prevailing social norms,\nand religious dictates. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192421140\" id=\"span_108\">Functionally, marriages are seen as a site for the propagation of social and cultural capital\nas they help in identifying kinship ties, regulating sexual behaviour, and consolidating property and social\nprestige.” Likewise, in <a href=\"/doc/192421140/\" id=\"a_864\">Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma</a> [(2013) 14 SCR 1019] this court said that “The institutions\nof marriage and the family are important social institutions.” The same decision also recognized the centrality of\ntradition, and custom, while emphasizing that “Marriages in India take place either following the personal Law\nof the Religion to which a party is belonged or following the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_865\">Special Marriage Act</a>.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">\f                                                     27</span>\n\n\ncompeting claims about the nature of marriage: one being that the state should\nexercise more control over marriage to support and protect “traditional purposes\nand perceptions” and the other, that each individual should have the right to\ndefine marriage for themselves and state involvement in marriage should be\nminimal.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">46.        If indeed there is a right to marry unless it is elevated to a right akin to\n<a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_866\">Articles 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_867\">, 23</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_868\">24</a>, [which apply to both state and nonstate agencies and\nactors], it cannot be operationalized. These provisions, most emphatically create\npositive obligations; likewise <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_869\">Articles 15 (3)</a><a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_870\">, 15 (4)</a> – and 15 (6), as well as\n<a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_871\">Articles 16 (4)</a><a href=\"/doc/198187879/\" id=\"a_872\">, 16 (6)</a> highlight state interest in creating conditions to further the\ngoal of non-discrimination. Yet, the previous decisions of this court have\ncarefully held such provisions to enable the state, and in a sense oblige it to take\nmeasures; but ruled out court mandated policies and laws.46 In our considered\nopinion, this is not however, one such case where the court can make a departure\nfrom such rule, and require the state to create social or legal status.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">47.        What is being asked for by the petitioners is state intervention in enabling\nmarriage between queer or non-heterosexual couples. Civil marriage or\nrecognition of any such relationship, with such status, cannot exist in the absence\nof statute. The demand, hence, is that of a right of access to a publicly created\nand administered institution. There is a paradox here or a contradiction, which\nruns to the root of the issue and weighs on this court’s mind, heavily - in that the\ncreation of the institution, here depends on state action, which is sought to be\ncompelled through the agency of this court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"641689\" id=\"span_110\">48.        Most of the precedents cited contain discussions on how the institution of\nmarriage involves issues of basic importance. Many decisions, including\nObergefell v. Hodges (hereafter, “Obergefell”)47, recall tradition, to underline\nthat marriage is of utmost significance, and that it underlines the importance of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">46</span>\n     <a href=\"/doc/641689/\" id=\"a_873\">Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission v. Baloji Badhvanath</a> 2009 (5) SCR 668\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">47</span>\n     576 US 644 (2015)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">\f                                           28</span>\n\n\ncommitment of two individuals towards each other and that it is a foundational\nrelationship of society. Traditions of marriage per se may not support the basis of\nrecognition of marital relationship between non-heterosexual couples. Many\ndecisions by the US courts, have underlined the rationale for declaring the right\nto marry a fundamental right as being essential to the orderly pursuit of Happiness\n(as it appears in their Declaration of Independence) by free persons.</span> This strand\nof reasoning is apparent from Loving48 to Obergefell (supra).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">49.        This with respect is not sound - at least as applied to state licensing of\nmarriage (as in the US), which is what civil marriage is. The fundamental\nimportance of marriage remains that it is based on personal preference and\nconfers social status. Importance of something to an individual does not per se\njustify considering it a fundamental right, even if that preference enjoys popular\nacceptance or support. Some may consider education to be fundamentally\nimportant in that they consider nothing less than a postgraduate degree is\nfundamental; there may be a large section of the people, who consider that access\nto internet is a fundamental right, and yet others, who may wish that access to\nessential medication is a fundamental right. All these cannot be enforceable\nrights, which the courts can compel the state or governance institutions to\nprovide. These cannot result in demand for creation of a social institution, and in\nturn creation of status, through a statute. This result - i.e. recognition, can be\nachieved only by enacted law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"92846055\" id=\"span_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_116\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_117\">50.

The conclusion arrived at by the learned Chief Justice is that while there is\nno express fundamental right to marry, there is a right or freedom to enter into a\nunion [spelt out in <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_882\">Navtej Johar</a> (supra), <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_883\">K.S.

The\nlearned Chief Justice also traces this right to enter into an abiding cohabitational\nrelationship to express provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_886\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, (c), and (e), <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_887\">Article 21</a>, and\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_888\">Article 25.</a></span></span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_129\">52.

There can be no doubt that\n      an individual also has a right to a union under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_892\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. When we say union,\n      we do not mean the union of marriage, though marriage is a union. As a concept, union also\n      means companionship in every sense of the word, be it physical, mental, sexual or emotional. The\n      LGBT community is seeking realisation of its basic right to companionship, so long as such a\n      companionship is consensual, free from the vice of deceit, force, coercion and does not result in\n      violation of the fundamental rights of others.”                             (emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">\f                                          30</span>\n\n\nprivacy, autonomy and dignity.

The learned Chief Justice in a detailed discussion of the ‘goal of self-\ndevelopment’, rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_897\">Article 19 (including the right to freedom of speech</a>\nand expression, and to form ‘intimate’ associations, to settle in any part of India),\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_898\">Article 21</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_899\">Article 25</a>, arrives at the conclusion that the right to union (or right\nto enter into an abiding cohabitational relationship) can be traced to these express\nprovisions, which in turn enrich this right. Thereafter, having traced this right to\nunion, it is propounded that the ‘positive’ postulate of fundamental rights (as\nexplained in an earlier section of the draft opinion), necessitates or places a\npositive obligation on the State to accord recognition to such relationships/unions.\nThis, in our considered opinion, is not necessary. Further, our point of\ndisagreement is deepened by the discussion in Part D(v) and (vi) in the learned\nChief Justice’s draft opinion, prior to the section on ‘the right to enter into a\nunion’- which lays down a theory on the ‘positive postulates’ of fundamental\nrights and the consequential obligation on the State. For the reasoning elaborated\nin Part IV of our opinion, we cannot agree to this characterisation of the\nentitlement, or any corresponding state obligation to create a status through\nstatute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">54.    If it is agreed that marriage is a social institution with which the State is\nunconcerned except the limited state interest in regulating some aspects of it, does\nit follow that any section of the society (leaving aside the issue of rights of non-\nheterosexual couples) – which wishes for creation of a like social institution, or\neven an entry into a zone which is not popular or otherwise does not fall within\nthe institution of marriage – can seek relief of its creation by court intervention?\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">\f                                          31</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">IV.   Positive obligations in furtherance of fundamental rights\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">55.   The conception of fundamental rights – in terms of their negative, and\npositive content – is a formulation that requires no citation. However, the extent\nto which this positive obligation may reach to, is where our reasoning arrives at\nthe metaphorical fork in the road. Every fundamental right, is not enjoyed by an\nindividual, to the same degree of absoluteness – for instance: <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_900\">Article 19</a> has a\nclear stipulation of reasonable restrictions for each freedom; <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_901\">Article 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_902\">16</a>\nhave a clear negative injunction on the State against discrimination, within which\nsubstantive equality is baked in and requiring the State to step in or facilitate;\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_903\">Article 25</a>, is subject to other fundamental rights and freedoms under Part III, etc.\nThere are restrictions, to the content of these rights. A discussion of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_904\">Article 21</a>\nelucidates this point. However, even while tracing these numerous\n‘unenumerated’ rights – the right to a clean environment, right to shelter, etc. –\nthe courts have been (necessarily so) circumspect in how these can be enforced.\nOften, these rights have come to be enumerated in response to State action that\nthreatened the freedom, or right directly or indirectly, thus compelling the litigant\nto invoke the jurisdiction of this court, to remind the State of the negative\ninjunction that impedes its interference, and must guides its actions. Does this,\nhowever, mean that a litigant could knock on the doors of this court, seeking to\nenforce each of these unenumerated rights? A simple example would offer some\nclarity – consider a poet who wishes to share their work, with the public at large.\nNow provided that there is no direct restriction, or those in the nature of having a\nchilling effect, the State’s role in enabling or facilitating this freedom enjoyed by\nthe poet, is limited. This court cannot direct that the State must create a platform\nfor this purpose; this would be a stretch, in the absence of any overt or inert threat.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">56.   In the draft circulated by the Chief Justice, the reasoning that there is no\nfundamental right to marry and thereafter, nevertheless, to proceed to delineate\nthe facets or features which unions other than marriage, are deprived of; merits a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                                                    32</span>\n\n\ncloser look. The summation of various rights which such a couple is said to be\ndeprived of, is used to delineate the contours of the right to enter into a union, and\njustify a positive obligation. There cannot be any doubt that the individuals have\nthe choice of their life partners and the right to live the lives they wish to,\nundisturbed. This is the essence of what the jurisprudence of this Court has been\nso far, i.e., an explanation of the right to life and the other rights enumerated or\ndiscovered by interpretive process – privacy, choice, dignity etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">57.     Repeatedly, decisions of this court have emphasized on the non-\ndiscriminatory and positive content of certain fundamental rights (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_905\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_906\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_907\">,\n16</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_908\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_909\">, 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_910\">24</a>). In fact, the court has underlined the obligations of the state to\ncreate conditions conducive to the exercise of the right to equality (i.e.,\nsubstantive equality), and to realize fraternity [Refer: decisions in N.M. Thomas51\nand Indra Sawhney52 which expanded the understanding of substantive equality,\nthough without making enabling provisions enforceable by court]. This court has\nalso in some decisions, accepted the argument that given the nature of\nfundamental rights, and its evolving content, in many circumstances, it might be\nnecessary for the state to intervene and protect the fundamental right concerned\nthus creating an atmosphere conducive for the enjoyment of such right. Lata\nSingh (supra) dealt with honour killings of couples involved in inter-caste, inter-\nreligious marriages; in Arumugam Servai v. State of Tamil Nadu53, where the\nissue was virulent caste slurs and violence, which were crimes, the court required\nadministrative and police officials “to take strong measures to prevent such\natrocious acts”. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92846055\" id=\"span_140\">In <a href=\"/doc/92846055/\" id=\"a_911\">Shakti Vahini</a> (supra), which dealt with threats by khap\npanchayats, this court held that the state “is duty-bound to protect the\nfundamental rights of its citizens; and an inherent aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_912\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution would be the freedom of choice in marriage”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_141\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1130169\" id=\"span_142\">The court issued\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">51</span>\n   <a href=\"/doc/1130169/\" id=\"a_913\">State of Kerela v.

As the two 7-judge bench decisions have affirmed whilst there is no dispute\nthat there is an interconnectedness of various fundamental rights, their\nmanifestations in different forms especially under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_968\">Article 19</a> and the distinct\ngrounds on which they can be circumscribed, sets each freedom and right apart.\nWhile the right to free speech and expression may be exercised in conjunction\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">62</span>\n     1962 (3) SCR 269\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">63</span>\n     1978 (2) SCR 621\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">\f                                         37</span>\n\n\nwith the right to association and even the right to assemble and move,\nnevertheless the extent of the assertion of these rights, collectively, would depend\non the circumstances of the case and the nature of the curbs imposed (by law).\nThus, for instance, the right to protest in the form of a procession is subjected to\nthe laws reasonably restricting movement in the larger interests of the public. It\nis questionable whether the imposition of valid restrictions and curbs in such\ncircumstances can be successfully impugned only on the ground that their right\nto free speech and assembly are violated. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_174\">In the case of both, if the restriction is\nvalid for one fundamental right, it is equally valid for the others on an application\nof the test <a href=\"/doc/1781810/\" id=\"a_969\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_970\">Maneka Gandhi</a> (supra). Rather it is the test of\nreasonableness and the proximity to the disturbance of public order, when such\nrestriction is imposed, that becomes the focal point of debate. Therefore, in the\nabstract every right enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_971\">Article 19</a>, and other <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_972\">Article 25</a>, can be\nexercised freely without hindrance by all. However, it is the assertion of the right,\nin the face of some threat by state action or despite state protection, which\nbecomes the subject of court scrutiny. The extent of right to free speech is subject\nto reasonable restrictions, to further inter alia, “public order” or “decency” and\n“morality”. The right to association is hedged by reasonable restrictions inter\nalia, in furtherance of “public order or morality”. The right to travel and settle\nin any part of the country, is subject to reasonable restrictions in the “interests of\nthe general public” or “for the interests of any scheduled tribe”. Likewise, the\nfreedom of conscience is both internal, and external.

We do not therefore, agree with the learned Chief Justice who has\nunderlined that the positive postulate of various rights, leads to the conclusion\nthat all persons (including two consenting adult queer persons) have an\nentitlement to enter into a union, or an abiding cohabitational relationship which\nthe state is under an obligation to recognize, “to give real meaning” to the right.\nThere is no recorded instance nor was one pointed out where the court was asked\nto facilitate the creation of a social institution like in the present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_176\">68.

The observations were in the context of criminalization of\nconsensual sexual conduct between queer couples. The observations, however,\nhave tended to point to the direction that there should be some social ordering of\ninstitutions, which not merely accommodate such choice, but facilitate its\nmeaningful exercise beyond the confines of their right to privacy and to live\ntogether.

Therefore, even if we were to, for argument sake, recognise an entitlement\nunder the Constitution to enter into an abiding cohabitational relationship or\nunion– in our opinion, it cannot follow to a claim for an institution. There are\nalmost intractable difficulties in creating, through judicial diktat, a civil right to\nmarry or a civil union, no less, of the kind that is sought by the petitioners in these\nproceedings. “Ordering a social institution” or re-arranging existing social\nstructures, by creating an entirely new kind of parallel framework for non-\nheterosexual couples, would require conception of an entirely different code, and\na new universe of rights and obligations. This would entail fashioning a regime\nof state registration, of marriage between non-heterosexual couples; the\nconditions for a valid matrimonial relationship amongst them, spelling out\neligibility conditions, such as minimum age, relationships which fall within\n“prohibited degrees”; grounds for divorce, right to maintenance, alimony, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_92\">70.   As a result, with due respect, we are unable to agree with the conclusions\nof the learned Chief Justice, with respect to tracing the right to enter into or form\nunions from the right to freedom of speech and expression [<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_975\">Article 19(1)(a)]</a>, the\nright to form associations [<a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_976\">Article 19 (1)(c)]</a>, along with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_977\">Article 21</a> and any\ncorresponding positive obligation. It is reiterated that all queer persons have the\nright to relationship and choice of partner, co-habit and live together, as an\nintegral part of choice, which is linked to their privacy and dignity. Any further\ndiscussion on the rights which consenting partners may exercise, is unnecessary.\nNo one has contested that two queer partners have the rights enumerated under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_978\">Article 19 (1)(a); (c)</a>, and (d), or even the right to conscience under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_979\">Article 25.</a>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">\f                                                 40</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">The elaboration of these rights, to say that exercise of choice to such relationships\nrenders these rights meaningful, and that the state is obliged to “recognise a\nbouquet of entitlements which flow from such an abiding relationship of this\nkind” is not called for. We therefore, respectfully disagree with that part of the\nlearned Chief Justice’s reasoning, which forms the basis for some of the final\nconclusions and directions recorded in his draft judgment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\"> V.

The petitioners complained that provisions of the SMA, inasmuch as they\nexcluded, or do not provide for marriage of non-heterosexual couples, is\ndiscriminatory, because the classification made in its various provisions are\nheteronormative, thus discriminating against non-heterosexual couples.

There ought to be\n               causal connection between the basis of classification and the object of the\n               statute.

To put it simply, all that is\n             required in class or special legislation is that the legislative classification\n             must not be arbitrary but should be based on an intelligible principle having\n             a reasonable relation to the object which the legislature seeks to attain.”</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73048038\" id=\"span_185\">74.

The discussion on equality and the limits of permissive classification were\nconveniently summarized by the seven-judge bench in In Re the Special Courts\nBill, 1978 (hereafter, “Re Special Court’s Bill”)71. Some of the propositions were\nstated as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           “[..] (2).The State, in the exercise of its governmental power, has of necessity to\n               make laws operating differently on different groups or classes of persons\n               within its territory to attain particular ends in giving effect to its policies, and\n               it must possess for that purpose large powers of distinguishing and classifying\n               persons or things to be subjected to such laws.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">           (3). The constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of its laws\n               sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise\n               formula. Therefore, classification need not be constituted by an exact or\n               scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things. The courts should not\n               insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the\n               validity of classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is\n               not palpably arbitrary.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">           (4). The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_990\">Article 14</a> is not that the same rules\n               of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that\n               the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of\n               differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly\n               circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and\n               liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same\n               situation, and there should be no discrimination between one person and\n               another if as regards the subject-matter of the legislation their position is\n               substantially the same.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                   ***\n           (6) The law can make and set apart the classes according to the needs and\n               exigencies of the society and as suggested by experience. It can recognise\n               even degree of evil, but the classification should never be arbitrary, artificial\n               or evasive.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">70</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">     1974 (1) SCR 771\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">71</span>\n     (1979) 2 SCR 476\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">\f                                                       43</span>\n\n\n            (7) The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational, that is to say, it\n                must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be\n                found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out\n                but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the\n                object of the legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions must be\n                fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible\n                differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others\n                and (2) that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought\n                to be achieved by the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">            (8) The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the object of the Act\n                are distinct things and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between\n                them. In short, while <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_991\">Article 14</a> forbids class discrimination by conferring\n                privileges or imposing liabilities upon person arbitrarily selected out of a\n                large number of other persons similarly situated in relation to the privileges\n                sought to be conferred or the liabilities proposed to be imposed, it does not\n                forbid classification for the purpose of legislation, provided such\n                classification is not arbitrary in the sense abovementioned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_105\">                     ***\n            (11) Classification necessarily implies the making of a distinction or\n                discrimination between persons classified and those who are not members of\n                that class. It is the essence of a classification that upon the class are cast\n                duties and burdens different from those resting upon the general\n                public. Indeed, the very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it\n                goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines\n                the matter of constitutionality.”\n\n\nThe differentiation, therefore, is to be discerned from gathering of the object\nsought to be achieved by the enactment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">77.        For a moment, if it is assumed (as the petitioners argue) that the\nclassification is suspect, because non-heterosexual couples are not provided the\nfacility of marriage, yet such “under classification” is not per se discriminatory.\nThis aspect was highlighted by this court in Ambica Mills72:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                “Since the classification does not include all who are similarly situated with respect\n                to the purpose of the law, the classification might appear, at first blush, to be\n                unreasonable. But the Court has recognised the very real difficulties under which\n                legislatures operate — difficulties arising out of both the nature of the legislative\n                process and of the society which legislation attempts perennially to re-shape — and\n                it has refused to strike down indiscriminately all legislation embodying classificatory\n                inequality here under consideration”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"681436\" id=\"span_196\">78.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons of SMA clearly suggests that the\nsole reason for the enactment of the Act was to replace the earlier colonial era law\nand provide for certain new provisions; it does not refer to any specific object\nsought to be achieved or the reasons that necessitated the enactment of the new\nAct other than that it was meant to facilitate marriage between persons professing\ndifferent faiths.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">82.    If one looks at the enacted provisions, especially Sections 19-21 and 21A,\n<a href=\"/doc/534344/\" id=\"a_998\">Sections 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1292201/\" id=\"a_999\">25</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_1000\">27</a>, <a href=\"/doc/175453/\" id=\"a_1001\">31</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1167708/\" id=\"a_1002\">37</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1204664/\" id=\"a_1003\">38</a>, of SMA, there can be no doubt that the sole\nintention was to enable marriage (as it was understood then, i.e., for heterosexual\ncouples) of persons professing or belonging to different faiths, an option hitherto\navailable, subject to various limitations. There was no idea to exclude non-\nheterosexual couples, because at that time, even consensual physical intimacy of\nsuch persons, was outlawed by <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_1004\">Section 377</a> IPC. So, while the Act sought to\nprovide an avenue for those marriages that did not enjoy support in society, or did\nnot have the benefit of custom to solemnise, it would be quite a stretch to say that\nthis included same sex marriages. Therefore, the challenge to the constitutionality\nof the statute, must fail. It is settled by decisions of the court that as long as an\nobjective is clearly discernible, it cannot be attacked merely because it does not\nmake a better classification. The need for a law or a legal regime that provides or\nfacilitates matrimony of queer couples is similar, to the need to facilitate inter-\nfaith marriages which is what drove the Parliament to enact the SMA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1351547\" id=\"span_204\">83.    The next question urged is that the passage of time, has rendered the\nexclusion of queer couples, the benefit of SMA, discriminatory. This line of\nargument, is based on this court’s reasoning that with passage of time, a\nclassification which was once valid, could become irrelevant, and insupportable,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">\f                                                      46</span>\n\n\nthus discriminatory. The first of such decisions was <a href=\"/doc/1351547/\" id=\"a_1005\">Motor and General Traders\nv. State of AP75</a> wherein a provision of the state rent control legislation (which\nexempted premises constructed after 26.08.195776) was under challenge. The idea\nwas to provide impetus to construction of houses; however, the long passage of\ntime resulted in two classes of tenants, i.e., those residing in older premises, who\nwere covered by the law, and those who lived in premises constructed later. This\ncourt held that the continued operation of such exemption, rendered it\nunconstitutional:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">             “There being no justification for the continuance of the benefit to a class of\n             persons without any rational basis whatsoever, the evil effects flowing from\n             the impugned exemption have caused more harm to the society than one could\n             anticipate. What was justifiable during a short period has turned out to be a\n             case of hostile discrimination by lapse of nearly a quarter of century. The\n             second answer to the above contention is that mere lapse of time does not lend\n             constitutionality to a provision which is otherwise bad.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"340697\" id=\"span_206\">84.

In all the judgments cited by petitioners, the court was able to discern or\nfind that a classification, made at an earlier point in time, had lost its relevance,\nand operated in a discriminatory manner. In some circumstances, rather than\ndeclaring the entire law void, this court “read down” the relevant provision to the\nextent the statute could be so read. In the present case, the petitioner’s arguments\nwith respect to “reading down” provisions of the SMA are insubstantial. The\noriginal rationale for SMA was to facilitate inter-faith marriages. That reason is\nas valid today as it was at the time of birthing that law. It cannot be condemned\non the ground of irrelevance, due to passage of time. It would be useful to recall\nprinciple (9)79 of the opinion in Re Special Court’s Bill (supra). The classification\nwas primarily not between heterosexual and non-heterosexual couples, but\nheterosexual couples of differing faiths. All its provisions are geared to and\nprovide for a framework to govern the solemnisation, or registration, of the\nmarital relationship, which replicates the status that different personal laws\nbestow. Since there was no one law, which could apply for couples professing\ndiffering religions, the SMA created the governing norms- such as procedure,\nminimum age, prohibited degree of relationship and forbidden relationships for\nthe male and female spouses respectively (through different schedules); the\ngrounds of divorce, etc. The relevance of SMA has gained more ground, because\nof increasing awareness and increasing exercise of choice by intending spouses\nbelonging to different faiths. It cannot be said, by any stretch of the imagination\nthat the exclusion of non-heterosexual couples from the fold of SMA has resulted\nin its ceasing to have any rationale, and thus becoming discriminatory in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">79</span>\n   “(9) If the legislative policy is clear and definite and as an effective method of carrying out that policy a\ndiscretion is vested by the statute upon a body of administrators or officers to make selective application of the\nlaw to certain classes or groups of persons, the statute itself cannot be condemned as a piece of discriminatory\nlegislation.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">\f                                           48</span>\n\n\noperation.

The petitioners’ efforts have been aimed at persuading this court to\ninterpret the provisions of SMA in a manner, that accommodates non-\nheterosexual couples and facilitates this marriage. Their arguments were centred\naround reading its specific provisions – [<a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_1012\">Section 2 (b)</a> read with Part I (for a male)\nand Part II (for a female) (degrees of prohibited relationships), <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_1013\">Section 4 (c)</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1542339/\" id=\"a_1014\">Section 12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_1015\">15</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1220424/\" id=\"a_1016\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1773422/\" id=\"a_1017\">23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_1018\">27(1)</a>; 27(1A) (special ground of divorce for wife),\n31(1)(iiia) and (2) (special provision for jurisdiction in case of proceeding for the\nwife), 36 and 37 (alimony for the wife), 44 (bigamy)] – which present a dominant\nunderlying heteronormative content. They argue that this court should adopt a\npurposive construction of the provisions of SMA, and interpret it in light of this\ncourt’s previous decisions in <a href=\"/doc/15876695/\" id=\"a_1019\">Dharani Sugars and Chemicals Ltd v.

In Dharani Sugars, the challenge was against a new policy introduced by\nthe Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The petitioners contented that there was no\nauthorization under the <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_1020\">RBI Act</a> to frame the impugned policy. Although the court\nacknowledged that new facts can influence the interpretation of existing law, it\nultimately upheld the policy based on existing provisions that empowered the RBI\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">80</span>\n     [2019] 6 SCR 307\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">\f                                                       49</span>\n\n\nto issue such policies. A careful examination of this judgment would reveal that\neven though discussion on the interpretation that “unless a contrary intention\nappears, an interpretation should be given to the words used to take in new facts\nand situations, if the words are capable of comprehending them” indeed\noccurred81; but, the court also noticed that “this doctrine does not however mean\nthat one can construe the language of an old statute to mean something\nconceptually different from what the contemporary evidence shows that\nParliament must have intended”82.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15876695\" id=\"span_218\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_219\">90.

She can legally enter into marriage only after attaining the age of 18 years. When a girl gets married below\nthe age of 18 years, the persons who contract such a marriage or abet in contracting such child marriage, commit\na criminal offence and are liable for punishment under the PCMA. In view of this position there is no rationale\nfor fixing the age at 15 years. This age has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved viz., maintaining the\nsanctity of marriage because by law such a marriage is not legal. It may be true that this marriage is voidable\nand not void ab initio (except in the State of Karnataka) but the fact remains that if the girl has got married before\nthe age of 18 years, she has right to get her marriage annulled. Irrespective of the fact that the right of the girl\nchild to get her marriage annulled, it is indisputable that a criminal offence has been committed and other than\nthe girl child, all other persons including her husband, and those persons who were involved in getting her married\nare guilty of having committed a criminal act. In my opinion, when the State on the one hand, has, by legislation,\nlaid down that abetting child marriage is a criminal offence, it cannot, on the other hand defend this classification\nof girls below 18 years on the ground of sanctity of marriage because such classification has no nexus with the\nobject sought to be achieved. Therefore, also Exception 2 in so far as it relates to girls below 18 years is\ndiscriminatory and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1035\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">\f                                                  51</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"66020071\" id=\"span_239\">92.

Once the interpreter defines the\n             range, he or she chooses the legal meaning of the text from among the\n             (express or implied) semantic possibilities. The semantic component thus sets\n             the limits of interpretation by restricting the interpreter to a legal meaning\n             that the text can bear in its (public or private) language.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178099225\" id=\"span_240\">94.

It should not be lightly\n              assumed that &quot;Parliament had given with one hand what it took away with\n              the other&quot; (see Principles of Statutory Interpretation, Justice G.P. Singh, 7th\n              Edn. 1999, p. 113). That construction is to be rejected which will introduce\n              uncertainty, friction or confusion into the working of the system (ibid, p. 119).\n              While embarking upon interpretation of words and expressions used in a\n              statute it is possible to find a situation when the same word or expression may\n              have somewhat different meaning at different places depending on the subject\n              or context. This is however an exception which can be resorted to only in the\n              event of repugnancy in the subject or context being spelled out. It has been\n              the consistent view of the Supreme Court that when the legislature used same\n              word or expression in different parts of the same section or statute, there is a\n              presumption that the word is used in the same sense throughout (ibid, p. 263).\n              More correct statement of the rule is, as held by the House of Lords in Farrell\n              v. Alexander All ER at p. 736b, &quot;where the draftsman uses the same word or\n              phrase in similar contexts, he must be presumed to intend it in each place to\n              bear the same meaning&quot;. The court having accepted invitation to embark\n              upon interpretative expedition shall identify on its radar the contextual use of\n              the word or expression and then determine its direction avoiding collision\n              with icebergs of inconsistency and repugnancy.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1144327\" id=\"span_262\">99.

The provisions and the objects of the SMA\n(as discussed in the earlier section on discrimination) clearly point to the\ncircumstance that Parliament intended only one kind of couples, i.e., heterosexual\ncouples belonging to different faiths, to be given the facility of a civil marriage.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_133\">100. The petitioners’ argued that the purpose of the SMA was to provide a\nframework for civil marriages not based on personal law includes same-sex\nmarriages. Yet, structurally, <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_1049\">Section 4</a> (conditions relating to solemnization of\nspecial marriages), contemplates marriages between a man and a woman. To read\nSMA in any other manner would be contrary to established principles of statutory\ninterpretation as discussed in preceding paragraphs. It is also not permissible for\nthe court to &#x27;read up’ and substitute the words “any two persons” to refer to a\nmarriage between non-heterosexual couples.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">101. Gender neutral interpretation, much like many seemingly progressive\naspirations, may not really be equitable at times and can result in women being\nexposed to unintended vulnerability, especially when genuine attempts are made\nto achieve a balance, in a social order that traditionally was tipped in favour of\ncis-heterosexual   men.    The    purpose     of   terms   like ‘wife’,   ‘husband,’\n‘man,’ and ‘woman’ in marriage laws (and other laws on sexual violence and\nharassment as well) is to protect a socially marginalised demographic of\nindividuals. For instance, women facing violence by their partner have a right to\nseek recourse under the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_1050\">Domestic Violence Act</a>, which assures- and is meant to\nassure that they (the victims) are safeguarded and provided relief against such\ninjustice. In fact, provisions in SMA, for alimony, and maintenance (<a href=\"/doc/1515822/\" id=\"a_1051\">Section 36</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1167708/\" id=\"a_1052\">37</a>) confer rights to women; likewise certain grounds of divorce (conviction\nof husband for bigamy, rape) entitle the wife additional grounds (<a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_1053\">Section 27</a>) to\nseek divorce. Other provisions such as: <a href=\"/doc/745289/\" id=\"a_1054\">Section 2 (b)</a> read with Part I (for a male)\nand Part II (for a female) enact separate degrees of prohibited relationships;\n<a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_1055\">Section 4 (c)</a>, uses the terms “husband” and “wife”; <a href=\"/doc/1542339/\" id=\"a_1056\">Section 12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_1057\">15</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1220424/\" id=\"a_1058\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1773422/\" id=\"a_1059\">23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1227821/\" id=\"a_1060\">27(1)</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/314352/\" id=\"a_1061\">Section 31(1) (iiia)</a> and (2) (special provision for jurisdiction in case of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_267\">\f                                                    55</span>\n\n\nproceeding for the wife), <a href=\"/doc/1515822/\" id=\"a_1062\">Sections 36</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1167708/\" id=\"a_1063\">37</a> provide for maintenance and\nalimony for the wife), <a href=\"/doc/738288/\" id=\"a_1064\">Section 44</a> (Punishment of bigamy). The general pattern of\nthese provisions – including the specific provisions, enabling or entitling women,\ncertain benefits and the effect of <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_1065\">Sections 19</a>, <a href=\"/doc/497797/\" id=\"a_1066\">20</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_1067\">21</a> and 21A of SMA is that even\nif for arguments’ sake, it were accepted that <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_1068\">Section 4</a> of SMA could be read in\ngender neutral terms, the interplay of other provisions- which could apply to such\nnon-heterosexual couples in such cases, would lead to anomalous results,\nrendering the SMA unworkable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">102. Furthermore, if provisions of SMA are to be construed as gender neutral\n(such as persons or spouses, in substitution of wife and husband) as the petitioners\npropose, it would be possible for a cis-woman’s husband to file a case or create a\nnarrative to manipulate the situation. Gender neutral interpretation of existing\nlaws, therefore, would complicate an already exhausting path to justice for\nwomen and leave room for the perpetrator to victimise them. A law is not merely\nmeant to look good on paper; but is an effective tool to remedy a perceived\ninjustice, addressed after due evaluation about its necessity. A law which was\nconsciously created and fought for, by women cannot, therefore, by an\ninterpretive sleight be diluted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">103. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"268805\" id=\"span_268\">In fact, it would do well to remind ourselves what this court had stated, in\n<a href=\"/doc/268805/\" id=\"a_1069\">Delhi Transport Corporation v.

In such\n               circumstances, it is not possible for the court to remake the statute. Its only\n               duty is to strike it down and leave it to the legislature if it so desires, to amend\n               it.”\n\nSimilarly, in <a href=\"/doc/116404795/\" id=\"a_1070\">Cellular Operators Association of India v.

Lastly, there is no known rule by which a word or group of words, in one\nprovision, can have two different meanings. The effect of the petitioner’s\nargument would be to say that generally, provisions of SMA should be read in a\ngender neutral manner (spouse for wife and husband; persons instead of the male\nand female, etc). Whilst it could in theory be possible to read such provisions in\nthe manner suggested, their impact on specific provisions such as the separate\nlists for wives and husbands for purposes of age, determining prohibited degrees\nof relationships, and remedies such as divorce and maintenance, leads to\nunworkable results. Most importantly, the court, in its anxiety to grant relief,\nwould be ignoring provisions that deal with and refer to personal laws of\nsuccession that are, <a href=\"/doc/1806576/\" id=\"a_1071\">Sections 19</a>, <a href=\"/doc/497797/\" id=\"a_1072\">20</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_1073\">21</a> and 21A. This court cannot look at a text\ncontaining words with two optional meanings in the same provision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">105. Likewise, with regard to the FMA, the petitioners’ sought that certain\nconditions and provisions be read in gender neutral terms, to enable same-sex\nmarriage. FMA too, is a secular legislation wherein Section 4107 states that a\nmarriage between “parties” may be solemnized under this Act, provided that at\nleast one of the two parties is a citizen of India. However, “bride” and\n“bridegroom” are used in <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_1074\">Section 4</a> (relating to the age of the parties at time of\nsolemnization), the Third and Fourth Schedule (which prescribe the declarations\nby both parties and certification of marriage). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27274070\" id=\"span_273\">In our view, the conditions for such\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">106</span>\n    <a href=\"/doc/27274070/\" id=\"a_1075\">Likewise, B.R.

It is important to recognize, that while the state ipso facto may have no role\nin the choice of two free willed individuals to marry, its characterizing marriage\nfor various collateral and intersectional purposes, as a permanent and binding\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">113</span>\n      2022 (12) SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">114</span>\n      2021 (13) SCR 823\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">\f                                           60</span>\n\n\nlegal relationship, recognized as such between heterosexual couples only (and no\nothers) impacts queer couples adversely. The intention of the state, in framing the\nregulations or laws, is to confer on benefits to families, or individuals, who are\nmarried. This has the result of adversely impacting to exclude queer couples. By\nrecognizing heterosexual couples’ unions and cohabitation as marriages in\nvarious laws and regulations such as: in employment (nominations in pension,\nprovident fund, gratuity, life and personal accident insurance policies); for credit\n(particularly joint loans to both spouses, based on their total earning capacity);\nfor purposes of receiving compensation in the event of fatal accidents, to name\nsome such instances, and not providing for non-heterosexual couples such\nrecognition, results in their exclusion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">114. The individual earned benefits (by each partner or both collectively), which\nwould be available to family members (such as employee state insurance benefits,\nin the event of injury of the earning partner, provident fund, compensation,\nmedical benefits, insurance benefits, in the event of death of such earning partner)\nare examples of what the injured or deceased partner by dint of her or his work,\nbecomes entitled to, or the members of her family become entitled to. The denial\nof these benefits and inability of the earning partner in a queer relationship,\ntherefore has an adverse discriminatory impact. The state may not intend the\ndiscrimination, or exclusion in the conferment of such benefits or social welfare\nmeasures. Yet, the framework of such policies or regulations, expressed in favour\nof those in matrimonial relationships, results in denial of entitlements/benefits,\ndespite the professional abilities and contributions which such individuals might\nto society.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">115. The objective of many of these laws or schemes is to confer or provide\nentitlements based on individual earning and contribution. For example,\nprovident fund is payable due to the employee’s personal contribution and their\nstatus as an employee, directly flowing from the functions discharged. Similarly,\nthe objective of entitlement of benefits under the Employee State Insurance Act,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">\f                                           61</span>\n\n\nand other such insurance related schemes or welfare measures (such as the\nWorkman’s <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_1085\">Compensation Act</a>), flow from the individual status, work, and effort\nof the concerned employee. Major part of these benefits, or all of them, flow in\nthe event of certain eventualities such as fatal accident, or death. The design of\nthese statutes and schemes, is to enable both the concerned subscriber or\nemployee (in the event of infirmity or termination of employment) to receive\nthem, or in an unforeseen event such as death, for his dependents to receive them.\nThe restrictive way in which ‘dependent’ or ‘nominee(s)’ are defined (‘spouse’,\nor members of the family in a heteronormative manner) exclude their enjoyment\nto the intended beneficiary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_153\">116. This deprivation has to be addressed. That these can be magnified, can be\nillustrated by a few examples. For instance, a queer couple might live together as\nspouses (without legal recognition)- even for two decades. If one of them passes\naway in a motor vehicle accident, the surviving partner would not only be unable\nto get any share of the deceased partner’s estate, but also any portion of the\ncompensation. In case the union was not with approval of their respective\nfamilies, who might have ostracised or broken relationship with them, the result\nwould be injustice, because the surviving spouse, who shared life and cared for\nthe deceased partner, especially during hard times, would be completely excluded\nfrom enjoying any benefits - all of which would go to the family members of the\ndeceased (who may have even boycotted them). The same result would occur, in\nthe event of death of one partner; family pension and death benefits would be\ndenied to the queer partner. This injustice and inequity results in discrimination,\nunless remedial action is taken by the state and central governments.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">117. It is relevant to record a note of caution at this juncture. While the right to\nmarry or have a legally recognised marriage is only statutory, the right to cohabit\nand live in a relationship in the privacy of one’s home is fundamental, and enjoyed\nby all. This is not to say that the latter, is unqualified or without restriction. Rather,\nthat the latter, is a right afforded to all, irrespective of the State&#x27;s recognition of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">\f                                          62</span>\n\n\n the relationship or status, as in the case of ‘married’ couples. The discriminatory\n impact recognised in the above paragraphs, however, is to highlight the effect of\n a legislative vacuum – specifically on long term queer couples, who do not have\n the avenue of marriage, to entitle them to earned benefits. Could this same logic\n then be extended to heterosexual couples that choose to not get married, despite\n having the avenue? With respect, this would require further consideration by the\n State, and was an aspect that was neither argued, nor were we called upon to\n decide, in the present petitions. Therefore, it is pointed out that State must remain\n cognizant of such an unwitting consequence of creating two parallel frameworks,\n for live-in or domestic partnerships, and marriages, and the confusion or\n anomalies this may cause to gendered legal frameworks (as they stand today) –\n while trying to remedy or mitigate the discrimination faced by queer couples.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\"> 118. Addressing all these aspects and concerns means considering a range of\n policy choices, involving multiplicity of legislative architecture governing the\n regulations, guided by diverse interests and concerns - many of them possibly\n coalescing. On 03.05.2023, during the course of hearing, the learned Solicitor\n General, upon instructions, had expressed the Union’s position that a High-\n powered committee headed by the Union Cabinet Secretary would be formed to\n undertake a comprehensive examination to consider such impacts, and make\n necessary recommendations in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">VII.

Some of the petitioners have challenged <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_1088\">Regulation 5(3)</a> of the 2020\nCARA Regulations. By <a href=\"/doc/62658616/\" id=\"a_1089\">Section 57(2)</a> of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection\nof Children) Act, 2015 (hereafter ‘<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1090\">JJ Act</a>’), consent of both the spouses for adoption\nis necessary (“shall be required”).

The\npetitioners argued that these regulations relating to adoption were ultra vires the\nparent enactment – the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1093\">JJ Act</a>, and arbitrary for classifying couples on the basis of\nmarital status, for the purpose of joint adoption.

The interpretation placed on <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1095\">Section 57(2)</a> of the JJ Act by the learned\nChief Justice, is that it contemplates (joint) adoption by both married and\nunmarried couples, but the condition requiring both spouses to consent applies\nonly to married couples. Therefore, while the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1096\">JJ Act</a> is wider in its scope, the\nCARA <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_1097\">Regulation 5(3)</a> [in furtherance of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1098\">Section 57(5)</a> which delegates power\nto prescribe any other criteria] stipulating a ‘stable marital relationship’ exceeds\nthe power granted by the parent Act, and is ultra vires the express provisions and\nlegislative policy of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1099\">JJ Act</a>. Our disagreement with this characterization is laid\nout in Part A below. Thereafter, the learned Chief Justice has read down offending\npart ‘marital’ from <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_1100\">Regulation 5(3)</a>, and held that the requirement of ‘consent’\nembodied in <a href=\"/doc/942886/\" id=\"a_1101\">Regulation 5(2)(a)</a> would be equally applicable on both married and\nunmarried couples. We are of the firm opinion that the exercise of reading down\nitself, is unsustainable [See part B below] and hence, this consequence though\nfavourable, cannot apply. Our reasoning in relation to the aspect of adoption by\nqueer couples, and the indirect discrimination faced, is elaborated in Part C.\n\n\n\n      A. Not a case of delegated legislation being ultra vires the parent Act\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_165\">122. With respect, we disagree with the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1102\">Section 57(2)</a> of the JJ\nAct itself. A reading of the provision as a whole, makes it amply clear that it\nintends joint adoption only to married couples. While the word “couple” is not\npreceded by ‘married’, the use of “spouse” later in the sentence, rules out any\nother interpretation. The principle of noscitur a sociis (meaning of a word should\nbe known from its accompanying or associating words) is squarely applicable; a\nprovision is to be seen as a whole, wherein words are to be read in the context of\naccompanying or associating words. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"942016\" id=\"span_301\">In <a href=\"/doc/942016/\" id=\"a_1103\">K.

The\n          pristine principle based on the maxim noscitur a sociis (meaning of a word\n          should be known from its accompanying or associating words) has much\n          relevance in understanding the import of words in a statutory provision.”\n\nFurthermore, such an interpretation – of construing a part of one provision as\noperating to one set of people, and not others, is simply not known to law.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_166\">123. To read <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1104\">Section 57(2)</a> as enabling both married and unmarried couples to\nadopt, but that the statutory provision contemplates a restriction or requirement\nof ‘consent’ only on the former kind of couple is not based on any known principle\nof interpretation. There is a strong legislative purpose in the requirement of\nobtaining consent of the spouse, which is rooted in the best interest of the child;\nfor their welfare, and security. The parent Act, and delegated legislation, both are\nclear that a prospective adoptive parent can be a single person (whether\nunmarried, widower, etc.) and on them, there exists no restriction other than on a\nsingle male being barred from adopting a girl child. The restriction of ‘consent’\nof partner, applies only in the case of a couple. This is because the child will enter\ninto a family unit – consisting of two parents, as a result of the adoption and will\nin reality, enjoy the home that is made of both partners. Acceptance, therefore, of\nthe other partner, is imperative; it would not be in the best interest of the child if\none of the partners was unwilling to take on the responsibility. The only other\nlegislative model is <a href=\"/doc/1698417/\" id=\"a_1105\">Section 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1494822/\" id=\"a_1106\">8</a> of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act,\n1956 which mandates consent of both spouses (which much like other personal\nlaws, uses the gendered language of “wife” and “husband”).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">124. Therefore, given that we differ on the starting point itself – that <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1107\">section\n57(2)</a> of the JJ Act permits joint adoption by both married and unmarried couples\n(as held by the learned Chief Justice) – we are of the considered opinion that is\nnot a case of delegated legislation being ultra vires the parent Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">125. The legislative choice, of limiting joint adoption only to married couples\nneeds to be understood in the broader context of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1108\">JJ Act</a>, and its purpose –\nwhich is the best interest of the child are paramount. Legal benefits and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">\f                                            66</span>\n\n\nentitlements, flow either from/in relation to the individual adopting (when a\nsingle person adopts), or the married couple adopting as a unit. In the case of\nbereavement, of such single parent, custody of the child may be taken by a relative\nin the former, whereas continued by the surviving spouse, in the latter. But\nconsider, that in the case of a married couple – there is a breakdown of marriage,\nor simply abandonment/neglect of one partner and the child, by the other. There\nare protections in the law, as they stand today, that enable such deserted, or\nneglected spouse, to receive as a matter of statutory right – maintenance, and\naccess to other protections. Undoubtedly, the DV Act offers this protection even\nto those in an unmarried live-in relationship, but consider a situation that does not\ninvolve domestic violence, and is plain and simple a case of neglect, or worse,\ndesertion. It is arguable that both partners, are equally responsible for the child\nafter the factum of adoption; however – it begs the question, how can one enforce\nthe protection that is due to this child?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">126. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1109\">The JJ Act</a> merely enables adoption, but for all other consequences (i.e.,\nrelating to the rights of a child qua their parents, and in turn obligations of a parent\ntowards the said child) reference has to be made to prevailing law (law relating\nto marriage and divorce, maintenance, succession, guardianship, custody, etc.).\nWhen a single person adopts as an individual, their capabilities are assessed as\nper <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1110\">Section 57(1)</a> [and <a href=\"/doc/33946/\" id=\"a_1111\">Regulation 5(1)</a>], and the responsibility of that child – falls\nsquarely on this individual. If that person enters into a relationship, whether it\nlater succeeds, or fails, is immaterial – the responsibility of the child remains\nsquarely on the individual (until they are married, and the partner legally adopts\nthe child). When a couple adopts, they are jointly assessed, and in law, the\nresponsibility falls on both parents. If one parent was to abandon the relationship,\nand the other parent is unable to maintain themselves or the child by themselves–\nrecourse lies in other statutory provisions which enable remedy to be sought. To\nread the law in the manner adopted by the learned Chief Justice, with all due\nrespect, would have disastrous outcomes, because the ecosystem of law as it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">\f                                         67</span>\n\n\nexists, would be unable to guarantee protection to the said child in the case of\nbreakdown of an unmarried couple, adopting jointly. This, therefore, would not\nbe in the best interest of the child.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_170\">  B. Not a case for reading down or other interpretive construction\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_171\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_306\">127. Counsel relied on the case of <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_1112\">X v. Principal Secretary</a> (supra) where this\ncourt read down ‘married woman’ to just ‘woman’ for the purpose of\ninterpretating the MTPA Act, to argue that a similar interpretation be adopted for\nthe law relating to adoption. In our considered opinion, that case was on a\ndifferent footing altogether – it related to an individual woman’s right to choice\nand privacy, affecting her bodily autonomy. Given the fundamental right that each\nchildbearing individual has, and the objective of the Act, the classification on the\nbasis of marital status, was wholly arbitrary. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1113\">The JJ Act</a> and its regulations are on\na different footing. Here, the object of the Act and guiding principle, is the best\ninterest of the child (and not to enable adoption for all).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_172\">128. It is agreeable that all marriages may not provide a stable home, and that a\ncouple tied together in marriage are not a ‘morally superior choice’, or per se\nmake better parents. Undoubtedly, what children require is a safe space, love,\ncare, and commitment – which is also possible by an individual by themselves,\nor a couple– married or unmarried. There is no formula for a guaranteed stable\nhousehold. Principally, these are all conclusions we do not differ with. As a\nsociety, and in the law, we have come a long way from the limited conception of\na nuclear family with gendered roles, and privileging this conception of family\nover other ‘atypical’ families. However, the fact that Parliament has made the\nlegislative choice of including only ‘married’ couples for joint adoption (i.e.,\nwhere two parents are legally responsible), arises from the reality of all other laws\nwherein protections and entitlements, flow from the institution of marriage. To\nread down ‘marital’ status as proposed, may have deleterious impacts, that only\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">\f                                         68</span>\n\n\nthe legislature and executive, could remedy – making this, much like the\ndiscussion on interpretation of SMA, an outcome that cannot be achieved by the\njudicial pen. Having said this, however, there is a discriminatory impact on queer\ncouples, perhaps most visible through this example of adoption and its regulation,\nthat requires urgent state intervention (elaborated in Part C).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_173\">129. Furthermore, the previous analysis of SMA has led this Court to conclude\nthat its provisions cannot be modified through any process of interpretation and\nthat the expression “spouse” means husband and wife or a male and female as the\ncase may be, on an overall reading of its various provisions. By <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_1114\">Section 2(64)</a> of\nthe JJ Act, expressions not defined in that Act have the same meanings as defined\nin other enactments. The SMA is one example. Likewise, the other enacted laws\nwith respect to adoption is the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. That\ncontains the expression “wife and husband”. In these circumstances, we are of\nthe opinion that the manner in which <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1115\">Section 57(2)</a> is cast, necessitating the\nexistence of both spouse and their consent for adoption of a child. In such a\nrelationship, <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_1116\">Regulation 5(3)</a> cannot be read down in the manner suggested by the\nlearned Chief Justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">130. Therefore, in our opinion, whilst the argument of the petitioners is merited\non some counts, at the same time, the reading down of the provision as sought for\nwould result in the anomalous outcome that heterosexual couples who live\ntogether, but choose not to marry, may adopt a child together and would now be\nindirect beneficiaries, without the legal protection that other statutes offer –\nmaking it unworkable (much like the discussion on SMA in Part V).\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">  C. Discriminatory impact of adoption regulations on queer persons\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">131. <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1117\">Section 57(2)</a> of that Act spells out the eligibility conditions of prospective\nadoptive parents. The petitioner’s argument was that the expression “marital”\nresults in discrimination inasmuch as single parent can adopt – the only\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">\f                                         69</span>\n\n\nprohibition being that a single man cannot adopt a girl child. Further, if a single\nman and/or a single woman choose to adopt separately as an individual, and live\ntogether, the resultant de facto parents would still have a choice of marrying each\nother – for the child in question to be legally the child of both parents. Or put\ndifferently, if a heterosexual couple wants to adopt a child jointly, they have the\noption of entering into a marriage, thereby making them eligible for joint\nadoption. However, in the absence of legal recognition of a queer couple union,\nthey are left to adopt as individuals and the resultant de facto family would have\nno avenue for legal recognition. This iniquitous result too is an aspect which\nneeds to be addressed as the impact here is not only on the queer couple (who\nhave no avenue to seek legal recognition of their union) but also upon the children\nadopted by them (who have no say in the matter).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">132. Furthermore, given the social reality that queer couples are having to adopt\nin law as individuals, but are residing together and for all purposes raising these\nchildren together – means that the State arguably has an even more urgent need\nto enable the full gamut of rights to such children, qua both parents. For instance,\nin an unforeseen circumstance of death of the partner who adopted the child as an\nindividual, the child in question may well become the ward of such deceased’s\nrelatives, who might (or might not) even be known to the child, whereas the\nsurviving partner who has been a parent to the child for all purposes, is left a\nstranger in the law. Therefore, this is yet another consequence of the non-\nrecognition of queer unions, that the State has to address and eliminate, by\nappropriate mitigating measures.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">133. This is not to say that unmarried couples – whether queer or heterosexual–\nare not capable or suitable, to be adoptive parents. However, once the law permits,\nas it has done – adoption by both single individuals, the likelihood of their joining\nand co-habiting cannot be ruled out. In such event, de facto family unit can and\ndo come about. The underlying assumption in the law as it exists, that such\nunmarried heterosexual or queer couples should not adopt needs to be closely\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">\f                                          70</span>\n\n\nexamined. Similarly, the need of such couples to have and raise a family in every\nsense of the term, has to be accommodated within the framework of the law,\nsubject to the best interests of the child. The existing state of affairs which permits\nsingle individuals to adopt, and later to live as a couple in due exercise of their\nchoice, in effect deprives the children of such relationships various legal and\nsocial benefits, which are otherwise available to children of a married couple. In\nother words, given the objective of <a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1118\">Section 57</a> and other allied provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_1119\">JJ Act</a>, which is beneficial for children, the State as parens patriae needs to\nexplore every possibility and not rule out any policy or legislative choice to\nensure that the maximum welfare and benefits reach the largest number of\nchildren in need of safe and secure homes with a promise for their fullest\ndevelopment. This aspect is extremely important given that a large number of\nchildren remain neglected, or orphaned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\">134. It goes without saying that the welfare and the benefit of the children is\nparamount in every case, and the State has the duty to act as parens patriae. That\nour country has countless children who are orphaned or neglected, and in need of\nloving homes, is not lost on us – and is certainly a concern that the State is most\nacutely aware of. In these circumstances, it would be in the general interest of all\nchildren that such impact is removed at the earliest instance, after undertaking in-\ndepth study and analysis of the various permutations and combinations that would\narise in opening adoption more widely, without hampering the child’s rights. In\nits exercise of reframing the regulations or laws, it is reiterated that the State\ncannot, on any account, make regulations that are facially or indirectly\ndiscriminatory on the ground of sexual orientation. It would be entirely wrong, if\nthe observations herein, are construed as saying that the State should hamper or\ninterfere in queer persons who have in the past, or are seeking to adopt as\nindividuals. These observations are to be construed to enable the state to consider\nall options, and implications, with the object of promoting the best welfare of\nchildren, especially whether joint adoption can be facilitated to such willing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">\f                                          71</span>\n\n\ncouples, even while ensuring that the legal web of statutory protections and\nentitlements guaranteed to children, are operationalised for these children as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">135. These observations are not meant to impede all possibilities and make all\nnecessary policy and legislative changes, enabling children’s welfare. In other\nwords, the possibility of queer couples adopting children, should be given equal\nconcern and consideration having regard to the larger interest of the largest\nnumber of children and their development.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">IX.   Moulding relief\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">136. The breadth and amplitude of this court’s jurisdiction is incontestable. The\nconstitution framers created this as a fundamental right in most emphatic terms.\nThis jurisdiction enables the court to create and fashion remedies suited for the\noccasion, oftentimes unconstrained by previous decisions. Yet the breadth of this\npower is restrained by the awareness that it is in essence judicial. The court may\nfeel the wisdom of a measure or norm that is lacking; nevertheless, its role is not\nto venture into functions which the constitution has authorised other departments\nand organs to discharge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\">137. Social acceptance is an important aspect of the matrimonial relationship,\nbut that is not the only reality; even in the exercise of choice by the parties to a\nmarriage, there may be no acceptance at all, by members of their respective\nfamilies; others too may shun them. Yet, their relationship has the benefit of the\ncover of the law, since the law would recognize their relationship, and afford\nprotection, and extend benefits available to married persons. This however eludes\nthose living in non-heterosexual unions, who have no such recognition in all those\nintersections with laws and regulations that protect individual and personal\nentitlements that are earned, welfare based, or compensatory. The impact,\ntherefore, is discriminatory.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_311\">138. Does the existence of such discriminatory impacts, in these intersections\nwith the state, and arising out of a variety of regulations and laws, impel this court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">\f                                                    72</span>\n\n\nto fashion a remedy, such as a declaration, which enjoin legislative activity, or\ninstruct the executive to act in a specified manner, i.e., achieving non-\nheterosexual couple marriage? This aspect cannot be viewed in isolation, but in\nthe context of our constitution’s entrenchment of separation of powers, which\naccording to <a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_1120\">Kesavananda Bharati</a> (supra), Indira Gandhi119 and other judgments\nconstitutes an essential feature of the Constitution. It is one thing for this court,\nto commend to the state, to eliminate the discriminatory impact of the\nintersections with laws and publicly administered policies and institutions, upon\nnon-heterosexual couples, and entirely another, to indirectly hold that through a\nconflation of positive obligations cast on the State, that such individuals’ right to\nchoice to cohabit and form abiding relationships, extends to the right (or some\nentitlement) to a legally recognised union that must be actualized by State\npolicy/legislation.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1031794\" id=\"span_313\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1031794\" id=\"span_314\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"777973\" id=\"span_315\">139.

The approach of <a href=\"/doc/777973/\" id=\"a_1136\">Common Cause</a> (supra) as can be seen from the varied\nopinions of the Judges forming the Bench was one of seeing the workability and\nthe need to elaborate guidelines formulated in <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_1137\">Aruna Shanbaug</a> (supra). The\nCourt had no occasion, really speaking, but to consider whether the directions\ngiven could not have been given.

The Court\ntook note of international conventions and instruments and also held that\nguidelines had to be formulated for enforcement of Fundamental Rights till a\nsuitable law is made. The Court expressly indicated what kind of behaviour was\nsexual harassment (para 2 of the guidelines) and further that regulations had to be\nformulated for prohibited sexual harassment and providing for appropriate\npenalties at workplace. Other directions were that if the conduct amounted to an\noffence, the employer had to initiate appropriate action according to law and also\nensure that the victims had to be given the option of transfer of their perpetrator\nor their own transfer. Furthermore, disciplinary action in terms of the rules was\ndirected with a further requirement that necessary amendments were to be carried\nout. The Court then went on to request the State to consider adopting suitable\nmeasures indicating legislation to ensure that the guidelines in the order were\nemployed by the Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1031794\" id=\"span_340\">143. Central to the idea of issuing directions or guidelines in <a href=\"/doc/1031794/\" id=\"a_1144\">Vishaka</a> (supra)\nwas the felt need to address a living concern - that of providing redressal against\nsocially repressible conduct suffered by women in the course of employment. The\nCourt stepped in, so to say, to regulate this behaviour in public places, which\nthough not criminalized or outlawed (other than in the limited context of <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_1145\">Section\n354</a> IPC) actually tended towards criminal behaviour. The Court articulated the\nconstitutional vision for bringing about gender parity and to that end, elimination\nof practices which tended to lower the dignity and worth of women through\nunacceptable behaviour. Guided by <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_1146\">Article 15(3)</a>, the court stepped in, while\nlimiting itself to regulate workplaces essential in the public field (State or State\nagencies). The Union of India was actively involved and in fact had given\nsuggestions, at the time of formulation of these guidelines. At the same time, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_341\">\f                                         75</span>\n\n\ncourt realized its limitation and declared that such guidelines shall continue till\nappropriate laws are made. Existing service rules were in fact amended to\naccommodate these concerned, to the extent of incorporating the forums through\nwhich such grievance could be articulated. This later culminated in the Sexual\nHarassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act,\n2013 which applies not merely to public but all establishments.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">144. In NALSA (supra), the Court again was confronted with an acute concern\nwherein the personhood of transgender persons itself, was not recognized. The\ncourt held that the intrinsic worth of every individual and the value of individuals\nto fully realise their rights, was a premise embedded in the Constitution. The\nCourt sought to address hostile discriminatory practices, which included violence\nthat transgender persons were subjected to routinely. Given all these\ncircumstances, the Court located the right of those identifying themselves as\ntransgender persons squarely under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1147\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Any\ndiscriminatory practice against such persons, would violate their <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1148\">Article 15</a> right\nunder the Constitution. The directions given by the Court were that such persons\nshould be treated as third gender, where appropriate, and granted legal protection\nto their self-identified gender identity. Further, that the State and Central\nGovernment should seriously address problems faced by them by providing\nmeasures for medical care and facilities in hospitals, permitting them access to\nsocial welfare schemes for their betterment and take other measures. The court\nalso constituted an expert committee to make an in-depth study of problems faced\nby transgender persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1031794\" id=\"span_342\">145. In the present case, however, the approach adopted in the above three cases\nwould not be suitable. The court would have to fashion a parallel legal regime,\ncomprising of defined entitlements and obligations. Furthermore, such\nframework containing obligations would cast responsibilities upon private\ncitizens and not merely the State. The learned Chief Justice’s conclusions also do\nnot point towards directions of the kind contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1031794/\" id=\"a_1149\">Vishaka</a> (supra).</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">\f                                         76</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">However, the outlining of a bouquet of rights and indication that there is a\nseparate constitutional right to union enjoyed by queer couples, with the\nconcomitant obligation on the State to accord recognition to such union, is what\nwe take exception to.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_195\">X.    Conclusion and directions\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">146. Marriage, in the ultimate context, is not defined merely by the elements,\nwhich delineate some of its attributes, and the differing importance to them,\ndepending on times, such as permanence of a sexual partner; procreation and\nraising of children, stability to family, and recognition in the wider society. Some,\nor most of these elements may be absent in many relationships: there may be no\nprocreative possibility due to choice, or otherwise; some marriages may have no\nwider context, such as absence of the larger family circle, due to several reasons,\nincluding alienation or estrangement; there may be no matrimonial home, in some\nmarriage, because of constraints including spouses being located in different\nplaces; some marriages may be (by choice or otherwise) bereft of physical or\nsexual content. Yet, these marriages might be as successful, as fulfilling and\ncomplete as any other. The reason, in this author’s opinion, is that at its core,\nmarriage has signified companionship, friendship, care and spiritual\nunderstanding a oneness, which transcends all other contents, and contexts. Thus,\n“home” is not a physical structure; it is rather the space where the two individuals\nexist, caring, breathing and thinking, living for each other. This is how\ntraditionally it has been understood.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">147. This feeling need not be unique to marriage; and in fact has come to be\nenjoyed by many without the cover of it (for e.g., those who are simply in\ncommitted cohabitational relationships). While many others, may only be able to\nexperience such a feeling and way of life, if it were to have the legitimacy in\nsociety, akin to marriage. That law has the potential to play such a legitimising\nrole, cannot be overstated. The feeling of exclusion that comes with this status\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">\f                                         77</span>\n\n\nquo, is undoubtedly one which furthers the feeling of exclusion on a daily basis,\nin society for members of the queer community. However, having concluded that\nthere exists no fundamental right to marry, or a right to claim a status for the\nrelationship, through the medium of a law (or legal regime) and acknowledged\nthe limitations on this court in moulding relief, this court must exercise restraint;\nit cannot enjoin a duty or obligation on the State to create a framework for civil\nunion or registered partnership, or marriage, or abiding co-habitational\nrelationship. Yet, it would be appropriate to note that everyone enjoys the right to\nchoice, dignity, non-discrimination, and privacy. In a responsive and\nrepresentative democracy which our country prides itself in being, such right to\nexercise choices should be given some status and shape. Of course, what that\nshould be cannot be dictated by courts. At the same time, prolonged inactivity by\nlegislatures and governments can result in injustices. Therefore, action in this\nregard, would go a long way in alleviating this feeling of exclusion that\nundoubtedly persists in the minds and experiences, of this community.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_198\">148. The resultant adverse impact suffered by the petitioners in relation to\nearned benefits [as elaborated in Part VI], solely because of the State’s choice to\nnot recognise their (social) union or relationship, is one which results in their\ndiscrimination. This discriminatory impact – cannot be ignored, by the State; the\nState has a legitimate interest necessitating action. The form of action – whether\nit will be by enacting a new umbrella legislation, amendments to existing statutes,\nrules, and regulations that as of now, disentitle a same-sex partner from benefits\naccruing to a ‘spouse’ (or ‘family’ as defined in the heteronormative sense), etc.–\nare policy decisions left to the realm of the legislature and executive. However,\nthe recognition that their non-inclusion in a legal framework which entitles them,\nand is a prerequisite eligibility criteria for myriad earned and accrued benefits,\nprivileges, and opportunities has harsh and unjust discriminatory consequences,\namounting to discrimination violating their fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1150\">Article 15</a> –\nis this court’s obligation, falling within its remit. The State has to take suitable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_345\">\f                                          78</span>\n\n\nremedial action to mitigate the discriminatory impact experienced by the\nmembers of the queer community, in whatever form it deems fit after undertaking\ndue and necessary consultation from all parties, especially all state governments\nand union territories, since their regulations and schemes too would have to be\nsimilarly examined and addressed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">149. This court hereby summarizes its conclusions and directions as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">  i.   There is no unqualified right to marriage except that recognised by statute\n       including space left by custom.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\"> ii.   An entitlement to legal recognition of the right to union – akin to marriage\n       or civil union, or conferring legal status upon the parties to the relationship\n       can be only through enacted law. A sequitur of this is that the court cannot\n       enjoin or direct the creation of such regulatory framework resulting in legal\n       status.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">iii.   The finding in (i) and (ii) should not be read as to preclude queer persons\n       from celebrating their commitment to each other, or relationship, in\n       whichever way they wish, within the social realm.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">iv.    Previous judgments of this court have established that queer and LGBTQ+\n       couples too have the right to union or relationship (under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1151\">Article 21</a>) – “be\n       it mental, emotional or sexual” flowing from the right to privacy, right to\n       choice, and autonomy. This, however, does not extend to a right to claim\n       entitlement to any legal status for the said union or relationship.\n v.    The challenge to the SMA on the ground of under classification is not made\n       out. Further, the petitioner’s prayer to read various provisions in a ‘gender\n       neutral’ manner so as to enable same-sex marriage, is unsustainable.\nvi.    Equality and non-discrimination are basic foundational rights. The indirect\n       discriminatory impacts in relation to earned or compensatory benefits, or\n       social welfare entitlements for which marital status is a relevant eligibility\n       factor, for queer couples who in their exercise of choice form relationships,\n       have to be suitably redressed and removed by the State. These measures\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_346\">\f                                          79</span>\n\n\n        need to be taken with expedition because inaction will result in injustice\n        and unfairness with regard to the enjoyment of such benefits, available to\n        all citizens who are entitled and covered by such laws, regulations or\n        schemes (for instance, those relating to employment benefits: provident\n        fund, gratuity, family pension, employee state insurance; medical\n        insurance; material entitlements unconnected with matrimonial matters,\n        but resulting in adverse impact upon queer couples). As held earlier, this\n        court cannot within the judicial framework engage in this complex task;\n        the State has to study the impact of these policies, and entitlements.\nvii.    Consistent with the statement made before this Court during the course of\n        proceedings on 03.05.2023, the Union shall set up a high-powered\n        committee chaired by the Union Cabinet Secretary, to undertake a\n        comprehensive examination of all relevant factors, especially including\n        those outlined above. In the conduct of such exercise, the concerned\n        representatives of all stakeholders, and views of all States and Union\n        Territories shall be taken into account.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">viii.   The discussion on discriminatory impacts is in the context of the effects of\n        the existing regimes on queer couples. While a heterosexual couple’s right\n        to live together is not contested, the logic of the discriminatory impact\n        [mentioned in conclusion (vi) above] faced by queer couples cohabiting\n        together, would definitionally, however, not apply to them.\n ix.

The learned Chief Justice in his response seeks to highlight that the Court\nhas in the past exercised its powers under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1157\">Article 32</a> in respect of enforcement of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">\f                                         81</span>\n\n\nvarious fundamental rights and cited certain precedents. A close look at each of\nthem would reveal that in almost all cases, the Court enforced facets of personal\nliberty, or an aspect that was the subject of legislation. The allusion to cases\ndealing with subjects, particularly, incarceration of persons with mental\ndisabilities (Sheela Barse126), the right to speedy trial (<a href=\"/doc/1970738/\" id=\"a_1158\">State of Punjab v.

The reference to cases dealing with clean environment, is also a\nfacet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1159\">Article 21.</a> In fact, there are enacted laws in the field of environment\nprotection.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"973841\" id=\"span_354\">The allusion to the directions in <a href=\"/doc/973841/\" id=\"a_1160\">PUCL v.

It was held that direction\nwas not to supervise the action but only to the apprise state of the inaction to bring\nabout a sense of urgency. The court also observed importantly that it is primarily\nwithin the domain of the executive to determine the urgency and manner of\npriorities of the need of any law. This court by its judgment even observed that\nthere was nothing wrong in such directions, since a sanction for the road had been\nobtained but there was tardy implementation of the same.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_204\">152. That certain fundamental rights have positive content, or obligation, is not\ndisputed – in fact, in paragraph 57 this has been elaborated; exception was instead\ntaken to the approach suggested by the learned Chief Justice, of tracing the right\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_356\">126</span>\n    1993 Supp (1) SCR 561\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_357\">127</span>\n    1995 (1) SCR 496\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">128</span>\n    1995 Supp (2) SCR 733\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_359\">129</span>\n    W.P.(C)196/2001\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_360\">130</span>\n    1986 (1) SCR 251\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_361\">\f                                          82</span>\n\n\nto union from a conjoint reading of multiple Articles (clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1162\">Article 19</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1163\"><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1164\">, 25</a></a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1165\"><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1166\">21</a>)</a>, as necessitating the creation of a legal status to the relationship (a result\nof the obligation to “accord recognition”) and enunciation of a bouquet of\nentitlements flowing from this [see paragraph 336(i)]. With respect, such a\ndirection is in the nature of creating a legal status. Further, the discussion on the\nabsence of law, and limited extent of positive rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1167\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1168\">25</a> in\nour opinion, was in fact to insist that rather than ordering liberties and\nenumerating every possible right or the way in which it is to be enjoyed, the\ncontent of fundamental rights are that they take up all the space, until restricted –\nwhich can be tested on the ground of its reasonableness, as per the limitations in\nPart III. This in no manner takes away from the previous jurisprudence of this\nCourt where positive obligation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1169\">Article 21</a> has been expounded to locate\nseveral obligations upon the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_205\">153. This Court’s observations with respect to the learned Chief Justice’s\nreasoning centered around the enunciation of the bouquet of rights emanating\nfrom various provisions other than <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1170\">Article 21 [</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1171\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1172\">25]</a>, and locating an\nobligation, has to be seen in the backdrop of the unanimous view of this Court,\nthat the fundamental right to marry is not found within the Constitution.\nTherefore, it is our considered opinion that to create an overarching obligation\nupon the State to facilitate through policies the fuller enjoyment of rights under\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1173\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1174\">25</a>, is not rooted in any past decision, or jurisprudence. That queer\ncouples have the right to exercise their choice, cohabit and live without\ndisturbance – is incontestable. In the same vein, that they are owed protection\nagainst any threat or coercion to their life, is a positive obligation that binds the\nState– this is a natural corollary of their right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1175\">Article 21.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">154. Consider in this context, also the nature of the relief sought, and the\npositive obligation fashioned. While there are innumerable judgments on the\npositive content of rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1176\">Article 21</a>, there are also countless judgments that\ninsist upon the separation of powers, when it comes to matters of policy, and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_362\">\f                                         83</span>\n\n\ncourts not being the appropriate forum for the adjudication of the same. The\npolycentric nature of the issue, is compelling.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">155. Next, on the charge levelled that our conclusion on the challenge to the\nSMA (Part V of this judgment) and subsequently finding on the disparate or\ndiscriminatory impact faced by the queer community (Part VI) being\ncontradictory – a small comment is called for. The section discussing the\nprovisions of the SMA and the challenge to its validity, was based entirely upon\nwhether it violated the Constitution on the ground of impermissible classification\n(under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1177\">Article 14</a>) – for which, the object of the Act (i.e., to facilitate marriage\nbetween inter-faith couples, wherein at the time ‘marriage’ or even a ‘couple’ only\ndenoted heterosexual couples in light of same sex relations being criminalized),\nand its provisions, are relevant factors. Classification, involves differentiation;\nfurther, this court has discussed how ‘under classification’ per se does not warrant\ninvalidation. In contrast, in the latter segment on discriminatory impact (Part VI),\nthe issue that this court was considering, was not reasonable classification but the\nimpact upon queer couples through neutral laws or regulations that they encounter\nin their everyday lives; the purpose of which, or even their substantive provisions,\nhave nothing to do with matrimony. Its rather to confer other benefits – many of\nwhich are earned or accrued on account of individual skill and attainment. Yet the\nframing of some benefits or their intended beneficiary – wherever articulated in\nterms of entitlement to families or spouses, tends to exclude from its ambit, queer\ncouples and their lived realities. When such queer couples are entitled to benefits\nwherever they fulfil other eligibility criteria; it is the disparate impact of these\nneutral laws in disbursal of entitlements or benefits, which is seen through the\neffect/impact lens. Therefore, the discussion on the constitutionality of the SMA\nis markedly different from the section on discriminatory impact in certain points\nfor queer persons, as they have no avenue for marriage like heterosexual persons.\nIn the latter, the impact of various laws were pointed as a starting point for the\nState to take remedial action.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_363\">\f                                                         84</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">156. What is apparent, however, from our judicial differences and the manner\nin which we have articulated them – is that a certain question, of fair significance,\narises: whether the absence of law or a regulatory framework, or the failure of the\nState to enact law, amounts to discrimination that is protected131 against under\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1178\">Article 15?</a> With respect, this was perhaps neither argued, nor answered by us;\nour opinion is limited to testing the provisions of the SMA for violation of\nfundamental rights and noticing that there are various cracks through which the\nqueer community slip through, in other neutral laws, policies and frameworks,\ndue to the manner in which they privilege marital/spousal status (access to which,\nis not enabled/possible under existing law). <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_1179\">Article 15(1)</a> now, can be understood\nas permitting a classification for the purpose of fashioning policies. Can the\nstate’s omission to create a classification, and further, its absence of a policy for\na distinct group, which in the court’s opinion deserves favourable treatment,\namount to violation of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1180\">Article 15?</a> There is no known jurisprudence or case law\n(yet) pointing to the absence of law being considered as discrimination as\nunderstood under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1181\">Article 15.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">157. The learned Chief Justice has dealt with in some detail on that section of\nour judgment, on adoption [Part VIII]. The underlying premise of his comments\nseek to highlight that the existing legal framework affords protection in the event\nof an unforeseen eventuality like abandonment, or sudden death of one partner. It\nis incontestable that <a href=\"/doc/946336/\" id=\"a_1182\">Section 63</a> of the JJ Act, provides legal status to the child, in\nrelation to their adoptive parent(s). However, that per se, is not adequate to\naddress all concerns relating to the child. There would be difficulties faced by\nchildren, in claiming entitlements such as maintenance, in the absence of a\ngeneral law. The example given by the learned Chief Justice illustrates this:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_364\">benefit under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (which is available only\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_365\">131</span>\n   Sexual orientation has been recognised under ‘sex’ in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1183\">Article 15</a> by this court in <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_1184\">Navtej Johar</a> (supra) and does\nnot merit elaboration, further than to say that any law or policy which directly, or indirectly, discriminates against\na queer individual on the basis of their sexual orientation would fall foul of the Constitution, unless the law is a\npermissible classification.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_366\">\f                                         85</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">to Hindus, but accommodates both genders, unlike other laws). A suggestion of\n<a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_1185\">Section 125</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code would give rise to the same set of\ndifficulties as the earlier discussion on SMA. In other words, to obviate the\ngendered language, an interpretive exercise of the kind ruled out for the\ninterpretation of SMA, would be necessary. It is for these reasons, that we\nhighlighted the need for the State to consider all aspects [para 133-135]. This\ncourt would reiterate that there is no basis for interpreting the term ‘couple’ under\n<a href=\"/doc/1573489/\" id=\"a_1186\">Section 57(2)</a> of the JJ Act as including both married and unmarried couples,\ngiven the use of the word ‘spouse’ in the very same provision. It is pertinent to\nhighlight that <a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_1187\">Section 2(61)</a> of the JJ Act prescribes that expressions not defined,\nwould have the same meaning as in other enactments.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">158. As far as the learned Chief Justice’s comment with respect to this court not\nreading down ‘marital’ or striking down <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_1188\">Regulation 5(3)</a>, the earlier discussion in\nPart VIII clarified that there was a conscious legislative policy while highlighting\nthe interpretation of the term ‘spouse’. At the same time the court recognised the\ndisparate, and even discriminatory impact, on children of individuals, who\nformed de facto families (with their unmarried partner). In our opinion, striking\ndown the term ‘marital’ under <a href=\"/doc/895889/\" id=\"a_1189\">Regulation 5(3)</a> – would likely have unintended\nconsequences, which cannot be comprehended by the court as it involves policy\nconsiderations. This is the reason for desisting from invalidating the provision but\nhaving left it to the State to take measures to remedy these impacts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">159. Lastly, a small note of caution is expressed in relation to a few conclusions\nof our learned brother Kaul, J. There can hardly be any dispute of the positive\noutcomes or the need for a broadly applicable non-discriminatory law (as\nelaborated by Kaul, J). However, the wisdom or unwisdom of such a law, the\nelements that go into its making are matters that are not before this Court to\ncomment on. Nor can we anticipate what would be its content. We are of the\nopinion that it is not possible to hold that a positive obligation to enact such a law\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_367\">\f                                         86</span>\n\n\nexists. We, therefore, expressly place our disagreement with the reasoning of\nKaul, J on this aspect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">160. The known canons of interpretation require the courts to take any statute\nand interpret its provisions keeping in mind their contextual setting. Likewise, the\nmeaning of words have to be understood in the totality of provisions of the statute.\nThus, wherever a word is used, the overall context of its location plays a role;\nsometimes, its meaning changes wherever the context is different. We have hence\nheld that the expressions in the SMA [“wife” and “husband” or “male” and\n“female”] cannot, have a uniform meaning, because there is an intended gendered\nbinary [e.g., male and female] in the specific enacting provisions. As far as inter\nse statutes are concerned, the inexpedience of a singular, gender neutral meaning\nis not a possible outcome, as explained previously. Therefore, it is our considered\nview, that there is no known interpretive tool enabling an exercise inter se and in\nbetween statutes, as held by Kaul, J.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">161. Undoubtedly, constitutional values endure; they are not immutable. To the\nextent it is possible, the statutes may be interpreted in tune with such evolving\nvalues. Yet, statutes are neither ephemeral, nor their terms transient, and are meant\nto confer rights, duties, and obligations – and sometimes impose burdens and\nsanctions. This means that their contents have to be clear and capable of easy\ninterpretation. The text of the statute therefore must be given meaning – any\ninterpretive exercise must therefore begin with the text of the enacted law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">162. The gaps and inadequacies outlined earlier by this judgment result in wide-\nreaching impacts and concern crucial aspects of everyday life. Therefore, the\nrespondents and all institutions should take note of the lived realities of persons\nacross the range of gender identities and suitably prioritize their needs of social\nacceptance. There is also need for a move towards greater acceptance of personal\nchoices and preferences, and an equal marking of our differences in all their\nvaried hues.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_368\">\f                                         87</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">163. In various countries that have since legislated on same-sex marriage, the\nprecursor to this regime was often the civil union route. Known by many names,\nthe concept of civil union enjoys varying rights and entitlements in different\njurisdictions. This was a legal relationship for unmarried, yet committed couples,\nwho cohabited together and sought certain rights, and the protection of law. The\nrights that flowed were not identical in scope or extent of rights arising from\nmarriage, but was still an avenue to provide certain limited, but enforceable\nrights. In the US, for instance this was rolled out by many state governments,\nwhen same-sex marriage was not legalized by the federal government. What\nbegan as an option for same sex couples, to attain financial and legal partnership\n(tax benefits, property rights, child adoption in some jurisdictions, inheritance,\netc.) now remains on the statute books for some states, with which couples who\ndo not want to enter the societal pressures or institution of marriage, are able to\nprotect their rights. However, many advocates for LGBTQ rights have strongly\nopposed civil unions in other jurisdictions, as offering a ‘second class’ status, in\nthe absence of the marriage route. Other alternatives available in some of these\ncountries – the suitability of which have also been subject to criticism of varying\ndegrees, but includes – domestic partnerships, cohabitation agreements, common\nlaw marriages, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">164. This court would be sorely mistaken if we presume what the queer\ncommunity – in all its diversity, seeks and lay it out in a formulaic framework.\nMany may welcome civil unions as a pragmatic first step, while some may find\nit to be yet another inequitable solution to the feeling of exclusion that persists in\nsociety against this community, and one which simply repackages the\nstigmatization felt. Many may desire marriage as understood in the ‘traditional’\nsense to escape their societal realities – a form of financial and social\nemancipation from opposing natal families, or diametrically opposite – to\nassimilate and gain more social acceptance in their natal families. Yet, others may,\nas a result of their experience reject altogether the institution of marriage and all\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_369\">\f                                                        88</span>\n\n\nthe social obligation and associations that come with it, but still want legal\nprotection of their rights. Certainly, what the former group may want, does not\nhamper or hinder the latter, in any manner – for it is a choice that they seek. That\nthe state should facilitate this choice for those who wish to exercise it, is an\noutcome that the community may agree upon. Yet, the modalities of how it should\nplay out, what it will entail, etc. are facets that the State – here the legislature, and\nexecutive – needs to exercise its power in furtherance of. Now whether this will\nhappen through proactive action of the State itself, or as a result of sustained\npublic mobilization– is a reality that will play out on India’s democratic stage,\nand something only time can tell.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">165. The State may choose from a number of policy outcomes; they may make\nall marriage and family related laws gender neutral, or they may create a separate\nSMA-like statute in gender neutral terms to give the queer community an avenue\nfor marriage, they may pass an Act creating civil unions, or a domestic partnership\nlegislation, among many other alternatives. Another consequence may be that\nrather than the Union Government, the State legislatures132 takes action and\nenacts law or frameworks, in the absence of a central law. What is certain\nhowever, is that in questions of such polycentric nature – whether social, or\npolitical – the court must exercise restraint and defer to the wisdom of the other\nbranches of the State, which can undertake wide scale public consultation,\nconsensus building and reflect the will of the people, and be in their best interest.\nIf as a result of this, a law is enacted that undermines or violates the\nconstitutionally protected rights of an individual, or a group – no matter how\nminiscule, their right to seek redressal from this Court is guaranteed under Article\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">32.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">166.

However, we are deeply conscious, that no matter how\nmuch we empathize with the outcome sought, the means to arriving at such a\ndestination, must also be legally sound, and keep intact, the grand architecture of\nour Constitutional scheme. For if we throw caution to the wind, we stand the risk\nof paving the way (wherein each brick may feel justified) to untold consequences\nthat we could not have contemplated.

The right to marriage is a statutory right, and to the extent it is\n                  demonstrable, a right flowing from a legally enforceable\n                  customary practice. In the exercise of such a right, statutory or\n                  customary, the State is bound to extend the protection of law to\n                  individuals, so that they can exercise their choices without fear\n                  and coercion.

There cannot be any quarrel, in my opinion, that marriage is a social institution,\n\n     and that in our country, it is conditioned by culture, religion, customs and\n\n     usages. It is a sacrament in some communities, a contract in some other. State\n\n     regulation in the form of codification, has often reflected the customary and\n\n     religious moorings of the institution of marriage. An exercise to identify the\n\n     purpose of marriage or to find its ‘true’ character, is a pursuit that is as diverse\n\n     and mystic as the purpose of human existence; and therefore, is not suited for\n\n     judicial navigation. But that does not render the institution meaningless or\n\n     abstract for those who in their own way understand and practice it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">6.   In India, the multiverse of marriage as a social institution, is not legally regulated\n\n     by a singular gravitational field. Until the colonial exercise of codification of\n\n     regulations governing marriage and family commenced, the rules governing\n\n     marriage and family, were largely customary, often rooted in religious practice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">     This exercise of codification, not always accurate and many a times\n\n     exclusionary, was the product of the colonial desire to mould and reimagine our\n\n     social institutions. However, what is undeniable is that, impelled by our own\n\n     social reformers, the colonial codification exercise produced some reformatory\n\n     legislative instruments, ushering in some much-needed changes to undo\n\n     systemic inequalities. The constitutional project that we committed ourselves to\n\n     in the year 1950, sought to recraft some of our social institutions and within the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_384\">                                                                                         5</span>\n\f          first half decade of the adoption of the Constitution, our indigenous codification\n\n          and reformation of personal laws regulating marriage and family was underway.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">7.        Even when our own constitutional State attempted codification and reform, it\n\n          left room for customary practices to co-exist, sometimes providing legislative\n\n          heft to such customary practices. <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_1199\">Section 5(iv)</a><a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_1200\">5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1728952/\" id=\"a_1201\">section 5(v)</a><a href=\"/doc/1089523/\" id=\"a_1202\">6</a>, section 77, and\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/1159958/\" id=\"a_1203\">section 29(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/774980/\" id=\"a_1204\">8</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 are illustrative in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_244\">          <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_1205\">Similarly, the Special Marriage Act, 1954</a> in provisos to <a href=\"/doc/847564/\" id=\"a_1206\">sections 4(d)</a><a href=\"/doc/1850073/\" id=\"a_1207\">9</a> and\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_1208\">section 15 (e)</a><a href=\"/doc/1273949/\" id=\"a_1209\">10</a> saves customary practices, without which the marriage would\n\n          have been otherwise null and void.

There is a differential minimum age prescription for male and female\n\n       partners in most legislations. Thus males, who have otherwise attained the age\n\n       of majority, cannot marry under these enactments, even though they exercise\n\n       many other statutory and constitutional rights when they attain the age of\n\n       eighteen.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">11.

In my considered opinion, the institutional space of marriage is conditioned and\n\n      occupied synchronously by legislative interventions, customary practises, and\n\n      religious beliefs. The extant legislative accommodation of customary and\n\n      religious practices is not gratuitous and is to some extent conditioned by the\n\n      right to religion and the right to culture, constitutionally sanctified in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1223\">Articles 25</a>\n\n      and <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_1224\">Article 29</a> of the Constitution of India. This synchronously occupied\n\n      institutional space of marriage, is a product of our social and constitutional\n\n      realities, and therefore, in my opinion, comparative judicial perspectives offer\n\n      little assistance. Given this nature of marriage as an institution, the right to\n\n      choose a spouse and the right of a consenting couple to be recognized within\n\n      the institution of marriage, cannot but be said to be restricted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_250\">13.   The learned Chief Justice has opined that marriage may not attain the social\n\n      and legal significance it currently has if the State had not recognised and\n\n      regulated it through law. It is further opined that marriage has attained\n\n      significance because of the benefits which are realised through it. In this\n\n      context, it is necessary to recount that until the post constitutional codification\n\n      of laws relating to marriage and divorce, there was no significant State\n\n      intervention on customary laws relating to marriage. Even today, much of the\n\n      Mohammedan law of marriage is governed by religious texts and customs and\n\n      there is hardly any State intervention. The Sixth Schedule areas under the\n\n      Constitution are largely governed by customary laws of marriage. That the State\n\n      has chosen to regulate the institutional space of marriage and even if such\n\n      regulation occupies the space in toto, by itself does not imply that marriage\n\n      attained significance due to State recognition.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_401\">                                                                                          9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_402\">14.      I must hasten to add that the aforesaid recollection of legislative illustrations\n\n         was with a view to demonstrate the cultural relativism involved in the idea of\n\n         marriage. No singular right can inform unimpeded entry to and unregulated exit\n\n         from the institution of marriage; for that would disassociate the institution of\n\n         marriage from its social context. The claim of the right to marry, de-hors the\n\n         existing statutory framework, is nothing but a claim to create a legally and\n\n         socially enforceable status. It is not a claim against criminalisation of sexual\n\n         conduct, which was the issue in <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_1225\">Navtej</a> (supra). It is nothing but a prayer of\n\n         mandamus to create the necessary legislative and policy space for recognition\n\n         of relationships as marriages in the eyes of law. The prayer to recognize such\n\n         a right is not one that expects the State to desist from pursuing an act, but one\n\n         which will place positive obligations upon the State to erect new laws, or at least\n\n         amend existing laws. I say laws, because marriage laws do not stand in\n\n         isolation, they interact in multifarious ways with succession, inheritance and\n\n         adoption laws, to name a few. The content of the right claimed by the Petitioners\n\n         is such that it clearly places positive legislative obligations on the State, and\n\n         therefore, cannot be acceded to. That there cannot be a mandamus to amend\n\n         or enact laws, is such a deeply entrenched constitutional aphorism, which need\n\n         not be burdened by quotational jurisprudence. We are afraid, that the creation\n\n         of social institutions and consequent re-ordering of societal relationships are\n\n         ‘polycentric decisions’, which have “multiplicity of variable and interlocking\n\n         factors, decisions on each one of which presupposes a decision on all others”18,\n\n         decisions that cannot be rendered by one stroke of the judicial gavel.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_403\">  18</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160389977\" id=\"span_404\"><a href=\"/doc/160389977/\" id=\"a_1226\">Indian Ex-Service Movement v.

Having concluded that there exists no unqualified right to marry, in the ordinary\n\n      course, no occasion would have arisen for any further deliberation. However,\n\n      as the learned Chief Justice, in his opinion, has arrived at a conclusion that\n\n      there exists a constitutional right to a union or an abiding cohabitational\n\n      relationship, it is necessary for me to express my opinion on this new\n\n      construction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_255\">16.   The learned Chief Justice locates components of this right to union or an\n\n      abiding cohabitational relationship under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1227\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_1228\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_1229\">Article\n\n      19(1)(e)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1230\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1231\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution. In my opinion, it would not\n\n      be constitutionally permissible to identify a right to a union or an abiding\n\n      cohabitational relationship mirroring the institution of marriage. The learned\n\n      Chief Justice identifies ‘tangible’ and ‘intangible’ benefits (bouquet of\n\n      entitlements) that arise from state recognition and regulation of marriages. The\n\n      Chief Justice further opines that the right to marriage is not fundamental.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">      However, it is these very tangible and intangible benefits, the denial of which,\n\n      according to the learned Chief Justice must inform the reading of a\n\n      constitutional right to an abiding cohabitational union. In other words, the\n\n      benefits of marriage, however fundamental to a fulfilling life do not make\n\n      marriage itself a fundamental right, but they render the right to an abiding\n\n      cohabitational union fundamental. I find it difficult to reconcile these.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_257\">17.   The learned Chief Justice opines that “it is insufficient if persons have the ability\n\n      and freedom to form relationships unregulated by the State. For the full\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_406\">                                                                                        11</span>\n\f      enjoyment of such relationships, it is necessary that the State accord\n\n      recognition to such relationships. Thus, the right to enter into a union includes\n\n      the right to associate with a partner of one’s choice, according recognition to\n\n      the association, and ensuring that there is no denial of access to basic goods\n\n      and services is crucial to achieve the goal of self-development.” The opinion of\n\n      the Chief Justice, thereafter, classifies that status of two persons in relationship:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">      (a) ‘relationships’ which do not have legal consequences, (b) ‘unions’ which\n\n      have legal consequences and marriages. In my considered opinion, it is in\n\n      positively mandating the State to grant recognition or legal status to ‘unions’\n\n      from which benefits will flow, that the doctrine of separation of powers is\n\n      violated. The framing of a positive right and the positive entitlements which flow\n\n      therefrom, essentially require the State to regulate such unions and benefits.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_258\">      In my opinion, the direction in effect, is to amend existing statutory frameworks,\n\n      if not to legislate afresh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_259\">18.   Additionally, the opinion of the learned Chief Justice, situates the right to choice\n\n      of a partner and right to legal recognition of an abiding cohabitational\n\n      relationship within <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1232\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution of India. Emphasis is placed on\n\n      the term “freedom of conscience” which is placed alongside the right to freely\n\n      profess, practice and propagate religion. The opinion situates in this freedom of\n\n      conscience, the right not only to judge the moral quality of one’s own action but\n\n      also to act upon it. If that were permissible under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1233\">Article 25</a>, then the textual\n\n      enumeration of freedoms in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1234\">Article 19</a> become redundant, since these freedoms\n\n      can be claimed to be actions on the basis of one’s own moral judgment. I find it\n\n      difficult to agree with such a reading of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1235\">Article 25.</a>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_407\">                                                                                        12</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">\f19.   I am not oblivious to the concerns of the LGBTQ+ partners with respect to denial\n\n      of access to certain benefits and privileges that are otherwise available only to\n\n      married couples. The general statutory scheme for the flow of benefits\n\n      gratuitous or earned; property or compensation; leave or compassionate\n\n      appointment, proceed on a certain definitional understanding of partner,\n\n      dependant, caregiver, and family. In that definitional understanding, it is no\n\n      doubt true, that certain classes of individuals, same-sex partners, live-in\n\n      relationships and non-intimate care givers including siblings are left out. The\n\n      impact of some of these definitions is iniquitous and in some cases\n\n      discriminatory. The policy considerations and legislative frameworks underlying\n\n      these definitional contexts are too diverse to be captured and evaluated within\n\n      a singular judicial proceeding. I am of the firm belief that a review of the impact\n\n      of legislative framework on the flow of such benefits requires a deliberative and\n\n      consultative exercise, which exercise the legislature and executive are\n\n      constitutionally suited, and tasked, to undertake.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_261\">20.
