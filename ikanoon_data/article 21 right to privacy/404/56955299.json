It is stated that\n                          the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_10\">Competition Act, 2002</a>, allows a complainant to set the\n                          law in motion by providing information akin to a first information report\n                          under the criminal law, meaning post its initiation, the complainants do not\n                          have any further role to play. It is, therefore, stated that the impleadment of\n                          BAI, despite it being one among the many complainants on the basis of\n                          whose report investigation under Suo Moto Case No. 2 of 2019 was initiated\n                          with no special footing, has led to a change in the nature of the enquiry to\n                          one of an adversarial nature despite being initiated on Suo Moto basis by the\n                          CCI.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Signing Date:19.12.2023   W.P.(C) 9854/2023                                                     Page 5 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">11:00:32</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                           12.    It is also stated that CCI, by way of an earlier Order dated 29.12.2021,\n                          had rejected the impleadment application of BAI and that the impugned\n                          Order dated 05.07.2023 allowing its impleadment is tantamount to a de facto\n                          review of the Order dated 29.12.2021, despite there not being any change in\n                          facts or circumstances in the intervening period. Moreover, it is stated that\n                          the CCI passed the impugned Order dated 05.07.2023 by stating that BAI\n                          has a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceeding and its opinions\n                          are necessary for a meaningful enquiry without establishing as to how it has\n                          reached its satisfaction of the same. It is further stated that such a power of\n                          reviewing and recalling of its orders does not vest with CCI as <a href=\"/doc/1951562/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 37</a>\n                          which grants CCI the power to do so has been expressly taken away by way\n                          of a repeal, and thereby, the passage of the impugned Order dated\n                          05.07.2023 is a clear violation of the provisions of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                          13.    It is further stated that <a href=\"/doc/1537115/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 57</a> of the Act lays out that no\n                          information relating to any enterprise being obtained by CCI for the purpose\n                          of the Act shall be disclosed without prior permission in writing of the\n                          enterprise and <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 36</a> of the Act accords the principles of natural justice\n                          to all proceedings before the tribunal. The Petitioner states that the\n                          impugned Order dated 05.07.2023 is contrary to the provisions of the Act\n                          insofar as access has been provided to BAI for inspection of the non-\n                          confidential records in the matter pertaining to Suo Moto Case No. 2 of\n                          2019, which include submissions by the Petitioner. It is stated that such an\n                          access has been granted where neither any prior permission was granted by\n                          the Petitioner as under <a href=\"/doc/1537115/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 57</a> of the Act, nor was the Petitioner or any\n                          affected party who have a direct and substantial interest in the matter present\n                          or given a prior notice and an opportunity of being heard.

Therefore, such an impleadment, despite the presence of an\n                          efficacious alternate remedy, is stated by the Petitioner as being unwarranted\n                          and untenable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                          18.    Per contra, learned Counsel for the CCI contends that the impugned\n                          Order is in fact a reasoned order passed under <a href=\"/doc/1199955/\" id=\"a_31\">Regulation 25</a> of the General\n                          Regulations 2009 after taking into consideration the detailed submissions\n                          made by BAI that it is the largest consumer of cement bearing direct impact\n                          of the anti-competitive practices in the grey cement industry and is thereby a\n                          necessary party with substantial interest for a meaningful enquiry. It is also\n                          contended that the action of impleadment does not impact the legal rights of\n                          the Petitioner whose interest is limited to providing inputs and information\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signing Date:19.12.2023   W.P.(C) 9854/2023                                                     Page 9 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">11:00:32</span>\n                           to CCI, facilitating the arrival of a just conclusion, but merely that of BAI as\n                          a party being impleaded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"864375\" id=\"span_46\">19.    The learned Counsel for the Respondents further states that the\n                          application of principles of natural justice is not absolute and depends on the\n                          nature of the duty to be performed by the authority based on facts and\n                          circumstances.

A contract is\n                                         a commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders and\n                                         awarding contracts are essentially commercial\n                                         functions. Principles of equity and natural justice stay\n                                         at a distance. If the decision relating to award of\n                                         contract is bona fide and is in public interest, courts\n                                         will not, in exercise of power of judicial review,\n                                         interfere even if a procedural aberration or error in\n                                         assessment or prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The\n                                         power of judicial review will not be permitted to be\n                                         invoked to protect private interest at the cost of public\n                                         interest, or to decide contractual disputes.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Signing Date:19.12.2023   W.P.(C) 9854/2023                                                     Page 23 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">11:00:32</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10528123\" id=\"span_118\">30.

Right to reasons is an\n                                         indispensable part of a sound system of judicial review.\n                                         Under our Constitution an administrative decision is\n                                         subject to judicial review if it affects the right of a\n                                         citizen, it is therefore desirable that reasons should be\n                                         stated.&quot;                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">                          37.

It is fundamental to fair procedure that both\n                                         sides should be heard - audi alteram partem, i.e., hear\n                                         the other side and it is often considered that it is broad\n                                         enough to include the rule against bias since a fair\n                                         hearing must be an unbiased hearing. One of\n                                         the essential ingredients of fair hearing is that a\n                                         person should be served with a proper notice, i.e., a\n                                         person has a right to notice. Notice should be clear\n                                         and precise so as to give the other party adequate\n                                         information of the case he has to meet and make an\n                                         effective defence. Denial of notice and opportunity to\n                                         respond result in making the administrative decision as\n                                         vitiated. The adequacy of notice is a relative term and\n                                         must be decided with reference to each case. But\n                                         generally a notice to be adequate must contain the\n                                         following: (a) time, place and nature of hearing; (b)\n                                         legal authority under which hearing is to be held; (c)\n                                         statement of specific charges which a person has to\n                                         meet.

In administrative law, the rules of natural justice\n                                         have traditionally been regarded as comprising the\n                                         principles of Audi alteram partem and nemo judex in\n                                         causa sua.

The first principle is of\n                                         great importance because it embraces a rule of fair\n                                         procedure or due process. Generally speaking, the\n                                         notion of fair hearing extends to the right to have\n                                         notice of other side&#x27;s case, the right to bring evidence\n                                         and the right to argue. The premise on which the\n                                         courts extended their jurisdiction against the\n                                         administrative action was that the duty to give every\n                                         victim a fair hearing was as much a principle of good\n                                         administration as of good legal procedure.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">                          44.    It is, therefore, a reiteration of the well-established principle that a fair\n                          procedure very much includes the presentation of an appropriate notice to all\n                          involved parties. However, the contention of the Petitioner that such a notice\n                          was not provided to the Petitioner prior to the passing of the impugned\n                          Order dated 05.07.2023 by the CCI cannot by accepted by this Court.

This expression was\n                                         then substituted with the expression ―receipt of any\n                                         information in such manner and by the 2007\n                                         Amendment. This substitution is not without\n                                         significance. Whereas, a complaint could be filed only\n                                         from a person who was aggrieved by a particular\n                                         action, information may be received from any person,\n                                         obviously whether such person is or is not personally\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">Signing Date:19.12.2023   W.P.(C) 9854/2023                                                   Page 35 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">11:00:32</span>\n                                          affected.

That the CCI may inquire into any\n                                         alleged contravention of the provisions of the Act on its\n                                         own motion, is also <a href=\"/doc/65191688/\" id=\"a_91\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1081742/\" id=\"a_92\">section 19(1)</a> of the\n                                         Act.

A right in rem is a right\n                                         exercisable against the world at large, as contrasted\n                                         from a right in personam which is an interest\n                                         protected solely against specific individuals. Actions in\n                                         personam refer to actions determining the rights and\n                                         interests of the parties themselves in the subject matter\n                                         of the case, whereas actions in rem refer to actions\n                                         determining the title to property and the rights of the\n                                         parties, not merely among themselves but also against\n                                         all persons at any time claiming an interest in that\n                                         property.

By contrast,\n                                         a judgment in personam, ―although it may concern res,\n                                         merely determines the rights of the litigants inter se to\n                                         the res‖. Distinction between judgments in rem and\n                                         judgments in personam turns on their power as res\n                                         judicata i.e. judgment in rem would operate as res\n                                         judicata against the world, and judgment in personam\n                                         would operate as res judicata only against the parties\n                                         in dispute.&quot;                       (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">                          50.

It is not possible or desirable, and in any\n                                         case it would be inexpedient to lay down any principles\n                                         which should govern the approach of the Court in\n                                         dealing with the question of reviewing and revising its\n                                         earlier decisions. It would always depend upon several\n                                         relevant considerations: What is the nature of the\n                                         infirmity or error on which a plea for a review and\n                                         revision of the earlier view is based? On the earlier\n                                         occasion, did some patent aspects of the question\n                                         remain unnoticed, or was the attention of the Court not\n                                         drawn to any relevant and material statutory\n                                         provision, or was any previous decision of this Court\n                                         bearing on the point not noticed? Is the Court hearing\n                                         such plea fairly unanimous that there is such an error\n                                         in the earlier view? What would be the impact of the\n                                         error on the general administration of law or on public\n                                         good? Has the earlier decision been followed on\n                                         subsequent occasions either by this Court or by the\n                                         High Courts? And, would the reversal of the earlier\n                                         decision lead to public inconvenience, hardship or\n                                         mischief? These and other relevant considerations\n                                         must be carefully borne in mind whenever this Court is\n                                         called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and\n                                         revise its earlier decisions. These considerations\n                                         become still more significant when the earlier decision\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">Signing Date:19.12.2023   W.P.(C) 9854/2023                                                        Page 39 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">11:00:32</span>\n                                          happens to be a unanimous decision of a Bench of five\n                                         learned Judges of this Court.‖</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">                          53.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"62856811\" id=\"span_210\">In <a href=\"/doc/62856811/\" id=\"a_105\">S.

It is therefore clear that the impugned Order passed by CCI does not\n                          ensue the grant of confidential records of proceedings to BAI. Moreover, it\n                          is also clear that the grant of non-confidential information is also explicitly\n                          recorded to be done within the bounds of <a href=\"/doc/58586293/\" id=\"a_118\">Regulation 37(1)</a> which can only\n                          be exercised subject to conformity with the safeguards enumerated within\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1537115/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 57</a> of the Act and <a href=\"/doc/1753275/\" id=\"a_120\">Regulation 35</a> of the General Regulations 2009 as\n                          noted above.

The requisite procedural provisions on\n                          sharing information with parties to the proceedings have been duly paid\n                          attention to and followed by CCI as far as the impugned Order dated\n                          05.07.2023 challenged in the present Writ is concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">                          60.
