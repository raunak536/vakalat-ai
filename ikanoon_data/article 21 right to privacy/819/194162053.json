This is an appeal against the judgment dated 26.09.2023 passed by the\nlearned Special Judge, POCSO at Golaghat in Special POCSO Case No.25/2022,\narising out of Golaghat P.S. Case No.69/2022, by which the appellant had been\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 6</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 and sentenced to undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs.50,000/-, in default, to undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for 3 (three) months.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1863244\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"61642\" id=\"span_2\">3. The case against the appellant is that he had raped the victim girl who was\nan alleged minor, due to which the appellant has been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n6</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012. The ossification test that had been conducted on the\nvictim shows that she was between 16 and 18 years during the time the\nincident of rape had occurred. Keeping in view the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/61642/\" id=\"a_3\">Ram Suresh Singh vs. Prabhat Singh @ Chhotu &amp;\nAnother</a>, reported in (<a href=\"/doc/1863244/\" id=\"a_4\">2009) 6 SCC 681 and Jyoti Prakash Rai @ Jyoti\nPrakash vs. State of Bihar</a>, reported in (2008) 15 SCC 223, the age\ndetermined by ossification test is not a precise one and therefore a 2 year\nmargin of error can be applied on either side of the age of the victim. Though\nthe above judgments are in relation to the giving of the benefit of ± 1 or 2\nyears to an accused on whom an ossification test had been conducted to\ndetermine the age of the accused, there is no reason not to apply the said\nprinciple of ± 2 years margin of error even on an ossification test conducted on\na victim. Keeping in view the settled law of the land that in the event of there\nbeing 2 views, one in favour of the accused and one in favour of the State, we\nare of the view that the margin of error of 1 plus 2 year can be given on the\nhigher side, when it comes to determining the age of the victim after an\n                                                                         Page No.# 3/11\n\nossification test is conducted. The victim, in any event, would have been\ndeemed to be 18 years in terms of the ossification test. The above being said, it\nis the case of the prosecution that a child has been born out of the rape that\nhad been committed by the appellant on the victim. On a query made to the\nlearned counsels for the parties, as to whether a DNA test should be conducted,\nto determine the paternity of the child vis-a-vis the appellant, the counsels of\nthe parties submit that they do not have any objection if a DNA test is\nconducted on the child and the appellant.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100070399\" id=\"span_3\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/100070399/\" id=\"a_5\">Sudip Biswas @ Bura vs. The State of Assam &amp;\nAnother</a> (Criminal Appeal 73/2023), the Division Bench of this Court, vide\nOrder dated 13.10.2023, had directed that a DNA test/profiling should be\nconducted on the child of the victim and the accused/appellant therein, to get to\nthe truth of the matter, as the offence of rape was an offence against the\nsociety at large and as the objective of a Court proceeding was to find out the\ntruth.

DNA conclusively\npoints the finger of guilt towards the perpetrator of a crime. However, while\nconsidering this scientific piece of evidence, the Court is required to examine as\nto whether at any point of time, it could be said that there was the slightest\nchance of playing with the samples and/or tampering with it by anyone.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">7.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68696327\" id=\"span_6\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/68696327/\" id=\"a_10\">Mukesh Vs.

On considering that there is no bar or restriction in having a DNA profiling\nof an accused in a rape case and as the appellant has been accused of being\nthe father of the child born to the victim, we are of the view that there should\nbe a DNA profiling of the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 53</a> Cr.P.C. We have also\nnoticed that in the case of       <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_27\">Bhabani Prasad Jena Vs. Orissa State\nCommission</a> for Women, reported in 2010 8 <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_28\">SCC 633 and Dipanwita Roy\nVs. Ronobroto Roy</a>, reported in 2015 1 SCC 365, DNA testing has been\nallowed to determining the paternity of the child</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100070399\" id=\"span_16\">17.   Keeping in view the above decisions and the order dated 13.10.2023\npassed in Criminal Appeal 73/2023 (<a href=\"/doc/100070399/\" id=\"a_29\">Sudip Biswas @ Bura vs. The State of\nAssam &amp; Another</a> ), we are of the view that a DNA profiling of the appellant,\nwho is in jail and the child born to the victim should be done, so as to determine\nthe paternity of the child. Accordingly, we direct the learned Trial Court to take\nadditional evidence under <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 391</a> Cr.P.C, which is equivalent to Section 432\nBNSS, by taking steps for ensuring that a DNA test/profiling of the appellant and\nthe child of the victim alleged to have been fathered by the appellant, is\nundertaken, after taking the samples from the appellant and the child in the\npresence of the learned Judge of the learned Trial Court. In this regard,\nnecessary directions may be issued by the learned Trial Court to the\nSuperintendent of the concerned Jail to produce the appellant and also to the\nvictim to produce the child. The learned Trial Court shall ensure all precautions\nare taken at the time of taking of samples from the above persons and making\n                                                                      Page No.# 11/11\n\nsure the samples are not compromised in any manner. The learned Trial Court\nshall also ensure that the persons/institution which is going to conduct the DNA\ntest/profiling takes all possible precautions so that the entire testing procedure\nis not compromised in any manner. The entire exercise should be conducted at\nthe earliest and preferably within a period of 2 (two) months from the date of\nreceipt of a copy of this order.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">18.
