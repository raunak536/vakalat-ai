The Scheme may mainly\n\n            help    the   lower     income  strata  of   the\n\n            society.      The policy is to retain the\n\n            existing    dwellings     as  far   as  possible\n\n            except huts.      All vacant lands within the\n\n            scheme area have to be put to development\n\n            in a minimum period.

What remains for consideration is the impact\n\nof the Kerala Municipality (Dangerous and Offensive\n\nTrade and other Trade Licensing) Rules, 2011 in regard\n\nto the activities in the area.              The implementation of\n\nthe above Rules was initially stayed by the Government\n\nwhich order has admittedly not been extended beyond\n\n31.07.2016 as submitted.

However, S.575 of the 1994 Act,\n\n            the clause relating to repeals and savings,\n\n            provides among other things, in sub-s.2(ii)\n\n            thereof, that, notwithstanding the repeal\n\n            of the 1960 Act, any Rule in the Schedules\n\n            to the said repealed Act, which are in\n\n            force, at the commencement of the 1994 Act\n\n            shall continue to be in force unless they\n\n            are inconsistent with the 1994 Act.

Mr.        Anil      Sivaraman,     Advocate   gracefully\n\nsubmitted that the petitioners have no objection in the\n\noccupants of the residential units conducting business\n\nwhich are not notified as &#x27;dangerous or offensive&#x27;.\n\nThis is subject to the condition that the occupants -\n\nwhether it be the owner or the tenant - resides in a\n\nportion of the premises and conducts business (not\n\ndangerous or offensive) in the other portion.              Such a\n\nstand    is    taken     since      many  of  the  occupants   are\n\nprofessionals        like     Doctors,    Chartered   Accountants,\n\nAdvocates etc. having offices at home.            The petitioners\n\nin short are aggrieved by the residential units being\n\nutilised for conducting businesses which have been\n\nnotified as dangerous or offensive.                Such of those\n\nestablishments which require a D &amp; O license (Dangerous\n\nand Offensive) are however to be prohibited in the area\n\naccording      to    the    petitioners.       I  appreciate  the\n\ngenerous stand of the petitioners as there has to be a\n\nsustainable development ofcourse without sacrificing\n\nthe environmental values.             The user of the buildings as\n\f\nWP(C) No. 10130/2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                      25</span>\n\n\n\n\ngodowns, ware houses, factories, show rooms etc. within\n\nthe area covered by Ext.P2 Scheme makes the living of\n\nthe petitioners awful.            The congestion on the roads due\n\nto unruly parking of vehicles of these establishments\n\ncoupled with the accompanying air and noise pollution\n\nare intolerable.         There is a loss of privacy and peace\n\nof mind to the residents of the housing colony due to\n\nthe invasion of outsiders on daily basis and there is\n\nuntold misery due to unrestricted commercialisation.\n\nIt is trite law that the the State is bound to provide\n\nan absolutely healthy environment to its citizens for a\n\npeaceful living sans any pollution even as per the\n\npublic trust doctrine.              This position assumes greater\n\nrigour if the very land has been acquired through land\n\nacquisition proceedings solely for the purpose of a\n\nhousing scheme.           The State in short has committed\n\nbreach of trust by depriving the original owners of\n\ntheir property allegedly for a housing scheme and\n\npermitting      commercial        activity  therein.    All such\n\nactivities have to come to a grinding halt except\n\nofcourse in relation to the four plots (plot Nos. 131,\n\n132, 133 and 134) within the area.
