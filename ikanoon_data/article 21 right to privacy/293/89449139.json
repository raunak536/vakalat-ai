Hence, the same could not be provided under\nsection 8(1) (e) &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">RTI Act</a>. With respect to point (b) the appellant was\ninformed that the information was available in public domain.

CPIO, DOPT by which\n      property returns of Shri U.K. Sinha, retired IAS officer were ordered to be\n      disclosed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"104381\" id=\"span_2\">4.    Against the full bench order of the Commission, the Respondent SEBI filed a\nwrit petition before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Bombay [W.P.(C) No. 3386/2014- <a href=\"/doc/104381/\" id=\"a_4\">SEBI\nVs. Arun Kumar Agrawal</a>. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Bombay had disposed of the\nwrit petition vide order dated 13.02.2015. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Bombay\nobserved that: &quot;....the Central Information Commission while allowing the appeal had\nnot given any reason whatsoever for taking a view which is contrary to the view\ntaken by it (the CIC in its earlier order dated 06.11.2012)...&quot; and set aside the\nimpugned order dated 28.11.2014 of the full bench of the Commission and\nremanded the matter back to the Central Information Commission with directions to\ndecide the appeal expeditiously after giving personal hearing to the parties.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.    In compliance with the direction of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Mumbai, the\nmatter was heard by full bench of the Commission on 03.05.2016. The appellant\nstated that he would not like to join in the hearing as he had no faith in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                         2</span>\n Commission, but the appellant was present for VC and duly participated in the\nhearing. The appellant stated that he had received the notice only on 27.4.2016 and\nhe had requested the Bench to be reconstituted. He further stated that the CIC&#x27;s\norder in the matter had not attained finality as the Delhi High Court remanded all the\nfour cases to the Commission. There was conflict of interest as the Commissioners\nhad not declared their movable assets, whereas the Hon&#x27;ble Judges of the High\nCourts and Supreme Court of India had done that. The Chairman, SEBI who\nregulates the share market can purchase shares and therefore there was a conflict\nof interest and any information about assets should be disclosed. He further stated\nthat the notification of <a href=\"/doc/53292799/\" id=\"a_5\">Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013</a> issued was being extended\nrepeatedly, but in his view the movable assets should be placed in public domain of\npublic servants. The respondents stated that the appellant had initially submitted four\nseparate applications relating to different issues. The case relating to disclosure of\nassets and liabilities only was relevant. They stated that the information on the\nassets and liabilities of the Chairman, SEBI was clearly personal information, exempt<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">\nu/s 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act. They stated that third party had to be heard in the matter\nand that no appeal had been filed separately for seeking property returns and the\nHigh Court had remanded only the cases relating to Reliance and therefore it was\nnot the mandate of the Commission to hear this case. The respondents added that\nthe Chairman, SEBI had been giving his property returns to SEBI which is being\nshared with the DoPT, even though he was no more a civil servant. Furthermore, the\nappellant had not specified as to what public interest would be served for obtaining\nthe personal information of the third party and requested the Commission that the\nmatter to be dismissed with exemplary costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">6.    The Commission directed the respondents and the third party&#x27;s representative\nto send their written submissions, which have been received by the Commission.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">Appellant&#x27;s submissions:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    The appellant&#x27;s submissions sent through e-mail dated 24.4.2016 were\nreceived by the Commission, in which he has stated as under:\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                      3</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">    •   The RTI application for the instant appeal was made on 17.01.2012. He had\n       to go through four High Court Appeals in Mumbai and Delhi for no fault of his\n       and incur heavy expenses for information which was asked in public interest.\n       The Appellant alleged insensitivity of the CIC in passing non speaking orders\n       leading to the inconvenience caused to citizen;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">   •   The Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court vide its order dated 13.02.2015 rightly held\n       that the order of the Commission dated 28.11.2014 was not a speaking order\n       as no reasons had been given and reverted the matter in February, 2015 for\n       deciding the appeal expeditiously. The order was brought to the notice of the\n       Registrar of the CIC and the Ld. Commissioners on two occasions but the\n       matter was kept pending for 16 months in spite of the order of the Hon&#x27;ble\n       High Court. The appellant had requested the Hon&#x27;ble High Court to decide\n       the matter knowing fully well that the matter would be kept pending by the\n       Commission indefinitely, as in the past when similar directions had been\n       issued by the Hon&#x27;ble High Courts to the Commission.\n   •   Two of the Ld. Commissioners are members of the present Bench who had\n       earlier decided the appeal, which was remanded by the Bombay High Court;\n   •   In the instant case, if the outcome of the appeal is against the SEBI Chief,\n       the same will be challenged by him and the matter will not be decided till he\n       retires upon completing his tenure.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">   •   The appellant has reasoned that the SEBI chief should disclose the\n       information on the assets is the conflict of interest in his holding publicly listed\n       shares and mutual fund units which he as the Chairman of SEBI which\n       regulates the shares of the publicly listed companies. In fact there is a conflict\n       of interest between all officers of SEBI as regulators and investors. <a href=\"/doc/1365176/\" id=\"a_7\">The SEBI\n       Act</a> does not prohibit its officers from investing in shares in companies and\n       units of mutual fund which are publicly listed and traded. At the same time,\n       they regulate these companies and are privy to information about these\n       companies which the general public is not. Every action of SEBI against a\n       company impacts its price.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">   •   Further as per contentions of the appellant, integrity of the SEBI Chief has\n       been questioned on various occasions and complaints against him on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                        4</span>\n        corruption involving thousands of crores of public money is pending before\n       the CBI, Finance Minister etc.\n   •   The appellant has alleged that in his opinion what is true for Shri U.K. Sinha\n       is also true for the Ld. Commissioners as far as conflict of interest are\n       concerned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">   •   The appellant had filed a RTI application with the CIC regarding information\n       on the movable assets of the Ld. Commissioners. He was informed that the\n       same had not been declared by the Ld. Commissioners, by the CPIO and the\n       same reason was given in the first appeal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">   •   It was because of the order favouring RIL, the appellant emphatically sought\n       information    to   satisfy   himself       as   to   whether   the   concerned   Ld.\n       Commissioners were not holding shares in RIL or in any mutual fund having\n       RIL shares that RTI was filed for disclosure of movable assets.\n   •   The Appellant has stated that the Ld. Commissioner who according to the\n       roster hears appeals against SEBI is a batch mate of the SEBI Chief U.K.\n       Sinha and hence he expressed his doubts as to whether it too constitutes\n       conflict of interest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">   •   He has further elucidated that there is a further conflict of interest in that as to\n       whether the Ld. CIC who have not declared their movable assets will order\n       the declaration of movable assets of the SEBI Chairman U.K. Sinha.\n       Additionally, the appellant has contended that if officials in high position\n       choose not to be transparent in the disclosure of their assets, then adverse\n       conclusions are bound to be drawn in a country high on corruption index. The\n       adverse conclusions relates to the integrity of the persons who refuse to\n       declare their assets. His apprehensions include the Government of India\n       allowing repeated extensions for declaration of assets by officials<a href=\"/doc/141283844/\" id=\"a_8\"> u/s 44</a> of\n       the Lokpal Act 2013, the latest deadline being 31.07.2016. There have been\n       five such earlier extensions and the reason for the same, according to the\n       appellant are far too obvious.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">   •   The appellant for the above said reasons has expressed his loss faith in the\n       system viz. in the Government, the Commission and SEBI and therefore for\n       these reasons has no hope left for the officials being transparent about their\n       assets which is the first step towards eliminating corruption from the system.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                           5</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      •   The appellant for reasons mentioned above has decided not to appear\n         before the Hon&#x27;ble Commission and leaves it to the sensitiveness of the Ld.\n         Members of the Commission to decide the issue in public interest or\n         otherwise, as the case may be.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.       The respondents and representatives of third party stated that they will file the\nwritten submissions after the hearing. The Commission directed the respondents and\nrepresentatives of third party to file their submissions within ten days of the hearing.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">Respondent&#x27;s submissions:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">9.       The submissions dated 12.05.2016 from SEBI were received by the\nCommission, vital contentions wherein are as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     •   The Commission&#x27;s order dated 06.11.2012 passed by the then Chief\n         Information Commissioner was not assailed/challenged by the appellant and\n         attained finality and could not have been reopened.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">     •   Shri U.K. Sinha, Chairman, SEBI was not an appointee of SEBI and was\n         appointed by Government of India.

It is not abnormal for people of\n             high integrity to make a sacrifice financially to take up the position\n             of honour and service to the nation. In any event, we are of the\n             opinion, the acceptance by Mr. Sinha of lesser salary as Chairman\n             of SEBI cannot ipso facto lead to the conclusion that the accepted\n             the position for purpose of abusing the authority of Chairman,\n             SEBI&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"812638\" id=\"span_10\">The Respondent has further made specific reference to paragraph 55\n             and 60 of <a href=\"/doc/812638/\" id=\"a_14\">the said judgment</a>, to emphasize the fact that all the issues\n             being raised by the appellant in the appeal before the Hon&#x27;ble CIC,\n             were duly considered and dealt with by the Apex Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                         7</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">   •   Respondents have further referred to the Full Bench decision of the\n      Commission dated 28.11.2014 relating to the present case, wherein it had\n      referred to its earlier order dated 06.02.2013 in the matter of the appellant vs.\n      DoPT and therein directing disclosure of the information relating to Chairman,\n      SEBI. In respect of the said order of the CIC, they stated that the said order\n      was not absolute, but with a rider, which read as &#x27;we understand that the\n      central government has, in the meanwhile, decided to disclose the property\n      returns of all the IAS officers in the public domain. If that is so, there is no\n      reason why the property returns of this particular officer should not be\n      disclosed. Hence the DoPT was not required to disclose the details of returns\n      filed with them. The rider &quot;...if that is so,...&quot; in the order refers to disclosure\n      under <a href=\"/doc/53292799/\" id=\"a_15\">Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013</a> which is applicable to every public\n      servant and no one is singled out from the same.

Union of India &amp;\n      Ors. which has already dealt with the issue of larger public interest and is the\n      only development that took place between the passing of the order dated\n      06.11.2012 and the order dated 28.11.2014. In view of the same, they stated\n      that before passing the order dated 28.11.2014, the Hon&#x27;ble Commission\n      ought to have considered that the contentions of the appellant about the\n      public interest angle have already been examined and found to be devoid of\n      merit by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and thus there remains no ground for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                      8</span>\n          overriding the exemptions. In any event, the findings of the Apex judicial body\n         which had attained finality cannot be questioned or reopened before a quasi\n         judicial body and the said attempt on the part of the appellant besides being\n         malafide is a gross abuse of the process of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">     •   The appellant&#x27;s contention that the Chairman, SEBI and other employees of\n         SEBI were investing in shares of the companies, thereby giving rise to conflict\n         of interest and thus warranting disclosure of information, as sought by him, in\n         public interest have been rebutted by the respondents as factually incorrect,\n         baseless and thus deserving to be dismissed. Regulation 64 of the SEBI\n         (Employees Service) Regulations, 2001 permits to invest only in mutual\n         funds, where there is no control of the employee to select the companies. The\n         Regulations specifically prohibit employees to make any other equity related\n         instruments. The Respondents have further added that SEBI had also\n         prescribed Code of Conduct, which apart from its employees, is also\n         applicable to the Chairman and Whole Time Members. The said Code,\n         restricts all employees, Chairman and Whole Time Members, from making\n         any investment in equity or equity related instruments.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">Third Party&#x27;s submissions:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">10       The submissions dated 12.05.2016 have also been received from Shri U.K.\nSinha, Chairman, SEBI (hereinafter referred to as the third party) by the\nCommission, who has stated as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">         •   He has no objection to the statement of his assets and liabilities made\n             public in pursuance of a government policy applicable uniformly to all\n             public servants. However, he has objection to his being singled out for\n             such disclosure at the behest of the appellant, who has a long history of\n             filing vexatious petitions against him, major one of which had been\n             dismissed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court vide judgement dated\n             01.11.2013 in WP No. 374 of 2012. The requested information should not\n             be directed to be given to the appellant, because the Hon&#x27;ble Commission\n             passed a composite order dated 06.11.2012 pertaining to four specific\n             cases. Only one out of this pertained to furnishing information relating to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                        9</span>\n          assets and liabilities pertaining to him. There was no challenge to this\n         order by any party and therefore the said order attained finality.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">     •   The order dated 06.11.2012 was challenged by Reliance Industries Ltd.\n         (&#x27;RIL&#x27;) before the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court with respect to issues which\n         pertained to RIL only. The appellant did not prefer any appeal against the\n         order of refusal of disclosure of information relating to assets and liabilities\n         statement pertaining to him and hence the appellant cannot take\n         advantage of an order of remand passed at the instance of a distinct party.\n         The Third party has explained that the writ petition (C) No. 7248/2012 was\n         filed by RIL on the grounds that no notice of hearing was given to it before\n         the directions of disclosure of information were passed. The order of\n         Hon&#x27;ble CIC qua the assets and liabilities statements etc. was not under\n         challenge. By order dated 30.01.2013 the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court\n         allowed the writ of RIL and remanded the matter for re-hearing only qua\n         the petitioners therein i.e. RIL. Plain reading of the said order shows that\n         re-hearing was only qua RIL and not with respect to all the four matters.\n         The writ petition No. 4637/2013 was filed by RIL seeking hearing by at\n         least one member who had knowledge and expertise in law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">     •   The Third party has further contended that the appellant is attempting to\n         misread the order dated 14.03.2014 of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court.\n         Since all the notices/orders passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Commission always\n         jointly referred to four appeals (even though none had been challenged by\n         the appellant), there was no occasion for RIL to identify the appeal\n         pertaining to it. As a result, the four orders had been collectively referred\n         in the order of Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court. However, this alone would not\n         entitle the appellant to seek re-opening of a decided matter. The Hon&#x27;ble\n         Commission was in error of re-hearing all the matters and reviewing its\n         order dated 06.11.2012 whereby the appeal seeking the assets and\n         liabilities statements of third party etc. was clearly turned down by a\n         reasoned order. Power of review is a creature of statute and cannot be\n         inferred, since no such power is available to the Hon&#x27;ble Commission\n         under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">RTI Act</a>, the Hon&#x27;ble Commission could not have reviewed its\n         earlier order. The Hon&#x27;ble Commission is a quasi judicial body and does\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                      10</span>\n          not have inherent power to review which is available to a constitutional\n         court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">     •   The third party has further stated that the required information had been\n         regularly furnished by him to Govt/DoPT. <a href=\"/doc/53292799/\" id=\"a_20\">Under the Lokpal and Lokayukta\n         Act, 2013</a>, the issue of disclosure is in two parts - (a) disclosure to the\n         Government and (b) disclosure to the public. However, as per notification\n         No. 407/12/2014-AVD-IV(B) dated 12.04.2016 issued by DoPT cut-off\n         date for filing the information had been extended till July 31, 2016 for all\n         officers covered by it. This includes him. Pending such decision, no\n         precipitate orders should be passed. Mr. Sinha had been voluntarily\n         furnishing the information to SEBI and to the Government from time to\n         time and hence it is a case of much ado about nothing. The Third party\n         has submitted that the appellant is simply trying to short circuit the entire\n         process and gain information, with which he has neither any concern nor\n         which would serve any larger public interest and accordingly he had\n         disclosed the justification for the third party to be singled out and that too\n         at his instance, when he has had a chequered past in the context of his\n         tirades against the third party. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court had\n         pronounced a detailed judgement running into 87 pages on 01.11.2014\n         and has severely castigated the role of the appellant. The appellant seeks\n         to lay emphasis on a subsequent order in an application seeking\n         modification of the aforesaid judgment dated 1.11.2014, whereby some of\n         the observations had been expunged. In other words, 85 pages remain\n         un-expunged. A plain reading of the judgement shows the conduct of the\n         appellant vis-à-vis the third party. The appellant has chosen to\n         conveniently gloss over this vital aspect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">     •   The nature of public interest could not be established by the appellant\n         which would be served by procuring the desired information nor has the\n         appellant explained the relation between personal information of third\n         party    serving   public   interest.   The   conduct   of   the   appellant   is\n         contumacious, who seeks to merely scandalize the matter and the issue.\n         On the one hand he is seeking to scandalize the Regulator through its\n         Chairman, as is borne out from the findings in the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                       11</span>\n           Supreme Court. On the other hand, the appellant is also trying to\n          scandalize and brow-beat the Commission by writing that he shall not\n          appear since he has no faith in it. Despite expressing his doubt on the\n          integrity of two of the Commissioners comprising the Bench hearing the\n          case and refusing to appear before the Bench, the Appellant attended the\n          hearing through video conferencing. The appellant had contended that the\n          Chairman SEBI and other employees of SEBI are investing in shares of\n          the companies, thereby giving rise to conflict of interest and thus\n          warranting disclosure of the information, as sought by him, in public\n          interest. This contention is factually incorrect, baseless and deserves to be\n          dismissed. Regulation 64 of the SEBI (Employees Service) Regulations,\n          2001 permits the employees of SEBI to make investment only in mutual\n          funds, where there is no control of the employee to select the companies.\n          The Regulations specifically prohibit employees to make any other equity\n          related instruments. Similarly, SEBI also has a prescribed Code of\n          Conduct, which is applicable to the Chairman and Whole Time Members\n          and employees of SEBI.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">Conclusion / Decision\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">11.    While discussing the contentions of the parties, at the outset, the Commission\nopines that the reliance placed on the Commission&#x27;s decision dated 06.11.2012, by\nboth the respondent and third party, is misplaced as the issue was not emphasized\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court, which remanded back the matter of\ndisclosure of assets and liabilities statement of Shri U.K. Sinha, Chairman, SEBI to\nbe decided afresh.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">12.    The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande\n[decision dated 03/10/2012 - SLP(C) No. 27734 of 2012] has held that information\nrelating to assets &amp; liabilities of an individual is &quot;personal information&quot; which stands\nexempted from disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless the\nCPIO is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such\ninformation.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                      12</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\"> 13.   What flows from the judgment of the Apex Court is that the details of assets &amp;\nliabilities of an individual constitute personal information and is exempted from\ndisclosure under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> and that the said personal information can only be\ndivulged if the CPIO reaches a conclusion that it would be in larger public interest to\nreveal such information.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_17\">14.   The exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the said Act had come up                for\nconsideration     before        the      Apex         Court in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_24\">Bihar       Public     Service\nCommission</a>&#x27;s Case (supra). The Apex Court after observing that information which\nrelates to personal information recorded by <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the said Act stands\nexempted and can be disclosed only if larger public interest so warrants, has\nthereafter held that the said exemption is a statutory exemption which must\noperate as a rule and only in exceptional cases, would disclosure be permitted\nthat too for reasons to be recorded demonstrating satisfaction to the test of\nlarger public interest. In so far as the competing claims between larger public\ninterest and the invasion of privacy, the observations of the Apex Court in paragraph\n23 of <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_26\">the said judgment</a> are material and are reproduced herein under:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                    &quot;23 The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the\n                    authorities       objectively      and   the   consequences     of\n                    such disclosure have to be weighed with regard to the\n                    circumstances of a given case. The decision has to be\n                    based on objective satisfaction recorded for ensuring that\n                    larger public interest outweighs unwarranted invasion of\n                    privacy or other factors stated in the provision. Certain\n                    matters, particularly, in relation to            appointment, are\n                    required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The\n                    information may come to knowledge of the authority as a\n                    result of disclosure by others who give that information\n                    in confidence         and        with complete faith, integrity and\n                    fidelity.     Secrecy of such            information    shall   be\n                    maintained,        thus, brining it within the ambit of fiduciary\n                    capacity.         Similarly, there may be cases where the\n                    disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                            13</span>\n                    interest or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of\n                   privacy of the individual. On these protections have to be\n                   given their due implementation as they spring from\n                   statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter\n                   between private interest and public interest. It is a matter\n                   where a constitutional protection is available to a person\n                   with regard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public\n                   interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the\n                   balance factor between right to privacy and right to\n                   information with the purpose sought to be achieved and\n                   the purpose that would be served in the larger public\n                   interest, particularly when both these rights emerged\n                   from the constitutional values under the Constitution of\n                   India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">                   Since the right to privacy has been recognized as a fundamental\n                   right to which a citizen is entitled to, therefore, unless the\n                   condition     mentioned      in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_27\">Section   8(1)(j)</a> is   satisfied,   the\n                   information cannot be provided.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">15.   This Commission in its decision dated 28/11/2014 (set aside by the Bombay\nHigh Court) has observed as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                      &quot;      11. This Commission recognizes the perspective brought\n                   out on public interest in <a href=\"/doc/1484095/\" id=\"a_28\">section 8(2)</a> of the Act in the course of\n                   the hearing. The appellant underlined the dimensions of public\n                   interest overriding the protected interest, i.e., the protection\n                   given to the &#x27;fiduciary&#x27; and &#x27;personal information&#x27; elements.\n                   However, the other side argued that the appellant is overstating\n                   the public interest. The appellant said that Shri Sinha gave up a\n                   job of very high emoluments, which was done to dilute the\n                   cases of some major defaulters in the capital market, hence, the\n                   need to know, in the public interest, about the assets and\n                   liabilities of Shri Sinha.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">CIC/SM/A/2012/001062                      14</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                     12. Taking into account the arguments of the appellant, this\n                    appears to be fit case where the requested information should\n                    be disclosed in larger public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">16.   The Apex Court in its judgment dated 01.11.2013 (WP (C) 374 of 2012-Arun\nKumar Agrawal Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.) has brushed aside the said argument\nholding as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                    &quot;84 Mr. Salve, in our opinion, has also rightly submitted that\n                    there is nothing surprising in Respondent 4 accepting the post\n                    of Chairman, SEBI which carried much lesser emoluments than\n                    he enjoyed as Chairman, UTI AMC. It is not abnormal for people\n                    of high integrity to make a sacrifice financially to take up the\n                    position of honour and service to the nation. In any event, we\n                    are of the opinion, the acceptance by Mr. Sinha of lesser salary\n                    as Chairman of SEBI cannot ipso facto lead to the conclusion\n                    that he accepted the position for purpose of abusing the\n                    authority of Chairman, SEBI..............&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                    The Apex Court has further observed that the petition does not\n                    satisfy the test of utmost good faith which is required to maintain\n                    public interest litigation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175012216\" id=\"span_20\">17.   The right to privacy, entrenched in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution, recognizes\nthat human beings have a right to a sphere of intimacy and autonomy that should be\nprotected from invasion. Hence, the burden on the appellant to satisfy the test of\nlarger public interest is much more onerous than may be in routine case. The\nHon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in its decision dated 13/07/2012 (W.P. (C) No. 1243 of\n2011- <a href=\"/doc/175012216/\" id=\"a_30\">UPSC vs. R.K.

The appellant in his submissions has made a series of allegations against the\nthird party, Shri U.K. Sinha, Chairman, SEBI, including that there is a conflict of\ninterest in his holding publicly listed shares and mutual fund units&#x27; that his integrity\nhas been questioned on various occasions and complaints against him on corruption\ninvolving thousands of crores of public money are pending before CBI, Finance\nMinister etc. and so on; but has failed to produce any documentary evidence\nsubstantiating his allegations. The allegations are nothing but statements of belief\nthat some wrong or harm has occurred. They are not conclusive proof of such wrong\nor harm having occurred. The stage of leveling of allegation is a stage preceding to\nthe examination of such allegations, which may or may not found to be correct by the\nauthority competent to examine such allegations under the law. Thus, mere leveling\nof allegation can hardly be said to satisfy the condition of disclosure being made in\nlarger public interest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">19.    For the reasons aforesaid stated the Commission is of the considered opinion\nthat the appellant in the instant case has not made a bona fide public interest in\nseeking information, the disclosure of such information is likely to cause unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy of the individual under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act.
