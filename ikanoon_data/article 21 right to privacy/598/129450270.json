The petitioner had filed an application for maternity leave before the\n                          concerned Dean and Vice-Chancellor of respondent no.2 annexing the\n                          doctor&#x27;s advice along with the prescription.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">                          4.    On 28.02.2023, the petitioner received a reply from the Dean of\n                          respondent no.2 whereby, her request for maternity leave was denied. The\n                          petitioner thereafter, raised her grievance before respondent no.1 and since\n                          the petitioner did not receive any response, she has approached this court for\n                          the aforesaid directions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">                          5.

Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.2 opposed the\n                          submission and he submits that the circular relied upon by the petitioner\n                          does not have any application in the instant case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">                          8.         In addition he submits that the course of the petitioner is governed by\n                          the provisions of National Council for <a href=\"/doc/202695/\" id=\"a_5\">Teacher Education Act, 1993</a> (\n                          hereinafter &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/202695/\" id=\"a_6\">NCTE Act, 1993</a>&#x27;) and the regulations made therein. While\n                          placing reliance on National Council for Teacher Education (Recognition\n                          Norms and Procedure) Regulations, 2014 ( hereinafter &#x27;NCTE\n                          Regulations, 2014&#x27;) he states that the candidates pursuing M.Ed. course are\n                          governed by Appendix-5 i.e. Master of Education Program Leading to\n                          Master of Education (M.Ed.)

He, further states that the minimum attendance of students\n                          shall be 80% for theory course and practicum and 90% for field attachment.\n                          He, therefore, states that there is no provision under Regulations, 2014 or\n                          under Appendix-5 to create any category, for the purpose of the students\n                          who want to avail the benefit of maternity leave. According to him, in the\n                          absence of any provision for the same, the university cannot consider the\n                          application submitted by the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">                          10.   I have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the\n                          parties and perused the record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">                          11.   There is no doubt that the circular issued by the UGC will not have a\n                          direct application to the M.Ed. course which is essentially governed by the\n                          provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/202695/\" id=\"a_7\">NCTE Act, 1993</a> and the regulations made therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">                          12.   If the UGC circular is perused, the same clearly indicates that it has\n                          been made applicable to the entire duration of M.Phil/Ph.D course and a\n                          provision is made for grant of 240 days of maternity leave. The duration of\n                          M.Phil/Ph.D course and the duration of M.Ed. course are distinctly different.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">                          13.   The course in question i.e. M.Ed. course is only for a period of two\n                          years in contradistinction to the M.Phil/Ph.D course, which is for a\n                          considerably longer period of time and normally lasts for 5-6 years. It is thus\n                          seen that the circular relied upon by the petitioner issued by the UGC will\n                          not have a direct application under the facts of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">                          14.

It is important to recognise\n                                      that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to\n                                      abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is that a\n                                      woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be\n                                      respected. This means that there should be no restriction whatsoever\n                                      on the exercise of reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to\n                                      refuse participation in sexual activity or alternatively the insistence\n                                      on use of contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are also free\n                                      to choose birth-control methods such as undergoing sterilisation\n                                      procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion, reproductive rights\n                                      include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term,\n                                      to give birth and to subsequently raise children...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                          19.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_30\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_11\">K.S.

The Constitution as adopted on 26th of November, 1949 served as a\n                          pledge that the citizens of India made to themselves. A pledge to\n                          disassociate ourselves from the parochial notions of society that prevented\n                          the ushering of equality. It was without any form of equivocation that the\n                          people asserted their right to be treated equally. Irrespective of gender, race,\n                          religion or caste, citizens were to claim their opportunities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                          23.   The Constitution envisaged an egalitarian society where citizens could\n                          exercise their rights, and the society as well as the State would allow the\n                          manifestation of their rights. A compromise was then not sought in the\n                          Constitutional scheme. The citizens could not be forced to choose between\n                          their right to education and their right to exercise reproductive autonomy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                          24.   A man could then well enjoy parenthood while pursuing his higher\n                          education, whereas a woman necessarily has to undergo pre and post\n                          pregnancy care. It is not her choice, but the will of nature. What is, however,\n                          left for us to decide is the consequence we would impose upon a woman\n                          who bears a child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">                          25.   The court, as well as the society, has two roads that it can tread in\n                          such a scenario. It can either follow the bare text of an existing legal\n                          provision, be stuck at the bark of words, be blind to the consequences of the\n                          law, and allow it to take its course. The other path-way is of being sensitive\n                          to the person in the dispute, applying the values enshrined in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signing Date:29.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">13:46:19</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                 -8-</span>\n\n\n\n\n                          Constitution and attempting, wherever possible, to accommodate the law\n                          falling short of societal development.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">                          26.   The first path would force a woman to necessarily choose between her\n                          right to a higher education and the right of becoming a mother. A woman\n                          would then have to either re-engage herself in the activity that she was\n                          previously pursuing and was halted by her pregnancy or would have to\n                          remain content with her having been unable to complete her vocation or\n                          education.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                          27.   Undoubtedly, in exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the\n                          Constitution of India, this court cannot create a different compartment for\n                          the purposes of relaxation of attendance. The applicable regulations which\n                          require a specific number of days of attendance are also required to be\n                          fulfilled. At the same time, the interests of candidates seeking maternity\n                          leave are also required to be catered to.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">                          28.   Under the instant case, the petitioner has requested for 59 days of\n                          maternity leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">                          29.   The genuineness of the application submitted by the petitioner is not\n                          doubted nor challenged. If the leave as prayed for i.e. 59 days is considered\n                          under the &#x27;theory classes&#x27; the petitioner would be fulfilling the 80%\n                          attendance criteria in the theory classes. The same would ensure that the\n                          right of the petitioner is secured without compromising the standards to be\n                          maintained by the educational institution. It is for this reason, this court\n                          under the facts of the present case deems it appropriate to direct the\n                          respondent no.2- University to consider the application of the petitioner for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Signing Date:29.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">13:46:19</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                  -9-</span>\n\n\n\n\n                          the grant of 59 days leave as maternity leave against 80% theory classes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">                          30.     Needless to state that if the petitioner has missed any practical classes\n                          during the period of leave, the same can always be directed to be rearranged\n                          as a special case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">                          31.
