Even after FIRs were quashed the\n\nrowdy sheets are continued. It is also submitted that\n\ncases which are compromised in Lok Adalat etc., are still\n\nbeing used as a ruse to continue the rowdy sheets\n\n(W.P.No.17453 of 2021).

Learned\n\n       Government Pleader for Home, therefore, emphasises\n\n       that the entire exercise of the Police Department, in\n\n       either opening or in continuing the rowdy sheet, is to\n\n       ensure that a crime is not committed by gathering\n\n       information/intelligence.       According    to   him,   the\n\n       prevention of crime and the protection of the society are\n\n       the essential reasons /rationale for the opening of a\n\n       rowdy sheet.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       c)     He also submits that the challenge to the Police\n\n       Standing Orders made in these cases is not backed up\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                         10</span>\n\n\n\n\n         by adequate or proper pleadings and that, therefore, this\n\n         Court cannot decide on the vires of the Police Standing\n\n         Orders.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">         d)    Learned Government Pleader also argues that the\n\n         Police Standing Orders are not unconstitutional, that\n\n         procedural safeguards are provided and that they are\n\n         being implemented.

Like the right to life and liberty, privacy\n            is not absolute. The limitations which operate on the\n            right to life and personal liberty would operate on the\n            right to privacy.

All liberal democracies believe that the State\n            should not have unqualified authority to intrude into\n            certain aspects of human life and that the authority\n            should be limited by parameters constitutionally fixed.\n            Fundamental rights are the only constitutional firewall\n            to prevent State&#x27;s interference with those core\n            freedoms constituting liberty of a human being. The\n            right to privacy is certainly one of the core freedoms\n            which is to be defended. It is part of liberty within the\n            meaning of that expression in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21.&quot;</a>\n\n\n        Justice S.A.Bobde - Paras 428.2 and 428.3\n\n            &quot;428.2. The right to privacy is inextricably bound up\n            with all exercises of human liberty--both as it is\n            specifically enumerated across Part III, and as it is\n            guaranteed in the residue under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21.</a> It is\n            distributed across the various Articles in Part III and,\n            mutatis mutandis, takes the form of whichever of their\n            enjoyment its violation curtails.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                            21</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n\n\n   428.3. Any interference with privacy by an entity\n   covered by <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 12</a>&#x27;s description of the &quot;State&quot; must\n   satisfy the tests applicable to whichever one or more\n   of the Part III freedoms the interference effects.&quot;\n\n\nJustice R.F.Nariman - para 526\n\n   &quot;526. But this is not to say that such a right is\n   absolute.    This      right   is      subject    to    reasonable\n   regulations made by the State to protect legitimate\n   State interests or public interest. However, when it\n   comes to restrictions on this right, the drill of various\n   articles    to   which       the     right   relates    must   be\n   scrupulously followed. For example, if the restraint on\n   privacy is over fundamental personal choices that an\n   individual is to make, State action can be restrained\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 14</a> if it is arbitrary\n   and unreasonable; and under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> read with\n   <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> only if it relates to the subjects\n   mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 19(2)</a> and the tests <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_51\">laid down by</a>\n   this   Court     for   such        legislation   or    subordinate\n   legislation to pass muster under the said article. Each\n   of the tests evolved by this Court, qua legislation or\n   executive action, under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 14;</a>\n   or <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> in the aforesaid\n   examples must be met in order that State action pass\n   muster. In the ultimate analysis, the balancing act\n   that is to be carried out between individual, societal\n   and State interests must be left to the training and\n   expertise of the judicial mind.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">\nJustice A.M. Sapre - 557\n\n   &quot;557. In my considered opinion, &quot;right to privacy of\n   any individual&quot; is essentially a natural right, which\n   inheres in every human being by birth. Such right\n   remains with the human being till he/she breathes\n   their last. It is indeed inseparable and inalienable from\n   human being. In other words, it is born with the\n   human being and extinguishes with human being.&quot;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                 22</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">        Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul - Paras 639 and 650\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">           639. The right to privacy as already observed is not\n           absolute. The right to privacy as falling in Part III of\n           the Constitution may, depending on its variable facts,\n           vest in one part or the other, and would thus be\n           subject to the restrictions of exercise of that particular\n           fundamental right. National security would thus be an\n           obvious restriction, so would the provisos to different\n           fundamental rights, dependent on where the right to\n           privacy would arise. The public interest element would\n           be another aspect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">           650. Let the right to privacy, an inherent right, be\n           unequivocally a fundamental right embedded in Part\n           III of the Constitution of India, but subject to the\n           restrictions specified, relatable to that part.

It is stated very clearly in clause (1) - that these\n\n&quot;Standing Orders&quot; in the Manual do not supersede any\n\nstatutory rules, regulations etc. As per Clause (2) these orders\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                      27</span>\n\n\n\n\ndo not vest the police officers with any power not specifically\n\nconferred with the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_72\">Cr.P.C</a>., <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_73\">I.P.C</a>., etc.             It is clear that the\n\nManual is only a guideline and procedure for all the police\n\nofficers. Thus (apart from the authoritative case law) it is clear\n\nthat the Police Standing Orders do not have any statutory force.\n\nThey are not even regulations and are mere departmental\n\ninstructions.          It is clearly spelt out in all the three G.O.s,\n\nmentioned above that they will not supersede any rule or\n\nregulation. They are admittedly not framed under the <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_74\">Police\n\nAct, 1861</a> or any other such law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133024\" id=\"span_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"846379\" id=\"span_81\">28) As     far   as   sufficiency   of   pleadings   issue   is\n\nconcerned, this Court is of the opinion that sufficient pleadings\n\nhave been raised.

Even\n\notherwise, the parties had ample opportunity spread over days\n\nfor arguing the issue. The case law cited and considered makes\n\nit clear that the issue of infringement of Fundamental Rights\n\nwas argued.            All the facts necessary for determination are\n\nbefore this Court.            Therefore, this Court holds that the\n\nadequacy of pleadings issue is not very material.

These judgments have\n\n              become final and have not been challenged.\n\n              Therefore, there is no need for further &#x27;declaration&#x27;\n\n              on this as mentioned earlier.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">        c) Once the Police Standing Orders are held /\n\n              declared to be without any statutory force in the\n\n              State of Andhra Pradesh it is not necessary or\n\n              needed for a party to seek a de novo declaration\n\n              that the Standing Orders are contrary to law.\n\n              However, such a prayer is made in W.P.No.3568 of\n\n              2022 and an Interlocutory Application (I.A.No.2 of\n\n              2022) was also filed to amend the prayer. The said\n\n              application is also allowed and the prayer is\n\n              amended.

That domiciliary\n\n            visits are continuing is alleged.           Display of\n\n            photographs is also alleged. Summoning to the\n\n            Police Station; being asked to wait for hours;\n\n            branding a person as &quot;rowdy&quot; contrary to law etc.,\n\n            are all urged. Difficulties faced for simple issues\n\n            like getting a passport due to the pendency of a\n\n            rowdy sheet are also urged. Persons involved in a\n\n            single but simple offence are branded as habitual\n\n            offenders.   There are also glaring violations and\n\n            disobedience    of     the   judicial   orders   passed.\n\n            Application of mind is not visible as per PSO 600(2)\n\n            etc., and periodic review as per PSO 602 (1 and 2)\n\n            is also not visible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">      30) However, the compelling State interest, which is so\n\nwell argued and articulated by Sri G. Maheswar Reddy, learned\n\nGovernment Pleader for Home, cannot be totally lost sight of by\n\nthis Court and needs to be answered. This compelling State\n\ninterest is the need of the State and the police to prevent the\n\ncrime. The &quot;surveillance&quot; and the opening of rowdy sheets is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                               30</span>\n\n\n\n\njustified by the learned Government Pleader for Home on the\n\nground that the collection of this data and information is\n\nnecessary for the purpose of detection of a crime before it\n\noccurs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">       31) This Court cannot be oblivious to this compelling\n\nState need or that this procedure has been in vogue for\n\ndecades. However, it must be said again that the efforts to\n\n&quot;prevent&quot; crime do not meet the test of law. The issue is about\n\nthe use / misuse of the information and the abuse of power.\n\nUnobtrusive surveillance, gathering of information through\n\nlawful means was not prohibited. In fact, it was held necessary\n\nto prevent crime in the earlier cases. The indiscriminate use of\n\nthis information; the night visits; frequent calling to the police\n\nstation; display of photographs is the issue, despite the clear\n\njudgments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_90\">32) Sri Maheswar Reddy, learned Government Pleader\n\nfor Home sought to get over the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_83\">K.S.Puttaswamy</a>\n\n(2 supra) by stating that the factual context in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_84\">the said\n\njudgment</a> is different. He also relied upon the compilation of\n\njudgments which he had furnished including the judgments of\n\nGobind and Malak Singh cases (9 and 1 supra) etc., to\n\nsubstantiate his case that these judgments of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt permitted certain actions of the Police like surveillance\n\netc.   Therefore, he sought to justify the police action in the\n\npresent case.</span>   In the case of Gobind (9 supra), the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court found that the regulations were traceable to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                     31</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 46(2) (c)</a> the Police Act.            In Malak Singh&#x27;s case (1\n\nsupra), the vires of the rules was not challenged. However, in\n\nthe State of Andhra Pradesh, it is clear the standing orders are\n\nnot framed under any statute.

In   India   the    grundnorm     is   the   Indian\n                        Constitution, and the hierarchy is as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">                        (i) The Constitution of India;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">                        (ii) Statutory law, which may be either law made by\n                        Parliament or by the State Legislature;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                        (iii) Delegated legislation, which may be in the form of\n                        rules made under the statute, regulations made\n                        under the statute, etc.;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">                        (iv) Purely executive orders not made under any\n                        statute.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">                        35. If a law (norm) in a higher layer in the above\n                        hierarchy clashes with a law in a lower layer, the\n                        former will prevail. Hence a constitutional provision\n                        will prevail over all other laws, whether in a statute\n                        or in delegated legislation or in an executive order.\n                        The Constitution is the highest law of the land, and\n                        no law which is in conflict with it can survive. Since\n                        the law made by the legislature is in the second layer\n                        of the hierarchy, obviously it will be invalid if it is in\n                        conflict with a provision in the Constitution (except\n                        the directive principles which, by <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 37</a>, have\n                        been expressly made non-enforceable).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">            37) The duty of a Constitutional Court is also spelt out in this\nvery judgment as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">                        90.

This\n\n          should be done on a high priority.      The comment\n\n          made by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\n\n          Gobind case (9 supra) is that &quot;In truth, legality\n\n          apart, these regulations ill-accord with the essence of\n\n          personal freedoms and the State will do well to revise\n\n          these old police regulations verging perilously near\n\n          unconstitutionality&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">          Even after about 45 years it transpires that the State\n\n          did not revise the old Police regulations which were\n\n          held to be very close to unconstitutionality&quot;.    It is\n\n          hoped that the State would urgently frame an\n\n          appropriate law on this subject keeping in view the\n\n          laws on the subject including the aspect of &#x27;privacy&#x27;\n\n          being declared a Fundamental Right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"496236\" id=\"span_113\">(b) This Court also notices that Chapter-VII of the\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_110\">Cr.P.C</a>., is hardly being invoked by the Police. This\n\n          provides for obtaining security for keeping the peace\n\n          and for good behaviour i.e., to prevent crime. The\n\n          various Sections 106, 111 and other sections of this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                       38</span>\n\n\n\n\n                Part of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_111\">Cr.P.C</a>., are in the opinion of this Court\n\n                enough to meet the apprehension of the police that\n\n                they should know about the activities of the people,\n\n                who are classified as rowdies etc., and for preventing\n\n                crime. In fact, <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_112\">Sections 107</a> and <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_113\">109</a> Cr.P.C., deal\n\n                with people, who are likely to commit a crime, which\n\n                is a cognizable offence or disturb the public\n\n                tranquillity etc., and to take preventive steps.\n\n                Similarly, Section 110 (a) to (g) of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_114\">Cr.P.C</a>., also deals\n\n                with &#x27;habitual offenders&#x27;. These Sections also provide\n\n                some procedural safeguards. Their efficacy and use\n\n                has been recognised and upheld in cases like <a href=\"/doc/496236/\" id=\"a_115\">Madhu\n\n                Limaye v Sub-Divisional Magistrate22</a>. Therefore,\n\n                for the present, this Court is of the opinion that if the\n\n                Police are of the opinion that a check must be kept on\n\n                the activities of the habitual offenders or others likely\n\n                to commit a crime and to prevent a crime the\n\n                provisions of this Chapter must be utilised.
