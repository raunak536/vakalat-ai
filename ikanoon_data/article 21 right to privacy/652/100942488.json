By filing this application, the applicant has raised the necessary\n\n      protocol for maintaining the ambient air quality. The learned\n\n      counsel representing the Central Pollution Control Board (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_2\">CPC</a>B)\n\n      has submitted that necessary protocol has been issued and\n\n      ambient air quality has been notified by the authority concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_2\">2.    The learned counsel appearing for applicant has submitted that the\n\n      standards presently set for noise levels in relation to the sirens and\n\n      multi-toned horns are not in the consonance with the Environment\n\n      protection Rules, 2006 r/w Notification dated 31.07.2014 issued by\n\n      Environment Department for the Govt. of Maharashtra which\n\n      specified a certain decibel higher standard than those specified in\n\n      Environment Protection Rule.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                              1</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\"> 3.   Before entering into the arena of above issues, we would like to lay\n\n     emphasis on fact that increasing noise levels in the urban areas, is\n\n     posing a serious threat to health of the people in general and\n\n     especially to the children and old, in particular. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\n     Supreme Court and various High Courts, have time and again\n\n     emphasized the need to control noise pollution and we do not wish\n\n     to reproduce all such catena of Judgments, as importance of\n\n     maintaining noise levels within urban areas was generally agreed\n\n     by the learned Counsel appearing in the present Application too. It\n\n     is also an admitted fact that automobiles, due to its engine (auto\n\n     mechanism) noise and also, noise generated by blowing of horns\n\n     contribute significantly to ambient noise levels in urban areas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">     Needless to say that various reports available in the public domain,\n\n     record that ambient noise levels in most of urban areas in the\n\n     country are exceeding the ambient noise level standards as set out\n\n     in the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. Noise\n\n     pollution is a significant environmental problem in many urban\n\n     areas. This problem has not been adequately addressed and\n\n     remedied despite the fact that it is growing in developing countries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">     This widespread non- recognition of noise pollution problem, in a\n\n     similar fashion as to air and water pollution problems, could be\n\n     attributed to reasons such as; by the definition and perception of\n\n     noise as a subjective experience, short decay time, and difficulty to\n\n     associate cause with effect when it comes to health impacts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     Depending on its duration and volume, the effects of noise on\n\n     human health and comfort are divided into four categories; physical\n\n     effects, such as hearing defects; physiological effects, such as\n\n     increased blood pressure, irregularity of heart rhythms and ulcers;\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                         2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">      psychological effects, such as disorders, sleeplessness and going to\n\n     sleep late, irritability and stress; and finally effects on work\n\n     performance,    such     as    reduction    of    productivity    and\n\n     misunderstanding what is heard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.   The Motor vehicle rule 120 prescribes the noise standards for\n\n     automobiles at manufacturing stage and are as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;120.

The provisions of Rule 120 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules,\n\n     1989   are   very   specific   as   standards   specified   under   the\n\n     Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 have been adopted for every\n\n     motor vehicle at construction stage and also while it is put to use.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">     Therefore it is necessary that compliance of such standards, need\n\n     to be independently verified and assessed by the concern agencies\n\n     while granting Certificate of Test, under the Rule 126 of the Central\n\n     Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.

It is an established principle of law that the right to life, as\n                        envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India includes\n                        the right to a decent environment1. It includes within its ambit\n                        the right of a citizen to live in a clean environment2. With\n                        regard to vehicular traffic, this Court has issued a number of\n                        directions to ensure a clean environment and reduce\n                        pollution3. It has been held that the right to clean environment\n                        is a fundamental rights4.The right to live in an environment\n                        free from smoke and pollution follows from the &quot;quality&quot; of life\n                        which is an inherent part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

The apex court while dealing with the issue of privacy as\npart of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India held that right to\nsleep has always been treated to be a fundamental right like\nright to breath, to eat, to drink, to blink, etc. In the case of\nRamlila Maidan Incident, in re, reported in 2012 (5) SCC 1 in\nparagraphs 318 and 327, the apex court held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">&quot;318.

An individual is entitled to sleep as comfortably and as\nfreely as he breathes. Sleep is essential for a human being to\nmaintain the delicate balance of health necessary for its very\nexistence and survival. Sleep is, therefore, a fundamental and\nbasic requirement without which the existence of life itself\nwould be in peril. To disturb sleep, therefore, would amount to\ntorture which is now accepted as a violation of human right. It\nwould be similar to a third degree method which at times is\nsought to be justified as a necessary police action to extract\nthe truth out of an accused involved in heinous and cold-\nblooded crimes. It is also a device adopted during warfare\nwhere prisoners of war and those involved in espionage are\nsubjected to treatments depriving them of normal sleep.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">23. There is catena of judicial decisions which recognizes the\nright to live in freedom from noise pollution as a fundamental\nright protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Noise\npollution beyond permissible limit is hazardous which violates\nthe fundamental rights of citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">24. In the case of Church of God (Supra), the Supreme Court\nhas held that no religion prescribes that prayers should be\nperformed by disturbing the peace of others nor does it preach\nthat they should be through voice amplifiers or beating of\ndrums. In a civilized society in the name of religion, activities\nwhich disturb old or infirm persons, students or children\nhaving their sleep in the early hours or during daytime or other\npersons carrying on other activities cannot be permitted. A\nstudent preparing for his examination is entitled to concentrate\non his studies without their being any unnecessary\ndisturbance by the neighbours. Similarly, the old and the\ninfirm are entitled to enjoy reasonable quietness during their\nleisure hours without there being any nuisance of noise\npollution. Aged, sick, people afflicted with psychic\ndisturbances as well as children up to 6 years of age are\nconsidered to be very sensitive to noise. Their rights are also\nrequired to be honoured.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                               17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\"> 26. It cannot be denied that sound is one of the recognised\nmode of creating pollution and thus sound pollution by means\nof using loud-speakers, without prior permission of authority,\nas prescribed in law, has to be controlled. A citizen has a right\nto leisure, right to sleep, right not to hear and right to remain\nsilent. He has also the right to read and speak with others.\nUse of microphones certainly takes away the right of the\ncitizens to speak with others, their right to read or think or the\nright to sleep. There may be heart patients or patients\nsuffering from nervous disorder and they may be compelled to\nbear this serious impact of sound pollution which has had an\nadverse effect on them. It may create health problems.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">27. No person has right to take away the right of others. There\nis no religious freedom in this country except the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_50\">Art. 25</a> of the Constitution which is subject to public order,\nmorality and health and other provisions of part III\nincluding <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_51\">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. Freedom of\nreligion is subject to others&#x27; right as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_52\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, namely, religious freedom cannot\nabridge or take away or suspend others&#x27; right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_53\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> regarding their freedom of speech and expression. Use\nof loud-speakers is not an integral part of Azan or necessary\nfor making Azan effective. Use of loud-speakers otherwise in\naccordance with law affects fundamental rights of the citizens\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19 (1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. No one has\ngot the right to make other persons captive listeners. One\ncannot disturb others&#x27; basic human rights and fundamental\nrights. Use of loud-speakers can cause hearing loss,\ndisturbance of sleep, interference with communication,\nannoyance etc. and other diseases. Right to sleep is not only a\nfundamental right but it is to be conceded to be a basic human\nright.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">29.

Rule 5 deals with not only use of loud-speakers/public\naddress system but it also deals with sound producing\ninstruments or a musical instrument or a sound amplifier.\nUnder Sub-rule (1) of Rule 5, it is provided that a loud-speaker\nor a public address system shall not be used except after\nobtaining written permission from the Authority under the\nNoise Pollution Rules. Sub-rule (2) provides that a loudspeaker\nor a public address system or any sound producing instrument\nor a musical instrument or a sound amplifier shall not be used\nat night time except in closed premises such as auditorium,\nconference halls, banquet halls, community halls or during a\npublic emergency. The Schedule under the Rules of 2000,\ndefines night time to mean the period between 10.00 p.m. to\n6.00 a.m. Day time is defined as 6.00 am to 10.00 pm. Thus,\neven if permission is granted under Sub-rule (1) of Rule (5) to\nuse loudspeakers or public address systems, the same cannot\nbe used between 10.00 pm till 6.00 a.m. Then comes Sub-rule\n(3) which confers power of relaxation on the State Government.\nIt confers power on the State to permit the use of loudspeakers\nor public address system and the like during night hours\n(between 10.00 p.m. to 12.00 midnight) on or during any\ncultural or religious festive occasion not exceeding fifteen days\nin all during a calendar year. The said Sub-Rule requires the\nconcerned State Government to specify in advance, the\nnumber and particulars of the days on which such exemption\nwould be operative. Sub-rule (3) is an exception carved out\nwhich permits the State Government to relax the prohibition\nunder Sub-rule (3) for a period of 15 days in a calender year\nby permitting use of loudspeakers/public address systems or\nthe like only between 10 pm to 12 midnight.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">31. The challenge to Sub-rule (3) was negated by the Apex\nCourt in the case of Noise Pollution (VII) Vs. Union of India and\nOrs. (2005) 8 SCC 796. In paragraph 8 of the said decision the\nApex Court held thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">&quot;8. Looking at the diversity of cultures and religions in India,\nwe think that a limited power of exemption from the operation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                 20</span>\n             of the Noise Rules granted by the Central Government in\n            exercise of its statutory power cannot be held to be\n            unreasonable. The power to grant exemption is conferred on\n            the State Government. It cannot be further delegated. The\n            power shall be exercised by reference to the State as a unit\n            and not by reference to districts, so as to specify different\n            dates for different districts. It can be reasonably expected that\n            the State Government would exercise the power with due care\n            and caution and in the public interest. However, we make it\n            clear that the scope of the exemption cannot be widened either\n            by increasing the number of days or by increasing the\n            duration beyond two hours. If that is attempted to be done,\n            then the said Sub-rule (3) conferring power to grant exemption\n            may be liable to be struck down as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">Article\n            14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">21</a> of the Constitution. We also make it clear that the\n            State Government should generally specify in advance, the\n            number and particulars of the days on which such exemption\n            will be operative. Such specification would exclude\n            arbitrariness in the exercise of power. The exemption, when\n            granted, shall not apply to silence zone areas. This is only as\n            a clarification as this even otherwise is the position of law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">            32. Thus, under no circumstances loud-speakers or any public\n            address system or musical system or sound amplifiers can be\n            permitted to be used between 12.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. As\n            according to Noise Pollution Rules, night hours have been fixed\n            between 10. p.m. to 6 a.m. For the period between 10pm to 12\n            midnight the power of relaxation has been conferred only upon\n            the State Government under Sub Rule 3 of Rule 5.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">            37. xxxx In this regard emphasis has been laid on Paragraphs 9\n            &amp; 10 of the guidelines contained in order No. 40-3/2020-D\n            dated 24.03.2020, issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs,\n            Government of India for containing Covid-19 pandemic in the\n            country, which are as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">            &quot;(9) All places of worship shall be closed for public.
