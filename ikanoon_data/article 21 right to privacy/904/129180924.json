The reference order is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;The question raised in this case is of general\n     importance. It relates to the scope of ambit of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_5\">section 7-C</a>\n     of the Orissa Education Act. In particular it relates to the\n     interplay of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 7-C(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_7\">7-C(4)</a> of the Act and the\n     grant-in-aid    order    promulgated      in   terms   of\n     <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_8\">section 7-C(4)</a> of the Act. The Government has taken the\n     stand that it has been making budgetary allocations\n     within the limit of its economic capacity and the claims of\n     all those who may be eligible for the grant-in-aid could not\n     be considered in view of paucity of funds and they will be\n     considered, if found eligible, for grant-in-aid as and when\n     sufficient funds are allocated in that regard. The State\n     counsel relies upon <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_9\">section 7-C(4)</a> of the Act in support of\n     its submission.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">              Mr. Swain, learned counsel for the petitioners\n     relying upon the decision in OJC No.126 of 2001\n     submitted that this Court can issue a direction to the\n     government to make necessary budgetary allocation for\n     payment of grant-in-aid to all persons who are found\n     eligible under the grant-in aid to all persons who are found\n     eligible under the grant-in-aid order framed under <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_10\">section\n     7-C(4)</a> of the Act. It is further submitted that once a person\n     becomes eligible for grant-in-aid in terms of the grant-in-\n     aid order, the plea of paucity of funds cannot be accepted\n     in the light of the relevant decision of the Supreme Court.\n     Though in State of Orissa Vrs. Pratap Kumar Nayak &amp;\n     another, 93(2002) C.L.T. 79(SC), the Supreme Court had\n     occasion to refer to <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_11\">section 7-C</a> of the Act, their Lordships\n     have not examined the scope of that provision or the\n     interplay of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 7-C(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_13\">7-C(4)</a> of the Act and the\n     grant-in-aid order framed thereunder. But their Lordships\n     have reversed the direction issued by this Court for\n     payment of grant-in-aid and have affirmed another\n     direction issued by this Court to the Government to\n     consider the claim for grant-in-aid in terms of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_14\">section 7-C</a>\n     of the Act. Thus, the guideline issued by this decision is to\n     the effect that it is a matter for the Government to consider\n     and mere eligibility to receive grant-in-aid under the\n     Grant-in-Aid Order, does not necessarily result in a person\n     getting grant-in-aid as envisaged. In that context, Mr.\n     Swain submits that the Division Bench in the decision\n     referred to above, had issued a direction to the government\n     to make allocation of funds after considering the case of\n     the petitioner therein and if he is found eligible for grant-\n     in-aid in terms of the grant-in-aid order. With great\n     respect, we find it difficult to agree that in each and every\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                            3</span>\n\n\n\ncase once it is found that a person is eligible for grant-in-\naid in terms of the grant-in-aid order, a direction can be or\nshould be issued to the government to make budgetary\nallocation for payment to that person. Actually, there is no\ncase that the Government is not making allocations. It is\nmaking allocations, but its plea is that allocation is being\nmade within the limits of its economic capacity. It is not\nthe case that the plea of economic incapacity put\nforwarded by the Government is not bona fide and is a\nmere pretext for avoiding a statutory obligation or a\nconstitutional obligation. In that situation, can the Court\ndirect the Government to make budgetary allocation for\npayment of grant-in-aid to those who become eligible to\nreceive grant-in-aid under the grant-in-aid order? It is not\nthe case of one person or a few. A large number of teaching\nand non-teaching staff of various educational institutions\nare waiting. Therefore, unless we hold that the\nGovernment has an unqualified or absolute obligation\nand/or a constitutional obligation to make budgetary\nallocation for disbursement of grant-in-aid, any such\ndirection as sought for cannot be granted. Normally this\nCourt cannot issue a direction to the Government to make\nbudgetary provision for meeting such an obligation with\nrespect to any particular person or persons or any\ninstitution or institutions. There is also question as to how\nfar this Court, exercising its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226</a>\nof the Constitution, can direct that budgetary allocation be\nmade -- in this case be enhanced --in the circumstances,\nlike the present.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        As we notice, there are teaching and non-teaching\nstaff who are already in the Grant-in-Aid fold and are\nwaiting for arrears and regular salary payable to them and\nsuch matters are brought up every day before this Court.\nWe think that an authoritative pronouncement by a Full\nBench of this Court on the scope and ambit of section-7-C\nof the Orissa Education Act and the interplay of <a href=\"/doc/17738467/\" id=\"a_16\">section 7-</a>\nC, the Grant-in-Aid Order and other relevant orders and\nstatutory provisions and judicial pronouncements is\nneeded so that the decision can be applied uniformally in\nall cases. In view of this and in view of some of the\nobservations made in the judgment in OJC No.126 of 2001\nwith which we find some difficulty in agreeing, we feel that\nthe matter requires to be decided by a Full Bench.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        We, therefore, refer this case as a whole to the Full\nBench to finally decide all the questions falling for\ndecision.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                         4</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">3.           Before proceeding to consider the question, it may be\n\nnecessary to refer to the case of the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">4.           The petitioners seek direction for approval of their appointment\n\nand for release of salary under the direct payment scheme as per the\n\nprovisions of the Grant-in-Aid Order of 1994 read with Rule 9 of the Orissa\n\nEducation (Recruitment etc.) Rules, 1974 (in short &quot;the Rules&quot;). Their case\n\nis that they are teaching staff of Sukinda College, Sukinda in the district of\n\nJajpur. It is an aided educational institution under Section <a href=\"/doc/61342254/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 3(b)</a> of\n\nthe Orissa Education Act, 1969 (in short &quot;the Act&quot;). They were appointed\n\non 19.12.1992 as Demonstrator in Chemistry/Physics and became eligible\n\nto receive grant-in-aid w.e.f. 01.06.1998 as per Rule 9 of the Rules, 1974,\n\nbut approval to their appointment and grant of salary has not been given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">It is stated that appointment of lecturers in the said college has been\n\napproved and they are receiving salary, but demonstrators are not which is\n\nin violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.           In the counter affidavit filed by the Deputy Director of Higher\n\nEducation, it is stated that the Government has taken into consideration\n\nall the cases which acquired eligibility for grant-in-aid up to 01.06.1990\n\nand not beyond. Since the petitioners acquired eligibility on 01.06.1998,\n\ntheir cases have not been considered on account of economic capacity of\n\nthe Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">6.           Relying upon the earlier judgment of this Court in Prafulla\n\nKumar Sahoo Vrs. State of Orissa and others, 2003(I) OLR-91, it was\n\nsubmitted that the Government be directed to make necessary budget\n\nallocation for grant-in-aid to those who are found eligible for grant-in-aid\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       5</span>\n\n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 7-C (4)</a> of the Act. The plea of paucity of funds could not be\n\naccepted, -as held by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">7.           The Bench hearing the matter, vide above order of reference,\n\nfound it difficult to agree with some of the observations in Prafulla Kumar\n\nSahoo. It was observed that mere eligibility may not create an obligation,\n\nnor create a right for direction to make budget allocation unless the plea of\n\nfinancial incapacity is not bona fide. Accordingly, the Bench referred the\n\nwhole case to the Full Bench to finally decide the question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">8.           We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n\nrecord.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">9.           <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_20\">The Act</a> has been enacted by the State of Orissa for better\n\norganization and development of educational institutions in the State. It,\n\ninter-alia, provides for regulating establishment of educational institutions,\n\ngrant of recognition, management of educational institutions, appointment\n\nand service conditions of teachers and setting up of a tribunal to adjudicate\n\ndisputes between the managing committees and teachers/employees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">10.          <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 7-C</a> of the Act relates to Grant-in-Aid.

In exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 7-C (4)</a> of the Act, the Orissa\n\n(Non-Government Colleges, Junior Colleges and Higher Secondary Schools)\n\nGrant-in-Aid Order, 1994 (in short, &quot;the 1994 Order&quot;), has been issued to\n\nregulate payment of grant-in- aid to private educational institutions. The\n\nOrder lists the categories of non-government educational institutions\n\neligible for consideration as aided educational institutions, procedure for\n\nnotifying an institution as aided educational institution and the extent of\n\naid to be given. Aid has to be given for the teaching and non-teaching posts\n\nof the specified categories at admissible rates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">12.         In Prufulla Kumar Sahoo, the question for consideration was as\n\nto the validity of decision to abolish 50% of base level posts and not to\n\nadmit any posts in the cadre of Class III and Class IV into grant-in-aid\n\nunless necessary for academic activity of the college. Prufulla Kumar Sahoo\n\nwas getting grant-in-aid against the post of a Library Attendant. He was\n\npromoted to the post of Junior Librarian and the said post was not\n\nadmitted to the grant-in-aid fold. The contention raised on behalf of Sahoo\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\nwas that grant-in-aid having already been sanctioned for the post in\n\nquestion, the same could not be discontinued in view of the provisions of\n\nthe 1994 Order. Plea of lack of financial capacity could not be the\n\njustification to avoid responsibility or the State for proper education.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">Section 7-C (1) applied to institutions and not to posts and if the\n\ninstitutions are covered by the grant-in-aid, aid in respect of a post for\n\nwhich grant-in-aid had already been sanctioned could not be discontinued.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">13.         After a succinct analysis of the entire case law vis-Ã -vis\n\nSections 7-C(1), 7-C(4) and Grant-in-Aid Order 1994, the Bench speaking\n\nthrough Justice A.K.Patnaik (as His Lordship then was), in paragraphs 12,\n\n13 and 15 of the report held as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1816877\" id=\"span_7\">&quot;12. ....After the claim to eligibility to grant-in-aid is\n      decided by the Director, the State Government has to decide\n      the date from which the grant-in-aid would be paid after\n      finding the resources for making such payment. If funds are\n      available under the budget for making payment of the grant-in-\n      aid, the State Government can forthwith issue the order\n      specifying the date from which the payment of grant-in-aid\n      would be made. But if budgetary allocations for grant-in-aid\n      have been exhausted, the State Government will have to wait\n      till such budgetary allocations are made. Thus until the State\n      Government issues an order determining the date from which\n      grant-in-aid is payable to an educational institution or to a\n      member of the teaching or non-teaching staff of the educational\n      institution after finding the resources for the same, grant-in-aid\n      cannot be claimed as a matter of right and no direction can be\n      issued by the Court for payment. But once the State\n      Government issues an order determining the date from which\n      grant-in-aid is payable, a direction can be given by the Court to\n      make payment of grant-in-aid, both current and arrear. This\n      conclusion is in accord with the decision of the Supreme Court\n      in <a href=\"/doc/1816877/\" id=\"a_25\">State of Orissa and another v. Pratap Kumar Nayak\n      and another</a> (supra) that case of each employee for grant-in-\n      aid has to be considered as per the Grant-in-Aid Order and\n      <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 7-C</a> of the Orissa Education Act, 1969 and it is for the\n      State Government to examine each and every case in\n      accordance with the prescribed procedure for such grant-in-\n      aid.</span> This conclusion is also consistent with the view taken by\n      the Full Bench of this Court in Laxmidhar Pati and others v.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 8</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1816877\" id=\"span_9\"><a href=\"/doc/1816877/\" id=\"a_27\">State of Orissa and others</a> (supra) that mere eligibility to grant-\nin-aid ipso facto does not confer a right or entitlement on the\neducational institution or its teaching or non-teaching staff to\nclaim and receive grant-in-aid.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       13. This is not to say that after the eligibility or\nadmissibility to grant-in-aid is decided in accordance with the\nGrant-in-Aid Order, 1994 by the authorities of the Education\nDepartment, Government of Orissa, the State Government will\ndefer payment of grant-in-aid to educational institutions or\nmembers of teaching or non-teaching staff held to be eligible or\nadmissible to grant-in-aid for a long and indefinite period of\ntime. Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 7-C</a> of the Orissa Education Act\nprovides that the State Government &quot;shall&quot; within the limits of\nits economic capacity, set apart a sum of money annually for\nbeing given as grant-in-aid to private educational institutions\nin the State. The aforesaid provisions of law, therefore, casts an\nobligation on the State Government to set apart a sum of\nmoney for being given as grant-in-aid to private educational\ninstitutions in the State. Such obligation of the State\nGovernment, however, is subject to the limits of its economic\ncapacity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        15. Orissa is a State with large sections of people\nincluding Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are\nilliterate and backward consistent with the Directive Principles\nof the State Policy in <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/352126/\" id=\"a_30\">46</a> of the Constitution, the\nlegislature has imposed a mandate on the State Government\nunder Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 7-C</a> of the Orissa Education\nAct to set apart a sum of money annually for being given as\ngrant-in-aid to private educational institutions in the State\nsubject to the limits of its economic capacity. The State\nGovernment has also made the Grant-in-Aid Order, 1994\nunder Sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 7-C</a> of the Orissa Education\nAct clearly indicating the relevant factors to be taken into\nconsideration for deciding the eligibility of an educational\ninstitution or a member of teaching or non-teaching staff of\nsuch educational institution keeping in mind the educational\nneeds of the State. The State Government cannot ignore such\nlegislative mandate as well as the Directive Principles of State\nPolicy and the statutory provisions of the Grant-in-Aid Order,\n1994. Unless, therefore, there are other more pressing needs\nthan education, the State Government must set apart sufficient\nmoney for making payment of grant-in-aid to educational\ninstitutions or their teaching or non-teaching staff in\naccordance with the Grant-in-Aid Order, 1994&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">                                             (Empahasis added)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                      9</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">14.

The view taken in Prufulla Kumar\n\nSahoo is that the State is under an obligation under Section 7-C (4) to set\n\napart such sum of money as may meet the mandate of Section 7-C(4). The\n\nsaid mandate is supported by directive principles under <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_34\">Articles 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_35\">42</a>\n\nof the Constitution.

This expression cannot be read as\n\nnullifying the mandate of Section 7-C(4). It is obvious that grant-in-aid has\n\nto be paid as per Order or Rule made by the State itself. There is no reason\n\nto presume that the State will issue an Order/Rule without its economical\n\ncapacity.

Since we are dealing with two sub-\n          sections of S. 76, it is necessary that the said two sub-sections\n          must be construed as a whole &quot;each portion throwing light, if\n          need be, on the rest.&quot; The two sub-sections must be read as\n          parts of an integral whole and as being inter-dependent; an\n          attempt should be made in construing them to reconcile them\n          if it is reasonably possible to do so, and to avoid repugnancy.\n          If repugnancy cannot possibly be avoided, then a question\n          may arise as to which of the two should prevail.

Since Section 7-C(4) provides for grant-in-aid as per orders of\n\nthe State itself, such order cannot be rendered ineffective by permitting\n\nplea of financial incapacity.     Section 7-C(1) can only apply to claim for\n\ngrant-in-aid beyond the orders of the State under Section 7-C(4).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">18.

Upon that assumption, the question\n   which we have to consider is whether the right to life\n   includes the right to livelihood. We sees only one answer\n   to that question, namely, that it does. The sweep of the\n   right to life conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Art. 21</a> is wide and far-\n   reaching. It does not mean merely that life cannot be\n   extinguished or taken away as, for example, by the\n   imposition and execution of the death sentence, except\n   according to procedure established by law. That is but\n   one aspect of the right to life. An equally important facet\n   of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person\n   can live without the means of living, that is, the means\n   of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a\n   part of the constitutional right life, the easiest way of\n   depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive\n   him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation.\n   Such deprivation would not only denude the life of its\n   effective content and meaningfulness but it would make\n   life impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would\n   not have to be in accordance with the procedure\n   established by law, if the right to livelihood is not\n   regarded as a part of the right to live. That, which alone\n   makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life\n   livable, must be deemed to be an integral component of\n   the right to life. Deprive a person of his right to\n   livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                         14</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">Indeed, that explains the massive migration of the rural\npopulation to big cities. They migrate because they have\nno means of livelihood in the villages. The motive force\nwhich propels their desertion of their hearts and homes\nin the village is the struggle for survival, that is, the\nstruggle for life. So unimpeachable is the evidence of the\nnexus between life and the means of livelihood. They\nhave to eat to live : Only a handful can afford the luxury\nof living to eat. That they can do, namely, eat, only if\nthey have the means of livelihood. That is the context in\nwhich it was said by Douglas, J. in Baksey (( 19 54) 347\nMD 442) that the right to work is the most precious\nliberty that man possesses. It is the most precious\nliberty because, it sustains and enables a man to live\nand the right to life is a precious freedom. &quot;Life&quot;, as\nobserved by Field, J. in Munn v.

It is well accepted by the thinkers,\nphilosophers and academicians that if JUSTICE, LIBERTY,\nEQUALITY and FRATERNITY, including social, economic and\npolitical justice, the golden goals set out in the Preamble to the\nConstitution of India are to be achieved, the Indian polity has\nto be educated and educated with excellence. Education is a\nnational wealth which must be distributed equally and widely,\nas far as possible, in the interest of creating an egalitarian\nsociety, to enable the country to rise high and face global\ncompetition. &#x27;Tireless striving stretching its arms towards\nperfection&#x27; (to borrow the expression from Rabindranath\nTagore) would not be successful unless strengthened by\neducation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">90.

In order to achieve this constitutional\n      mandate, the State has to place much greater emphasis on\n      allocating more funds for primary and secondary education.\n      There is no corresponding constitutional right to higher\n      education. The entire nation&#x27;s progress virtually depends upon\n      the proper and effective implementation of Article 21-A.\n              xx            xx           xx           xx                xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">      423. Though an improvement over past performance, the\n      overall education picture leaves much to be desired. The bad\n      news is really bad. Even where we have seen improvement,\n      there is still failure. A survey by Pratham, an NGO, fleshes out\n      the acute problems found in rural schools. (See ASER 2007--\n      Rural Annual Status of Education Report for 2007, published\n      on 16-1-2008.) The survey covered 16,000 villages. As\n      Pratham indicates, there are an estimated 140 million children\n      in the age group of 6 to 14 years in primary schools. Of these\n      30 million cannot read, 40 million can recognise a few\n      alphabets, 40 million can read some words, and 30 million can\n      read paragraphs. Over 55 million of these children will not\n      complete four years of school, eventually adding to the illiterate\n      population of India. The national literacy rate is 65%.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">      424. 24 districts with more than 50,000 out of school children\n      means we have failed 24 times over. 71 districts in which\n      there are 60 students per teacher is just as bad, if not worse.\n      According to Pratham (and in-line with the Ministry of HRD&#x27;s\n      six-month review), the number of out of school children has\n      hovered around 7,50,000. (p.      6) Moreover, it goes without\n      saying that children need proper facilities. Today, just 59% of\n      schools can boast of a usable toilet.

While the Government is on the right track with regard to\n      improving the infrastructure of our system, books and\n      buildings only go so far. They are necessary but not sufficient\n      for achieving the ultimate goals of (1) keeping children in\n      school, (2) ensuring that they learn how to think critically, and\n      (3) ensuring that they learn skills that will help them secure\n      gainful employment. The quality of education provided in the\n      majority of primary schools is woeful. That is why I find it\n      necessary to review government spending on education--\n      especially at the primary/secondary level.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">              xx            xx           xx         xxx           xxx\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                         19</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">            440.
