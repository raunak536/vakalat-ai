They alleged\n\n                that the family member was prone to medical history of seizures caused by\n\n                disturbed sleep patterns, stress and lack of timely food.

It would thus suffice to outline the incident without any necessity for\n\n                minute and private details, such as the name of the family member, name of\n\n                treating doctor, name of the hospital and details of medical condition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">                          68.

However,\n\n                there is nothing that prevents the Courts from providing such succor or solace\n\n                to deserving persons upon our being so convinced, and it is left for the Courts\n\n                to sift the facts of each case and decide on such erasure/redaction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">                          70.

The open justice system is dealt with in detail in the case of Swapnil\n\n                Tripathi V. Supreme Court of India. Three Judges of the Hon’ble Supreme\n\n                Court, noting that generally criminal and civil Courts in India are open Courts,\n\n                opined that technology has made it possible for Courts to literally be open in\n\n                the sense of removing infrastructural restrictions and logistical issues.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">                          85. Indeed, the phenomenon of open Courts has literally brought justice\n\n                as well as the justice dispensation system to the doorsteps of citizens. There has\n\n                however, to be a fine balance between the concept of open justice and that of\n\n                the privacy of the litigant. The fact that privacy is an inalienable and undeniable\n\n                facet of the right to life and dignity is too well settled now. That apart, the right\n\n                to erasure is also now statutorily enshrined in the <a href=\"/doc/121417409/\" id=\"a_95\">DPDP Act</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">                          86. While the appellant relies on the judgment in the case of\n\n                K.S.Puttaswamy, the respondent would rely on the judgment in the case of\n\n                Swapnil Tripathi.        In our considered view and having studied both the\n\n                judgments carefully, we do not believe that the same militate at any level\n\n                whatsoever. A careful balance has to be achieved between the concept of Open\n\n                Court and Open access justice, and the cry for privacy. There could be no\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                34</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                                                                               W.A.(MD)No.1901 of 2021</span>\n\n\n\n\n                totalitarian application of either one concept as that would defeat the purpose of\n\n                both equally valid concepts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">                          87. Being a service institution committed to serving the cause of justice,\n\n                the Courts cannot close their eyes to the concerns of privacy and the right that\n\n                enure in the litigations to leave behind parts of their past which are no longer\n\n                relevant. This, in our view, would be a proper understanding and reconciliation\n\n                of the ratio of the judgments in Swapnil Tripathi and K.S.Puttasamy, balancing\n\n                the concept of open Court/open justice on the one hand and privacy concerns of\n\n                a citizen, on the other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">                          88.

The Writ Court has also expressed helplessness in passing ‘orders\n\n                and judgments in acquittal due to slipshod investigation, dishonest witnesses\n\n                and lack of an effective witness protection system. This Court honestly feels\n\n                that our criminal justice system is yet to reach such standards where Courts\n\n                can venture to pass orders for redaction of name of an accused person on\n\n                certain objective criteria prescribed by rules or regulations’.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">                          90.

True, Courts must do everything in their power and strive to\n\n                perfect the system. However, we do believe that the fallibility or vulnerability\n\n                of the criminal justice system must not stand in the way of rendition of justice\n\n                elsewhere, if, when, and where it is called for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">                          91. In the present case, there is no dispute in that the judgment in Crl.A.\n\n                (MD) No.321 of 2011 has attained finality. In that judgment, the Bench states\n\n                categorically &#x27;In the result, I hold that the appeal should be allowed and the\n\n                accused acquitted. I am not giving any benefit of doubt to the accused and\n\n                acquitting him, but I am holding that the accused has disproved the\n\n                prosecution case and has earned this acquittal.&#x27; The acquittal is thus full,\n\n                complete and unconditional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">                          92.

The fact that the ‘principle of fresh start’ has been statutorily enshrined\n\n                under the Juvenile Justice (Care and protection of Children), Act, 2015 cannot\n\n                lead to the conclusion that adults are not entitled to the same.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">                          CONCLUSION:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">                          93.
