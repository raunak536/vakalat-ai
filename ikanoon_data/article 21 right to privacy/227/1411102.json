Due to property dispute, his paternal uncle lodged a complaint\nwith the Sub-Inspector of Police, M.Reddiapatty Police Station, Virudhunagar\nDistrict and that a case in Crime No.99 of 2002 was registered against the\npetitioner and others, under <a href=\"/doc/1947545/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 448</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_3\">427</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_4\">506(2)</a> IPC. As there was an\nillegal demand to delete the name of the petitioner and his family members from\nthe criminal case, the same was refused by the petitioner. The Sub-Inspector of\nPolice, M.Reddiapatty Police Station, became inimical towards the petitioner and\nothers.  Though a final report was filed in C.C.No.100 of 2003, on the file of\nthe Learned Judicial Magistrate, Aruppukottai, the criminal Court acquitted the\npetitioner of the charges, as no witnesses supported the prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\t\t\t3.

As retention of the petitioner in History Sheet (Rowdy) has\naffected his reputation in the society, he made a representation, dated\n25.07.2005 to the second respondent, to delete his name.  As the said\nrepresentation was not considered, he was constrained to file W.P.No.7031 of\n2005.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\t\t\t5.\tBy an order, dated 03.08.2005, this Court directed\nthe Deputy Superintendent of Police, Virudhunagar District, Virudhunagar, to\npass orders on the representation.

The other case in\nCrime No.99 of 2002 registered under <a href=\"/doc/1947545/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 448</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_8\">427</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_9\">506(2)</a> IPC, on\naccount of property dispute, which culminated in C.C.No.100 of 2003, on the file\nof the Judicial Magistrate, Aruppukottai, had ended in acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t\t\t7.Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner further\ncontented that the History Sheet (Rowdy List) has been opened mechanically by\nthe second respondent, without proper consideration of the facts and the\nimpugned order of rejection, is not in accordance with Police Standing Orders\n747 and 749.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">\t\t\t8 Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Selvaraj\nand others v. The Inspector of Police, Kaliakavilai Police Station, Kanyakumari\nDistrict and others reported in 2010-1-L.W. (Crl.) 497,  learned counsel for the\npetitioner submitted that pendency of a single case without any conviction is\nnot a valid ground to include the name of the petitioner in the list of History\nSheeted Rowdies.  He also submitted that continuation of the petitioner in the\nsaid sheet, amounts to violation of his right to life and personal liberty\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.  For the above said\nreasons, he prayed that a suitable direction may be issued to the respondents to\nremove the name of the petitioner from the History Sheet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\t\t\t9.\tPer contra, based on the counter affidavit filed\nby the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Aruppukottai, Virudhunagar District,\ndated 5th December, 2005, Mr.K.Balasubramanian, learned Additional Government\nPleader, submitted that the petitioner, was involved in many criminal cases\nbefore 2005 and the details of the cases are, (i) Crime Nos.65 of 2000 under\n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 326</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_12\">506(ii)</a> of IPC; (ii) Crime No.27 of 2001 under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1517318/\" id=\"a_14\">436</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_15\">506(ii)</a> of IPC; (iii) Crime No.53 of 2001 under <a href=\"/doc/1198799/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 294(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_17\">506(ii)</a>\nof IPC and (iv) Crime No.99 of 2002 under <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 452</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_19\">427</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_20\">506(ii)</a> of IPC.\nHe further submitted that all the cases were registered on the file of\nM.Reddiapatty Police Station and that he was also involved in law and order\nproblem. As the petitioner, was involved in the abovesaid criminal cases and\nindulged himself in law and order problem there was reason to believe that his\nconduct required vigil and surveillance and therefore, a requisition dated\n04.03.2003 was made by the Sub-Inspector of Police, M.Reddiapatty Police\nStation, Virudhunagar District to the Deputy Superintendent of Police,\nAruppukottai Sub-Division, Virudhunagar District, the second respondent herein,\nto open a History Sheet (Rowdy) for the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\t\t\t10. and considering the request of the Sub-Inspector of\nPolice, M.Reddiapatty Police Station and on perusal of the connected records,\nthe Deputy Superintendent of Police, the second respondent herein, by his order\ndated 07.03.2003, has granted permission to open a History Sheet (Rowdy) for the\npetitioner. He therefore submitted that there is no manifest illegality in\nopening the History sheet for the petitioner. As regards retention of his name,\nby rejecting the petitioner&#x27;s request he submitted that as petitioner had\ninvolved in law and order problem, the same cannot be said to be arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">\t\t\t11.\tIt is to be noted that after registration of the\ncases in the year 2001-2002, no other criminal case has been registered and\ntherefore this court deems it fit to consider as to retention of the petitioner\nin the history sheet as on the date of hearing of this Writ Petition is\nnecessary or not.\n</p>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">\t\t\tHeard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the\nmaterials available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\t\t\t12.\tBefore going into the merits of the case, let me\nextract the relevant provisions contained in Police Standing Orders.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\t\t&quot;PSO 746.

The Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1353505/\" id=\"a_41\">Barium Chemicals Ltd. Vs.

It provides an option to the authority\nconcerned to adopt one or the other alternative.  But a better, proper and legal\nexercise of discretion is one where the authority examines the fact, is aware of\nlaw and then decides objectively and rationally what serves the interest better.\nWhen a statute either provides guidance or rules or regulations are framed for\nexercise of discretion then the action should be in accordance with it. Even\nwhere statutes are silent and only power is conferred to act in one or the other\nmanner, the Authority cannot act whimsically or arbitrarily.  It should be\nguided by reasonableness and fairness. The legislature never intends its\nauthority to abuse the law or use it unfairly. Where the law requires an\nauthority to act or decide, &#x27;if it appears to it necessary&#x27; or if he is &#x27;of\nopinion that a particular act should be done&#x27; then it is implicit that it should\nbe done objectively, fairly and reasonably.  In a democratic set up the people\nor community being sovereign the exercise of discretion must be guided by the\ninherent philosophy that the exerciser of discretion is accountable for his\naction. It is to be tested on anvil of rule of law  and fairness or justice\nparticularly if competing interests of members of society is involved.\nDecisions affecting public interest or the necessity of doing it in the light of\nguidance provided by the Act and rules may not require intimation to person\naffected yet the exercise of discretion is vitiated if the action is bereft of\nrationality, lacks objective and purposive approach.  Public interest or general\ngood or social betterment have no doubt priority over private or individual\ninterest but it must not be a pretext to justify the arbitrary or illegal\nexercise of power.  It must withstand scrutiny of the legislative standard\nprovided by the statute itself.  The authority exercising discretion must not\nappear to be impervious to legislative directions.  The action or decision must\nnot only be reached reasonably and intelligibly but it must be related to the\npurpose for which power is exercised.  No one howsoever high can arrogate to\nhimself or assume without any authorisation express or implied in law a\ndiscretion to ignore the rules and deviate from rationality by adopting a\nstrained or distorted interpretation as it renders the action ultra virus and\nbad in law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\t\t\t22.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166611\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/166611/\" id=\"a_51\">Shiv Sagar Tiwari v.

One of the points that falls for determination is the scope for\njudicial interference in matters of administrative decisions. Administrative\naction is stated to be referable to broad area of governmental activities in\nwhich the repositories of power may exercise every class of statutory function\nof executive, quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial nature. It is trite law that\nexercise of power, whether legislative or administrative, will be set aside, if\nthere is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the\npower is manifestly arbitrary (see <a href=\"/doc/1901448/\" id=\"a_55\">State of U.P. v. Renusagar Power Co.</a>). At one\ntime, the traditional view in England was that the executive was not answerable\nwhere its action was attributable to the exercise of prerogative power.\nProfessor de Smith in his classical work Judicial Review of Administrative\nAction, 4th Edn. at pp.285-87 states the legal position in his own terse\nlanguage that the relevant principles formulated by the courts may be broadly\nsummarised as follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\t\t\tThe authority in which discretion is vested can be compelled\nto exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In\ngeneral, discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is\ncommitted. That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it;\nit must not act under the dictates of another body or disable itself from\nexercising discretion in each individual case. In the purported exercise of its\ndiscretion, it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what\nit has not been authorised to do. It must act in good faith, must have regard to\nall relevant considerations and must not be influenced by irrelevant\nconsiderations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the\nspirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act\narbitrarily or capriciously. These several principles can conveniently be\ngrouped in two main categories: (i) failure to exercise a discretion, and (ii)\nexcess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes are not, however,\nmutually exclusive. Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because\nirrelevant considerations have been taken into account, and where an authority\nhands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires.\n</blockquote>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\t\t\t26.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"777136\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/777136/\" id=\"a_56\">Indian Railway Construction Co.

In the above judgment, the Supreme\nCourt held that in matters relating to administrative functions, if a decision\nis tainted by any vulnerability as such illegality, irrationality and procedural\nimpropriety, Courts should not hesitate to interfere, if the action falls within\nany of the categories stated supra.</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\t\t\t&quot;14. The present trend of judicial opinion is to restrict the\ndoctrine of immunity from judicial review to those class of cases which relate\nto deployment of troops, entering into international treaties etc. The\ndistinctive features of some of these recent cases signify the willingness of\nthe courts to assert their power to scrutinize the factual basis upon which\ndiscretionary powers have been exercised. One can conveniently classify under\nthree heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by\njudicial review. The first ground is &quot;illegality&quot;, the second &quot;irrationality&quot;,\nand the third &quot;procedural impropriety&quot;. These principles were highlighted by\nLord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil\nService (commonly known as CCSU case). If the power has been exercised on a non-\nconsideration or non-application of mind to relevant factors, the exercise of\npower will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative\nor administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and\nwhich are patently erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1462614\" id=\"span_17\">(See\n<a href=\"/doc/1462614/\" id=\"a_57\">CIT v.

There are, however, certain areas\nof governmental activity, national security being the paradigm, which the courts\nregard themselves as incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as\nto whether the Government&#x27;s claim is bona fide. In this kind of non-justiciable\narea judicial review is not entirely excluded, but very limited. It has also\nbeen said that powers conferred by the Royal Prerogative are inherently\nunreviewable but since the speeches of the House of Lords in Council of Civil\nService Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service this is doubtful. Lords\nDiplock, Scarman and Roskill appeared to agree that there is no general\ndistinction between powers, based upon whether their source is statutory or\nprerogative but that judicial review can be limited by the subject-matter of a\nparticular power, in that case national security. Many prerogative powers are in\nfact concerned with sensitive, non-justiciable areas, for example, foreign\naffairs, but some are reviewable in principle, including the prerogatives\nrelating to the civil service where national security is not involved. Another\nnon-justiciable power is the Attorney-General&#x27;s prerogative to decide whether to\ninstitute legal proceedings on behalf of the public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">\t\t\t(Also see Padfield v.

It reads as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t\t\t&quot;It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now\nwhat does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to\nexercise of statutory discretions often use the word &#x27;unreasonable&#x27; in a rather\ncomprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a\ngeneral description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person\nentrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law.\nHe must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He\nmust exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has\nto consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is\nsaid, to be acting &#x27;unreasonably&#x27;. Similarly, there may be something so absurd\nthat no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers of the\nauthority. ... In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters.\nIt is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith;\nand in fact, all these things run into one another.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\t\t\tLord Greene also observed: (KB p.230 : All ER p.683 F-G)\n\t\t\t&quot;... it must be proved to be unreasonable in the sense that\nthe court considers it to be a decision that no reasonable body can come to. It\nis not what the court considers unreasonable. ...

Therefore, to arrive at a decision on &quot;reasonableness&quot; the\ncourt has to find out if the administrator has left out relevant factors or\ntaken into account irrelevant factors. The decision of the administrator must\nhave been within the four corners of the law, and not one which no sensible\nperson could have reasonably arrived at, having regard to the above principles,\nand must have been a bona fide one. The decision could be one of many choices\nopen to the authority but it was for that authority to decide upon the choice\nand not for the court to substitute its view.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\t\t\t27.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1598563\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/1598563/\" id=\"a_58\">Union of India v.

When anything is left to any person, judge or Magistrate\nto be done according to his discretion, the law intends it must be done with\nsound discretion, and according to law. In its ordinary meaning, the word\n&quot;discretion&quot; signifies unrestrained exercise of choice or will; freedom to act\naccording to one&#x27;s own judgment; unrestrained exercise of will; the liberty or\npower of acting without control other than one&#x27;s own judgment. But, when applied\nto public functionaries, it means a power or right conferred upon them by law,\nof acting officially in certain circumstances according to the dictates of their\nown judgment and conscience, uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of\nothers. Discretion is to discern between right and wrong; and therefore, whoever\nhath power to act at discretion, is bound by the rule of reason and law. \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">\t\t\t21. Discretion, in general, is the discernment of what is\nright and proper. It denotes knowledge and prudence, that discernment which\nenables a person to judge critically of what is correct and proper united with\ncaution; nice discernment, and judgment directed by circumspection; deliberate\njudgment; soundness of judgment; a science or understanding to discern between\nfalsity and truth, between wrong and right, between shadow and substance,\nbetween equity and colourable glosses and pretences, and not to do according to\nthe will and private affections of persons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t\t\t22. The word &quot;discretion&quot; standing single and unsupported by\ncircumstances signifies exercise of judgment, skill or wisdom as distinguished\nfrom folly, unthinking or haste;evidently therefore a discretion cannot be\narbitrary but must be a result of judicial thinking.  The word in itself implies\nvigilant circumspection and care; therefore, where the legislature concedes\ndiscretion it also imposes a heavy responsibility. &quot;The discretion of a judge is\nthe law of tyrants; it is always unknown. It is different in different men. It\nis casual, and depends upon constitution, temper and passion. In the best it is\noften times caprice; in the worst it is every vice, folly, and passion to which\nhuman nature is liable,&quot; said Lord Camden, L.C.J., in Hindson and Kersey\nreported in (1680) 8 HOW St Tr 57.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\t\t\t23. If a certain latitude or liberty is accorded by a statute\nor rules to a judge as distinguished from a ministerial or administrative\nofficial, in adjudicating on matters brought before him, it is judicial\ndiscretion. It limits and regulates the exercise of discretion, and prevents it\nfrom being wholly absolute, capricious, or exempt from review.&quot;\t\n</blockquote>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1918433\" id=\"span_19\">28.While testing the validity of Central Electricity Regulatory\nCommission (Procedure, terms and conditions for grant of trading licence and\nother related matters) (Amendment) Regulations, 2006, the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1918433/\" id=\"a_60\">Global Energy Limited and another v.

An English Common\nLaw maxim asserts that &quot;every man&#x27;s house is his castle and in Semayne&#x27;s case,\n(1604) 5 Co Rep 91a : 1 Sm.L.C.(13th Edn.) 104 at p. 105 where this was applied,\nit was stated that &quot;the house of everyone is to him as his castle and fortress\nas well as for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose.&quot; We\nare not unmindful of the fact that Semayne&#x27;s case (1604) 5 Co Rep 91a : 1\nSm.L.C.(13th Edn.) 104 at p. 105 was concerned with the law relating to\nexecutions in England, but the passage extracted has a validity quite apart from\nthe context of the particular decision.  It embodies an abiding principle which\ntranscends mere protection of property rights and expounds a concept of\n&quot;personal liberty&quot; which does not rest on any element of feudalism or on any\ntheory of freedom which has ceased to be of value.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">\t\t\t32. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1369683\" id=\"span_21\">In\t<a href=\"/doc/1369683/\" id=\"a_71\">Dhanji Ram Sharma v.

These powers must be\nexercised with caution and in strict conformity with the rules.  The condition\nprecedent to the opening of history sheet under R 23.9(2) is that the suspect is\na person &quot;reasonably believed to be habitually addicted to crime or to be an\naider or abettor of such person&quot;.  Similarly, the condition precedent to the\nentry of the names of the suspects in Part II of police register No.10 under\nR.23.4(3)(b) is that they are &quot;persons who are reasonably believed to be\nhabitual offenders or receivers of stolen property whether they have been\nconvicted or not&quot;.

Mere belief is not sufficient.\nThe belief must be reasonable, it must be based on reasonable grounds. The\nsuspect may or may not have been convicted of any crime.

But all this does not mean that the police have a licence\nto enter the names of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance register;\nnor can the surveillance be such as to squeeze the fundamental freedoms\nguaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct the free exercise and enjoyment of\nthose freedoms; nor can the surveillance so intrude as to offend the dignity of\nthe individual. Surveillance of persons who do not fall within the categories\nmentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the prevention of crime,\nor excessive surveillance falling beyond the limits prescribed by the rules,\nwill entitle a citizen to the court&#x27;s protection which the court will not\nhesitate to give. The very Rules which prescribe the conditions for making\nentries in the surveillance register and the mode of surveillance appear to\nrecognise the caution and care with which the police officers are required to\nproceed. The note following Rule 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty upon the\npolice officer to construe the rule strictly and confine the entries in the\nsurveillance register to the class of persons mentioned in the rule. Similarly\nRule 23.7 demands that there should be no illegal interference in the guise of\nsurveillance. Surveillance, therefore, has to be unobtrusive and within bounds.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">\t\t\t10. Ordinarily the names of persons with previous criminal\nrecord alone are entered in the surveillance register. They must be proclaimed\noffenders, previous convicts, or person who have already been placed on security\nfor good behaviour. In addition, names of persons who are reasonably believed to\nbe habitual offenders or receivers of stolen property whether they have been\nconvicted or not may be entered. It is only in the case of this category of\npersons that there may be occasion for abuse of the power of the police officer\nto make entries in the surveillance register. But, here, the entry can only be\nmade by the order of the Superintendent of Police who is prohibited from\ndelegating his authority under Rule 23.5. Further it is necessary that the\nSuperintendent of Police must entertain a reasonable belief that persons whose\nnames are to be entered in Part II are habitual offenders or receivers of stolen\nproperty. While it may not be necessary to supply the grounds of belief to the\npersons whose names are entered in the surveillance register it may become\nnecessary in some cases to satisfy the court when an entry is challenged that\nthere are grounds to entertain such reasonable belief. In fact in the present\ncase we sent for the relevant records and we have satisfied ourselves that there\nwere sufficient grounds for the Superintendent of Police to entertain a\nreasonable belief. In the result we reject both the appeals subject to our\nobservations regarding the mode of surveillance. There is no order as to costs.&quot;\n</p>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\t\t\t35.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"890637\" id=\"span_24\">In <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_74\">Vijay Narain Singh v.

That standing order is very clear that there should be\nmaterials to show that a person is known or believed to be addicted to or to aid\nand abet the commission of a crime.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\t\t\t8. The showing of name in History sheet is to keep\nsurveillance on a person. Such surveillance cannot be such as to squeeze the\nfundamental right guaranteed and for the matter, the human right recognised to\nevery citizen. Human rights are basic rights as freedom to which all human\nbeings are entitled. The quality of a nation&#x27;s civilisation can be largely\nmeasured by the methods the police use in the enforcement of law and the police\nshould not use shortcuts and arbitrary methods in their performance of duties. A\nhistory sheet normally refers to a person who has long criminal record.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">\t\t\t9. The High Court exercises control over the Government\nfunctioning and in their obedience of rules and law by enforcing proper, fair\nand just performance of duty. Where the Governmental authority passes an order\nwhich is contrary to the rules or laws, as in this case contrary to the Police\nStanding Orders, it becomes amenable to correction by the Courts in exercise of\nwrit jurisdiction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">\t\t\t10. It is true that the police have the responsibility of\nprotecting law and order, to keep vigil and surveillance not only on the accused\nbut also on  suspected persons in the interest of general public.  But before\nshowing a person as history sheet rowdy, the action of the police must be\nsupported by materials and it cannot be on the whims and fancies of a particular\nofficer. Such action, if allowed, would definitely infringe the right of an\nindividual for his free movement, as the opening of history sheet against a\nperson would certainly result in restriction of his movement due to the\nsurveillance and he will be undermined in the public opinion.  Law enforcement\nagencies, while opening history sheet against a person for surveillance and\nobservance, frequently used to bring those persons shown in history sheet for\nquestioning whenever there were crimes committed in a given region.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1604625\" id=\"span_40\">11.

Police Standing Orders, thus, makes\nit clear that the conduct and activities of history-sheeted persons shall be\nmonitored for a specified period during which period, they should not come to\nany adverse notice and  the authority empowered to extend the period of\nretaining his name in the history sheet, should have reason to believe that such\nhistory- sheeted person is habitually addicted to or aid or abet, the commission\nof offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">\t\t\t50.Keeping surveillance or vigil on a history-sheeted\nperson should not be made permanent, mechanically, as it would affect his\nfreedom of life and liberty.

Objective satisfaction with reference to\nthe conduct of a history-sheeted person, to prevent commission or aiding or\nabetting of offences, by such persons, involving breach of peace or law and\norder.  The subjective satisfaction should be based on valid materials and it\ncannot be at the whims and fancies of the police officers.  Reading of the\nPolice Standing Order shows that the discretion conferred on the police officers\nis in-built, subject to the limitations, including a specific period, provided\nunder the said orders and it is not for any unlimited period, unless the conduct\nof the history-sheeted person is required to be monitored continuously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">\t\t\t51.As the discretionary jurisdiction conferred on the\nPolice Officers to open and retain a history sheet is to curtail his freedom and\nright of privacy, there should be awareness on the part of the authority and it\nshould be on the basis of surveillance materials, where that a reasonable man\nwould by probable reasoning arrive at a conclusion or infer that a person has to\nbe necessarily included in the History sheet. &#x27;Belief&#x27;, in the case on hand,\nmeans a degree of conviction of the truth of something especially based on a\nconsideration or examination of the evidence and the authorities vested with\ndiscretion of opening and retaining history sheets should prove that on the\nexamination of the data that there is awareness on their part indicating their\nstate of mind that by probable reasoning, they come to a conclusion or infer,\nabout the conduct of person, for whom a History sheet is opened or retained.\nThe record of events and the materials should be considered with care and the\nauthority concerned should pass an order, reflecting that he has thought over\nthe matter deliberately with care and it has been found necessary, as a result\nof such careful examination, an order opening or retaining a history sheet is\nrequired to be passed.\t\t\t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">\t\t\t52.

The Sub Divisional Officer or the Superintendent of Police after\nconsideration of the surveillance report should arrive at a reasonable\nconclusion, as to the existence of materials warranting retention of the rowdy\nlist. The discretion conferred on the police authorities under the Police\nStanding Orders is to subserve the object, viz., to control the prevention of\ncrime and protection to others from crime and the surveillance data has to be\ncarefully examined by the Station House Officer or the Competent Person, while\nrecommending opening or retaining a rowdy list.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">\t\t\t61.Thus it could be seen, that an elaborate procedure and\nthe manner in which the surveillance data has to be collected and ascertained,\nare set out in the Police Standing Orders. Intimation of the movements of the\npersons closely watched under PSO 752 is also given to the nearest railway\npolice stations.  Needless to say that when movements of the persons are\nwatched, there is an invasion of right of privacy. This intrusion of privacy is\nauthorised to control, prevention of crime and to protect others from crime and\nif the person against whom the history sheet is opened is free from any taint or\nsuspicion for over a considerable period of time, the Sub Divisional\nOfficers/Superintendent of Police has to exercise his discretion in favour of\nthose branded as rowdy, so as to allow himself to be free in the best interest\nof the society.  The Sub Divisional Officers should not be swayed away by any\nbald statement of his subordinates seeking opening or retention of history\nsheets, unless it is considered necessary or where an automatic opening of\nhistory sheet is necessary, as in the case of conviction for the offences stated\nin the police standing orders.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\t\t\t62.In a situation of this nature, keeping in mind the\nnature of the duties required to be performed by the law enforcing agencies, the\ndiscretion to be exercised by the second respondent should be on sound\nprinciples of fairness, reasonableness and it should be in accordance with the\nobject sought to be achieved while opening or retaining a rowdy history sheet.\n</p>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">\t63.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1918433\" id=\"span_41\">In <a href=\"/doc/1918433/\" id=\"a_117\">Global Energy Limited and another v.

Needless to say that his\nrelationship with others and the prospects of personal development may not\nremain the same.  Characterisation of a person is stigmatic, if any photographs\nis displayed in some conspicuous places in the area where he resides, or in\npublic places, and it affects not only his personal rights, but there is every\nlikelihood of damage being caused to the members of his family and it cannot be\nlost sight of.  Innocent children of such persons could be even looked down, if\nthe officer, mechanically under the guise of prevention of crime and to protect\nothers, open or extend history sheets, which has an impact on the right of\nprivacy of not only the individual against whom the order is passed, but also\ncauses harm to other person&#x27;s rights.  Therefore, a fair and reasonable decision\nshould be taken, taking into consideration the Constitutional rights under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and the interests of the State. It\nshould be noted that at time of opening a history sheet, the individual is not\ninformed of the decision taken by the authorities behind his back and that the\ninformation collected is discreet. Needless to say that every person wants to\nlive with dignity and he cannot be condemned arbitrarily. It is also to be borne\nin mind that estrangement of the members of a history sheeted rowdy, in social\ngatherings, etc., is not uncommon in our society.  Therefore, opening or\nretention of history sheets, which interferes with the right of privacy of a\nperson, should be done strictly adhering to the parameters inbuilt in the Police\nStanding Orders, keeping in mind the object sought to be achieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">\t\t\t68.\tA perusal of the files shows that the petitioner\nwas branded as a rowdy and that a history sheet has been opened on 07.03.2003,\non the request made by the Sub-Inspector of Police, M.Reddiapatty Police\nStation, Virudhunagar District.

Though a duty is cast on the Assistant\nSuperintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police to arrive at the\nsubjective satisfaction, on the basis of the materials, as to whether retention\nof the person in the history sheet beyond the period 31.12.2004 is required or\nnot, for the object sought to be achieved, the Deputy Superintendent of Police,\nAruppukottai, mechanically, without any application of mind, has simply ordered\nthe petitioner to be retained in the history sheet till 31.12.2004. The order\nmade by the Deputy Superintendent of Police dated 28.01.2004 is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">\t\t\t&quot;Retain till 31.12.2004.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">\t\t\t71.\tWhat is disclosed in the files is only periodical\nbald entries made by the Sub inspector of Police, sitting in his police station,\nby asking the petitioner to go over to the police station every month.  There is\nnot only procedural impropriety, but there is also no prima facie material for\nseeking extension, ie., retention of his name in the history sheet. The Sub\nDivisional Officer who is enjoined with the power to consider the request, after\nexamination of all the details has mechanically approved the request, without\nany application of mind.  Perusal of the same, shows that both the officers have\ngrossly failed in their duties and not applied their mind, to the object sought\nto be achieved and there is absolutely nothing to indicate their subjective\nsatisfaction on the basis of the twin tests, &quot;relevance and reason&quot;, which are\nto be satisfied, where discretion is conferred on any authority.\n</p>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">\t\t\t72.\tCharacterisation of the petitioner as a rowdy for\na longer period without any materials and on the basis of the report without\nfollowing the procedure contemplated in the Police Standing Orders and without\nrecording any reason is nothing but reflection of arbitrariness. The extracts\nmade above, makes it abundantly clear that both the authorities have only\nconcluded that the petitioner has to be retained as history sheeted rowdy\nwithout any reason. Such an arbitrary exercise of power is nothing but a breach\nof all the norms and requirements under the Police Standing Order by the above\nsaid officers and the invasion of the privacy of the petitioner sought to be\njustified by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Virudhunagar District, that\nthe petitioner was lateron involved in an offence and that the public out of\nfear are unable to come forward to lodge a complaint against the petitioner and\nthat he used to assault people and abuse them in filthy language is not\nsupported any materials. Without there being any materials in the history sheet,\nrecorded either by the Station House Officer or any one of the officers\ncompetent to make entries, the arbitrary action of both the officers clearly\nexpose their illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety in passing\nindiscriminate orders extending the period which does not satisfy the test of\nreasonableness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">\t\t\t73.\tThe details of the monthly entries made by Sub-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">Inspector of Police, M.Reddiapatty Police Station, Virudhunagar District shows\nthat periodically, the petitioner has been directed to appear before the Sub-\nInspector of Police and without conducting any enquiry or collecting information\nor facts regarding the conduct or criminality of the petitioner and without\nascertaining as to whether the petitioner is reasonably believed to be\nhabitually addicted to crime or to have aided or abetted a crime, the Sub-\nInspector of Police has formed an opinion that the petitioner&#x27;s activities, as\nnot satisfactory.  The entries, show that the Sub-Inspector of Police, sitting\nin his office, has directed the petitioner to appear before him for enquiry.\n</p>\t\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">\t\t\t74.The power to open or retain a history sheet is not\nabsolute or uncontrolled. It has to be exercised only within the defined limits\nand it cannot be done according to private opinion.  The competent authority has\nto examine the materials and then decide objectively and rationally, as to  what\nserves the best interest of the society vis-a-vis an individual&#x27;s rights.  In\nthe case on hand, though a detailed procedure is provided for collection of\nsurveillance evidence or facts, the Sub Inspector of Police,\nM.Reddipathy Police Station, has remained in his police station and has been\nmaking entries, as if he has reason to believe that the conduct of the\npetitioner was not satisfactory right from the date of opening an History Sheet.\nAs stated supra, it is evident from the entries made in the rowdy sheet that the\nSub Inspector of Police has simply made the petitioner to appear every month and\nrecorded a bald and routine statement that the conduct of the petitioner was not\nsatisfactory and that he was under surveillance. Even though the petitioner was\nlastly convicted in a criminal case which according to him, was due to a family\ndispute, there is no incriminating material between 2003 to 2007, that the\npetitioner had come to adverse notice between 2003 to 2007 and no details of any\nalleged occurrence, such as involvement in a crime or aiding or abetting, is\nrecorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">\t\t\t75.The facts of this case do not reflect adherence to\nfairness, reason and exercise of discretion in the manner expected of, as per\nthe principles of law.  It is well-settled that arbitrariness is anthesis of\nlaw, if a statutory authority dealing with matters, relating to right to life\nand liberty, acts arbitrarily without any rhyme or reason, this Court exercising\nwrit jurisdiction, dealing with the most cherished rights of dignity and freedom\nof movement has no hesitation to declare that the action of the statutory\nauthority in continuing the history sheet of the petitioner as illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">\t\t\t76. In the light of the discussions, this Court is of the\nconsidered view that retention of the petitioner in the rowdy history sheet, has\nbeen done mechanically by the second respondent, without proper application of\nmind and in these circumstances, deems it fit to direct the second respondent to\nremove the name of the petitioner from the rowdy history sheet within a period\nof three weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">\t\t\t77.Though the Secretary to the Government, Home Department\nand the Director General of Police, Chennai, are not parties to this Writ, a\ndirection is issued to them to issue appropriate instructions to all concerned\nto review retention of History Sheets, K.D. Sheets, Rowdy Sheets, etc., in all\nthe Police Stations in the State of Tamil Nadu and direct them to remove the\nnames, wherever necessary.  Registry is directed to issue the order copy to the\nSecretary to the Government, Home Department, Chennai and the Director General\nof Police, Chennai, for appropriate action.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">\t\t\t78.
