For the purposes of declaring marriage to be void under\n<a href=\"/doc/368948/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 12</a> of the Act, she contended that the marriage held on\n14.02.2013 since could not be consummated, hence may be declared\nas void. According to the plaintiff-respondent their marriage was\nsolemnized on 14.02.2013 at Hyderabad, in accordance with the\nHindu customs and rituals and subsequently, it was registered before\nthe Registrar of Marriage on the same day. The marriage between the\nparties to the Suit was settled on the basis of the publication and\nsubsequent correspondences made on telephone between the\nfamilies, in which they have projected while negotiation were being\nheld, it revealed the defendant happens to be a person belonging to a\nhigher income group and has a sufficient income from various other\nallied businesses in which he was involved. The marriage was settled\nby way an engagement ceremony held on 13.02.2013 and\nsolemnized on 14.02.2013 at Hyderabad.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.          The ground for seeking dissolution of marriage by the\nplaintiff was that after the marriage held on 14.02.2013, the same\nwas not consummated, as the appellant has shown reluctance in\nentering into any physical relationship with the plaintiff-respondent.\nWhen the same was objected by him, it revealed to her later that he\nwas physically impotent and not in a position to have sexual\nrelationship with the plaintiff-respondent.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    3</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.          On being faced with questions about the incapacity to\nenter into any physical relationship. The husband got outraged and\nbecame angry and misbehaved on 21.04.2013. As the marriage\nbetween the parties has not being consummated, she filed a Suit for\ndeclaring the marriage to be void under <a href=\"/doc/1243269/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11</a> of the Hindu\nMarriage Act. She also claimed maintenance of Rs. 25,000/- per\nmonth out of the total income of the appellant. As projected by wife\nthat he was earning Rs. 90000/- per month she submitted that she\nmay be granted a one time permanent alimony to the tune of Rs.\n20.00 lacs so that she may be able to maintain herself in life.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.          The appellant appeared and filed his written statement. In\nhis written statement, he made efforts to deny the allegations about\nimpotency and his incapacity to enter into physical relationship. It\nwas rather contended that it was the plaintiff-respondent who has\nexpressed her unwillingness to have physical relationship. It was not\ndue to any impotency. He further denied that at no point of time, the\nplaintiff-respondent expressed her anguish due to purported story of\nthe impotency of the appellant nor he contended that any such type\nof complaint was raised by the plaintiff-respondent. To support his\ncontention, he stated that rather the wife was not willing to have in\nphysical relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.          In para 18 and 19 of the written statement, he has\nvaguely denied the contents of para 18 and 19 of the plaint pertaining\nto grounds narrated therein for the purposes of invoking <a href=\"/doc/95286/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 25</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1449825/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 24</a> for grant of pendent elite maintenance. In the written\nstatement the fact that has come on record by pleading was that there\nwas no cohabitation, and that the marriage has taken place under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         4</span>\n\n\n\n\nundue pressure of the parents of the plaintiff, as they wanted her to\nmarry with some other boy of her choice, for which the parents of the\nplaintiff were not willing.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">8.          In para 31 of the written statement, a very vague reply\nwas extended with regards to impotency, saying that he was not\nincapacitated from indulging into sex due to impotency and to\ncontrovert false allegations leveled against him by the plaintiff, in the\nsaid paragraph. The defendant referred to the medical tests done by\nthe medical experts at Bangalore and he was found as to be potent,\nand capable to have sexual relation with female. Para 31 of the\nwritten statement is quoted herein below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            &quot;31. The defendant is not impotent. He is fully potent and has\n            fully capacity to indulge in sex. To controvert such false\n            allegations levelled against him by the plaintiff, the defendant\n            went under medical tests done by the Medical Experts at\n            Bangalore and was found potent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">9.          On the exchange of the pleadings, the learned trial court\nframed the following issues on 09.10.2014:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            1-    D;k foi{kh us ;kph ls fookg ds fy, Ny ls lgefr yh gS vkSj foi{kh\n                  fookg ds le; laHkksx djus esa vl{ke Fkk rFkk i{kdkjksa dk fookg iw.kZ\n                  ugha gks ik;k\\\n            2-    D;k ;kph dk fookg fnukad 14-02-2013 &quot;kwU; ,oa &quot;kwU;dj.kh; ?kksf&#x27;kr gksus\n                  ;ksX; gS\\\n            3-    D;k ;kph foi{kh ls thou fuokZg ikus dh vf/kdkfj.kh gS] ;fn gkWa rks fdl\n                  nj ls fodYi esa D;k ;kph ,d eq&quot;r thou fuokZg izkIr djus dh\n                  vf/kdkfj.kh gS] ;fn gkaw rks fdruh\\\n            4-    D;k ;kph okni= dh lwph esa of.kZr lkeku ;k mlds led{k /kujkf&quot;k\n                  ikus dh vf/kdkfj.kh gS] ;fn gkaw rks fdruh\\\n            5-    D;k ;kph okafNr vuqrks&#x27;k izkIr djus dh vf/kdkjh gS\\\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">10.         The prime issue which is for consideration before this\nCourt is the issue no. 1 with regards to impotency as to &quot;whether at\nthe time of marriage, he was competent to enter into sexual\nrelationship? Whether on the basis of finding on issue no. 1, the\nmarriage dated 14.02.2013 deserves to be declared as void?\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                    5</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.         The appeal in question is primarily confined to the\ncompetence of the appellant to enter into sexual relationship and with\nregards to the impact of the medical certificate, submitted by the\nappellant in the proceedings before the court below pertained to\nperiod prior in time to the litigation. To support the contention, the\nplaintiff-respondent appeared in the witness box as PW1 and\nexamined herself and the defendant-appellant appeared as DW-1.\nThe appellant, to support his version, and to establish that he is not\nsuffering from impotency has placed on the record, the list of\ndocuments by way of paper no. 32 Ga, wherein 7 reports have been\nfiled.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12.         What is relevant to be seen is that when the case has\nproceeded before the court below to settle the issue no. 1, pertaining\nto the impotency and the competence of the appellant to have sexual\nintercourse, the plaintiff filed an application on 13.12.2013, praying\nbefore the court below to ask the defendant to undergo the potency\ntest in Doon Hospital, Dehradun. This application was opposed by\nthe appellant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">13.         When on three consecutive dates the appellant had not\npresented himself before Doon Hospital, the Court rightly observed\nand came to a conclusion that the appellant was not interested in\ngetting the potency test conducted and the said issue was directed to\nbe decided at the time of final hearing.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">14.         The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in its judgment rendered in\nAIR 2002 SC 2582, &quot;Praveen Mehta v. Inderjit Mehta&quot; although\ndeals with a situation where a wife refuses to cooperate with her\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       6</span>\n\n\n\n\nhusband in sexual intercourse and also refuses to get herself\nmedically examined or undergo medical treatment and that she has\nabused and misbehaved with the husband and friends and other\nrelatives, thereby depriving of the husband to normal cohabitation,\nthis will amount to be mental cruelty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">15.         In the instant case, it is the husband, who despite of the\ncourt&#x27;s order avoid to undergo the medical test, this avoidance to\nundergo the medical test will amount to the refusal for medical test.\nSuch a refusal will amount to be a mental cruelty. In the said\njudgment while dealing with the concept of mental cruelty it has\nbeen held that it is a state of mind and feeling, thus the cruelty for the\npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/932494/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 13(1)</a>(i-a) is to be taken as a behaviour towards\nthe spouse and one another. In the same judgment, Hon&#x27;ble Apex\nCourt has held that a wife of non cooperative attitude to have sex and\nrefusing for a medical treatment, abusing and misbehaving with the\nhusband even with his friends would be a mental cruelty. Para 19, 20\nand 21 of the said judgment are reproduced herein below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            &quot;19. Clause (ia) of sub-Section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 13</a> of the Act is\n            comprehensive enough to include cases of physical as also mental\n            cruelty. It was formerly thought that actual physical harm or\n            reasonable apprehension of it was the prime ingredient of this\n            matrimonial offence. That doctrine is now repudiated and the\n            modern view has been that mental cruelty can cause even more\n            grievous injury and create in the mind of the injured spouse\n            reasonable apprehension that if will be harmful or unsafe to live\n            with the other party. The principle that cruelty may be inferred\n            from the whole facts and matrimonial relations of the parties and\n            interaction in their daily life disclosed by the evidence is of\n            greater cogency in cases falling under the head of mental cruelty.\n            Thus mental cruelty has to be established from the facts (Mulla\n            Hindu Law, 17th Edition, Volume II, page 91 ).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            20. In the case in hand the foundation of the case of &#x27;cruelty&#x27; as a\n            matrimonial offence is based on the allegations made by the\n            husband that right from the day one after marriage the wife was\n            not prepared to cooperate with him in having sexual intercourse\n            on account of which the marriage could not be consummated.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"198827109\" id=\"span_8\">When the husband offered to have the wife treated medically she\n            refused. As the condition of her health deteriorated she became\n            irritating and unreasonable in her behavior towards the husband.\n            She misbehaved with his friends and relations. She even abused\n            him, scolded him and caught hold of his shirt collar in presence of\n            elderly persons like Shri S.K. Jain. This Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/198827109/\" id=\"a_13\">Dr.\n            N.G. Dastane v. Mrs. S. Dastane</a> (supra), observed : &quot;Sex plays an\n            important role in marital life and cannot be separated from other\n            factors which lend to matrimony a sense of fruition and\n            fulfillment&quot;.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">            21. Cruelty for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/72812721/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 13(1)(ia)</a> is to be taken as a\n            behavior by one spouse towards the other which causes\n            reasonable apprehension in the mind of the latter that it is not safe\n            for him or her to continue the matrimonial relationship with the\n            other. Mental cruelty is a state of mind and feeling with one of the\n            spouses due to the behavior or behavioral pattern by the other.\n            Unlike the case of physical cruelty the mental cruelty is difficult\n            to establish by direct evidence. It is necessarily a matter of\n            inference to be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the\n            case. A feeling of anguish, disappointment and frustration in one\n            spouse caused by the conduct of the other can only be appreciated\n            on assessing the attending facts and circumstances in which the\n            two partners of matrimonial life have been living. The inference\n            has to be drawn from the attending facts and circumstances taken\n            cumulatively. In case of mental cruelty it will not be a correct\n            approach to take an instance of misbehavior in isolation and then\n            pose the question whether such behavior is sufficient by itself to\n            cause mental cruelty. The approach should be to take the\n            cumulative effect of the facts and circumstances emerging from\n            the evidence on record and then draw a fair inference whether the\n            petitioner in the divorce petition has been subjected to mental\n            cruelty due to conduct of the other.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">16.         In another judgment rendered by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\nreported in AIR 2007 SC 1426 &quot;Mayadevi v. Jagdish Prasad&quot; it has\nbeen provided that to prove a cruelty, may be physical or mental in\nproceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 13</a>, is not to be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt. The concept of proof beyond the reasonable doubt\nis applicable only in criminal matters and not in civil mattes and\nparticularly in the matters in which delicate personal relationship as\nthose of husband and wife is involved. Denying of the evidence on\nrecord, it is the Court&#x27;s duty to come to the conclusion about the\nprobabilities in a case as to whether mental or physical cruelty has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         8</span>\n\n\n\n\nbeen established or not? Such a cruelty has an effect on the mind of\nthe concerned spouse because in an act on omission or commission\nof the either party and thus the cruelty may be physical or corporeal\nor may be mental. In the cases of mental cruelty like that with\nallegation of impotency, there cannot be a tangible or direct evidence\nand in such cases courts are required to probe into the mental process\nand mental effect of incidents which are brought in evidence. Para 9\nof the said judgment is reproduced herein below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            &quot;9.     The expression &quot;cruelty&quot; has not been defined in the Act.\n            Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is a ground for\n            dissolution of marriage may be defined as willful and unjustifiable\n            conduct of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health,\n            bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such\n            a danger. The question of mental cruelty has to be considered in the\n            light of the norms of material ties of the particular society to which the\n            parties belong, their social values, status, environment in which they\n            live. Cruelty, as noted above, includes mental cruelty, which falls\n            within the purview of a matrimonial wrong. Cruelty need not be\n            physical. If from the conduct of his spouse same is established and /or\n            an inference can be legitimately drawn that the treatment of the spouse\n            is such that it causes as apprehension in the mind of the other spouse,\n            about his or her mental welfare then this conduct amounts to cruelty. In\n            delicate human relationship like matrimony, one has to see the\n            probabilities of the case. The concept, a proof beyond the shadow of\n            doubt, is to be applied to criminal trials and not to civil mattes and\n            certainly not to mattes of such delicate personal relationship as those of\n            husband and wife. Therefore, one has to see what are the probabilities\n            in a case and legal cruelty has to be found out, not merely as a matter of\n            fact, but as the effect on the mind of the complainant spouse because of\n            the acts or omissions of the other. Cruelty may be physical or corporeal\n            or may be mental. In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and direct\n            evidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there may not at the same\n            time be direct evidence. In cases where there is no direct evidence,\n            Courts are required to probe into the mental process and mental effect\n            of incidents that are brought out in evidence.

The Court has also gone into the question of what\n            would be the reasonable excuse for non-consummation. In the present\n            case, it was sought to be contended that the medical condition of the\n            husband, namely, hernia, was a possible causative factor for the non-\n            consummation. Unfortunately, the doctors did not support this view in\n            their evidence and Shri Manudhane is right in relying on this decision\n            which conclusively states that in such cases of non-consummation\n            where there is no reasonable ground set out that an adverse inference\n            must follow.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"336665\" id=\"span_13\">Shri Manudhane has thereafter drawn our attention to two\n            decisions, the first of them being in the case of <a href=\"/doc/336665/\" id=\"a_20\">Mary Kurian vs. T.T.\n            Joseph</a>, AIR 1980 Ker.</span> 131; and the second being in the case of J.\n            Anthony vs. M.S.

In the cases of marriage, physical relationship or mental\nrelationship is a condition which is persistent and regular to make the\nconsummation of marriage essential.

The learned Judge has put his finger on the correct aspect and\n            object of mental cruelty. The fact that this case did not arise out of the\n            proceedings under Section 125 makes no difference because we have\n            already observed that the concept of cruelty remains the same whether\n            it is a civil case or a criminal case or a case under any other similar Act.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                         11</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">            The general principles governing acts constituting cruelty-legal or\n            mental-ill-treatment or indifference cannot vary from case to case\n            though the facts may be different.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">            34.

We hold that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the\n            court that a husband is impotent and is unable to discharge his marital\n            obligations, this would amount to both legal and mental cruelty which\n            would undoubtedly be a just ground as contemplated by the aforesaid\n            proviso for the wife&#x27;s refusal to live with her husband and the wife\n            would be entitled to maintenance from her husband according to his\n            means. In these circumstances, therefore, it would be pusillanimous to\n            ignore such a valuable safeguard which has been provided by the\n            legislature to a neglected wife.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">23.         The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the aforesaid judgment has\nalso dealt with the aspect as to what would constitute to be the just\nground for refusal by the wife to live with her husband. His lordship\nhas held that the interpretation of just ground may not be accedes but\nmay be illustrated and self-explanatory, depending upon the\ncircumstances of each case which imbibes within its physical, mental\nand legal cruelty. Thus, incompetence do not exclude the impotency\nof the husband when he is unable to do an act and it was treated to be\nthe just ground on which the wife can refuse to live with her husband\nas contemplated by the points pervade.

The learned Judge seems to have been under the impression that\n            so far as the provisions of Section 488 of the Code of 1898 were\n            concerned they had no bearing on conjugal relations between the\n            husband and the wife. With great respect to the learned Judge we are\n            unable to agree with this process of reasoning. In fact, the fundamental\n            basis of the ground of maintenance under Section 488 is conjugal\n            relationship and once conjugal relationship is divorced from the ambit\n            of this special provision, then the very purpose and setting of the\n            statutory provision vanishes.

A clear perusal of this provision manifestly shows that it was\n            meant to give a clear instance of circumstances which may be treated as\n            a just ground for refusal of the wife to live with her husband. As\n            already indicated, by virtue of this provision, the proviso takes within\n            its sweep all other circumstances similar to the contingencies\n            contemplated in the Amending provision as also other instances of\n            physical, mental or legal cruelty not excluding the impotence of the\n            husband. These, circumstances, therefore, clearly show that the grounds\n            on which the wife refuses to live with her husband should be just and\n            reasonable as contemplated by the proviso. Similarly, where the wife\n            has a reasonable apprehension arising from the conduct of the husband\n            that she is likely to be physically harmed due to persistent demands of\n            dowry from her husband&#x27;s parents or relations, such an apprehension\n            also would be manifestly a reasonable justification for the wife&#x27;s refusal\n            to live with her husband. Instances of this nature may be multiplied but\n            we have mentioned some of the circumstances to show the real scope\n            and ambit of the proviso and the Amending provision which is, as\n            already indicated, by no means exhaustive.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">24.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"179963\" id=\"span_18\">In a judgment rendered by Hon&#x27;ble Rajasthan High\nCourt at Jaipur in the case of <a href=\"/doc/179963/\" id=\"a_28\">Renuka vs. Rajendra Hada</a> in its\npara 12 and 13 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;12.

Collecting DNA from suspects\n\n              DNA evidence should not be collected from a suspect unless the\n              information is relevant to a specific crime in question. For\n              example, it would be appropriate to obtain a DNA sample from a\n              suspect where DNA evidence is left at the scene of the crime and\n              the suspect&#x27;s DNA is needed to prove the suspect&#x27;s involvement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">              DNA evidence should not be collected from suspects as a matter\n              of routine.

Thus, it would not be appropriate for\n           Parliament to give blanket authority to collect DNA samples from\n           all persons suspected of indictable offences. DNA should also not\n           be collected from a suspect of investigators have no DNA\n           evidence with which to compare the suspect&#x27;s sample.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           Nor would a DNA sample from the suspect be necessary if the\n           suspect admitted guilt.

As a further privacy safeguard, DNA evidence\n           should be collected from a suspect only if a judge authorizes the\n           collection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           In our 1992 report, Genetic Testing and Privacy, we discussed\n           limiting the collection of DNA samples to cases involving\n           criminal violence. The types of violence crimes for which DNA\n           samples might be collected should be set out in legislation. The\n           list of violent crimes set out in New Zealand&#x27;s recently introduced\n           Criminal Investigations (Blood Samples) Bill offers an example\n           of the types of crimes for which DNA testing might be considered\n           in Canada. It may also be appropriate to allow the collection of\n           samples for other crimes, such as conspiracies to commit offences\n           involving violence. For example, it should be lawful for samples\n           to be taken if DNA evidence could help convict someone\n           suspected of planning a terrorist act or murder (perhaps the\n           suspect had left DNA on a stamp he licked and attached to a letter\n           implicated in the crime).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">27.

Essentially the whole controversy revolves round the question of\n      impotency of the Petitioner. Now the question for consideration is as to\n      whether at the behest of Respondent, Petitioner could be ordered to be\n      subjected to medical examination by the Medical Board. The answer in\n      the peculiar facts of the case has to be in affirmative otherwise it shall be\n      difficult for the Respondent (Plaintiff) to prove the impotency of the\n      Petitioner (Defendant). The question of invasion to privacy is\n      permissible. The answer is available in para 80 of the judgment rendered\n      by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in MANU/SC/0260/2003 : AIR 2003 SC\n      3450.

In all such\n      matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on the ground of\n      impotency, schizophrenia etc. normally without there being medical\n      examination, it would be difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether\n      the allegation made by his spouse against the other spouse seeking\n      divorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In order to substantiate such\n      allegation, the Petitioner would always insist on medical examination. If\n      Respondent avoids such medical examination on the ground that it\n      violates his/her right to privacy or for a matter right to personal liberty as\n      enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, then it may in\n      most of such cases become impossible to arrive at a conclusion. It may\n      render the very grounds on which divorce is permissible nugatory.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">      Therefore, when there is no right to privacy specifically conferred by\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and with the extensive\n      interpretation, of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read\n      into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as absolute right. What is emphasized\n      is that some limitations on this right have to be imposed and particularly\n      where two competing interests clash. In matters of aforesaid nature\n      where the legislature has conferred a right upon his spouse to seek\n      divorce on such grounds. It would be the right of that spouse which\n      comes in conflict with the so-called right to privacy of the Respondent.\n      Thus the Court has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing\n      the interests involved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">      7.     Now again question is as to whether in case of default on the part\n      of Petitioner in subjecting himself to the medical examination, adverse\n      inference can be drawn. Same is answered by para 83 of the said\n      judgment which reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      83.    If despite an order passed by the Court, a person refuses to submit\n      himself to such medical examination, a strong case for drawing an\n      adverse inference would be made out. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_39\">S. 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act\n      also enables a Court to draw an adverse inference if the party does not\n      produce the relevant evidences in his power and possession.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">28.          The case was taken on 17.04.2014 before the court below\nwhereby the appellant has tried to place the records of certain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                    16</span>\n\n\n\n\ndocuments by which he contends to show that he was not suffering\nfrom any such problem of impotency. To support his version, he\nplaced the records and the documents by a list dated 05.02.2014 i.e. a\nConsultant Radiologist report dated 01.06.2013 pertaining to &quot;Penile\nDoppler Study&quot;. The second test which was conducted on\n01.06.2013 was &quot;Scrotal Doppler Study&quot;. Then third test dated\n28.05.2013     &quot;Biochemistry&quot;     test   and    on   the   same     day\n&quot;Endocrinology&quot;, test as well as the test of clinical pathology.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">29.          What is relevant at this juncture, is that the court below,\nfor the first time, called upon the appellant after framing the issues,\nto undergo the potency test on 20.03.2014. The appellant had not\nparticipated with the potency test. Subsequently, when the\ndocuments were filed by the appellant on 05.02.2014 contains all the\nreports which were prior to 24.02.2014 i.e. first date fixed by the\ncourt for the potency test. Although, these reports, which were prior\nin time, were filed later. A direction was issued to the appellant by\nthe court to undergo the potency tests. Besides this, the said reports\nwere not proved by the appellant by producing doctor in the witness\nbox. All this shows that he was not a patient of impotency. Rather to\nthe contrary, after 19.03.2014, the appellant had filed an application\non 08.07.2013 under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_40\">Right to Information Act</a> before the\nInformation Officer of the Doon Hospital, Dehradun, who has\nresponded back by giving the information on 23.07.2013, showing\nthat the tests on impotency is not available in Doon Hospital hence\nthe test by Doon Hospital cannot be conducted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">30.          It is not the case of the appellant in compliance of the\norder of the court below, he has presented himself for undergoing the\ntest in Doon Hospital. It was rather subsequent to the finding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                   17</span>\n\n\n\n\nrecorded on 19.03.2014, to the effect that despite of willingness\nextended on 05.02.2014, to undergo the impotency test, since the\nappellant is not interested, it would not be a case where the\nimpotency test could not be conducted. Because of the fact that there\nwas no facilities available in the Doon Hospital, because the\nappellant himself has not complied with any order and never\npresented himself for the impotency test before Doon Hospital.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">31.         Another argument which was raised by the counsel for\nthe appellant was that since the appellant is privately engaged, there\nis a dearth of time for him to appear for the test as directed by the\ncourt below, before the competent medical authority. The reason of\nshortage of time is not acceptable. More particularly, when the\nearlier conduct shows that he had participated in the medical tests,\nthere was no reason why he cannot appear before the medical\nauthority to undergo the test of potency in compliance of court&#x27;s\norder.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">32.         The controversy has to be looked into from another\nangle. The appellant has tried to place reliance on the report prior in\ntime, and it was never pleaded by the appellant as to why and under\nwhat circumstances the tests were conducted by him earlier and why\nthe reports of pathology was not placed on the record earlier when\nthey were obtained prior in time? Even according to the findings and\nthe statements recorded by the court below, as a matter of fact, there\nhad been no sexual intercourse and it was only an oral sexual\nrelationship established between them and thus the finding recorded\non issue no. 1 by the court below after considering the recorded\nstatement that the appellant was not competent to enter into sexual\nrelationship.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                   18</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">33.         This also further stands fortified because of the\nunwillingness of the appellant to undergo the tests on the basis of the\ndirection issued by the court below, which was necessary to settle the\nissue no. 1 has placed reliance on the medical tests held prior in time.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">These documents, apart from the fact being prior in time, were not\nproved by producing the doctor, who has issued certificate by\nproducing him in the witness box. Hence, on this ground, the learned\nfamily court has rightly decreed the Suit under <a href=\"/doc/1243269/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/368948/\" id=\"a_42\">12</a> of\nthe Act, held the marriage to be void as husband to prove that he was\npotent and capable to enter into sexual relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">34.         For the purposes of considering issue nos. 3 and 4\npertaining to grant of alimony and for settlement of articles, the court\nhas held apart from the fact that the appellant is earning Rs. 50,171/-\nper month which is based upon the statement of the wife in her\nexamination-in-chief. Besides the above source, there are various\nother sources from which the appellant has having income. He is\nhighly qualified and employed and looking to the fact that the\nmarriage was organized at the Hotel Taj, Hyderabad, the court below\nrightly awarded the permanent alimony of Rs. 10,00,000/- to the\nrespondent, accepting the financial status of the husband.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">35.         Since issue no. 4 has been decided against the plaintiff-\nrespondent and no appeal has been preferred by her, there is no\nnecessity to deal with the findings on the issue.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">36.         On account of the fact that the evidences which\nestablishes that the appellant was suffering from impotency and that\nthe conduct of the appellant shows that he made no efforts to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                 19</span>\n\n\n\n\nestablish that he was potent, the judgment and decree passed by the\ncourt below dated 09.10.2014 calls for no interference by this Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 19(1)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act. Hence the appeal\nfails and is dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">(Sharad Kumar Sharma, J.)
