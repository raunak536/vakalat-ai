The case of petitioner is that the State of Madhya\n\nPradesh has amended sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 73</a> of the\n\nIndian Stamp Act (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;), as\n\napplicable in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The aforesaid\n\nprovision    empowers        the     Collector   or    any     person\n\nauthorised in writing by the Collector to enter upon any\n\npremises and to inspect for such purpose the registers,\n\nbooks, records, papers, documents and proceedings and\n\nto take such notes and extracts as he may deem\n\nnecessary, without fee or charge and if necessary to seize\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 [5]</span>\n\n\nthem     and        impound   the      same    under   proper\n\nacknowledgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.     The challenge has been made by the petitioner\n\nbecause of issuance of notice Annexure P-1 dated\n\n02.12.2011 by the Collector of Stamps and District\n\nRegistrar, by which the District Registrar, Seoni, Shri\n\nBalkrishn More had directed to inspect the petitioner Bank\n\nunder the chairmanship by an inspecting team. The\n\ninspecting team was constituted of Shri Maksood Khan,\n\nAssistant Grade-2 and Shri G.L. Deshbhratar, Registration\n\nClerk. As many as 10 Banks of Seoni namely (1) Central\n\nBank, Branch Seoni; (2) State Bank of India, Branch\n\nKachahri Chowk, Seoni; (3) Canara Bank, Branch Seoni;\n\n(4) Punjab National Bank, Branch Seoni; (5) Life Insurance\n\nCorporation of India, Seoni; (6) I.C.I.C.I.

Bank, Seoni; (8) AXIS Bank, Seoni; (9) Bank of\n\nIndia, Branch Seoni; and (10) Bank of Maharashtra, Branch\n\nSeoni, as scheduled in the letter were directed to be\n\ninspected. This letter was issued mainly on the ground\n\nthat   the    Inspector General       of Registration, Madhya\n\nPradesh, Bhopal had intimated to the District Registrar\n\nthat certain Banks though have got executed documents\n\nnamely       sale   agreement     letter,   development   and\n\nconstruction agreement but had not paid the stamp duty,\n\nas was required under Schedule 1-&#x27;A&#x27;, Clause &quot;5&quot; of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Stamp Act</a>.

Registration, Madhya\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               [6]</span>\n\n\nPradesh had directed the District Registrar to inspect the\n\nBanks and all the loan cases between 01.01.2010 to\n\nNovember, 2011 were directed to be inspected and the\n\ndocuments which could be found insufficiently stamped,\n\ntheir copies be obtained from the Bank and case be\n\nregistered between 20.12.2011 and 25.12.2011 and\n\ninformation be sent to the I.G. before 26.12.2011.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">5.    The letter was issued by the District Registrar\n\ninvoking powers under <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 73</a> of the Act as amended\n\nin the State of Madhya Pradesh. This letter was protested\n\nby the petitioner by filing a written objection dated\n\n09.12.2011, Annexure P-2, but it appears that the\n\nobjection was not sustained, hence the present petition\n\nhas been filed for the aforesaid reliefs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">6.    The aforesaid notice and the provisions as contained\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 73(1)</a> of the Act have been challenged on the\n\nground that;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">(a)   <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_18\">The Indian Stamp Act</a>, as applicable in the State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh is a fiscal statute.

The Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_36\">Canara Bank</a> (supra)\n\nconsidered the factual position, thus: &quot;7. There were 25\n\nwrit petitions filed in the High Court.       Out of these, 11\n\nwere by different banks. A few writ petitions were filed by\n\ninstitutions, corporate or incorporate bodies and a few\n\nwere filed by sugar companies.            The grievances arose\n\nbecause the documents executed between private parties\n\nand received and retained in the custody of the bank in\n\nordinary course of their loan advancing transactions were\n\ninspected and then the banks were served with a request\n\nto remit the amount of deficit duty on the documents\n\ninspected and to recover the same from the parties\n\nconcerned. The grievance of the sugar companies is that\n\nin the course of their business they were entering into\n\nagreements with the sugarcane growers selling sugarcane\n\nto the sugar companies in compliance with the provisions\n\nof A.P. Sugarcane Control Order, 1965 in the proforma\n\nprescribed by Control Order. Several agreements entered\n\ninto   in   the   prescribed   proforma      were   treated   as\n\nunstamped (though they were not liable to be stamped, in\n\nthe submission of sugar companies) and therefore were\n\nsought to be impounded.               The grievance of private\n\npersons is that the documents in their possession are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 [11]</span>\n\n\nsought to be inspected, impounded and levied with duty\n\nthough they were not tendered in evidence nor produced\n\nbefore any public office&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">11. The Apex Court in para 8 of the judgment considered\n\nthe judgment of the High Court in which the High Court\n\nhad held thus: &quot;in holding the impugned <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 73</a> of the\n\nAct ultra vires the Constitution and other provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_38\">Indian Stamp Act</a>, the High Court has arrived at four\n\nfindings:   firstly,   that   the      amended   <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_39\">Section   73</a>   is\n\ninconsistent with the other provisions of the Act; secondly,\n\nthat the provision is violative of the principles of natural\n\njustice; thirdly, the provision is arbitrary and unreasonable\n\nand hence violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution; and\n\nfourthly, there are no guidelines provided for the exercise\n\nof power by the authorized persons under the amended\n\n<a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 73</a> which is either arbitrary and unreasonable or\n\nvitiated on account of excessive delegation of statutory\n\npowers&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">12. So far as the power to impound a document and to\n\nrecover the duty with or without penalty thereon has been\n\ndirected to be construed strictly and can be sustained only\n\nwhen falling within the four corners and letter of the law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">13. The Apex Court in para 15 considered the position\n\nwith reference to <a href=\"/doc/117475092/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 62</a> of the Act holding that\n\n&quot;though an instrument not duly stamped may attract\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                [12]</span>\n\n\ncriminal prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/117475092/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 62</a> of the Act but\n\nParliament and the Legislature have both treated it to be a\n\nminor   offence   punishable     with       fine   only   and   not\n\ncognizable. That such an offence is liable to be condoned\n\nby payment of duty and penalty on the document and no\n\nprosecution can be launched except in the case of a\n\ncriminal intention to evade the Stamp Law or in case of a\n\nfraud and that too after giving the person liable to be\n\nproceeded against, an opportunity of being heard&quot;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">14. The Apex Court in para 16 of the judgment examined\n\nthe scope of Section 73 of the A.P. Act No.17 of 1986 thus:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;A bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 73</a> as substituted by A.P. Act\n\nNo.17 of 1986 indicates the infirmities with which the\n\nprovision suffers. The provision empowers any person\n\nauthorized in writing by the Collector to have access to\n\ndocuments in private custody or custody of a public officer\n\nwithout regard to the fact whether the documents are\n\nsought to be used before any authority competent to\n\nreceive evidence and without regard to the fact whether\n\nsuch document would ever be voluntarily produced or\n\nbrought before a public officer during the performance of\n\nany of his specified functions in his capacity as such. The\n\npower is capable of being exercised by such persons at all\n\nreasonable   times   and   it    is   not    preceded     by    any\n\nrequirement of the      reasons being recorded by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                    [13]</span>\n\n\nCollector     or    the   person      authorized       for   his   belief\n\nnecessitating search.          The person authorized has been\n\nvested with authority to impound the document. It is only\n\nin case of documents in custody of any bank that an\n\nexception has been carved out for giving a 30 days\n\nprevious notice to the bank to make good the deficit stamp\n\nduty before seizing and impounding the document.                     Not\n\nonly is there no valid reason -- none pointed out either in\n\nthe pleadings nor at the hearing -- for drawing the\n\ndistinction between a bank and other public office or any\n\nperson having custody of document. Even in the case of a\n\nbank,   the    power      to   adjudicate      upon    the    need    for\n\nimpounding the document has been vested in the person\n\nauthorized.         The provision does not lay down any\n\nguidelines    for    determining      the     person    who    can    be\n\nauthorized by the Collector to exercise the powers\n\nconferred by <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 73</a>&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">15.   The Apex Court considered the right of privacy and\n\npower of the State to &#x27;search and seizure&#x27; in para 18 and\n\nheld thus: &quot;The right to privacy and the power of the State\n\nto &#x27;search and seize&#x27; have been the subject of debate in\n\nalmost every democratic country where fundamental\n\nfreedoms are guaranteed.                  History takes us back to\n\nSemayne&#x27;s case decided in 1603 where it was laid down\n\nthat &#x27;Every man&#x27;s house is his castle&#x27;.            One of the most\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                              [14]</span>\n\n\nforceful expressions of the above maxim was that of\n\nWilliam Pitt in the British Parliament in 1763.       He said:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the\n\nforce of the Crown. It may be frail - its roof may shake -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">the wind may blow through it - the storm may enter, the\n\nrain may enter - but the King of England cannot enter -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">all his force dare not cross the threshold of the ruined\n\ntenement&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">16. The intrusion into privacy has been explained by the\n\nApex Court in para 34, thus: &quot;Intrusion into privacy may be\n\nby - (1) legislative provisions, (2) administrative/executive\n\norders and (3) judicial orders.     The legislative intrusions\n\nmust be tested on the touchstone of reasonableness as\n\nguaranteed by the Constitution and for that purpose the\n\nCourt can go into the proportionality of the intrusion vis-a`-\n\nvis the purpose sought to be achieved.        (2)    So far as\n\nadministrative or   executive action is concerned, it has\n\nagain to be reasonable having regard to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case. (3) As to Judicial warrants, the\n\nCourt must have sufficient reason to believe that the\n\nsearch or seizure is warranted and it must keep in mind\n\nthe   extent   of search or seizure      necessary    for the\n\nprotection of the particular state interest. In addition, as\n\nstated earlier, common law recognized rare exceptions\n\nsuch as where warrantless searches could be conducted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                               [15]</span>\n\n\nbut these must be in good faith, intended to preserve\n\nevidence or intended to prevent sudden danger to person\n\nor property&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_15\">17. The Apex Court in para 35 further held thus: &quot;The\n\nearliest case in India to deal with &#x27;privacy&#x27; and &#x27;search and\n\nseizure&#x27; was <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_46\">M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra</a> in the context\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_47\">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_48\">Art. 20(3)</a> of the Constitution.        The\n\ncontention that search and seizure violated <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_49\">Art. 19(1)(f)</a>\n\nwas rejected, the Court holding that a mere search by\n\nitself did not affect any right to property, and though\n\nseizure affected it, such effect was only temporary and\n\nwas a reasonable restriction on the right.        The question\n\nwhether search warrants for the seizure of documents\n\nfrom the accused were unconstitutional was not gone into.\n\nThe Court, after referring to the American authorities,\n\nobserved that in the US, because of the language in the\n\nFourth Amendment, there was a distinction between legal\n\nand illegal searches and seizures and that such a\n\ndistinction need not be imported into our Constitution. The\n\nCourt opined that a search warrant was addressed to an\n\nofficer and not to the accused and did not violate <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_50\">Art.\n\n20(3).</a> In the present discussion the case is of limited help.\n\nIn fact, the law as to privacy was developed in latter cases\n\nby spelling it out from the right to freedom of speech and\n\nexpression in Art 19(1)(a) and the right to &#x27;life&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Art. 21&quot;.</a></span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                  [16]</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15059075\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_22\">18.

It will be seen that under <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_59\">sec.73</a>,\n              the Collector could inspect the &#x27;registers,\n              books, records, papers, documents or\n              proceedings&#x27; in the public office. Obviously,\n              this meant that the inspection must relate to\n              &#x27;public documents&#x27; in the custody of the public\n              officer or to public record of private\n              documents available in his office.            The\n              inspection could be carried out only by a\n              person authorized -- in writing -- by the\n              Collector.

It is obvious that in its\n              operation after the commencement of the\n              Constitution, even the unamended <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_62\">sec.73</a>\n              must conform to the provisions of Part III of\n              our Constitution.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">20.   In respect of inspection of the public record in a\n\nBank,   the     Apex    Court   considered     the   elements     of\n\nconfidentiality between the bank and customer in relation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  [17]</span>\n\n\nto the letter&#x27;s banking transactions.

But, as in the\n              case before us, in the context of a Bank which\n              either holds the private documents of its\n              customers or copies of such private\n              documents, the question arises whether\n              disclosure of the contents of the documents by\n              the Bank would amount to a breach of\n              confidentiality and would, therefore, be\n              violative of privacy rights of its customers?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                     46. It cannot be denied that there is\n              an element of confidentiality between a Bank\n              and its customers in relation to the latter&#x27;s\n              banking transactions. Can the State have\n              unrestricted access to inspect and seize or\n              make roving inquiries into all Bank records,\n              without any reliable information before it\n              prior to such inspection? Further, can the\n              Collector authorize &#x27;any person&#x27; whatsoever to\n              make the inspection, and permit him to take\n              notes or extracts? These questions arise even\n              in relation to the <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_64\">sec.73</a> and have to be\n              decided in the context of privacy rights of\n              customers.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">21.     The Apex Court considered the judgment of United\n\nStates vs. Miller, 425 US 435 (1976) as referred in para 48\n\nthus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">              &quot;The majority in Miller laid down that a\n        customer who has conveyed his affairs to another\n        had thereby lost his privacy rights. (i) Prof. Tribe\n        states in his treatise (see p.1391) that this theory\n        reveals &#x27;alarming tendencies&#x27; because the Court has\n        gone back to the old theory that privacy is in\n        relation to property while it has laid down that the\n        right is one attached to the person rather than to\n        property. If the right is to be held to be not attached\n        to the person, then &#x27;we would not shield our account\n        balances, income figures and personal telephone\n        and address books from the public eye, but might\n        instead go about with the information written on our\n        &#x27;foreheads or our bumper stickers&#x27;. He observes\n        that the majority in Miller confused &#x27;privacy&#x27; with\n        &#x27;secrecy&#x27; and that &quot;even their notion of secrecy is a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                              [18]</span>\n\n\n     strange one, for a secret remains a secret even\n     when shared with those whom one selects for one&#x27;s\n     confidence&quot;. Our cheques are not merely negotiable\n     instruments but yet the world can learn a vast\n     amount about us by knowing how and with whom we\n     have spent our money. Same is the position when\n     we use the telephone or post a letter. To say that\n     one assumes great risks by opening a bank account\n     appeared to be a wrong conclusion. Prof. Tribe asks\n     a very pertinent question (p. 1392):\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                 &quot;Yet one can hardly be said to have\n           assumed a risk     of surveillance in a\n           context where, as a practical matter, one\n           had no choice.

The Apex Court thereafter considered the merits of\n\nthe case in para 53, 54 and 55 thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           &quot;53. Once we have accepted in Gobind and in\n     later cases that the right to privacy deals with\n     &#x27;persons and not places&#x27;, the documents or copies of\n     documents of the customer which are in Bank, must\n     continue to remain confidential vis-`-vis the person,\n     even if they are no longer at the customer&#x27;s house\n     and have been voluntarily sent to a Bank. If that be\n     the correct view of the law, we cannot accept the\n     line of Miller in which the Court proceeded on the\n     basis that the right to privacy is referable to the\n     right of &#x27;property&#x27; theory. Once that is so, then\n     unless there is some probable or reasonable cause\n     or reasonable basis or material before the Collector\n     for reaching an opinion that the documents in the\n     possession of the Bank tend, to secure any duty or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                              [19]</span>\n\n\n     to prove or to lead to the discovery of any fraud or\n     omission in relation to any duty, the search or\n     taking notes or extracts therefore, cannot be valid.\n     The above safeguards must necessarily be read into\n     the provision relating to search and inspection and\n     seizure so as to save it from any unconstitutionality.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           54. Secondly, the impugned provision in <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_65\">sec.\n     73</a> enabling the Collector to authorize &#x27;any person&#x27;\n     whatsoever to inspect, to take notes or extracts\n     from the papers in the public office suffers from the\n     vice of excessive delegation as there are no\n     guidelines in the Act and more importantly, the\n     section allows the facts relating to the customer&#x27;s\n     privacy to reach non-governmental persons and\n     would, on that basis, be an unreasonable\n     encroachment into the customer&#x27;s rights. This part\n     of the <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 73</a> permitting delegation to &#x27;any\n     person&#x27; suffers from the above serious defects and\n     for that reason is, in our view, unenforceable.

The A.P. amendment permits inspection\n     being carried out by the Collector by having access\n     to the documents which are in private custody i.e.\n     custody other than that of a public officer.

The Apex Court considering the aforesaid reasons\n\nhad agreed with the view taken by the High Court that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 73</a> of the Indian Stamp Act, as amended in its\n\napplication to the State of Andhra Pradesh, by the Andhra\n\nPradesh   Act   No.17    of   1986    is   ultra   vires   to    the\n\nConstitution. The Apex Court held thus:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">            &quot;A bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 73</a> as substituted\n      by A.P. Act No.17 of 1986 indicates the infirmities\n      with which the provision suffers. The provision\n      empowers &quot;any person&quot; authorized in writing by the\n      Collector to have access to documents in private\n      custody or custody of a public officer without regard\n      to the fact whether the documents are sought to be\n      used before any authority competent to receive\n      evidence or whether such document would ever be\n      voluntarily produced or brought before a public\n      officer during the performance of any of his\n      specified functions in his capacity as such (contrary\n      to the scheme of the rest of the <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_83\">Stamp Act, 1899</a>\n      even as applicable to the State of Andhra Pradesh).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              [21]</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     The power is capable of being exercised by such\n     persons at all reasonable times and it is not\n     preceded by any requirement of reasons being\n     recorded by the Collector or the person authorized,\n     for his belief necessitating search. The provision\n     suffers from the vice of excessive delegation as\n     there are no guidelines in the Act as to the persons\n     who may be authorised. The State must clearly\n     define the officers by designation or state that the\n     power can be delegated to officers not only below a\n     particular rank in the official hierarchy, as may be\n     designated by the State. The person authorized has\n     been vested with authority to impound the\n     document. It is only in case of documents in custody\n     of any bank that an exception has been carved out\n     for giving a 30 days previous notice to the bank to\n     make good the deficit stamp duty before seizing and\n     impounding the document. Not only is there no valid\n     reason -- none pointed out either in the pleadings or\n     at the hearing -- for drawing the distinction between\n     a bank and other public office or any person having\n     custody of document, even in the case of a bank, the\n     power to adjudicate upon the need for impounding\n     the document has been vested in the person\n     authorized.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">25.
