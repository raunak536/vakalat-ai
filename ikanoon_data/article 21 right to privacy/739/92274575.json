The writ petition pertains to the duty of the\n\nState to provide protection and security to the life of a\n\nperson, consequence of the failure to do so and the\n\nremedy available to the aggrieved person for the breach\n\nof right to life and security.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">          2. It will be only appropriate to refer to the\n\nfacts first.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">          3. The petitioners are the unfortunate parents\n\nof a person by name Balakrishnan, who was hacked to\n\ndeath by a group of assailants, who belonged to a\n\nparticular community, at 10.30 p.m. on 18.9.2001. The\n\nstory is that one Rasina, daughter of Abubacker Haji\n\nMalangh of Uppala in Kasaragod had taken a fancy to\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                             2</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\n\nBalakrishnan. The relationship became so intense that\n\nthey eloped on 26.5.2001.      It is claimed that Rasina\n\nconverted to Hinduism and on 1.6.2001 Balakrishnan\n\nand Rasina got married as per the Hindu religious rites\n\nat a temple in Mettupalayam. This act of the girl was\n\nagainst the wishes of her parents and that created\n\nintense dislike in them.    The couple remained for a\n\nwhile at Coimbatore. The petitioners would say that\n\nduring that period, the father of Rasina along with a\n\nclose relative of her used to make frequent visits to the\n\nhouse of the petitioners enquiring about Balakrishnan&#x27;s\n\nwhereabouts.        They collected the photograph of\n\nBalakrishnan, however, the petitioners would say that\n\nthey did not reveal the hideout of Balakrishnan.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">            4. Finding it hard to pull on at Coimbatore,\n\nRasina and Balakrishnan returned to Kasaragod and\n\nBalakrishnan resumed his        courier business.   One\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                              3</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\n\nAbdulla, uncle of Rasina, visited the couple giving the\n\nimpression that he was meeting them to enquire about\n\nthe welfare of Rasina. The allegation is that Abubacker\n\nHaji and other close relatives of Rasina conspired to do\n\naway with Balakrishnan under the leadership of one\n\nperson by name Atha who is a notorious criminal and\n\nthe execution was carried out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">            5. According to the petitioners, at the relevant\n\ntime, communal fanaticism       at Kasaragod was at its\n\npeak. There were frequent clashes between the two\n\ncommunities. The State with its enormous resources at\n\nits command must have been able to gather information\n\nabout the possible outburst.           According to the\n\npetitioners,       the conspiracy   to   do    away    with\n\nBalakrishnan was hatched in the two meetings, one at\n\nCity Tower on 9.8.2001 and the other at Victoria Lodge\n\non 11.8.2001. The conspiracy so hatched in these two\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                             4</span><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">\n\nplaces ought to have been noticed by the State with its\n\nintelligence network and it should have been possible\n\nto gather necessary information regarding the intention\n\nof the conspirators. This is more so in view of the tense\n\nsituation that prevailed in the area. They should have\n\ntaken the necessary precautionary measures. Had the\n\nState and its agencies been more diligent, careful,\n\ncautious enough, they could have easily come to know\n\nabout the plot to do away with Balakrishnan and could\n\nhave averted the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">            6. The apathy on the part of the police during\n\ninvestigation after the incident forced the petitioners to\n\napproach this court by way of O.P. 9131 of 2002 for\n\nproper investigation. That was disposed of by Ext.P1\n\njudgment.        However, the police continued the cold\n\nattitude and the petitioners were forced to approach the\n\nHuman Rights Commission. Finding that, that had little\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                              5</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n\neffect, the petitioners filed W.P.(C) 32794 of 2005\n\nbefore      this   court.  A   statement  filed by   the\n\nSuperintendent       of  Police  of  C.B.C.I.D., Kannur\n\nmentioned about the various steps taken by the police\n\nand that finally resulted in Ext.P2 judgment. In the said\n\njudgment, there was a direction that the investigation\n\nshall be       conducted under the direct supervision of\n\nDeputy Inspector General of Police, Northern Range.\n\nInspite of the direction given under Ext.P2 judgment,\n\nnot much progress was made.          That compelled the\n\npetitioners to approach this court again by way of W.P.\n\n(C) 29278 of 2006. After referring to the total lack of\n\ncommitment and to the indifferent attitude of the\n\ninvestigating agency, this court by Ext.P3 judgment\n\ndirected the investigation to be conducted by C.B.I.\n\nAgain the casual attitude of the police force continued\n\nand the mother of the deceased approached this court\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                             6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\nby way of W.P.(C). 6140 of 2011 which was disposed of\n\nby Ext.P4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">            7. The specific accusation is that the law and\n\norder machinery which is also bound to protect the life\n\nof a person and provide security to him completely\n\nfailed and had the authorities concerned exercised due\n\ndiligence and promptness and had taken precautionary\n\nmeasures, the mishap could have been prevented. As\n\ncommunal frenzy prevailed in the area and there were\n\ninstances of sporadic violence      and members of two\n\ncommunities had indulged in indiscriminate violence,\n\nthe police force must have been more alert. Had they\n\nbeen vigilant they could have gathered necessary\n\ninformation        about the  plot  to   do   away    with\n\nBalakrishnan. The State, in the light of the surcharged\n\natmosphere and volatile situation that prevailed in the\n\narea, should have made necessary arrangements and\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              7</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\nefforts to watch movements of people.          To be more\n\nprecise, if the intelligence wing of police force      had\n\ntaken note of frequent visits of relatives of Rasina to the\n\nhouse of the petitioner, the meetings at the two lodges,\n\nnecessary conclusions could have been drawn.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">            8. Pointing out the utter failure on the part of\n\nthe State to provide adequate security and protection\n\nand also the failure to properly investigate the case\n\ncompelling the petitioners to approach this court on\n\nseveral occasions, the petitioners say that the State is\n\nliable to pay compensation under the            public law\n\ndoctrine for violation of the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">            9. The State opposes the petition. They filed\n\ntwo counter affidavits.     They deny any liability with\n\nregard to the incident or liability to pay compensation\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                            8</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\n\nto the petitioners. If at all the petitioners have any\n\ngrievance, their remedy lies under the civil law or as a\n\ntortious claim or under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_3\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>,\n\nand no relief can be granted under the writ jurisdiction.\n\nThere was no laches or negligence on the part of the\n\nState machinery which resulted in the death of\n\nBalakrishnan. There was no circumstances to foresee\n\nany danger and no such situation as alleged prevailed in\n\nthe area at any point of time and neither Balakrishnan\n\nor his parents nor anybody else had filed any complaint\n\nregarding any threat to Balakrishnan or his wife. It is\n\nvirtually impossible for the State with its limited\n\nresources and man power to give security to all persons\n\nat all times and no such right is recognized in law. At\n\nno point of time it was brought to the notice of the\n\npolice     authorities that  there  was   any    threat,\n\nintimidation from anybody or that the family of\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                            9</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\n\nBalakrishnan had suffered any bitter experience at the\n\nhands of the parents or relatives of Rasina. After the\n\nincident, proper investigation has been done and the\n\nfinal report has been laid. The case is to come up for\n\ntrial.    If at all the petitioners are entitled to get\n\ncompensation, they will get the same under <a href=\"/doc/1705664/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 357</a>\n\nCr.P.C. In short, the contention is that this writ petition\n\nis misconceived and ill-advised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">            10. Learned Senior counsel Sri. Raju Joseph\n\ncontended that in civilized societies governed by rule of\n\nlaw, right to life and liberty of a person are well\n\nrecognized. In <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nthe words used are life and liberty, while in\n\nInternational Covenants to which India is a party, the\n\nwords used are life and security. The word life is given\n\na wide connotation by the Apex Court and is construed\n\nas conferring right on all persons from birth till death.\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                            10</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n\nAccording to the learned Senior Counsel, the State is\n\nbound to take measures to protect the life of a citizen.\n\nThe vibrant <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> takes within its fold all aspects of\n\nlife which include adequate security also.        Learned\n\ncounsel pointed out that it is not his claim that the\n\npolice should provide security to all, at all times. But\n\nwhen the situation prevailing is such that it gives\n\nreasonable apprehension of possible outburst and\n\noffensive actions, the police is bound to take adequate\n\nprecautionary measures.        If the police had the\n\nknowledge of a possible mishap or outburst, or could\n\nhave had the knowledge of the same, they are bound to\n\ntake adequate preventive measures and if due to their\n\nnegligence, the life or property of a person is lost, the\n\nState is certainly liable and is bound to compensate.\n\nHonour killing has been deprecated by the Apex Court.\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                            11</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\n\nIt is by now well settled that in case of violation of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a>, Public Law remedy is available and in\n\nappropriate cases compensation can and infact must be\n\nmade available to the aggrieved. Learned counsel also\n\nemphasized that the public law remedy is in addition to\n\nother remedies. In support of his contention, learned\n\ncounsel relied on the decisions reported in Nilabati\n\nBehera v. State of Orissa (AIR 1993 SC 1960), Rudul\n\nSah v. State of Bihar (AIR 1983 SC 1086), Bhagwan\n\nDass v. State (NCT of Delhi) ((2011) 6 SCC 396,\n\nArumugham Servai v. State of T.N.

If at all any\n\nsuch privilege is available, it is only available in regard\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                              12</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n\nto primary functions of the State. The State is liable for\n\nthe tortious acts of its officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">            11. Coming to the facts of this case, learned\n\nSenior Counsel pointed out that had the police\n\nexercised reasonable vigil, the incident would not have\n\nhappened.          It has come out that there were two\n\nmeetings in two lodges where the conspirators had\n\ngathered and planned to do away with Balakrishnan.\n\nThese meetings at the two lodges should have alerted\n\nthe State which has enormous resources at its\n\ncommand and should have suspected the motive of the\n\nparticipants in the meeting. Moreover, had the police\n\nofficers been vigilant, they could have noticed the\n\nfrequent visits of the relatives of Rasina to the house of\n\nBalakrishnan at the time of tension prevailing in the\n\narea between the two communities and that should\n\nhave been taken note of. Under normal circumstances,\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                             13</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">\n\nit may be too much to ask for protection of individual&#x27;s\n\nlife and liberty at all times.    But in the light of the\n\ncommunal          tension and   surcharged     atmosphere\n\nprevailing in the area, the police ought to have been\n\nmore alert and careful.           The indifference and\n\ncallousness is quite apparent from the lukewarm\n\nattitude shown by the police even after the incident.\n\nThis court had to be approached on several occasions\n\nfor proper investigation and all these would show the\n\nfailure on the part of the authorities concerned to\n\nexercise necessary caution and care which ultimately\n\nresulted in the calamity. The indifference, laches and\n\nnegligence on the part of the persons concerned cost\n\nthe life of a person and that constitute breach of right\n\nto life and liberty of the victim as well as the applicants\n\nwho enjoy such rights as guaranteed under the\n\nConstitution as well as under the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_10\">Human Rights Act</a>\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                              14</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n\nand are entitled to compensation under the public law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">            12.    Per contra, learned Additional Director\n\nGeneral of Prosecution Shri. Tom Jose Padinjarekkara\n\ncontended that the arguments of the petitioners are far\n\nfetched and too remote. According to him, it is virtually\n\nimpossible with the limited resources available to give\n\nprotection to the life and liberty of every person and the\n\nlaw does not insist so. It is significant, according to the\n\nlearned Addl. D.G.P., that no incidents are referred to in\n\nthe writ petition to show that any communal tension\n\nprevailed in the area or the life of members of either\n\ncommunity was in danger. There was no complaint by\n\neither the victim or his parents of any threat or\n\nintimidation. There was nothing to show that there\n\nwas threat to the life of any person. The contention\n\nbased on conspiracy consequent to the meeting in two\n\nlodges is misconceived. It was during the investigation\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                            15</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">\n\nof the crime after the incident that police force came to\n\nknow that there were two meetings in the lodges made\n\nmention of by the petitioners. Merely because a few\n\npeople had gathered at a place, the police cannot\n\nsuspect conspiracy and that by itself is insufficient for a\n\nprobe. Unless some suspicious activity is noticed or\n\ninformation thereof is passed on, the police cannot\n\nintrude into the privacy of persons without any\n\njustification. Had the victim or his parents or any of his\n\nrelatives given intimation or complaint regarding any\n\ndamage to the life of either Balakrishnan or Rasina,\n\nsurely appropriate action would have been taken by the\n\nofficers of the State. Learned Addl.D.G.P. contended\n\nthat, true the State has a duty to protect the life of its\n\ncitizens. But it cannot be stretched beyond limits. If\n\nthe event which resulted in causing damage or loss of\n\nlife to a person as a result of the violation of the\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                            16</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"504283\" id=\"span_18\">constitution or human right could have been reasonably\n\nforeseen or ought to have been foreseen by the\n\nauthorities, then there may be some substance in the\n\nclaim made by the petitioners. In the case on hand,\n\nthere are absolutely no materials to suspect the alleged\n\nmove to do away with Balakrishnan. It is true that the\n\nState has vast resources in its command.         But it is\n\nridiculous to suggest that the police or intelligence wing\n\nhas to keep track of every movement of a citizen\n\nwithout any justification or suspicion.      None of the\n\nsituation which would attract liability on the State is\n\npresent or established. It was also pointed out that if at\n\nall the petitioners have a grievance and are entitled to\n\ncompensation, they will have to resort to the ordinary\n\ncivil remedy or resort to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_11\">Cr.P.C</a>.

First of all, one has to note whether there\n\nexists any right as claimed by the petitioners and a\n\ncorresponding duty on the State to provide security to\n\nthe life of a person from the criminal activity of a third\n\nperson. If one is to locate such a right and\n\ncorresponding duty, then what are their limitations The\n\nnext aspect that needs to be considered is, if there is\n\nsuch a duty or right, on the breach of the right or\n\nfailure to perform the duty, what are the consequences\n\nand what are the remedies available to the aggrieved\n\nperson?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">            15.

It is contended that it\n\nis the constitutional obligation and the statutory duty,\n\nviolation of which gives rise to strict liability. Being a\n\nconstitutional and statutory duty, failure to perform\n\nsuch duties would enable the petitioner to avail of\n\npublic law remedy, which according to the petitioner, is\n\nby now well established.

Every Nation which has a written or\n\nunwritten Constitution functioning on conventions give\n\nsignificance and importance and infact primary concern\n\nto the life and personal liberty of a person. In most of\n\nthe Constitutions, right to life and liberty are\n\nguaranteed so also in case of violation of those core\n\nrights, the aggrieved person has the right to move the\n\nappropriate court or tribunal as the case may be for\n\nredressal of his grievances.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">W.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                               21</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">            19.

The common law rights\n\nrecognized          till  then   became   constitutionally\n\nguaranteed rights. It also provides limits of legislative\n\nencroachment.        Part III of the Indian Constitution\n\nmakes       mention     of  various  fundamental   rights.\n\nLegislative check is also provided for, mainly by\n\nrestrictions and also taking note of the reasonableness\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                             27</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">\n\nof those restrictions.

India has a written Constitution with\n\nconstitutionalism firmly embedded in it.

The Constitution also provides for\n\nremedies under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_32\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">226</a> of the Constitution\n\nfor redressal of grievances in case of violation of human\n\nrights and fundamental rights. The Apex Court has held\n\nthat infact the High Court exercising jurisdiction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> enjoys wider powers than that is conferred\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 32</a>,         though <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 32</a> is part of the\n\nfundamental rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">            32.      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> is couched in negative\n\nlanguage.        Strictly speaking, it does not confer any\n\npositive right. It is only a dictate to the State not to do\n\ncertain things.

Therefore literally\n\nPart III of the Constitution of India provides rights as\n\nagainst State interference and does not actually create\n\nentitlement to claim positive rights.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">            33. However, by interpretative process, the\n\nApex court has widened the horizon of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> and\n\nhas laid down that it encompasses positive rights also.\n\nIt has been held that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> takes within its fold the\n\nright to go abroad, right to unpolluted environment,\n\nright to clean water, right to live with dignity and\n\nhonour, right to education, right to medical treatment,\n\nright to shelter, right to privacy etc. In fact the Apex\n\nCourt has gone on to observe that right to life includes\n\nright to live with human dignity and all that goes along\n\nwith it namely, the bare necessities of life such as food,\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                             31</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">\n\nclothing, shelter and facilities for reading and writing\n\nand express oneself in diverse forms, freely moving\n\nabout and mixing with fellow human beings.

In the latter\n\n     case, the concept of security was associated\n\n     with       concepts  like  &quot;national   security&quot;,\n\n     &quot;internal security&quot; or &quot;public security&quot;, all of\n\n     which refer specifically to the security of the\n\n     State.

The difference\n\ndrawn was public law functions of an authority are\n\nthose which involve the determination of questions and\n\nreaching of decisions, whereas private law functions are\n\nthose which involve carrying out of contract or other\n\noperations.

The mere fact that the family was able to\n\nprocure       orders from  this  court   for  a    proper\n\ninvestigation, and that final report has been laid by the\n\ninvestigating agency is no answer to their claim that\n\ntheir fundamental rights have been violated.       It is a\n\nclear case of lethargy, inefficiency whether deliberate\n\nor not, and a reflection of     indifferent attitude    or\n\nunconcern of a citizen&#x27;s right displayed by the\n\ninvestigating agency.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_222\">W.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                             118</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_223\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">            100.

The question then arises as to what\n\nexactly is the relief to be granted to the petitioners. Of\n\ncourse, the Addl.D.G.P. continues to contend that if the\n\npetitioners have suffered any damages, the proper\n\nforum for them is to approach the civil court or the\n\ncriminal court where the trial regarding the murder of\n\nBalakrishnan is pending and not to invoke the writ\n\njurisdiction of this court for compensation.\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                            119</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_226\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">            102. The history of the development of public\n\nlaw doctrine has been traced. It is by now well settled\n\nthat when the court comes to the conclusion that there\n\nhas been a violation of the fundamental rights of the\n\nparty concerned, if necessary, monetary compensation\n\nmay be ordered. In fact <a href=\"/doc/1753082/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 18</a> of the Protection of\n\nHuman Rights Act, 1993 provides for payment of\n\ncompensation. Instances are not rare when monetary\n\ncompensation was awarded like in cases of police\n\natrocities, illegal detention and medical negligence.\n\nPublic law remedy by way of         resorting to judicial\n\nreview method has now been accepted as an effective\n\nmode of rendering quick justice.         In some cases,\n\nmonetary compensation may be the only suitable\n\nremedy for redressal of the grievance.    In the case on\n\nhand, applying the well settled principle, it follows that\n\nthe only way by which the trauma undergone by the\n\f\nW.P.(C) 24015/2011.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                             120</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">\n\npetitioners and also the loss suffered by them as a\n\nresult of the violation of the personal liberty is by way\n\nof awarding monetary compensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_229\">            103.    The compensation awarded under the\n\npublic law remedy too is only one of the remedies where\n\nviolation or breach of a fundamental right is alleged and\n\nestablished.       The amount awarded as per public law\n\ndoes not preclude the beneficiary from resorting to\n\nother forms of remedies available to him.           These\n\nremedies are not either exclusive or unconnected with\n\neach other.
