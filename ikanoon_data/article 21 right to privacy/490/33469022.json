The Sessions Court, while dismissing the\n                          appeal, took the view that the order in question was purely interlocutory in\n                          nature and did not adjudicate upon any substantive rights of the parties.\n                          Accordingly, the Appellate Court held that no appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1771195/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 29</a> of the\n                          DV Act would lie against such an order.

It\n                          is thus urged that such an order cannot be characterised as merely procedural\n                          or interlocutory in nature, since it directly impinges upon a fundamental\n                          right.

It is apparent that application for condonation of\n                                        delay filed by the petitioner has been dismissed merely on the\n                                        ground that it was filed under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 151</a> CPC and not under\n                                        the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_22\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>. The trial court has not addressed the\n                                        application on merits. Mentioning wrong Section of law in an\n                                        application by a party is typically not considered &quot;Fatal&quot; to the\n                                        case, provided the substance of the application is clear and no\n                                        prejudice is caused to the opposite party of the court. The courts\n                                        generally prioritize substance over form, especially if the\n                                        intention and relief sought by the party are apparent. If\n                                        incorrect Section does not mislead the court or the other party\n                                        and no prejudice is caused, the mistake is treated as a &quot;curable\n                                        defect&quot;. The trial court should have focussed on the content of\n                                        the application rather than the technicalities of citing the\n                                        incorrect Section. Procedural errors, including mentioning\n                                        incorrect provision of law should not override the substantive\n                                        justice. The Court has enough powers under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 151</a> CPC to\n                                        ensure that justice is served. The trial court underscored that it\n                                        is a substance of the application that matters and not a form or\n                                        the specific provision and should have considered the\n                                        application on the merits regardless of respective provision\n                                        under which the same was filed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                                  Arguments addressed on behalf of respondents\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">                                  4.       Per contra, Ld. for respondents supporting the Impugned Order\n                                  argued that there is no infirmity and illegality done by the Ld. Trial Court\n                                  and has rightly passed the order which is an interlocutory order as no right\n                                  interim or otherwise of the parties has been decided, hence, no interference\n                                  is required by this Court. He further argued that the present appeal is\n                                  nothing but sheer abuse of process of law and has been devised as a tool to\n                                  not only harass the respondents but also for unjust enrichment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">                                  Relevant portion of the Impugned Order\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">                                  7.

The present appeal has been filed under <a href=\"/doc/1771195/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 29</a> of DV Act.\n                                  Appellant/complainant has filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1130386/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 19</a> of DV Act\n                                  seeking alternate accommodation or rent for the same. <a href=\"/doc/1130386/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 19</a> of the Act\n                                  deals with residence order to ensure the safety and well-being of aggrieved\n                                  person by preventing the respondent from interfering with her residence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                                  12.       The matter is herein the maintainability of the present appeal\n                                  against the impugned order. Therefore, the Court deems it appropriate to\n                                  first discuss the law on the point. In general parlance, if any order passed\n                                  by Trial Court decides any question between the parties which directly\n                                  affects the decision in the main case or which finally decides any collateral\n                                  issue in perpetuity, it would be a judgment or order which is appealable but\n                                  if an order, though deciding an issue between the parties finally, is\n                                  temporary and interim and has no bearing or effect on the rights of the\n                                  parties or the main issue involved in the case, it would fall within the\n                                  parameters of an interlocutory order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">                                  13.       However, an appeal can be filed against an interlocutory order in\n                                  a Domestic Violence (DV) matter, but it&#x27;s not always straightforward\n                                  <a href=\"/doc/1771195/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 29</a> of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005,\n                                  allows for appeals against orders made under the Act, including interim\n                                  orders passed by a Magistrate. But, the interlocutory orders which don&#x27;t\n                                  affect the substantive rights of the parties may not be appealable under this\n                                  Section. The present case is one such cases since the order assailed herein\n                                  is only for calling the salary slip, bank account statement and affidavit\n                                  regarding receipt of LIC amount by the aggrieved in order to decide her\n                                  claim for residence/alternate accommodation etc.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                                  14.

In the making of a residence order, no doubt the Court is required to have\n                                    due regard to financial needs and the resources of the parties. In this case, there\n                                    is material on record which indicates that the respondent has her own independent\n                                    financial income. However, the petitioner, admittedly has to provide for the minor\n                                    child. At the present stage, we are not concerned with the issue of maintenance per\n                                    se. However there is nothing on record to indicate that the petitioner has been\n                                    providing for any maintenance with respect to the minor child or his educational\n                                    or medical needs. There can be no serious doubt that the responsibility to provide\n                                    for not mere maintenance but also shelter to the minor child, is equally that of both\n                                    the parents. In these circumstances, if the impugned order, requires the petitioner\n                                    to bear the expenses to the extent of Rs. 8,000/- per month towards providing of\n                                    shelter to the respondent and the minor child, there is nothing either unreasonable\n                                    or unjustified in the same. This is not a case where the Family Court has\n                                    completely disregarded the financial needs and resource of the parties. The test, in\n                                    all cases cannot be that if the wife is in a position to provide for the financial\n                                    needs of the child her spouse is relieved altogether of his obligation to contribute\n                                    to the financial needs of such child. The phrase &#x27;having regard to financial\n                                    needs and resources of the parties&#x27; is required to be interpreted in a reasonable\n                                    manner. All that the phrase requires is that the Court must have due regard to\n                                    both the financial needs and the resources of the parties.
