The respondent preferred separate appeals before the First Appellate\nAuthority - Addl. Commissioner of Income-tax (hereafter the &#x27;FAA&#x27;)\nagainst the order of PIO. By a common order dated 08.05.2009, FAA\nrejected the appeal of the respondent. Aggrieved by the order dated\n08.05.2009 of FAA, the respondent preferred an appeal before the CIC.

Certain petitioners had specifically pleaded that information provided\nin the income tax returns could not be disclosed as the information was\nprovided in confidence. The CIC rejected the same by holding that the\nparties had failed to explain as to how that ground could apply or how\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                            Page 8 of 29</span>\n disclosure of information relating to commercial confidence would harm\ntheir competitive interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">14.      The income tax returns filed by an assessee and further information\nthat is provided during the assessment proceedings may also include\nconfidential information relating to the business or the affairs of an\nassessee. An assessee is expected to truly and fairly disclose particulars\nrelevant for the purposes of assessment of income tax. The nature of the\ndisclosure required is not limited only to information that has been placed\nby an assessee in public domain but would also include information which\nan assessee may consider confidential. As a matter of illustration, one may\nconsider a case of a manufacturer who manufactures and deals in multiple\nproducts for supplies to different agencies.     In the normal course, an\nAssessing Officer would require an assessee to disclose profit margins on\nsales of such products. Such information would clearly disclose the pricing\npolicy of the assessee and public disclosure of this information may clearly\njeopardise the bargaining power available to the assessee since the data as\nto costs would be available to all agencies dealing with the assessee. It is,\nthus, essential that information relating to business affairs, which is\nconsidered to be confidential by an assessee must remain so, unless it is\nnecessary in larger public interest to disclose the same. If the nature of\ninformation is such that disclosure of which may have the propensity of\nharming one&#x27;s competitive interests, it would not be necessary to\nspecifically show as to how disclosure of such information would, in fact,\nharm the competitive interest of a third party.

Insofar as the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the Act is concerned,\nI am unable to accept the contention that a fiduciary relationship within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the Act can be attributed to a relationship\nbetween an assessee and the income tax authority.

The information mostly sought for finds a place in the\n         income tax returns of the third respondent.

We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n         the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n         issued to the third respondent, show-cause notices and orders of\n         censure/punishment, etc. are qualified to be personal\n         information as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI\n         Act.

On the other hand, the disclosure of which\n         would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual.\n         Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information\n         Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate\n         authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the\n         disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be\n         passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter\n         of right.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">         13. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns\n         are &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from\n         disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act,\n         unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public\n         Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or\n         the appellate authority is satisfied that the larger public interest\n         justifies the disclosure of such information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">         14. The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona fide\n         public interest in seeking information, the disclosure of such\n         information would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of\n         the individual under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">19.      The CIC rejected the aforesaid contention by holding that the\nexpression &quot;personal information&quot; would necessarily only apply to an\nindividual and could not be applicable in case of corporate entities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">20.      It has been contended by the petitioners that the expression &quot;personal\ninformation&quot; must also extend to information relating to corporate entities.\nInasmuch as they may also fall within the definition of expression &quot;person&quot;\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_43\">General Clauses Act, 1897</a> as well as under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_44\">Income Tax Act,\n1961</a>. However, I am unable to accept this contention for the reason that the\nexpression &quot;personal information&quot; as used in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 8(1)</a> of\nthe Act has to be read in the context of information relating to an\nindividual. A plain reading of the aforesaid clause would indicate that the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                        Page 13 of 29</span>\n expression &quot;personal information&quot; is linked with &quot;invasion of privacy of the\nindividual&quot;.        The use of the word &quot;the&quot; before the word &quot;individual&quot;\nimmediately links the same with the expression &quot;personal information&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">21.      Black&#x27;s law dictionary, sixth edition, inter alia, defines the word\n&quot;personal&quot; as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">         &quot;The word &quot;personal&quot; means appertaining to the person;\n         belonging to an individual; limited to the person; having the\n         nature or partaking of the qualities of human beings, or of\n         movable property.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">22.      A perusal of the above definition also indicates that the ordinary\nusage of the word &quot;personal&quot; is in the context of an individual human being\nand not a corporate entity. The U.S. Supreme Court has also interpreted the\nexpression &quot;personal&quot; to be used in the context of an individual human\nbeing and not a corporate entity. In the case of Federal Communications\nCommission v. AT&amp;T Inc: 2011 US LEXIS 1899 the US Supreme Court\nconsidered the meaning of the expression &quot;personal privacy&quot; in the context\nof the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_46\">Freedom of Information Act</a>, which required Federal Agencies to\nmake certain records and documents publically available on request. Such\ndisclosure was exempt if the records &quot;could reasonably be expected to\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy&quot;.          The U.S.\nSupreme Court held that the expression &quot;Personal&quot; used in the aforesaid\ncontext could not be extended to corporations because the word &quot;personal&quot;\nordinarily refers to individuals. The Court held that the expression\n&quot;personal&quot; must be given its ordinary meaning. The relevant extract of the\nsaid judgment is as under:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                  Page 14 of 29</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">          &quot;&quot;Person&quot; is a defined term in the statute; &quot;personal&quot; is\n         not. When a statute does not define a term, we typically &quot;give\n         the phrase its ordinary meaning.&quot; Johnson v. United States, 559\n         U.S. ___, ___, 559 U.S. 133, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1,\n         8 (2010). &quot;Personal&quot; ordinarily refers to individuals. We do not\n         usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects,\n         personal correspondence, personal influence, or personal\n         tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities.\n         This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence,\n         influence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not use the\n         word &quot;personal&quot; to describe them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">         Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation\n         approached the chief financial officer and said, &quot;I have\n         something personal to tell you,&quot; we would not assume the CEO\n         was about to discuss company business. Responding to a\n         request for information, an individual might say, &quot;that&#x27;s\n         personal.&quot; A company spokesman, when asked for\n         information about the company, would not. In fact, we often\n         use the word &quot;personal&quot; to mean precisely the opposite of\n         business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business\n         expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a\n         company&#x27;s                                               view.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">         Dictionaries also suggest that &quot;personal&quot; does not ordinarily\n         relate to artificial &quot;persons&quot; such as corporations. See, e.g., 7\n         OED 726 (1933) (&quot;[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the individual\n         person or self,&quot; &quot;individual; private; one&#x27;s own,&quot; &quot;[3] [o]f or\n         pertaining to one&#x27;s person, body, or figure,&quot; &quot;[5] [o]f, pertaining\n         to, or characteristic of a person or self-conscious being, as\n         opposed to a thing or abstraction&quot;); 11 OED at 599-600 (2d ed.\n         1989) (same); Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary\n         1686 (1976) (&quot;[3] relating to the person or body&quot;; &quot;[4] relating\n         to an individual, his character, conduct, motives, or private\n         affairs&quot;; &quot;[5] relating to or characteristic of human beings as\n         distinct from things&quot;); ibid. (2002) (same).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                       Page 15 of 29</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"> 23.      In my view, the aforesaid reasoning would also be applicable to the\nexpression &quot;personal&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. The expression\n&#x27;individual&#x27; must be construed in an expansive sense and would include a\nbody of individuals. The said exemption would be available even to\nunincorporated entities as also private, closely held undertaking which are\nin substance alter egos of their shareholders. However, the expression\nindividual cannot be used as a synonym for the expression &#x27;person&#x27;. <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_48\">Under\nthe General Clauses Act, 1897</a> a person is defined to &quot;include any company\nor association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not&quot;. Thus,\nwhereas a person would include an individual as well as incorporated\nentities and artificial persons, the expression &#x27;individual&#x27; cannot be\ninterpreted to include such entities. The context in which, the expression\n&quot;personal information&quot; is used would also exclude it application to large\nwidely held corporations. While, confidential information of a corporation\nis exempt from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, there is no\nscope to exclude other information relating to such corporations under\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act as the concept of a personal information cannot in\nordinary language be understood to mean information pertaining to a public\ncorporation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"181332670\" id=\"span_24\">24.      It would also be relevant to refer to the decision of a Division Bench\nof this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/181332670/\" id=\"a_51\">Ashok Kumar Goel v. Public Information\nOfficer Vat Ward No.</a> 64 &amp; Anr.: (2012) 188 DLT 597 whereby it was\nheld that information of the returns made to the Sales Tax Commissioner in\nrelation to a firm was exempt under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. The relevant\nportion of <a href=\"/doc/181332670/\" id=\"a_53\">the said judgment</a> is quoted as under:-</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                     Page 16 of 29</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">          &quot;7. It is not in dispute that the information in the form of returns\n         filed by the respondent No. 2&#x27;s firm is in the nature of\n         commercial confidence which is clearly inferable from <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_54\">Section\n         98</a> of the Act. Such information can be given only if larger\n         public interest warrants the disclosure of this information. All\n         the authorities below including the learned Single Judge has\n         held and rightly so that no public interest is at all involved in\n         seeking of this information by the appellant from the\n         Sales Tax Commissioner. What to talk of public interest, the\n         finding is that the information is sought with oblique motive to\n         settle personal scores.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">25.      Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to the\ninformation pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in W.P.(C) 88/2010)\nand the information contained in the income tax returns would be personal\ninformation under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. However, the CIC directed\ndisclosure of information of Dr Trehan also by concluding that income tax\nreturns and information provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public\nactivity.&quot; In my view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of\nfiling returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity.\nThe expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public nature\nand not necessarily act done in compliance of a statute. The expression\n&quot;public activity&quot; would denote activity done for the public and/or in some\nmanner available for participation by public or some section of public.\nThere is no public activity involved in filing a return or an individual\npursuing his assessment with the income tax authorities. In this view, the\ninformation relating to individual assesse could not be disclosed. Unless,\nthe CIC held that the same was justified &quot;in the larger public interest&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                        Page 17 of 29</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"> 26.      At this stage, it may be appropriate to consider the nature of\ninformation that is provided by an assesse to its Assessing Officer. In case\nof Income from business and profession, the income tax returns mainly\ndisclose the final accounts (i.e. profit and loss account and balance sheets)\nThis information is otherwise also liable to be disclosed by companies and\nis available in public domain since it is necessary for a company to file its\nannual accounts with the Registrar of Companies. Other incorporated\nentities are similarly required to also publically disclose their final\naccounts. However, an Assessing Officer may call for further information\nwhile determining the assessable income, which may include all books and\npapers maintained by an entity. Such information may also have\ninformation relating to other parties, the disclosure of which may be exempt\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. As a matter of illustration, the books of\naccounts would record transactions of commercial nature which may enjoin\nthe parties to the transactions to keep the information confidential. Further,\nthe books of accounts would also record salaries and other payments to\nother individuals. Disclosure of such information would affect not just the\nassessee but also other parties. In the circumstances, it would be necessary\nto examine the details of information that are sought from the public\nauthority. In the present case, the respondent seems to have sought for an\nomnibus disclosure of all records and returns. In my view, the same could\nnot be allowed without examining the nature of information contained\ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_27\">27.

As a public authority,\n         Registrar of Co-operative Societies has been conferred with lot\n         of statutory powers under the respective Act under which he is\n         functioning.

The said\ncontroversy was answered by the following words:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">         &quot;It is undoubtedly open to the authorities to disclose\n         information received by them from assessments or other\n         proceedings under the Act. However, there are restrictions\n         contained in Section 138 as now existing concerning the\n         manner in which that information is to be disclosed. Leaving\n         aside sub-clause (a) of sub-section (1) it seems that under sub-\n         clause (b), the Commissioner can disclose information if he is\n         satisfied that it is within the public interest to do so. Hence, if\n         some other authority applies to the Commissioner to obtain\n         information, the same may be disclosed in the discretion of the\n         Commissioner. Under Sub-clause (a) there is also a power to\n         furnish information to other authorities. As this matter has not\n         been fully argued or discussed in the present case, it is\n         sufficient to note that there is no power to disclose information\n         to other authorities and officers outside the provisions of the\n         Section. As far as the information already given is concerned,\n         we have no power to give any direction concerning the same.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">31.      Although by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 22</a> of the Act, the provisions of the Act\nhave an overriding effect over any other inconsistent law, the said\nprovisions of the Act insofar as they are not inconsistent with other statutes\nmust be read harmoniously. Undoubtedly, the income tax returns and\ninformation provided to Income Tax Authorities by assessees is\nconfidential and not required to be placed in public domain. Given the\nnature of the income tax returns and the information necessary to support\nthe same, it would be exempt under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act in respect of\nindividual and unincorporated assessees. The information as disclosed in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                       Page 22 of 29</span>\n the income tax returns would qualify as personal information with regard to\nseveral private companies which are, essentially, alter egos of their\npromoters. However, in cases of widely held companies most information\nrelating to their income and expenditure would be in public domain and the\nconfidential information would be exempt from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_83\">Section\n8(1)(d)</a> of the Act. Further, even in cases of corporate entities, the income\ntax returns and other disclosure made to authorities would also include\ntransactions with other parties and those parties can also claim the\nexception under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. One has to also bear in mind that\nan authority may not have any obligation to provide any information other\nthan in the form in which it is available and the information provided by an\nassessee may not have been edited to remove references to other persons.\nKeeping all the aforesaid considerations in view, the parliament has enacted\n<a href=\"/doc/1448409/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 138</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to provide for disclosure only\nwhere it is necessary in public interest. Similar provisions are enacted\nunder the Act and clauses (d), (e) and (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act that\nspecify that information exempt from disclosure under those clauses, could\nbe disclosed in larger public interest. <a href=\"/doc/1484095/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 8(2)</a> of the Act also provides\nfor a non obstante clause which permits disclosure of information in larger\npublic interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">32.      It would also be necessary to refer to <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 11</a> of the Act, which\nprovides for a notice to a third party before any third party information is\ndisclosed.        The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 11</a> of the Act also specifies that\ndisclosure of trade or commercial secrets, which are protected by law\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                   Page 23 of 29</span>\n would not be allowed unless their disclosure is necessary in public interest.\n<a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 11(1)</a> of the Act reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">         &quot;11. Third party information.--(1) Where a Central Public\n         Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer, as\n         the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record,\n         or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates\n         to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as\n         confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information\n         Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be,\n         shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a\n         written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact\n         that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public\n         Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the\n         information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party\n         to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether\n         the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the\n         third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about\n         disclosure of information:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">         Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets\n         protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public\n         interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible\n         harm or injury to the interests of such third party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">33.      In the above context where the nature of income tax returns and other\ninformation provided for assessment of income is confidential and its\ndisclosure is protected under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_91\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a> it is not necessary\nto read any inconsistency between the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_92\">Act and Income Tax Act, 1961</a>. And,\ninformation furnished by an assesse can be disclosed only where it is\nnecessary to do in public interest and where such interest outweighs in\nimportance, any possible harm or injury to the assesse or any other third\nparty. However, information furnished by corporate assessees that neither\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                      Page 24 of 29</span>\n relates to another party nor is exempt under <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, can\nbe disclosed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">34.      In view of the aforesaid, the principal question that is to be addressed\nis whether the CIC has misdirected itself in concluding that disclosure of\nincome tax returns and other information relating to assessment of income\nof the petitioners was in public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">35.      In order to address this controversy, it is important to understand the\npurpose of the respondent in seeking such information. The proceedings\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_94\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a> with respect to assessment of income are\nat different stages. It is stated that in some cases, assessment is complete\nand appeal proceedings are pending in other fora.            In one case, it is\ncontended that the Appellate Authorities have remanded the matter of\nassessment to the Assessing Officer. It is apparent that the assessment\nproceedings have thrown up contentious issues which are being agitated\nbetween the income tax authorities and the assessees. The respondent,\nessentially, wants to intervene in those proceedings by adding and\nproviding his contentions or interpretation as to the information provided\nby the asseesees or otherwise available with the Income Tax Authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">36.      In my view, the CIC has misdirected itself in concluding that this\nwas in larger public interest. The CIC arrived at this conclusion by noting\nthat disclosure of information was in larger public interest in increasing\npublic revenue and reducing corruption. The assessment proceedings are\nnot public proceedings where all and sundry are allowed to participate and\nadd their opinion to the proceedings. Merely because a spirited citizen\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                      Page 25 of 29</span>\n wishes to assist in assessment proceedings, the same cannot be stated to be\nin larger public interest. On the contrary, larger public interest would\nrequire that assessment proceedings are completed expeditiously and by the\nauthorities who are statutorily empowered to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">37.      In the present case, there was no material to indicate that there was\nany corruption on the part of the income tax authorities which led to a\njustifiable apprehension that the said authorities were not performing their\nfunction diligently. In any event, the CIC has not found that the\nproceedings relating to assessment were not being conducted in accordance\nwith law and/or required the intervention of the respondent. Assessment\nproceedings are quasi-judicial proceedings where assessee has to produce\nmaterial to substantiate their return of income.      Income tax has to be\nassessed by the income tax authorities strictly in accordance with the\n<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_95\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a> and based on the information sought by them. In the\npresent case, the respondent wants to process the information to assist and\nsupport the role of an Assessing Officer.         This has a propensity of\ninterfering in the assessment proceedings and thus, cannot be considered to\nbe in larger public interest. The CIC had proceeded on the basis that the\nincome tax authorities should disclose information to informers of income\ntax departments to enable them to bring instances of tax evasion to the\nnotice of income tax authorities. In my view, this reasoning is flawed as it\nwould tend to subvert the assessment process rather than aid it. If this idea\nis carried to its logical end, it would enable several busy bodies to interfere\nin assessment proceedings and throw up their interpretation of law and facts\nas to how an assessment ought to be carried out. The propensity of this to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                    Page 26 of 29</span>\n multiply litigation cannot be underestimated. Further, the proposition that\nunrelated parties could intervene in assessment proceedings is wholly alien\nto the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_96\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a>. The income tax returns and information are\nprovided in aid of the proceedings that are conducted under that Act and\nthere is no scope for enhancing or providing for an additional dimension to\nthe assessment proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_38\">38.      The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_97\">Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed\nHussain Abbas Rizwi</a>: (2012) 13 SCC 61 held that the statutory exemption\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 8</a> of the Act is the rule and only in exceptional\ncircumstances of larger public interest the information would be disclosed.\nIt was also held that &#x27;public purpose&#x27; needs to be interpreted in the strict\nsense and public interest has to be construed keeping in mind the balance\nbetween right to privacy and right to information. The relevant extract from\n<a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_99\">the said judgment</a> is quoted below:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">         &quot;21. ...... Another very significant provision of the Act is\n         <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>. In terms of this provision, information which\n         relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no\n         relationship to any public activity or interest or which would\n         cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual\n         would fall within the exempted category, unless the authority\n         concerned is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the\n         disclosure of such information. It is, therefore, to be understood\n         clearly that it is a statutory exemption which must operate as a\n         rule and only in exceptional cases would disclosure be\n         permitted, that too, for reasons to be recorded demonstrating\n         satisfaction to the test of larger public interest. It will not be in\n         consonance with the spirit of these provisions, if in a\n         mechanical manner, directions are passed by the appropriate\n         authority to disclose information which may be protected in\n         terms of the above provisions. All information which has come\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                         Page 27 of 29</span>\n          to the notice of or on record of a person holding fiduciary\n         relationship with another and but for such capacity, such\n         information would not have been provided to that authority,\n         would normally need to be protected and would not be open to\n         disclosure keeping the higher standards of integrity and\n         confidentiality of such relationship. Such exemption would be\n         available to such authority or department.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41868\" id=\"span_40\">22. The expression &quot;public interest&quot; has to be understood in its\n         true connotation so as to give complete meaning to the relevant\n         provisions of the Act. The expression &quot;public interest&quot; must be\n         viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions so as to justify\n         denial of a statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its\n         common parlance, the expression &quot;public interest&quot;, like &quot;public\n         purpose&quot;, is not capable of any precise definition. It does not\n         have a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the\n         statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with time and\n         state of society and its needs (<a href=\"/doc/41868/\" id=\"a_101\">State of Bihar v. Kameshwar\n         Singh</a> [AIR 1952 SC 252] ). It also means the general welfare\n         of the public that warrants recognition and protection;\n         something in which the public as a whole has a stake [Black&#x27;s\n         Law Dictionary (8th Edn.)].</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">         23. The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities\n         objectively and the consequences of such disclosure have to be\n         weighed with regard to the circumstances of a given case. The\n         decision has to be based on objective satisfaction recorded for\n         ensuring that larger public interest outweighs unwarranted\n         invasion of privacy or other factors stated in the provision.\n         Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\n         required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information\n         may come to knowledge of the authority as a result of\n         disclosure by others who give that information in confidence\n         and with complete faith, integrity and fidelity.
