It also claims to have\nlong standing relationships and networking arrangements to provide the most comprehensive,\nmacro and micro reports of the respective industries. The defendant No.1 owns and operates at\nleast   three    websites,     viz.,   www.indianpetro.com,     www.energylineindia.com       and\nwww.indianfertilizer.com.

The adverse\nimpact on publication could also be existing Sale and Purchase agreements getting\nbreached/terminated (if there are disclosures about that agreement), the plaintiff facing claims\nfor damages, and even on adverse impact on the plaintiff in the stock market. It is contended\nthat any adverse impact on the plaintiff&#x27;s transactions or potential transactions would have an\nadverse chain reaction on other stake -holders in the petroleum sector.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.

Besides, it would be exempted from taxes and other levies of\n       local bodies such as Panchayat and municipalities. Though ensuring export\n       earnings by the units situated in SEZ does not fall in the ambit of the co-\n       developer&#x27;s duty, it is expected to develop infrastructure in SEZ. Thus, of the Rs.20\n       crore expected to be spent on providing common internal roads, security,\n       boundary wall, drains, street lights and gate office for sez, PLL will foot one-\n       fourth of the bill.

The plaintiff says that it would be seriously prejudiced and would suffer irreparable\ninjury if the offending news items are allowed to remain in the suit website. It is claimed that\nthe information contained in the news item reproduced in paragraph A (i) above falls within the\npurview of being &#x27;price sensitive information&#x27; as provided for in SEBI (Prohibition of insider\nTrading) Regulations, 1992 (&quot;SEBI Regulations&quot;); it is speculative in nature and contains\ndisclosures relating to the plaintiff&#x27;s business plans at the present only at the drawing board\nstage, with no certainty about if they would materialize wholly or in part. Such disclosure by\nunauthorized means of such price sensitive information of a publicly listed company could have\na strong bearing on the market behavior of the shares of the company and may affect the\ninterests of lakhs of investors adversely. Under the SEBI Regulations all listed companies are\nrequired to frame and comply with a code of internal procedures and conduct which casts an\nobligation on the plaintiff to protect and prevent the misuse of price sensitive information. In\naddition, any violation of the SEBI Regulations is an offence punishable with ten years\nimprisonment or fine up to Rs.25 crores or both. Further, under <a href=\"/doc/1418099/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 21</a> of the Securities\ncontract <a href=\"/doc/191279184/\" id=\"a_3\">(Regulation) Act, 1956</a> {&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1393639/\" id=\"a_4\">Securities Act</a>&quot;), a company whose securities are listed on a\nrecognized stock exchange has to comply with the listing Agreement of that stock exchange.\nUnder the Listing Agreements that the plaintiff had entered into with the Bombay Stock\nExchange and the National Stock Exchange, (where the plaintiff&#x27;s securities are listed) there is\nan obligation on its part, to inform the respective stock exchanges of any significant business\nplans such as undertaking of new projects, new investments etc., before such information is\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 8\n disclosed to the general public and non compliance is an offence punishable with ten years&#x27;\nimprisonment or fine up to Rs.25 crores or both.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">8.     The information in the news item reproduced in paragraph 5 A(ii) above, says the\nplaintiff, pertains to confidential negotiations between the plaintiff and certain Exxon Mobil\ncompanies which are covered by a Confidentiality agreement, in terms of which a party cannot\nmake, or cause to be made any statement to a third party, the public or media regarding the\noccurrence or the substance of any communications, discussions or negotiations without the\nprior agreement in writing of others. Parties cannot even use or permit use of the name of the\nothers or any of their affiliates in any publication, advertisement or other disclosure. The\nunauthorized publication of this offending news item by the defendants has the potential of\nbeing treated by the other parties to the confidentiality Agreement as a material breach\ncommitted by the plaintiff resulting in the other party&#x27;s potential suspending on-going\nnegotiations or altogether walking out of the negotiations. The consequence of this would be\ndisastrous for the plaintiff both in terms of loss of business and loss of reputation. The plaintiff\nclaims to have suffered embarrassment and the threat of potential default due to the\nunauthorized publication of the offending news items. It is alleged that Exxon Mobil companies\nhave viewed it as a breach of the confidentiality agreement by the plaintiff and sought its\nexplanation, which has been given. However, such embarrassment could have been well\navoided if the defendants had acted with some sense of responsibility. The plaintiff is not in a\nposition to give the details or produce documents in this regard as it claims to be bound by the\nconfidentiality clauses; it undertakes to produce it for the perusal of this Court if and when\ndirected to do so. It is contended that there are media reports that for a significant amount of\nthe LNG that the plaintiff is presently negotiating, the seller has been in parallel negotiations\nwith LNG buyers in China, Korea and Japan. In such situations unauthorized disclosure and\npublication of critical information relating to price, quantity, etc., of the plaintiff&#x27;s ongoing\nnegotiations with the LNG sellers gives its competitors an unfair advantage as they are at all\ntimes aware of confidential information. The disclosure of such information can mean that the\nplaintiff and in turn other oil and gas industry stakeholders may lose their share of LNG which\nwould result in adverse impact on gas and energy consumers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 9\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\"> 9.     The news item reproduced in paragraph 5-A (iii) above which states that the plaintiff has\nselected ship owners, to be issued bid documents is incorrect, according to the plaintiff. The\ntime charter contract to be awarded is of significant commercial value. Hence, the matter of\nselection of ship-owners is highly confidential and a closely guarded secret till the plaintiff&#x27;s\nboard of directors decides this finally, based on an evaluation of the recommendations of a\ncommittee appointed by it. The said news item was misleading at the time it was published by\nthe defendants on the suit website. The true position was that the committee looking into the\nmatter had only made its preliminary recommendations, which could be subject to variation\nfrom what had been reported and published on the website. There was always a possibility that\ntill the formal approval was given by the plaintiff&#x27;s Board some of the ship-owners (whose\nnames were listed on the suit website) might have been excluded and other ship owners\nincluded. Such unauthorized and premature publication of confidential information put the\nplaintiff in an awkward position as it could end up facing unnecessary litigation, if the Board&#x27;s\ndecision on the ship owners was at variance with the said news item.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">10.    The plaintiff says that the information contained in the news item reproduced in\nparagraph 5-B above, in as much as it suggests that the plaintiff resisted directions/ orders of\nthe Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (hereafter referred to as &#x27;PMO&quot;), is false and misleading. The news\nitem sensationalized confidential discussions involving the plaintiff and other stakeholders\nwhere participants merely expressed divergent views on the pros and cons of implementing a\nPMO directive. The issue was not finally decided; the plaintiff had not yet taken a definite\nstance on the matter. The said report also affected the plaintiff adversely as it conveyed the\nimpression that the plaintiff did not respect the PMO, which is malicious.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11.    It is claimed that information contained in the news item reproduced in paragraph 5-C\nand D above are also incorrect and misleading and were published with the sole intention of\ncausing sensation by reporting confidential internal discussions of the plaintiff involving its fund\nand cash flows. The defendants have twisted internal discussions as conflicting views portraying\nthat there is in-fighting within the plaintiff Company. As the defendants could not have\npublished such confidential issues, even if the information published was accurate, till they had\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                         Page 10\n been made available in the public domain, it goes without saying publishing of inaccurate\ninformation cannot be permitted at any cost. Further, this is also price sensitive information\nand therefore there is an obligation on the plaintiff to ensure that it is not leaked to the general\npublic, before formal decisions were taken in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">12.    The plaintiff, in view of their allegations, seeks permanent injunction to restrain the\ndefendants\n\nThe Defence\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">13.    In their written statement, the defendants contend that the first Defendant had been\nregularly publishing news and information regarding four public sector undertakings who own\n50% of the equity of the plaintiff, namely GAIL (India) Limited Oil and Natural Gas Corporation\nLtd., Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and none of\nthem ever complained about it. In fact, some of these entities are in the very business that the\nplaintiff is involved in. Defendant No. 1 has been publishing news and views on contractual and\ncommercial negotiations involving import of LNG by some of these entities without eliciting any\nlegal action or litigation there from. For example, Defendant No.1 has published a total of 1781\nnews articles relating to GAIL India&#x27;s activities concerning LNG. Similarly, there are 837 news\nitems on Indian Oil Corporation and issues relating to LNG. None of those companies ever\nsought legal recourse in respect of such news items. This shows that those companies\nunderstood the principle Freedom of Press to report on commercial matters involving billions of\ndollars of investments of public money in commercial ventures.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">14.    The defendants deny that they are in the habit of publishing confidential information or\nany information which could harm the plaintiff&#x27;s interest, and that of the public. They say that\nthe plaintiff contradicts itself as the &quot;highly confidential&#x27; information about itself could not have\nfallen in the hands of the defendants. It is averred that if, as the plaintiff claims, the information\npublished in the website had such serious repercussions on its ongoing negotiations for multi\nbillion LNG projects, the plaintiff should have kept such information to itself. That the media\nhad access to such information implied either that the information is not confidential or that\nthe plaintiff failed in its duty to its shareholders and business partners to keep such information\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                           Page 11\n from the public. To subsequently blame the media, particularly defendants No.1 &amp; 2 for\nimagined loss of business by publication of so-called confidential information is to make them\nconvenient scapegoats. The defendants say that it will be ironic should a multi-billion dollar\ntransaction be predicated on the mere publication of a news item in a limited subscriber\nwebsite such as that belonging to Defendant No.2 .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">15.    The defendants allege that the plaintiff seems to have made a habit of quoting\nConfidentiality Agreements with LNG suppliers and greater interest of the consumer and public\ngood served by keeping commercial negotiations for procurement of LNG under wraps -\nostensibly on the ground that shrouding such negotiations in total secrecy would lead to either\nan LNG contract being inked or a lower price of LNG - as reason for seeking a permanent\ninjunction against the Defendants from publishing any information without its written consent.\nIt is pertinent to note that an unfettered commercial transaction on import of LNG may not\nalways be in the consumer&#x27;s interest. Even though the plaintiff is a &#x27;Public company&#x27; with public\nand government shareholding, it is still a commercial entity and not a trust or a government\ndepartment. By definition, a commercial entity - however &#x27;public&#x27; it may be or however much\nit is committed to public good- is governed by commercial principles of profit maximization.\nThis is the raison d&#x27;etre of a commercial entity. The interest of its shareholders comes first and\nthen comes the interest of the public or the consumers. Under these circumstances,\ncommercial entities sometimes find it convenient to quote confidentiality agreements and price\nsensitivity&#x27; of information - to deflect, hide or manipulate information and situations. It is the\ntask of the media to ensure objectivity of commercial decision making by fearless and honest\nreporting so that the averment that such decisions are in the greater good of the consumer or\nthe public is indeed followed in principle and spirit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">16.    The defendants state that 130 news items pertaining to the plaintiff were published by\nthem during the period from 11.06.2005 to 26.4.2006. By the yardstick used by the plaintiff,\nquite a few of them could have been defined as &quot;sensitive&quot; or &quot;confidential&quot; yet the plaintiff\ndecided not to take any legal action on their publication. It is stated that the plaintiff has\narbitrarily chosen news items in the period 27.04.06 to 05.05.2005 to claim that sensitive\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                       Page 12\n information is being disseminated. The defendants deny having published any sensitive or any\nconfidential information in the news items under consideration. An analysis of the news items\nin question would itself reveal that there is nothing confidential or sensitive about the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">17.     The defendants say, on information in Para 5 A(i) above, that the news item published\non 27.4.2006 PLL to co-devlop Kochi SEZ, CPT to be developer. A reading of this would reveal\nthat there is actually promotional in nature and cannot in any way adversely affect the\nplaintiff&#x27;s business.

There is nothing confidential about this.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">18.     The defendants say, about the news item described in para 5A . (ii) above, viz. &quot;LNG\nsourcing for Kochi terminal : PLL Exxon Mobil and offtakers agree on various issues but pricing\nremains a problem&quot; that a similar news item was published in BUSINESS LINE which is a part of\nthe Hindu Group of News papers and media on 3rd May 2000; yet the plaintiff did not react\naction against that publication. That a widely read newspaper like &quot;BUSINESS LINE&quot; had access\nto this information showed that there was nothing confidential about It.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">19.     The defendants contend, about the news item described in Para 5A.(iii) above, `:LNG\ntransportation : PLL shortlists ship owners, moots special purpose company&quot; that a similar news\nitem was published in BUSINESS LINE and media on 25th May 2006 but the plaintiff did not take\nany action against the publications. In fact, in the 21st June, 2006 issue of the Hindustan Times a\nnews item pertaining to shipping of LNG by the plaintiff was published but the plaintiff did not\ninitiate any legal proceedings against the newspaper. This news item was published after the\nfiling of the preset suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">20.

Again no legal action of any kind was taken against the news paper by the\nplaintiff. The publication of this new item in PROJECT MONITOR shows that there was nothing\nconfidential about the information. As regards the news item in Para 5 C, dated 3.5.2006 viz.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 13\n &quot;PLL plans $ 100 million FCCB: ADB bailout in case of redemption pressure&quot; the defendants\ndeny that it is sensational in nature.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">21.    According to the defendants, the article dated 05.05.2006 (Para 5 D) &quot;PLL&#x27;s $ 100 million\nFCCB Salient points&quot; was found news worthy by the entire business press. The issuance of\nforeign currency convertible bonds was covered on 4th May 2006 in three major Business news\npapers namely business line which as mentioned earlier is a part of &quot;The Hindu Group&quot; of new\npapers, and &quot;Economic Times&quot; which is a part of the Times of India Group of news papers and\nalso in Financial Express which is the part of the (Express group of news papers). These clearly\nshowed that the management of the plaintiff chose and singled out the defendants and not\nother bigger organizations. In fact, by its very nature the issuance of foreign currency\nconvertible bonds falls within the realm of common commercial news.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">22. During the pendency of the suit, this court had issued an ex-parte injunction against the\ndefendants, restraining them from publishing anything pertaining to the plaintiff without its\nconsent. After pleadings were complete, the parties agreed that the suit and the pending\napplications could be heard on the merits, without the need to record oral evidence, since\npublication of the articles were not controverted facts; the defendants contested the plaintiff&#x27;s\nright to maintain the suit, and claim the injunctions it does.

Privacy is defined variously as &quot;an autonomy or control over the intimacies of personal\nidentity&quot; (Gerety, in &quot;Redefining Privacy&quot;, (1977) 12 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 233, 284-91);\nLaurence H.

In one of the earliest formulations, on the\nissue, it was thus held that the right to privacy is the &quot;right to be let alone&quot; a phrase coined by\nJustice Brandeis in his memorable dissent, in Olmstead v.

In the last resort, a person&#x27;s\n         house, where he lives with his family, is his &quot;castle&quot;; it is his rampart against\n         encroachment on his personal liberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge,\n         Frankfurter J., in Wolf v.

If physical restraints on a\n         person&#x27;s movements affect his personal liberty, physical encroachments on his\n         private life would affect it in a larger degree. Indeed, nothing is more deleterious\n         to a man&#x27;s physical happiness and health than a calculated interference with his\n         privacy. We would, therefore, define the right of personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> as a\n         right of an individual to be free from restrictions or encroachments on his person,\n         whether those restrictions or encroachments are directly imposed or indirectly\n         brought about by calculated measures.

If the Court does find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\n   fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the compelling State\n   interest test.

Obviously, if the\n   enforcement of morality were held to be a compelling as well as a permissible State\n   interest, the characterization of a claimed right as a fundamental privacy right would\n   be of far less significance. The question whether enforcement of morality is a State\n   interest sufficient to justify the infringement of a fundamental privacy right need not\n   be considered for the purpose of this case and therefore we refuse to enter the\n   controversial thicket whether enforcement of morality is a function of State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">       23. Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any system of limited\n   Government, is protected in part under our Constitution by explicit constitutional\n   guarantees. In the application of the Constitution our contemplation cannot only be\n   of what has been but what may be. Time works changes and brings into existence\n   new conditions. Subtler and far reaching means of invading privacy will make it\n   possible to be heard in the street what is whispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a\n   definition of privacy raises serious questions about the propriety of judicial reliance\n   on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of course, privacy primarily concerns\n   the individual. It therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The\n   most serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems of\n   defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in autonomy must also\n   be placed in the context of other rights and values.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">       24. Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal intimacies of\n   the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child rearing. This\n   catalogue approach to the question is obviously not as instructive as it does not give\n   analytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of privacy. Perhaps,\n   the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying principle underlying the concept\n   has been the assertion that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in\n   the concept of ordered liberty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">        25. Rights and freedoms of citizens are set forth in the Constitution in order to\n   guarantee that the individual, his personality, and those things stamped with his\n   personality shall be free from official interference except where a reasonable basis\n   for intrusion exists. &quot;Liberty against Government&quot; a phrase coined by Professor\n   Corwin expresses this idea forcefully. In this sense, many of the fundamental rights of\n   citizens can be described as contributing to the right to privacy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">   26. As Ely says:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">          &quot;There is nothing to prevent one from using the word &#x27;privacy&#x27; to mean the\n      freedom to live one&#x27;s life without governmental interference. But the Court\n      obviously does not so use the term. Nor could it, for such a right is at stake in\n      every case.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">   27. There are two possible theories for protecting privacy of home. The first is that\n   activities in the home harm others only to the extent that they cause offence\n   resulting from the mere thought that individuals might be engaging in such activities\n   and that such &quot;harm&quot; is not constitutionally protectible by the State. The second is\n   that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they can be free from societal\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                         Page 18\n       control. The importance of such a sanctuary is that individuals can drop the mask,\n      desist for a while from projecting on the world the image they want to be accepted\n      as themselves, an image that may reflect the values of their peers rather than the\n      realities of their natures.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">          28. The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process\n      of case-by-case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal\n      liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of\n      speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one\n      can characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think that the right is absolute.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">30.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_23\">R. Rajagopal</a> (supra) the Supreme Court had to consider the tension and relationship\nbetween freedom of the press and the right to privacy of citizens. One &quot;Auto&quot; Shankar,\nsentenced to death for committing six murders, chronicled his life, through a biography and\nwanted it to be published in a Tamil weekly magazine. In some parts of the work, he alleged his\nproximity with several Indian Administrative Serivice and other high ranking officers, stating\nthat they were his partners in crime. The Court revisited the law of privacy, and summarized the\nprinciples, in the following manner:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">             &quot;22. We may now consider whether the State or its officials have the\n         authority in law to impose a prior restraint upon publication of material\n         defamatory of the State or of the officials, as the case may be? We think not. No\n         law empowering them to do so is brought to our notice. As observed in New York\n         Times v. United States, popularly known as the Pentagon papers case, &quot;any\n         system of prior restraints of (freedom of) expression comes to this Court bearing\n         a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity&quot; and that in such cases,\n         the Government &quot;carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the\n         imposition of such a restraint&quot;. We must accordingly hold that no such prior\n         restraint or prohibition of publication can be imposed by the respondents upon\n         the proposed publication of the alleged autobiography of &quot;Auto Shankar&quot; by the\n         petitioners. This cannot be done either by the State or by its officials. In other\n         words, neither the Government nor the officials who apprehend that they may be\n         defamed, have the right to impose a prior restraint upon the publication of the\n         alleged autobiography of Auto Shankar. The remedy of public officials/public\n         figures, if any, will arise only after the publication and will be governed by the\n         principles indicated herein.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">         xxxxxx                                         xxxxxxxxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">         26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">             (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to\n         the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                            Page 19\n       has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation,\n      motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters. None can\n      publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent -- whether\n      truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be\n      violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an\n      action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily\n      thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n          (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\n      concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is\n      based upon public records including court records. This is for the reason that once\n      a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n      subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media\n      among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency\n      [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is\n      the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not\n      further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident being\n      publicised in press/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">          (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above -- indeed, this is not\n      an exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious,\n      right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply\n      not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of\n      their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts and\n      statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the publication\n      was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n      would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that\n      he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\n      prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved\n      to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would\n      have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in\n      matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the\n      same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs\n      no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for\n      contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures protected as their privileges\n      are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_26\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_27\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\n      exceptions to this rule.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">          (4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and\n      institutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain\n      a suit for damages for defaming them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">         (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_28\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or\n      any similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not bind the\n      press or media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">         (6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to\n      impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                       Page 20\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_8\">31.    The latest in the series of judgments of the Supreme Court was <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_29\">District Registrar and\nCollector v. Canara Bank</a>,(2005) 1 SCC 496. Recollecting the opinions in its previous judgments,\nthe court applied the right of privacy, in considering search and seizure provisions. The Andhra\nPradesh amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_30\">Stamp Act, 1899</a> was assailed inter alia as permitting any person to\n&quot;enter upon any premises&quot;, public or private, and seize and impound documents.

The above safeguards must\n       necessarily be read into the provision relating to search and inspection and\n       seizure so as to save it from any unconstitutionality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">32.    What is immediately apparent to the court is that the right to privacy, as shaped\nthrough judgments of the Supreme Court, from Kharak Singh onwards, were all in the context\nof individual rights. The clearest articulation of this may be seen in Justice Mathew&#x27;s perceptive\nobservations that the right enfolded &quot;personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage,\nmotherhood, procreation and child-bearing.&quot;          This articulation was taken further in the\nsummary, of the law in Rajgopal, where the court declared that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">       &quot;The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the\n       citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a\n       right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation,\n       motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters. None can\n       publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent -- whether\n       truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_9\">While on the subject, a slightly discordant note appears to have been struck, even at the time\nRajgopal was being considered; thus, in People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_32\">Civil Liberties v. Union of India</a>\n(1997) 1 SCC 301, the legality of &quot;telephone-tapping&quot; was considered. Even after conceding that\ntelephone conversations could be confidential and intimate in character, and declaring that\n\n\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                           Page 21\n such telephone tapping was, unless sanctioned through legislation, unconstitutional, the Court\nreasoned that the right to privacy was &quot;too broad and moralistic&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">33.    The second aspect which stares one at the face, in all the judgments, is that the right to\nprivacy was asserted in the context of the state&#x27;s intrusive behavior; Kharak Singh, and Gobind\nwere judgments in the context of surveillance regulations; Rajgopal was an individual&#x27;s plea\nagainst the attempt by the State and public officials to muffle his right to air his views and\nexperiences. None of the judgments were premised on assertion of privacy rights by artificial\nentities, against individual, non-state actors. One more aspect also is that unlike in other parts\nof the world, the right to privacy here is not rooted in any specific statute, which poses\nproblems, as would be apparent in this case itself.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_10\">34.    Now, it is well settled that while certain fundamental rights like <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 14</a> are available\nto artificial or juristic personalities, like companies, <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 19</a> rights are however, unavailable;\nshareholders or directors can approach the court for relief, if they can establish that the\nimpugned action impairs their rights (See R.C. Cooper -v- Union of India; 1970 (2) SCC 248;\n<a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_35\">Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. v. Union of India</a>, (1972) 2 SCC 788). In this background, what has to be\nseen is whether a juristic, or artificial entity such as a corporation or company, can assert right\nto privacy, which intrinsically has been seen as an essential trait of human personhood.\nThe position in Australia</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">35.    There are no Indian cases on the subject. However, a 2001 decision of the Australian\nHigh Court is illuminative on the question. Thus, in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v.\nLenah Game Meats Pty Ltd 2001 HCA 63, the respondent, Lenah Game Meat, an incorporated\ncompany, sought a restraint against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from distributing,\npublishing, copying or broadcasting a video tape or video tapes filmed by a trespasser or\ntrespassers showing [Lenah&#x27;s] brush tail possum processing facility at Tasmania. The main\nground urged for the action was that Lenah&#x27;s right to privacy would be breached. The full court\nof the Supreme Court of Tasmania, granted the injunction; ABC appealed; the High Court of\nAustralia allowed the appeal. Chief Justice Gleeson, in his judgment, said that:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                         Page 22\n       &quot;There is no bright line which can be drawn between what is private and what is\n      not. Use of the term &quot;public&quot; is often a convenient method of contrast, but there\n      is a large area in between what is necessarily public and what is necessarily\n      private. An activity is not private simply because it is not done in public. It does\n      not suffice to make an act private that, because it occurs on private property, it\n      has such measure of protection from the public gaze as the characteristics of the\n      property, the nature of the activity, the locality, and the disposition of the\n      property owner combine to afford. Certain kinds of information about a person,\n      such as information relating to health, personal relationships, or finances, may\n      be easy to identify as private; as may certain kinds of activity, which a reasonable\n      person, applying contemporary standards of morals and behaviour, would\n      understand to be meant to be unobserved. The requirement that disclosure or\n      observation of information or conduct would be highly offensive to a reasonable\n      person of ordinary sensibilities is in many circumstances a useful practical test of\n      what is private.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      43 It is unnecessary, for present purposes, to enter upon the question of whether,\n      and in what circumstances, a corporation may invoke privacy. United Kingdom\n      legislation recognises the possibility. Some forms of corporate activity are\n      private. For example, neither members of the public, nor even shareholders, are\n      ordinarily entitled to attend directors&#x27; meetings. And, as at present advised, I see\n      no reason why some internal corporate communications are any less private than\n      those of a partnership or an individual. However, the foundation of much of what\n      is protected, where rights of privacy, as distinct from rights of property, are\n      acknowledged, is human dignity. This may be incongruous when applied to a\n      corporation. The outcome of the present case would not be materially different if\n      the respondent were an individual or a partnership, rather than a corporation.\n      The problem for the respondent is that the activities secretly observed and filmed\n      were not relevantly private. Of course, the premises on which those activities\n      took place were private in a proprietorial sense. And, by virtue of its proprietary\n      right to exclusive possession of the premises, the respondent had the capacity\n      (subject to the possibility of trespass or other surveillance) to grant or refuse\n      permission to anyone who wanted to observe, and record, its operations. The\n      same can be said of any landowner, but it does not make everything that the\n      owner does on the land a private act. Nor does an act become private simply\n      because the owner of land would prefer that it were unobserved. The reasons for\n      such preference might be personal, or financial. They might be good or bad. An\n      owner of land does not have to justify refusal of entry to a member of the public,\n      or of the press. The right to choose who may enter, and who will be excluded, is\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                      Page 23\n        an aspect of ownership. It may mean that a person who enters without\n       permission is a trespasser; but that does not mean that every activity observed by\n       the trespasser is private.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">Gummow, J rested his conclusions on the following reasoning:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">       &quot;Nothing in Douglas suggests that the right to privacy which their Lordships\n       contemplate is enjoyed other than by natural persons. Further, the necessarily\n       tentative consideration of the topic in that case assumes rather than explains\n       what &quot;privacy&quot; comprehends and what would amount to a tortuous invasion of\n       it. The difficulties in obtaining in this field something approaching definition\n       rather than abstracted generalisation have been recognised for some time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">       117     In submissions, it was suggested that the present position in New\n       Zealand could provide no guidance and that this was because the outcome in the\n       decided cases had been controlled by statute, the Privacy Act 1993 (NZ).\n       However, that law has a limited scope and does not confer an enforceable cause\n       of action for damages (s 11(2)). There are decisions of the High Court of New\n       Zealand, at the interlocutory level, which do not turn upon the statute and which\n       favour the development of a tort of breach of privacy in respect of public\n       disclosure of true private facts, where the disclosure would be highly offensive\n       and objectionable to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities. But there\n       appears to be no decision to that effect at trial and no discussion of the subject\n       by the Court of Appeal. In the interlocutory decisions, the plaintiffs were natural\n       persons.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">Kirby, J, fascinatingly, referred to judgments from various countries, including the judgment of\nthe Indian Supreme Court in Gobind (footnote 258) and reasoned that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">       &quot;Privacy and corporations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">       The fact that the respondent is a corporation is a further reason for delaying a\n       response to this question.

It does not appear to apply to a corporation or agency of\n       government260.

It would also be useful to recollect that the right to privacy was seen as a &quot;penumbral&quot;\nthough un-enumerated right, in the United States (the existence of such &quot;unenumerated&quot; or\n&quot;penumbral&quot; or residual rights was rejected in Maneka Gandhi -V.- Union of India AIR 1978 SC\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">597). The growth of that branch of law has been in the context of individuals&#x27; claims for privacy,\nagainst unwarranted state action or intrusion, be it in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 US 479, 486\n(1965), or Katz v. United States, 389 US 347 (1967); Terry v. Ohio, 392 US 1 (1968); Stanley v.\nGeorgia, 394 US 557 (1969), the celebrated Jane Roe v. Henry Wade 410 US 113 (1973).\nRecently, privacy rights were also affirmed in declaring that statutes that criminalized same sex\nrelationships were Unconstitutional : Lawrence V. Texas 539 US 558 (2003).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">38.    In view of the above discussion, it is held that the present suit, so far as it is founded on\na claim for breach of the plaintiff&#x27;s right to privacy, as part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia, is not maintainable. Neither is the plaintiff a person, entitled to the right to life and\nconcomitant attributes of that right -which includes the right to privacy- nor is such right,\nassuming it to be applicable to companies and corporations, available against non-state\nindividuals, or &quot;actors&quot;. This issue is, accordingly answered against the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">Issue No.2 : Whether the plantiff proves that it can maintain the Suit on ground of entitlement\nto confidentiality of information;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_59\">39.    The plaintiff argues that the information published by the defendants is &quot;Price Sensitive\nInformation&quot; under the SEBI regulations quoted in an earlier part of the judgment. It is argued\nmore importantly that confidentiality negotiations between the plaintiff and Exxon Mobil\nCompany entities are covered by confidentiality agreement under which parties cannot make\ndisclosures to the media in regard to discussions or negotiations without prior agreement in\nwriting, to others. Such disclosure cannot even be permitted by third parties after\nadvertisements. It is claimed that such unauthorized publication of offending news items have\nthe &quot;potential of being treated to the other parties&quot; to the confidentiality agreement. The\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                         Page 26\n plaintiff argues having suffered embarrassment and threat of default due to unauthorized\npublication of offending news items which could have been avoided had it not been disclosed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">40.    It is argued that the right to maintain the present Suit to prevent breach of an\nobligation, even implicit in its terms, flows from <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 9</a> of CPC read with <a href=\"/doc/1474155/\" id=\"a_39\">Sections 38</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1558146/\" id=\"a_40\">39</a>\nof Specific Relief Act. It is submitted that the right to disclose to what is essentially private and\nconfidential information has to be subservient to the interest of the person who is entitled to\nmaintain the confidentiality of that news or information. The plaintiff relies upon judgment of\nthe House of Lords in Campbell v. MGN Limited 2004 (2) All ER 995 to say that there was a duty\nof confidence cast on the defendants not to make disclosure of the plaintiff&#x27;s sensitive\ninformation. It was submitted that Campbell (supra) has now positioned the right to\nconfidentiality as one whereby the concerned party can insist upon imposition of a duty upon a\nperson receiving information which he knows or ought to know, is fairly and reasonably\nregarded as confidential.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"699319\" id=\"span_11\">41.    It is submitted that the defendant&#x27;s claim for unfettered right to publish any information\nwhich he comes across under the garb of freedom of press is not absolute for all time, and in all\ncircumstances. It is claimed that allowing such unimpeded liberty would lead to anarchy; if all\nmanner of information, regardless of its veracity or sensitivity, would be accessible and public,\ndangerous consequences would result. Learned counsel relied upon the judgment in Rai Hari v.\nJai Singh 1996 (6) SCC 466 and the judgment reported as <a href=\"/doc/699319/\" id=\"a_41\">S.M.D. Kiran Pasha v. Govt. of Andhra\nPradesh</a> 1990 (1) SCC 328.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_62\">42.    The defendants submitted that like in the case of privacy, the plaintiff cannot pitch its\nclaim for an absolute right of withholding information that require critical examination by\nmembers of the public. It was argued that the plaintiff has not, in fact, stated what kind of\ninjury ensued or was likely to be caused. He argued that reliance on SEBI (Prohibition of Insider\nTrading) Regulations, 1992 is entirely misleading and misplaced. It is contended that there is\nnothing in those regulations preventing information received by non-corporate entities who\nhave no connection with the concerned company subjected to the regulations, to disclose it. It\nwas argued that in fact, the model rule of conduct listed in Schedule-I to the Regulations casts\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 27\n an obligation only on the employees and the Directors to maintain confidentiality of price-\nsensitive information. Similarly, the Regulations restrict flow of information within certain\nzones, of the corporate structure, to prevent insider trading. There is nothing, contend the\ndefendants, to prevent the press from exercising its right and duty to publish information\nrelating to performance and functioning of institutions that have a wide ranging repercussions\non members of the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">43.    It would therefore, be necessary to explore if there are implied obligations arising in\nlaw, on persons or individuals who come across information or news that is inherently sensitive\nand confidential, not to disclose, and which lead to corresponding right to those entitled to\nguard or protect such information, to maintain civil actions for that purpose. Before a\ndiscussion of the rival contentions on the question of confidentiality, it would be essential to\nset-out the relevant provisions; they are <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 9</a> of CPC, which reads as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">       &quot;9 COURTS TO TRY ALL CIVIL SUITS UNLESS BARRED.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">       The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to\n       try all suits of a civil nature excepting the suits of which their cognizance is either\n       expressly or implied barred.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">       Explanation I : A suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a\n       suit of a civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the\n       decision of questions as to religious rites or ceremonies.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">       Explanation II : For the purpose of this section, it is immaterial whether or not any\n       fees are attached to the office referred to in Explanation 1 or whether or not such\n       office is attached to a particular place.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\"><a href=\"/doc/1474155/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections 38</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1558146/\" id=\"a_44\">39</a> of the Specific Relief Act, read as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">       &quot;38 PERPETUAL INJUNCTION WHEN GRANTED.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">       (1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or referred to by this chapter,\n       a perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of\n       an obligation existing in his favour, whether expressly or by implication.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">       (2) When any such obligation arises from contract, the court shall be guided\n       by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter II.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                              Page 28\n        (3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff&#x27;s right to,\n       or enjoyment of, property, the court may grant a perpetual injunction in the\n       following cases, namely, -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">       (a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff&#x27;;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">       (b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage\n       caused, or likely to be caused, by the invasion;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">       (c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford\n       adequate relief;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">       (d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial\n       proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">       39 MANDATORY INJUNCTIONS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">       When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the\n       performance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court\n       may in its discretion grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of,\n       and also to compel performance of the requisite acts.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_67\">44.    The plaintiff, in the opinion of the Court, has not been able to establish how any\nprovision of SEBI regulations is applicable in this case. Learned counsel did not point out the\ngeneral bar to disclosure of information obtained by the members of the press and the\noverriding public interest in the suppression of its disclosure. Therefore, the argument that\nthere was an obligation upon the plaintiff to maintain confidentiality, which would be breached\nin the event the defendant publishes it after having sourced it on its own initiative, cannot be\naccepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1458789\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1161831\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"321104\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1996908\" id=\"span_15\">45.    The second limb of confidentiality question is whether there is an implicit duty cast\nupon a person, who comes by confidential information, and wishes to disclose it. There cannot\nbe any serious dispute that actions based on civil causes, not otherwise barred by statute -\neither expressly or by implication, can be brought by Courts in India. Under <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 9</a> of CPC\n(<a href=\"/doc/1996908/\" id=\"a_46\">Dhulabhai v. State of M.

Although, textually, <a href=\"/doc/1558146/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 39</a> talks of mandatory injunction\nand does not advert to statute based rights, it speaks of such remedy being available to\n&quot;prevent the breach of an obligation&quot; existing in favor of the claimant. The last two illustrations\nto the <a href=\"/doc/1474155/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 38</a> suggests that obligations not spelt-out in express terms and not found in\neither contract or statute, but arising out of the relationship or the peculiar conditions, are\nenforceable through injunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">47.    The earliest decision on what can be the obligation to maintain confidentiality was spelt-\nout in Prince Albert 1849 41 ER 1171. The approach of Courts was summarized, concerning the\ncommercial secrets of the Courts in England as regards this aspect was discussed in Duchess of\nArgyll v. Duke of Argyll 1967 Ch 302, where the Court applied the principle that there is an\nobligation to maintain confidentiality in respect of domestic secrets as those passing between\nhusband and wife during their marriage. The Court recognized that a wife could obtain restraint\norder against the husband from communicating such secrets. It was held that a contract or\nobligation could not be implied in such circumstances and breach of contract or trust or faith\ncould arise independently of any right of privacy or contract and that the Court in exercise of\nequitable jurisdiction would restrain breach of confidence independently of any right, at law. In\nFraser v. Evans 1969 (1) QB 349, the extension of the doctrine of confidence beyond\ncommercial secrets was recognized. Later in Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Limited [1969] RPC\n41; Megarry, J, after reviewing the previous judgments set-out the requirements necessary for\nan action based on breach of confidence to succeed; it was held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">       &quot;In my judgment, three elements are normally required, if, apart from contract, a\n       case of breach of confidence is to succeed. First, the information, in the words of\n       Lord Green M.R., &#x27;must have the necessary quality of confidence about it.\n       Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances meriting\n       an application of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorized use of that\n       information to the detriment of the party communicating it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">48.    In Attorney General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd. (No. 2) 1990 (1) AC 109, Lord Goff,\nextending the boundaries of the obligation to maintain confidentiality, with the corresponding\n\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 30\n right to ensure its protection from the traditionally recognized contract-status confines, stated\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">        &quot;I realize that, in vast majority of cases, in particular those concerned with trade\n        secrets, the duty of confidence will arise from a transaction or relationship\n        between the parties, often a contract, in which event the duty may arise by\n        reason of either an express or an implied term of that contract. It is in such cases\n        as these that the expressions &quot;confider&quot; and &quot;confidant&quot; are perhaps most aptly\n        employed. But it is well-settled that a duty of confidence may arise in equity\n        independently of such cases; and I have expressed the circumstances in which the\n        duty arises in broad terms, not merely to embrace those cases where a third\n        party receives information from a person who is under a duty of confidence in\n        respect of it, knowing that it has been disclosed by that person to him in breach\n        of his duty of confidence, but also to include certain situations, beloved of law\n        teachers, where an obviously confidential document is wafted by an electric fan\n        out of a window into a crowded street, or where an obviously confidential\n        document, such as a private diary, is dropped in a public place, and is then picked\n        up by a passer-by. I also have in mind the situations where secrets of importance\n        to national security come into possession of members of the public...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">46.     In Campbell&#x27;s case (supra), the Court of Appeal in England had reversed the Trial Court&#x27;s\ninterim injunction, sought by the plaintiff, a well-known international model. The claim was\nbased on both breach of privacy and confidentiality. The defendant had published photographs\nand particulars about her drug-rehabilitative treatment. The appeal was allowed; the House of\nLords outlined the law, which may be discerned in the following three passages; the first, by\nLord Nicholls; the second, by Lord Hoffman and the third, by Lord Hope:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">        &quot;13. The common law or, more precisely, courts of equity have long afforded\n        protection to the wrongful use of private information by means of the cause of\n        action which became known as breach of confidence. A breach of confidence was\n        restrained as a form of unconscionable conduct, akin to a breach of trust. Today\n        this nomenclature is misleading. The breach of confidence label harks back to the\n        time when the cause of action was based on improper use of information\n        disclosed by one person to another in confidence. To attract protection the\n        information had to be of a confidential nature. But the gist of the cause of action\n        was that information of this character had been disclosed by one person to\n        another in circumstances &#x27;importing an obligation of confidence&#x27; even though no\n        contract of non-disclosure existed: see the classic exposition of Megarry.J. in Coco\n        v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41, 47-48. The confidence referred to in\n        the phrase &#x27;breach of confidence&#x27; was the confidence arising out of a confidential\n        relationship.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 31\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">       14.      This cause of action has now firmly shaken off the limiting constraint of\n      the need for an initial confidential relationship. In doing so it has changed its\n      nature. In this country this development was recognized clearly in the judgment\n      of Lord Goff of Chieveley in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2)\n      *1990+ 1 AC 109, 281. Now the law imposes &#x27;a duty of confidence&#x27; whenever a\n      person receives information he knows or ought to know is fairly and reasonably\n      to be regarded as confidential. Even this formulation is awkward. The continuing\n      use of the phrase &#x27;duty of confidence&#x27; and the description of the information as\n      &#x27;confidential&#x27; is not altogether comfortable. Information about an individual&#x27;s\n      private life would not, in ordinary usage, be called &#x27;confidential&#x27;. The more\n      natural description today is that such information is private. The essence of the\n      tort is better encapsulated now as misuse of private information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">      xxxxxxxxxx                            xxxxxxxxx                     xxxxxxxxxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">      46.     In recent years, however, there have been two developments of the law of\n      confidence, typical of the capacity of the common law to adapt itself to the needs\n      of contemporary life. One has been an acknowledgement of the artificiality of\n      distinguishing between confidential information obtained through the violation\n      of a confidential relationship and similar information obtained in some other\n      way. The second has been the acceptance, under the influence of human rights\n      instruments such as <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_54\">article 8</a> of the European Convention, of the privacy of\n      personal information as something worthy of protection in its own right.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">      47.     The first development is generally associated with the speech of Lord Goff\n      of Chieveley in Attorney-General v General Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1990] 1 AC\n      109, 281, where he gave, as illustrations of cases in which it would be illogical to\n      insist upon violation of a confidential relationship, the &quot;obviously confidential\n      document .... wafted by an electric fan out of a window into a crowded street&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">      and the &quot;private diary .... dropped in a public place.&quot; He therefore formulated the\n      principle as being that\n\n                    &quot;a duty of confidence arises when confidential information\n             comes to the knowledge of a person....in circumstances where he\n             has notice, or is held to have agreed, that the information is\n             confidential, with the effect that it would be just in all the\n             circumstances that he should be precluded from disclosing the\n             information to others.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1375804\" id=\"span_16\">48.      This statement of principle, which omits the requirement of a prior\n      confidential relationship, was accepted as representing current English law by the\n      European Court of Human Rights in Earl Spencer v United Kingdom (1998) 25\n      EHRR CD 105 and was applied by the Court of Appeal in <a href=\"/doc/1375804/\" id=\"a_55\">A v B Plc</a> [2003] QB 195,</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">      207. It is now firmly established.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                      Page 32\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">       49.    The second development has been rather more subtle. <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_56\">Until the Human\n      Rights Act</a> 1998 came into force, there was no equivalent in English domestic law\n      of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_57\">article 8</a> the European Convention or the equivalent articles in other\n      international human rights instruments which guarantee rights of privacy. So the\n      courts of the United Kingdom did not have to decide what such guarantees\n      meant. Even now that the equivalent of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_58\">article 8</a> has been enacted as part of\n      English law, it is not directly concerned with the protection of privacy against\n      private persons or corporations. It is, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1773715/\" id=\"a_59\">section 6</a> of the 1998 Act, a\n      guarantee of privacy only against public authorities. Although the Convention, as\n      an international instrument, may impose upon the United Kingdom an obligation\n      to take some steps (whether by statute or otherwise) to protect rights of privacy\n      against invasion by private individuals, it does not follow that such an obligation\n      would have any counterpart in domestic law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">      50.     What human rights law has done is to identify private information as\n      something worth protecting as an aspect of human autonomy and dignity. And\n      this recognition has raised inescapably the question of why it should be worth\n      protecting against the state but not against a private person. There may of\n      course be justifications for the publication of private information by private\n      persons which would not be available to the state - I have particularly in mind\n      the position of the media, to which I shall return in a moment - but I can see no\n      logical ground for saying that a person should have less protection against a\n      private individual than he would have against the state for the publication of\n      personal information for which there is no justification. Nor, it appears, have any\n      of the other judges who have considered the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">      51.     The result of these developments has been a shift in the centre of gravity\n      of the action for breach of confidence when it is used as a remedy for the\n      unjustified publication of personal information. It recognizes that the incremental\n      changes to which I have referred do not merely extend the duties arising\n      traditionally from a relationship of trust and confidence to a wider range of\n      people. As Sedley LJ observed in a perceptive passage in his judgment in Douglas\n      v Hello! Ltd [2001] QB 967, 1001, the new approach takes a different view of the\n      underlying value which the law protects. Instead of the cause of action being\n      based upon the duty of good faith applicable to confidential personal information\n      and trade secrets alike, it focuses upon the protection of human autonomy and\n      dignity - the right to control the dissemination of information about one&#x27;s private\n      life and the right to the esteem and respect of other people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"806030\" id=\"span_17\">xxxxxxxxxx                           xxxxxxxxx                     xxxxxxxxxx\n\n      &quot;85. The questions that I have just described seem to me to be essentially\n      questions of fact and degree and not to raise any new issues of principle. As Lord\n      Woolf CJ said in <a href=\"/doc/806030/\" id=\"a_60\">A v B</a> plc [2003] QB 195, 207, paras 11(ix) and (x), the need for\n      the existence of a confidential relationship should not give rise to problems as to\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                     Page 33\n        the law because a duty of confidence will arise whenever the party subject to the\n       duty is in a situation where he knows or ought to know that the other person can\n       reasonably expect his privacy to be protected.</span> The difficulty will be as to the\n       relevant facts, bearing in mind that, if there is an intrusion in a situation where a\n       person can reasonably expect his privacy to be respected, that intrusion will be\n       capable of giving rise to liability unless the intrusion can be justified: see also the\n       exposition in Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1990] 1 AC\n       109, 282 by Lord Goff of Chieveley, where he set out the three limiting principles\n       to the broad general principle that a duty of confidence arises when confidential\n       information comes to the knowledge of a person where he has notice that the\n       information is confidential. The third limiting principle is particularly relevant in\n       this case. This is the principle which may require a court to carry out a balancing\n       operation, weighing the public interest in maintaining confidence about a\n       countervailing public interest favouring disclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"806030\" id=\"span_18\">86.     The language has changed following the coming into operation of the\n       <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_61\">Human Rights Act</a> 1998 and the incorporation into domestic law of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_62\">article 8</a> and\n       <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_63\">article 10</a> of the Convention. We now talk about the right to respect for private\n       life and the countervailing right to freedom of expression. The jurisprudence of\n       the European Court offers important guidance as to how these competing rights\n       ought to be approached and analysed. I doubt whether the result is that the\n       centre of gravity, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann says, has\n       shifted. It seems to me that the balancing exercise to which that guidance is\n       directed is essentially the same exercise, although it is plainly now more carefully\n       focused and more penetrating. As Lord Woolf CJ said in <a href=\"/doc/806030/\" id=\"a_64\">A v B</a> plc [2003] QB 195,\n       202, para 4, new breadth and strength is given to the action for breach of\n       confidence by these articles.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">       On the balance to be struck between the freedom of press or the right of the public to\nbe informed, of matters of general importance, and the right of an individual claiming\nconfidentiality of such information, or privacy, the Court of Appeal in its recent judgment\nreported as HRH Prince of Wales v. Associated Newspapers Limited 2007 (2) All. ER 139, states\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       &quot;*67+ There is an important public interest in the observance of duties of\n       confidence. Those who engage employees, or who enter into other relationships\n       that carry with them a duty of confidence, ought to be able to be confident that\n       they can disclose, without risk of wider publication, information that it is\n       legitimate for them to wish to keep confidential. Before the 1998 Act came into\n       force the circumstances in which the public interest in publication overrode a\n       duty of confidence were very limited. The issue was whether exceptional\n       circumstances justified disregarding the confidentiality that would otherwise\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 34\n        prevail. Today the test is different. It is whether a fetter of the right of freedom of\n       expression is, in the particular circumstances, &#x27;necessary in a democratic society.&#x27;\n       It is a test of proportionality. But a significant element to be weighed in the\n       balance is the importance in a democratic society of upholding duties of\n       confidence that are created between individuals. It is not enough to justify\n       publication that the information in question is a matter of public interest. To take\n       an extreme example, the content of a Budget speech is a matter of great public\n       interest. But if a disloyal typist were to seek to sell a copy to a newspaper in\n       advance of the delivery of the speech in Parliament, there can surely be no doubt\n       that the newspaper would be in breach of duty it is purchased and published the\n       speech.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">       [68] For these reasons, the test to be applied when considering whether it is\n       necessary to restrict freedom of expression in order to prevent disclosure of\n       information received in confidence is not simply whether the information is a\n       matter of public interest but whether, in all the circumstances, it is in the public\n       interest that the duty of confidence should be breached. The court will need to\n       consider whether, having regard to the nature of the information and all the\n       relevant circumstances, it is legitimate for the owner of the information to seek\n       to keep it confidential or whether it is in the public interest that the information\n       should be made public.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">       [69] In applying the test of proportionality, the nature of the relationship that\n       gives rise to the duty of confidentiality may be important. Different views have\n       been expressed as to whether the fact that there is an express contractual\n       obligation of confidence affects the weight to be attached to the duty of\n       confidentiality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">49.    It may be seen from the above discussion, that originally, the law recognized\nrelationships- either through status (marriage) or arising from contract (such as employment,\ncontract for services etc) as imposing duties of confidentiality. The decision in Coco (1969)\nmarked a shift, though imperceptibly, to a possibly wider area or zone. Douglas noted the\nparadigm shift in the perception, with the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_65\">Human Rights Act</a>; even before\nthat, in Attorney General (2) (also called the Spycatcher case, or the Guardian case) the Court\nacknowledged that there could be situations -where a third party (likened to a passerby,\ncoming across sensitive information, wafting from the top of a building, below) being obliged to\nmaintain confidentiality, having regard to the nature and sensitivity of the information. Of\ncourse, in that case, the claim put forward was national security; that was what the court had in\nmind, when the formulation of a broader duty to maintain confidentiality was declared. The\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 35\n stage, was therefore set, where ultimately, in Campbell, these developments were noted, and\nthe Court; best summarized the position in the passage (quoted earlier), which is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">       &quot;The result of these developments has been a shift in the centre of gravity of the\n       action for breach of confidence when it is used as a remedy for the unjustified\n       publication of personal information. It recognizes that the incremental changes\n       to which I have referred do not merely extend the duties arising traditionally from\n       a relationship of trust and confidence to a wider range of people. As Sedley LJ\n       observed in a perceptive passage in his judgment in Douglas v Hello! Ltd [2001]\n       QB 967, 1001, the new approach takes a different view of the underlying value\n       which the law protects.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"806030\" id=\"span_19\">50.    Even while recognizing the wider nature of duty - in the light of the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_66\">Human Rights Act,\n1998</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_67\">Articles 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_68\">10</a> of the European Convention, it was cautioned that the court, in\neach case, where breach of confidentiality, is complained, and even found- has to engage in a\nbalancing process; the factors to be weighed while doing so, were reflected in <a href=\"/doc/806030/\" id=\"a_69\">A v B</a> plc [2003]\nQB 195; the latest judgment in H.R. H. Prince of Wales indicates that the court would look at the\nkind of information, the nature of relationship, etc, and also consider proportionality, while\nweighing whether relief could be given:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">       &quot;The court will need to consider whether, having regard to the nature of the\n       information and all the relevant circumstances, it is legitimate for the owner of\n       the information to seek to keep it confidential or whether it is in the public\n       interest that the information should be made public.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">       ..In applying the test of proportionality, the nature of the relationship that gives\n       rise to the duty of confidentiality may be important.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">51.    Though the reported cases, discussed above, all dealt with individual right, to\nconfidentiality of private information (Duchess of Argyll; Frazer; Douglas; Campbell and H.R. H.\nPrince of Wales) yet, the formulations consciously approved in the Guardian, and Campbell,\nembrace a wider zone of confidentiality, that can possibly be asserted. For instance,\nprofessional records of doctors regarding treatment of patients, ailments of individuals,\nparticulars, statements of witnesses deposing in investigations into certain types of crimes,\nparticulars of even accused who are facing investigative processes, details victims of heinous\nassaults and crimes, etc, may, be construed as confidential information, which, if revealed, may\nhave untoward consequences, casting a corresponding duty on the person who gets such\ninformation - either through effort, or unwittingly, not to reveal it. Similarly, in the cases of\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                       Page 36\n corporations and businesses, there could be legitimate concerns about its internal processes\nand trade secrets, marketing strategies which are in their nascent stages, pricing policies and so\non, which, if prematurely made public, could result in irreversible, and unknown commercial\nconsequences. However, what should be the approach of the court when the aggrieved party\napproaches it for relief, would depend on the facts of each case, the nature of the information,\nthe corresponding content of the duty, and the balancing exercise to be carried out. It is held,\ntherefore, that even though the plaintiff cannot rely on privacy, its suit is maintainable, as it can\nassert confidentiality in its information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">Issue No.3 If the answer to Issue No. 2 is in the affirmative, does the plaintiff prove its\nentitlement to injunction sought for in this case .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_88\">52.    As noted earlier, the plaintiff is aggrieved by the publication of three news items on\n27.04.2006; one news item on 28.04.2006; one news item on 03.05.2006 and the last item on\n05.05.2006. The plaintiff&#x27;s concern in these is that the offending publications seriously\nprejudices it and that information would be construed as violating the mandate of SEBI\nregulations. The plaintiff contends next that the information is speculative as it concerns\nproposals at the &quot;drawing-board stage&quot; which may or may not mature. The third serious\nobjection is that the plaintiff is engaged in sensitive negotiations with overseas gas suppliers\nand that the information is bound to seriously prejudice these negotiations, particularly, the\nconfidentiality agreed by it. It is lastly contended that the news item alleging that the plaintiff\nresisted a PMO directive, depicted it in an unfavorable light even though in reality, the subject\nmatter was at the discussion level.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">53.    The defendants, on the other hand, contend that none of the information in the news\nitems are sensitive; it is contended that there is no particulars or cost-sensitive information are\nrevealed nor that the disclosure of Exxon Mobil as being in negotiation with plaintiff or the fact\nthat six shipping companies were shortlisted in a pre-qualification exercise, was sensitive and\nconfidential that public interest demands a &quot;gag&quot; order. It is submitted that the news item of\n28.04.2006 disclosed what was a fact, namely that the directives of PMO stating that bulk of\nthe LNG imported in Cochin was to be sent to NTPC, was resisted. It was submitted that so far\nas the news item on the issue of US $ 100 million convertible bonds is concerned, there was\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 37\n nothing sensitive or confidential about it as later events disclosed and even otherwise, most of\nthe information placed on the website was eventually picked-up in the mainstream media and\npublication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">54.    The defendants argue that granting relief of the kind sought in this case would amount\nto permanently gagging them thus effectively stifling and extinguishing the Right to Freedom of\nPress guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. It was submitted that what\neven the legislature of a State or Parliament cannot do, i.e. make a law prohibiting publication\nof information, in a blanket manner is achieved through the device of an injunction order. The\ndefendants argue that the existence of even the interim injunction each day has resulted in\nserious prejudice to their right to freedom of Press and that the Court should vacate the order.\nIt was argued that the Courts world over have recognized that free flow of information and\nideas is vital for the existence of a democratic society and pre-publication injunctions should\nordinarily, if ever, be resorted to only in the rarest of circumstances. It was submitted that it is\nonly in matters of security of the State or where the plaintiff would demonstrably be shown to\nbe prejudiced by pre-mature disclosure of information that the Courts can legitimately interfere\npublication, through an injunction order. It was contended that in the present case, the plaintiff\nhas been unable to demonstrate even prima facie how such an irreparable harm or prejudice\nwould be caused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_91\">55.    It was contended that the plaintiff is as much a public institution as any other Public\nSector Undertaking. It is virtually a monopoly engaged in importation of gas which is later\ndistributed for various purposes. Its share-holding pattern also reflects this domination; 50%\nstake is owned by the Central Government Public Sector Undertakings. It was argued that\nintentionally the share holding was not kept at 51% so that the plaintiff could be beyond the\npale of judicial review. It was argued that the processes by which the plaintiff engaged in its\nfunctions, had a vital impact on the consumers and the prices they would ultimately have to\npay for the products imported. Therefore, there was a greater counterveiling public interest in\ndisclosure of the information regarding the plaintiff&#x27;s business and functions. If injuncted, the\npublication, which has a legitimate right to scrutinize the plaintiff, (to assess its effectiveness),\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 38\n and disseminate its views to the public, would be deprived of its valuable rights, to do so. That\nwould be subversive of the media&#x27;s right to free speech.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"851308\" id=\"span_20\">56.    In the previous section dealing with the right of an individual or a Corporation to\nmaintain a civil action for breach of confidentiality, this Court had discerned the trend of law,\nparticularly, in England. During the course of the discussion, the Court noted that right from\nGuardian Newspapers [(2) 1990] down to HRH Prince of Wales [2007], the Courts had carefully\nadvocated a nuanced approach to balance different interests. Thus, in <a href=\"/doc/851308/\" id=\"a_71\">A v. B (PLC) and\nCampbell</a>, the Court recognized the needs of an individual or even a person complaining of\nprejudice of confidentiality, capable of coming into conflict with the freedom of Press. In\nGuardian Newspapers, the Court explicitly stated that the third limiting principle requires the\nCourt to carry-out a balancing operation weighing the public interest in maintaining confidence\nwith a &quot;countervailing public interest favoring disclosure&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1375804\" id=\"span_21\">In <a href=\"/doc/1375804/\" id=\"a_72\">A v. B (PLC</a>), the Court listed 12\npoints as indicative, though not exhaustive guidelines, which would assist in the carrying-out of\nthat exercise. Both Campbell and HRH Prince of Wales talked about proportionality - an\nobvious reference to the response while granting relief -in balancing the competing claims for\nright to confidentiality and the need for publication of the information, in the given\ncircumstances of individual cases. In HRH Prince of Wales, the Court referred as a duty to weigh\nand see whether the order is &quot;a fetter of the Right of Freedom of Expression is, in the broad\ncircumstances &#x27;necessary&#x27; in a democratic society.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_22\">57.    The above approach, in the opinion of the Court, accords with the long line of previous\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. Of course, in each of them, the Court was called upon to\ndecide whether a particular state action violated the Freedom of Speech guaranteed by the\nConstitution of India. Thus, in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_73\">Rajgopal</a> (supra), for instance, the Court recognized the needs of\nthe same kind of balancing exercise referring to New York Times v. Sullivan 385 US 374(1967)\n(where the Court had indicated the test of &quot;clear and present danger&quot; being the only\ncircumstance justifying prior restraint of press freedom); the Court also noted an interesting\ndecision of the House of Lords - Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Limited [1993]\nAC 534. The House of Lords held in that decision that civil action by a Local or County Council\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                      Page 39\n for defamation, in respect of speech made against it was not maintainable. It would be\nworthwhile to extract the relevant passage of the House, which stated that media freedom to\ncriticize and air views about public and local bodies is of great importance:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">       &quot;..of the highest public importance that a democratically elected governmental body, or\n       indeed any governmental body, should be open to uninhibited public criticism. The threat\n       of a civil action for defamation must inevitably have an inhibiting effect on freedom of\n       speech...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">And that\n\n       &quot;quite often the facts which would justify the publication are known to be true, but\n       admissible evidence capable of proving those facts is not available...&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">Because the result may be damaging self-censorship by the media to the impoverishment of\npolitical discourse - libel&#x27;s so-called `chilling effect&#x27; - was deemed contrary to the public interest\nto continue to allow government to sue in defamation. Nonetheless, defamation is now\nunavailable to such agencies, though they are free to sue for malicious falsehood. It was also\nheld that given that plaintiffs must prove falsity, malice, and loss, actions in malicious falsehood\nare perhaps less likely to chill political speech. In Goldsmith v Bhoyrul [1998] 2 WLR 435, a\npolitical party, allegedly libelled while campaigning for office at a general election, was held\nincapable of suing. In Reynolds v Times Newspapers Limited [2001] 2 AC 127 Lord Nicholls of\nBirkenhead described the legal position as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">       &quot;It is through the mass media that most people today obtain their information on\n       political matters. Without freedom of expression by the media, freedom of\n       expression would be a hollow concept. The interest of a democratic society in\n       ensuring a free press weighs heavily in the balance in deciding whether any\n       curtailment of this freedom bears a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the\n       curtailment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">In Stephens v West Australian Newspapers Ltd (1992) 182 CLR 211 at 264 a similar\nconclusion was reached by the High Court of Australia. McHugh J explained :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">       &quot;the quality of life and freedom of the ordinary individual...are highly dependent\n       on the exercise of functions and powers vested in public representatives and\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                           Page 40\n         officials by a vast legal and bureaucratic apparatus funded by public monies.\n        How, when, why and where those functions and powers are or are not exercised\n        are matters of real and legitimate concern to every member of the\n        community...So is the performance of the public representatives and officials who\n        are invested with them...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">58.     In the United States, in one of the earliest cases, dealing with the issue, Near v.\nMinnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), the US Supreme Court held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">        &quot;If we cut through mere details of procedure, the operation and effect of the\n        statute in substance is that public authorities may bring the owner or publisher of\n        a newspaper or periodical before a judge upon a charge of conducting a business\n        of publishing scandalous and defamatory matter-in particular that the matter\n        consists of charges against public officers of official dereliction-and, unless the\n        owner or publisher is able and disposed to bring competent evidence to satisfy\n        the judge that the charges are true and are published with good motives and for\n        justifiable ends, his newspaper or periodical is suppressed and further publication\n        is made punishable as a contempt. This is of the essence of censorship.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">and, later that;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">        &quot;The statute in question cannot be justified by reason of the fact that the\n        publisher is permitted to show, before injunction issues, that the matter\n        published is true and is published with good motives and for justifiable ends. ... it\n        would be but a step to a complete system of censorship. ... The preliminary\n        freedom, by virtue of the very reason for its existence, does not depend, as this\n        court has said, on proof of truth. (Patterson v.

The principle of Sullivan (376 US 254 :11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964)) was\n         carried forward - and this is relevant to the second question arising in this\n         case - in Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd. ((1993) 2\n         WLR 449 : (1993) 1 All ER 1011, HL), a decision rendered by the House of\n         Lords. The plaintiff, a local authority brought an action for damages for\n         libel against the defendants in respect of two article published in Sunday\n         Times questioning the propriety of investments made for its\n         superannuation fund. The articles were headed &quot;Revealed : Socialist\n         tycoon deals with Labour Chief&quot; and &quot;Bizarre deals of a council leader and\n         the media tycoon&quot;. A preliminary issue was raised whether the plaintiff has\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                       Page 42\n          a cause of action against the defendant. The trial Judge held that such an\n         action was maintainable but on appeal the Court of Appeal held to the\n         contrary. When the matter reached the House of Lords, it affirmed the\n         decision of the Court of Appeal but on a different ground. Lord Keith\n         delivered the judgment agreed to by all other learned Law Lords. In his\n         opinion, Lord Keith recalled that in Attorney General v. Guardian\n         Newspapers Ltd. (No. 2) ((1990) 1 AC 109 : (1988) 3 All ER 545 : (1988)\n         3 WLR 776, HL) popularly known as &quot;Spycatcher case&quot;, the House of Lords\n         had opined that &quot;there are rights available to private citizens which\n         institutions of ..... Government are not in a position to exercise unless they\n         can show that it is in the public interest to do so&quot;. It was also held therein\n         that not only was there no public interest in allowing governmental\n         institutions to sue for libel, it was &quot;contrary to the public interest because\n         to admit such actions would place an undesirable fetter on freedom of\n         speech&quot; and further that action for defamation or threat of such action\n         &quot;inevitably have an inhibiting effect on freedom of speech&quot;. The learned\n         Law Lord referred to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n         New York v. Sullivan (376 US 254 : 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964)) and certain\n         other decisions of American Courts and observed - and this is significant\n         for our purposes -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">         &quot;while these decisions were related most directly to the provisions of the\n         American Constitution concerned with securing freedom of speech, the\n         public interest considerations which underlaid them are no less valid in this\n         country. What has been described as &#x27;the chilling effect&#x27; induced by the\n         threat of civil actions for libel is very important. Quite often the facts which\n         would justify a defamatory publication are known to be true, but\n         admissible evidence capable of proving those facts is not available.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">         Accordingly, it was held that the action was not maintainable in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">         20. Reference in this connection may also be made to the decision of the\n         Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Leonard Hector v.

It provided that any person who printed\n         or distributed any false statement which was &quot;likely to cause fear or alarm\n         in or to the public or to disturb the public peace or to undermine public\n         confidence in the conduct of public affairs&quot; shall be guilty of an offence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">         The appellant, the editor of a newspaper, was prosecuted under the said\n         provision. He took the plea that the said provision contravened <a href=\"/doc/663133/\" id=\"a_75\">Section\n         12(1)</a> of the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda which provided that no\n         person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of freedom of expression. At the\n         same time, sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/586382/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 12</a> stated that nothing contained in\n         or done under the authority of law was to be held inconsistent with or in\n         contravention of sub-<a href=\"/doc/663133/\" id=\"a_77\">section 12(1)</a> to the extent that the law in question\n         made provisions reasonably required in the interest of public order.

It held that Section 33-B is wide enough to\n         cover not only false statements which are likely to affect public order but\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                     Page 43\n           also those false statements which are not likely to affect public order. On\n          that account, it was declared to be unconstitutional. The criminal\n          proceedings against the appellant was accordingly quashed. In the course\n          of his speech, Lord Bridge of Harwich observed thus :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">          &quot;In a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to need stating that\n          those who hold office in Government and who are responsible for public\n          administration must always be open to criticism. Any attempt to stifle or\n          fetter criticism amounts to political censorship of the most insidious and\n          objectionable kind. At the same time it is no less obvious that the very\n          purpose of criticism levelled at those who have the conduct of public affairs\n          by their political opponents is to undermine public confidence in their\n          stewardship and to persuade the electorate that the opponents would\n          make a better job of it than those presently holding office. In the light of\n          these considerations their Lordships cannot help viewing a statutory\n          provision which criminalises statements likely to undermine public\n          confidence in the conduct of public affairs with the utmost suspicion.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">61.    Earlier decisions of the Supreme Court too, had declared the valuable nature of the right\nto freedom of speech. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1475436\" id=\"span_23\">In <a href=\"/doc/1475436/\" id=\"a_81\">Virendra v.

Our Constitution\n       recognises this necessity and has attempted to strike a balance between the two\n       social interests. It permits the imposition of reasonable restrictions on the\n       freedom of speech and expression in the interest of public order and on the\n       freedom of carrying on trade or business in the interest of the general public.\n           Therefore, the crucial question must always be: Are the restrictions imposed\n       on the exercise of the rights under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_82\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_83\">19(1)(g)</a> reasonable in\n       view of all the surrounding circumstances?

From this point of view,\n       reasonably equal access to the political processes and reasonably uninhibited\n       freedom to argue and discuss (limited only by imminently impending danger to\n       the State itself) is in fact an integral part of, although antecedent to, the formal\n       legislative processes of democracy. Hence to uphold the restrictions on freedom\n       of thought and communication and access to the political processes which may\n       be placed in effect by a temporary majority would be actually to reduce the\n       integrity of the processes of transforming that transient majority into a\n       minority--a process essential to the very concept of democracy.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">63.    In the light of the above discussion, this Court has to now examine whether the\nplaintiff&#x27;s claim for protective injunction of the kind sought in these proceedings can be\ngranted, or whether defendant&#x27;s claim for right to publish them, in furtherance of their Right to\nFreedom of Speech and Information has to prevail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">64.    Though the plaintiff disputes that it performs any governmental or public function, it\ndoes not deny being a company with an equity base of Rs.1200 crores, of which 50% is\nsubscribed by Central Government Public Sector Undertakings. Although such undertakings are\nnot majority equity holders, and narrowly miss that description by one percent, nevertheless,\nthey have a significant shareholding. Equally, the plaintiff does not deny - rather it even asserts\nthat the negotiations conducted for the purpose of gas and allied products, are meant to\nservice the needs of the community and the consumer base in India. Understood in a broad\nsense, therefore, it is engaged in a vital public function. Its other shareholders are no doubt,\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 45\n non-state entities. Yet, there is a crucial public interest element in its functioning; 50% of\nRs.1200 crores shareholding is controlled by the Public Sector Undertakings which are directly\nanswerable to the Central Government and Parliament. Therefore, the claim for confidentiality\nhas to be necessarily from the view of the plaintiff&#x27;s accountability to such extent as well as its\nduties which have a vital bearing on the availability and presence of gas in the country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">65.    As far as the complaint that the plaintiff would be violating SEBI regulations is\nconcerned, no specific norm was brought to the notice of the Court which would attract penal\naction or other sanctions by the SEBI, due to impugned discussion, in the news reports, about\nits functioning. The various courses mandated by the regulations shown to the Court concern\ninternal processes of company as well as information relating to insider trading, share prices\nand other product information; the need to maintain &quot;Chinese Wells&quot; for ensuring integrity of\ninformation flow within the organization and so on. However, these nowhere inhibit\npublication of information which is otherwise available to third parties or becomes available to\na third party. No sanctions have been indicated nor shown to the Court. Therefore, the\nplaintiff&#x27;s complaint of its being possibly held liable for SEBI violations is accordingly overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_111\">66.    The second complaint about a public interest concern, in the plaintiff&#x27;s seeking\nprohibition of disclosure of information relating to negotiations with Exxon Mobil or its related\norganizations has to be now discussed. It is contended here that the plaintiff had entered into\nconfidential agreements with its potential suppliers which mandated secrecy; and disclosure of\neven seemingly innocuous information relating to negotiations would, it is argued amount to\nviolation of such confidentiality agreements. It is also argued that disclosure of such sensitive\ninformation would spell potential doom because rivals and competitors would come to know\nabout these developments that may completely change the nature of negotiations. It is also\ncontended parallely, that the potential suppliers, (in advanced stage of negotiations) have\ntaken unkindly to the press publication, and the plaintiff has been embarrassed, in that such\nsuppliers have expressed these disclosures to be in breach of the confidentiality agreement.\nThe defendant&#x27;s arguments for these is that the disclosure or news reports regarding identity of\none or the other suppliers is hardly confidential or in any event not of such sensitive nature as\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                           Page 46\n to entitle the plaintiff to a blanket injunction. It is argued that in such business, there are very\nfew suppliers and buyers - all of them know each other. The defendants also argued that in\nsuch circumstances, whatever be the confidentiality conditions which bind negotiating parties,\nunless the information sought to be published is so sensitive as would inevitably - and not\nmerely potentially - undermine the negotiating process, there can never be a prior restraint on\nits publication. It was contended here that disclosure of the entities owned by Exxon Mobil or\nthat it was negotiating with the plaintiff for supply of gas, can never be called confidential. It\nwas also argued that similarly, information relating to the plaintiff company&#x27;s - development of\nthe Kochi Special Economic Zone Area; that it mooted a special purpose company and\nshortlisted 6 out of 14 companies which had bid, in a pre-qualification document, was not at all\ncommercially sensitive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">67.    As far as the negotiations with foreign suppliers is concerned, the news item at para\n5(A)(ii) states that the plaintiff and three others, which needed LNG were in active negotiations\nwith Exxon Mobil. The purpose of this negotiation process was for supply of LNG to the Kochi\nTerminal from Exxon&#x27;s share of gas, from the $ 7.3 billion Gorgon LNG in Australia. The news\nitem was on 26.04.2006 and recounted what had been discussed, i.e. completion of terminal\nbefore date of commencement of supply; obligations of sales and purchase agreement till\nreceiving facilities were completed; and that to mitigate certain obligations in the event of\ndelayed completion, devaluation of cargo could take place to other terminals which in the case\nof force majeure could not be enforced. The news report also stated that Exxon Mobil asked the\nplaintiff to &quot;revisit the present agreement proposed in view of the rise in prices of petro-\nproducts&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">68.    Aside from indicating broad generality of what was allegedly negotiated by the plaintiff\nand Exxon Mobil in relation to completion of the terminal at Kochi before commencement of\nsupply, the obligations under sale and purchase agreement ; dealing with cargo till creation of\ncapacity and applicability or otherwise of the guarantee, absolutely no specifics or particulars\nwere published. The reference to the pricing agreement was only in passing and without\nmention of any details at all. In these circumstances, it is difficult to discern how a discussion in\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                          Page 47\n the proposed terms and, perhaps in the vaguest manner what are general terms of a contract,\ncould be construed as confidential, much less prejudicial. Similarly, description of six ship\nowning companies for transportation of LNG itself could not have resulted in breach of\nconfidentiality. Even if the plaintiff were &quot;in active negotiation&quot;, one fails to see, how a mention\nof those six companies without any further particulars could have prejudiced either them or the\nplaintiff or driven competitors to take precipitate action in scuttling the negotiations. Again,\nbulk transporters such as shipping companies, who engage in movement of special cargo, such\nas LNG, are known, in the trade, and are few and far between. The reason given that selection\nof the ship owners is a closely guarded secret and forms &quot;extremely confidential&quot; information,\nwhich should not have been published till a decision was taken by the Board of Directors, is just\nan assertion. The plaintiff&#x27;s contention that till formal approval of the Board was given, there\nwas possibility of exclusion of some ship owners and inclusion of other ship owners leading to\nembarrassment, in the opinion of the Court, does not amount to overriding concern, or a\ncompelling necessity, as to bar informing the public, through news. Here, unlike in the previous\ninstance, commercial or price-sensitivity has not been claimed; what is alleged is the\npotentiality of excluding some ship owners from the negotiations at a later point; that\nnegotiations were fluid, was deemed a sufficient justification for claiming injunction. Beyond\nasserting this, the plaintiff nowhere shows how such potentiality or possibility could justify\ninjunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">69.    As far as the information relating to the plaintiff&#x27;s resisting the directives of PMO is\nconcerned, it is claimed that the pros and cons of implementing the directives were under\ndiscussion and that certain stake holders expressed divergent views. The plaintiff contends that\nthe information or news was entirely false and misleading. The defendants here argued that as\na company with significant public participation, the plaintiff was bound by the PMO directives\nand that if it was taking a different view, or even contemplating it, the publication of such\ndiscussion was not prejudicial.       This Court is of the opinion that the news item relating to\nPMO directive&#x27;s can hardly be deemed confidential and would facially fall within the prohibited\ncategory spoken of in Sullivan as endorsed in Rajgopal and also in the Guardian case. After all,\ndissemination of news - even unpleasant and unwelcome news or information, particularly, if it\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                         Page 48\n relates to public bodies, is of the essence in a democracy. Wherever the general public or public\nagencies have a stake, in companies or corporations like the plaintiff, their right to be informed\nabout matters that concern the functioning of such corporations, is vitally important. This\ncould include discussions of the kind which the plaintiff is confronted with - i.e. the question of\nimplementing PMOs directives. The topicality and newsworthiness of such reports is\nundeniable; some may even argue that the press could sensationalize the facts in presentation\nof such information, yet the right to disseminate these view is at the core of freedom of speech\nand expression and any restraint would have a chilling effect on its exercise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">70.    So far as the articles of 03.05.2006 and 05.05.2006, concerning issue of US $ 100 million\nbonds by the ABB, it is argued that it is misleading, intended to causing sensation by reporting\nplaintiff&#x27;s confidential internal discussions involving funds and cash flows. The plaintiff asserts\nthat the information could not have been disclosed at all even if it were accurate till it were\nmade known in the public domain. The plaintiff contends that this news and information was\nalso price-sensitive information. The defendants argue that the issuance of foreign currency\nconvertible bonds was covered in three major business newspapers on 04.05.2006 which\nclearly disclosed that they were singled out and not bigger organizations. It is also asserted by\nits very nature, i.e. issuance of foreign currency convertible bonds, is a topic worthy of\nreporting as it is commercial news.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">71.    In the opinion of the Court, the plaintiff has been unable to substantiate how the news\nthat foreign exchange bonds were under contemplation and that the presentation by the\nplaintiff to five merchant bankers is price-sensitive. The plaintiff does not anywhere deny that\nthe Kochi Terminal was under contemplation - it was even known. The two news items of\n03.05.2006 and 05.05.2006 spoke about a proposal and speculated about the possible terms of\nthe debentures. No attempt has been made at all to say how such news would prejudice the\nplaintiff in any ongoing negotiation or commercially jeopardize its prospects. In these\ncircumstances, the Court concludes that as far as this item goes plea of confidentiality has not\nbeen established.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">CS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 49\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\"> 72.    In view of above conclusions, it is held that the plaintiff has been unable to substantiate\nits claim for confidentiality or that the information in regard to the news items complained\nagainst are of such sensitive nature as to warrant prior restraint of their disclosure. On the\nother hand, the defendants, in the opinion of the Court, have been able to show public interest\nin news reporting and discussion about the plaintiff&#x27;s functioning - in the areas sought not to\nbe intedicted by the kind of injunction sought. Clearly, the grant of injunction would destroy the\nvery essence of press freedom and the right of the general public to be informed about the\nfunctioning of an entity in which 50% stake is held by the Central Public Sector Undertakings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">73.    This Court, while recollecting the judgment of the Supreme Court in S. Rangarajan,\nVirendra, Rajgopal as well as that of the US Supreme Court in Sullivan, is of the opinion that the\npublic interest in ensuring dissemination of news and free flow of ideas, is of paramount\nimportance. The news or information disclosure of which may be uncomfortable to an\nindividual or corporate entity but which otherwise fosters a debate and awareness about\nfunctioning of such individuals or bodies, particularly, if they are engaged in matters that affect\npeople&#x27;s lives, serve a vital public purpose. Very often, the subject of information or news - i.e\nthe individual or corporation may disagree with the manner of its presentation. If it contends\nthat such presentation tends to defame or libel, it is open for the entity or individual to sue for\ndamages. In the case of a corporate entity, unless the news presented is of such a sensitive\nnature that its business or very existence is threatened or would gravely jeopardize a\ncommercial venture, the Courts would be slow in interdicting such publication. The\nConstitution&#x27;s democratic framework, depends on a free commerce in ideas, which is its life\nblood. In the words of Walter Lippmann newspapers are &quot;the bible of democracy&quot;. Justice\nHolmes ( Abrams -vs- US 250 US 616 (1919)) characterized the discussion of public matters as\nessential to see that &quot;the ultimate good desired is better reached by a free trade in ideas&quot;. Even\nmore poignantly, one of the principal architects of the American Constitution, James Madison,\n(1751-1836) wisely stated that:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">       &quot;Nothing could be more irrational than to give the people power, and to withhold\n       from them information without which power is abused. A people who mean to be\n\n\nCS(OS) No.1102/2006                                                                        Page 50\n         their own governors must arm themselves with power which knowledge gives. A\n        popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is\n        but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">74.     Even though, on occasions, the press may be seen and may even be overstepping its\nlimits, it functions as the eyes and ears for the people, throwing light into the unlit and unseen\ncrabbed corners, of decisions and public policies which greatly want in public gaze, for the\nvibrancy as well as accountability of public institutions. Freedom of the press is not a privilege\ngranted to the few controlling the press, or press institutions; it is &quot;a right granted to the people\nfor their protection against the vicissitudes of government and all other sources of power and\ninfluence. ... The newsman is but the surrogate for the people in a never-ending search to\nuncover the truth.&quot; (Stanford Smith, American Newspaper Publishers Association).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\">75.     In view of the above, it is held that the defendants publications cannot be termed as\nunprotected speech, qualifying for restraint through injunction; the plaintiff is therefore, not\nentitled to the injunctions sought for in the present suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">Issue No. 4 - Relief:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">76.
