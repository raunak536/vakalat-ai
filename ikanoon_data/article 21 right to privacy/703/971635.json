[316G, 317A-B]\n     Rule 23.7\twhich prescribes  the mode  of\tsurveillance\npermits close  watch over  the movements of the person under\nsurveillance   but   without   any   illegal   interference.\nPermissible surveillance  is only  to the  extent of a close\nwatch over  the movements  of the persons under surveillance\nand no\tmore. So  long as surveillance is for the purpose of\npreventing crime and is confined to the limits prescribed by\nRule  23.7   a\tperson\t whose\tname   is  included  in\t the\nsurveillance registered\t cannot have  a\t genuine  cause\t for\ncomplaint. Interference\t in accordance\twith law and for the\nprevention of  disorder and crime is an exception recognised\neven by the European Convention of Human Rights to the right\nto respect  for a  person&#x27;s private and family life (<a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_6\">Article\n8</a>). [317B-D]\n     2. Discreet  surveillance\tof  suspects,  habitual\t and\npotential offenders, may be necessary and so the maintenance\nof  history   sheet  and  surveillance\ta  register  may  be\nnecessary too,\tfor the\t purpose  of  prevention  of  crime.\nHistory sheets and surveillance registers have to be and are\nconfidential documents.\t Neither the  persons whose  name is\nentered in  the register  nor any other member of the public\ncan have  access to the surveillance register, the exception\nbeing that  the District Magistrate and the Ilaqa Magistrate\nare entitled to examine the records in accordance with Rules\n1.15 and  1.21. The  nature and\t character of  the  function\ninvolved in  the making\t of an\tentry  in  the\tsurveillance\nregister\n312\nbeing utterly  administrative and  non-judicial the  rule of\naudi altrem  partem is not applicable. In fact observance of\nthe principles of natural justice may defeat the very object\nof the\trule providing\tfor  surveillance.  There  is  every\npossibility of the ends of justice being defeated instead of\nbeing served.\n     [317G-H, 318A-B]\n     Further the entry in the surveillance register is to be\nmade on\t the basis  of the  material provided by the history\nsheet whose  contents, by  their  very\tnature\thave  to  be\nconfidential. It would be contrary to the public interest to\nreveal the  information in  the history\t sheet, particularly\nthe source  of information.  Revelation\t of  the  source  of\ninformation  may   put\tthe   informant\t in   jeopardy.\t The\nobservance of  the principle  of natural justice, apart from\nnot serving the ends of justice may thus lend to undesirable\nresults. The  rule audi\t altrem partem\tis,  therefore,\t not\nattracted. [318C-E]\n     Re v.  K (Infants),  1965 A.C.  201 &amp;  238, quoted with\napproval.\n     3. The  intention behind  Rule 23\tis not\tto give\t the\npolice a  licence to  enter the\t names of  whoever they like\n(dislike ?)  in\t the  surveillance  register;  nor  can\t the\nsurveillance be\t such as  to squeeze the fundamental freedom\nguaranteed to  all citizens or to obstruct the free exercise\nand enjoyment of those freedoms; nor can the surveillance so\nintrude\t as   to  offend  the  dignity\tof  the\t individual.\nSurveillance  of   persons  who\t  do  not  fall\t within\t the\ncategories mentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected\nwith the  prevention of\t crime,\t or  excessive\tsurveillance\nfalling beyond\tthe limits  prescribed by  the\trules,\twill\nentitle a  citizen to  the Court  protection which the court\nwill not  hesitate to  give. The  very rules which prescribe\nthe  conditions\t for  making  entries  in  the\tsurveillance\nregister recognises  the caution  and care  with  which\t the\npolice officers\t are required to proceed. The note following\nRule 23.4 enjoins a duty upon the police officer to construe\nthe  rule   strictly  and   confine  the   entries  in\t the\nsurveillance register  to the  class of persons mentioned in\nthe rule.  Similarly Rule  23.7 demands that there should be\nno  illegal  interference  in  the  guise  of  surveillance.\nSurveillance, therefore,  has to  be unobtrusive  and within\nbounds. [318E-H, 319A]\n     While it  may not be necessary to supply the grounds of\nbelief to  the\tpersons\t whose\tnames  are  entered  in\t the\nsurveillance register-it  may become necessary in some cases\nto satisfy  the Court  when an\tentry is  challenged on\t the\nground that  there are\tgrounds to entertain such reasonable\nbelief.

The two\tappeals\t are\ndirected against  the judgment of the High Court of Punjab &amp;\nHaryana\t dismissing   the  Writ\t  Petitions  filed   by\t the\nappellants seeking  the removal\t of  their  names  from\t the\nsurveillance  register\tmaintained  at\tPolice\tStation\t &#x27;A&#x27;\nDivision,  Amritsar  City  and\tfor  a\tdirection  that\t the\nrespondent  Police   Officers  should\tbe  restrained\tfrom\nharassing the  appellants by  calling  them  to\t the  Police\nStation frequently without any justification. The appellants\nMalak Singh and Jaswant Singh are brothers and they claim to\nbe engaged  in a business known as &#x27;Continental Electricals&#x27;\nbesides owning\ta hotel named Park Restaurant on Grand Trunk\nRoad Amritsar. They state that they are Income-tax assessees\nand assert  that they  are law\tabiding citizens. They claim\nthat on account of their active political affiliation to the\nAkali party,  one  Prithipal  Singh  a\tCongress  M.L.A.  is\nenimically disposed  towards them  and has been instrumental\nin having the appellants falsely implicated in some criminal\ncases. All  the criminal  cases ended either in acquittal or\ndischarge. The\tappellants were also detained under the MISA\nfor sometime  but they\twere released  from detention as the\nAdvisory Board\trefused\t to  confirm  their  detention.\t The\nappellants claim  that they took active part in exposing the\ncorrupt activities  of the  Deputy Superintendent of Police,\nAmritsar and had even published wall posters with the result\nthat the  Deputy Superintendent\t of Police  had instituted a\nprosecution for\t defamation against  the  appellants.  As  a\nmeasure of  humiliation and  harassment, the  names  of\t the\nappellants  were   entered  in\t the  surveillance  register\nmaintained at the Police Station &#x27;A&#x27; Division, Amritsar. The\nappellants allege that their photographs have been displayed\namongst those  of notorious  criminals and bad characters at\nthe Police  Station. Whenever a Senior Police Officer visits\nthe Police Station the appellants are required to attend the\nPolice Station\talongwith  other  persons  whose  names\t are\nentered\t in   the  surveillance\t  register.  They  are\talso\nneedlessly  asked   to\tassociate  themselves  with  various\ninvestigations though  they have nothing whatever to do with\nthose investigations. As, according to the appellants, there\nis no material whatsoever on the basis of which the names of\nthe  appellants\t  could\t be   entered  in  the\tsurveillance\nregister, they\tfiled  Writ  Petitions\tin  the\t High  Court\nquestioning the inclusion of their names in the surveillance\nregister  and\talso  praying  that  the  police  should  be\nrestrained from harassing them by calling them to the Police\nStation without any justification.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">     In the  High Court, counter affidavits on behalf of the\nrespondents were  filed\t by  the  Senior  Superintendent  of\nPolice, Amritsar, who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">314</span>\nclaimed\t that\tthe  appellants\t were  opium  smugglers\t and\nhabitual offenders  and receivers  of  stolen  property\t and\ntherefore, their  names were  entered  in  the\tsurveillance\nregister. It was, however, denied that their photographs had\nbeen displayed\tat the\tPolice Station.\t It was pleaded that\nthe reasons  for entering  their names\tin the\tsurveillance\nregister were  to be  found in the history sheets which were\nconfidential documents\tand which,  therefore, could  not be\ndisclosed. It  was also\t pleaded that  one of the appellants\nhad been convicted in a criminal case but it transpires from\nthe rejoinder  filed by\t the appellants\t that the conviction\nwas  set  aside\t on  appeal.  As  the  Writ  Petitions\twere\ndismissed by  the High\tCourt, the appellants have preferred\nthese two  appeals after  obtaining special  leave from this\nCourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">     Shri V.M.\tTarkunde, learned  counsel, who\t appeared as\nAmicus curiae  for the\tappellants urged  that there were no\ngrounds\t on   the  basis  of  which  the  respondents  could\nentertain a  reasonable\t belief\t that  the  appellants\twere\nhabitual offenders  or\treceivers  of  stolen  property\t and\ntherefore, there  was no  justification\t for  including\t the\nnames of  the appellants  in the  surveillance register.  He\nfurther submitted  that an  order  for\tsurveillance  was  a\nserious encroachment  on the  liberty  of  the\tcitizen\t and\ntherefore, it was necessary that a person should be given an\nopportunity to\tshow cause  before his\tname was included in\nthe  surveillance  register.  As  this\twas  not  done,\t the\ninclusion of the names of the appellants in the register was\nbad. We\t may add  that the  vires of the Punjab Police rules\nwhich provide for the maintenance of a surveillance register\nwas not questioned before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">     Chapter 23\t of  the  Punjab  Police  rules\t deals\twith\nprevention of  offences.

The preamble to the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_20\">Police\nAct</a> 1861 says :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t  &quot;Whereas it  is expedient to reorganise the police\n     and to  make it  a more  efficient instrument  for\t the\n     prevention and detection of crime&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\"><a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_21\">Sec. 23</a>\t of the\t Police Act  prescribes it  as the  duty  of\npolice officers\t &quot;to collect  and  communicate\tintelligence\naffecting the public peace, to pre\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">317</span>\nvent the  commission of\t offences and  public nuisances&quot;. In\nconnection with\t these duties  it will\tbe necessary to keep\ndiscreet surveillance  over reputed bad characters, habitual\noffenders and  other potential\toffenders.  Organised  crime\ncannot\tbe   successfully  fought  without  close  watch  of\nsuspects. But,\tsurveillance may  be intrusive and it may so\nseriously encroach  on\tthe  privacy  of  a  citizen  as  to\ninfringe  his\tfundamental  right   to\t  personal   liberty\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution and the freedom of\nmovement guaranteed  by\t <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_23\">Art.  19(1)  (d).</a>  That  cannot  be\npermitted. This\t is recognised\tby the\tPunjab Police  Rules\nthemselves.  Rule   23.7,  which   prescribes  the  mode  of\nsurveillance,  permits\t that  the   close  watch  over\t the\nmovements of  the person  under surveillance but without any\nillegal interference.  Permissible surveillance\t is only  to\nthe extent of a close watch over the movements of the person\nunder surveillance  and no  more. So long as surveillance is\nfor the\t purpose of  preventing crime and is confined to the\nlimits prescribed  by Rule  23.7 we  do not  think a  person\nwhose name is included in the surveillance register can have\na genuine  cause for  complaint. We  may  notice  here\tthat\ninterference in\t accordance with  law and for the prevention\nof disorder  and crime\tis an  exception recognised  even by\nEuropean Convention  of Human Rights to the right to respect\nfor a  person&#x27;s private\t and family  life.  <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_24\">Art.  8</a>  of\t the\nConvention reads as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t  &quot;(1) Everyone&#x27;s  right to  respect for his private\n     and family\t life, his home and his correspondence shall\n     be recognised.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t  (2) There  shall be  no interference\tby a  public\n     authority with  the exercise of this right, except such\n     as is  in accordance  with law  and is  necessary in  a\n     democratic\t society   in  the   interests\tof  national\n     security, public safety, for the prevention of disorder\n     and crime or for the protection of health or morals&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">     As we said, discreet surveillance of suspects, habitual\nand  potential\toffenders,  may\t be  necessary\tand  so\t the\nmaintenance of\thistory sheet  and surveillance register may\nbe necessary  too, for\tthe purpose  of prevention of crime.\nHistory sheets and surveillance registers have to be and are\nconfidential documents.\t Neither the  person whose  name  is\nentered in  the register  nor any other member of the public\ncan have access to the surveillance register.

It was well observed in Re : K(Infants) :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\t  &quot;But a  principle  of\t judicial  inquiry,  whether\n     fundamental or  not, is  only a  means to an end. If it\n     can be  shown in  any particular class of case that the\n     observance of  a principle\t of this sort does not serve\n     the ends of justice, it must be dismissed; otherwise it\n     would become  the master  instead\tof  the\t servant  of\n     justice&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">     The entry in the surveillance register is to be made on\nthe basis  of the  material provided  by the  history  sheet\nwhose  contents,   by  their   very  nature   have   to\t  be\nconfidential. It would be contrary to the public interest to\nreveal the  information in  the history\t sheet, particularly\nthe source  of information.  Revelation\t of  the  source  of\ninformation  may   put\tthe   informant\t in   jeopardy.\t The\nobservance of  the principle  of natural justice, apart from\nnot serving the ends of justice may thus lead to undesirable\nresults. We  accordingly held  that  the  rule\taudi  altrem\npartem is not attracted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">     But all  this does\t not mean  that the  police  have  a\nlicence to  enter the  names of whoever they like (dislike?)\nin the\tsurveillance register;\tnor can\t the surveillance be\nsuch as\t to squeeze  the fundamental  freedoms guaranteed to\nall citizens  or to obstruct the free exercise and enjoyment\nof those freedoms; nor can the surveillance so intrude as to\noffend\tthe  dignity  of  the  individual.  Surveillance  of\npersons who  do not  fall within the categories mentioned in\nRule 23.4  or for reasons unconnected with the prevention of\ncrime, or  excessive surveillance  falling beyond the limits\nprescribed by  the rules,  will entitle\t a  citizen  to\t the\nCourt&#x27;s protection  which the  court will  not\thesitate  to\ngive. The  very rules  which prescribe\tthe  conditions\t for\nmaking entries\tin the surveillance register and the mode of\nsurveillance appear  to recognise  the caution and care with\nwhich the  police officers are required to proceed. The note\nfollowing R. 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty upon the\npolice officer to construe the rule strictly and confine the\nentries in the surveillance register to the class of persons\nmentioned in  the rule.\t Similarly R.23.7 demands that there\nshould be no illegal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">319</span>\ninterference in\t the guise  of\tsurveillance.  Surveillance,\ntherefore, has to be unobstrusive and within bounds.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">     Ordinarily the  names of persons with previous criminal\nrecord alone  are entered in the surveillance register. They\nmust be\t proclaimed offenders, previous convicts, or persons\nwho have already been placed on security for good behaviour.\nIn addition, names of persons who are reasonably believed to\nbe  habitual  offenders\t or  receivers\tof  stolen  property\nwhether they  have been\t convicted or not may be entered. It\nis only\t in the\t case of this category of persons that there\nmay be occasion for abuse of the power of the police officer\nto make entries in the surveillance register. But, here, the\nentry can only be made by the order of the Superintendent of\nPolice who is prohibited from delegating his authority under\nRule 23.5.  Further it\tis necessary that the Superintendent\nof Police  must entertain  a reasonable\t belief that persons\nwhose names  are to  be entered\t in  Part  II  are  habitual\noffenders or  receivers of stolen property. While it may not\nbe necessary  to supply the grounds of belief to the persons\nwhose names  are entered in the surveillance register it may\nbecome necessary  in some cases to satisfy the Court when an\nentry is challenged that there are grounds to entertain such\nreasonable belief.  In fact  in the present case we sent for\nthe relevant  records and  we have  satisfied ourselves that\nthere were  sufficient grounds\tfor  the  Superintendent  of\nPolice to  entertain a\treasonable belief.  In the result we\nreject\tboth   the  appeals   subject  to  our\tobservations\nregarding the  mode of surveillance. There is no order as to\ncosts.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">S.R.\t\t\t\t\t   Appeal dismissed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">320</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>","numcites":15,"numcitedby":33,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":971635,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"audi altrem partem","formInput":"audi%20altrem%20partem"},{"value":"history sheet","formInput":"history%20sheet"},{"value":"punjab police rules","formInput":"punjab%20police%20rules"},{"value":"who is habitual offender","formInput":"who%20is%20habitual%20offender"},{"value":"encroachment as is where is","formInput":"encroachment%20as%20is%20where%20is"},{"value":"police act 1861","formInput":"police%20act%201861"},{"value":"stolen property","formInput":"stolen%20property"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"crime prevention","formInput":"crime%20prevention"},{"value":"reasonable belief","formInput":"reasonable%20belief"},{"value":"receiver of stolen  property","formInput":"receiver%20of%20stolen%20%20property"},{"value":"311 (2)","formInput":"311%20%282%29"},{"value":"confidential document ","formInput":"confidential%20document%20"},{"value":"surveillance by police","formInput":"surveillance%20by%20police"},{"value":"\"confidential document\"","formInput":"%22confidential%20document%22"},{"value":"bad character","formInput":"bad%20character"},{"value":"police act ","formInput":"police%20act%20"},{"value":"history","formInput":"history"},{"value":"311","formInput":"311"}],"cats":[{"value":"criminal-procedure-code","formInput":"tag:criminal-procedure-code"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
