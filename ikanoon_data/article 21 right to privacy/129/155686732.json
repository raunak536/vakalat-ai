JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH\n\n    JUDGMENT AND ORDER\n           C.A.V.\n\n    (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)\n\n    Date:     30-09-2016\n\n                     The present set of writ petitions has raised some\n\n     questions of great public importance, in the realm of the\n\n     Constitution of India, and the questions are: Whether the right to\n\n     consume alcohol is a fundamental right and any infringement or\n\n     intrusion into the said right, by means of legislation or otherwise,\n\n     would amount to violation of the right to privacy and, therefore,\n\n     constitutionally untenable?\n\n                     2.              The judgment of my esteemed brother,\n\n     Navaniti Prasad Singh, J., which I have the benefit of very\n\n     patiently, minutely and carefully reading and analyzing, answers\n\n     the questions, posed above, in the affirmative. It is this answer,\n\n     which I have, with great respect, not been able to persuade\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\n\n\n     myself to agree to and I have, therefore, decided to pen down my\n\n     concept and views on the said aspect of the constitutional law\n\n     separately.\n\n                     3.              I may, however, hasten to add and clarify\n\n     that except the questions, which I have posed above, I agree\n\n     with    the     findings     recorded,       conclusions   reached   and   the\n\n     decisions, eventually, rendered by my learned brother on all the\n\n     remaining issues, which have been framed.\n\n                     4.              In order to correctly appreciate how the\n\n     question has arisen, as to whether the right to consume alcohol is\n\n     a fundamental right or not, the material facts, leading to these\n\n     writ petitions, need to be borne in mind and are, therefore, set\n\n     out, in brief, as under:\n\n                     5.              In the State of Bihar, though <a href=\"/doc/196852864/\" id=\"a_3\">Bihar\n\n     Prohibition Act, 1938</a>, has been enacted, this Act has not been\n\n     enforced. What has, however, been in force is the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_4\">Bihar Excise\n\n     Act, 1915</a>, which though regulatory in nature, does incorporate\n\n     the provisions for absolute prohibition in the sense that <a href=\"/doc/1335295/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n     19 (4)</a> states:\n\n                                     &quot;4. Notwithstanding anything contained in\n                     this Act and the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 (Act 2 of\n                     1930), the State Government, may by notification,\n                     prohibit the possession, consumption or both by any\n                     person or class of persons or subject to such\n                     exceptions, if any, as may be specified in the\n                     notification, by all persons in the State of Bihar or in\n                     any specified local area, of any intoxicant either\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\n\n\n                     absolutely or subject to such conditions as it may\n                     prescribe.&quot;\n                                                        (Emphasis is supplied)\n\n                     6.              The State Government introduced, in the\n\n     year 2015, an Excise Policy, which was published in the official\n\n     gazette, on 21.12.2015. This policy is known as New Excise\n\n     Policy, 2015. This policy, nowhere, contemplates immediate and\n\n     complete prohibition on consumption of alcohol. The scheme,\n\n     notified by the Government in the form of New Excise Policy,\n\n     2015, was to obviously guide its future actions. In this policy,\n\n     there was, admittedly, nothing, which shows or authorizes the\n\n     State Government to immediately prohibit trade in Indian Made\n\n     Foreign Liquor (hereinafter to be referred as &#x27;IMFL&#x27;)/foreign\n\n     liquor, though it did provide for sale of IMFL/foreign liquor, in\n\n     restricted areas only, through single source, namely, Bihar State\n\n     Beverage Corporation Limited.\n\n                     7.              There is no doubt that New Excise Policy,\n\n     2015, (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the NEP&#x27;), did contemplate\n\n     implementation of total prohibition; but in a phased manner. It\n\n     is, thus, of paramount importance to note that the New Excise\n\n     Policy, 2015, envisaged total prohibition, albeit in a phased\n\n     manner and not whimsically or suddenly.\n\n                     8.              The underlying idea of the NEP was that\n\n     total prohibition would be brought about gradually and in a\n\n     phased manner so that the society becomes ripe and ready to\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\n\n\n     understand, realize and accept the necessity of having total\n\n     prohibition in order to ensure that no draconian methods would\n\n     be required to be adopted for the purpose of making the State\n\n     free from consumption of alcohol.\n\n                     9.              No wonder, therefore, as I would show,\n\n     the State decided to discontinue or prohibit sale of country liquor\n\n     completely, but permitted manufacture and trade in IMFL/foreign\n\n     liquor though in urban areas only. This did not, however, I must\n\n     hasten to point out, debar the population of rural areas to\n\n     purchase and consume IMFL/foreign liquor within the urban\n\n     areas.\n\n                     10.             The NEP pointed out that from time to\n\n     time, the Excise Policy of the State has undergone changes and\n\n     that some important changes were carried out by introduction of\n\n     Excise Policy, 2007, which led to significant increase in the\n\n     number of liquor vends giving rise to increased collection of\n\n     excise duty. This apart, the Excise Policy, 2007, curtailed the\n\n     tendency of the monopoly, in the trade, by allowing transparency\n\n     in the process of allotment of shop and, thus, efforts were made\n\n     to curb the illegal trading.\n\n                     11.             The NEP clearly reflects that the Excise\n\n     Police, 2007, though resulted in unexpected increase in excise\n\n     duty in the State, some negative aspects also surfaced inasmuch\n\n     as it was noticed that most adverse impact was on the poorest\n\n     class of people, particularly, in rural areas, and, under these\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\n\n\n     circumstances, the State Government felt the need to reconsider\n\n     its Excise Policy, 2007, and decided to frame New Excise Policy,\n\n     2015.\n\n                     12.             Naturally, therefore, the NEP announced\n\n     that in the first phase, only country liquor and spiced country\n\n     liquor shall be banned all over the State and no licence for the\n\n     same would be granted from 1st April, 2016; whereas, with effect\n\n     from 1stApril, 2016, foreign liquor/IMFL would be available in\n\n     urban areas only at the level of Municipal Corporation and\n\n     Municipal Council.           All vends shall be &quot;off&quot;. All bars and all\n\n     restaurants, located in areas other than Municipal Corporation\n\n     and    Municipal       Council,     shall    cease   to   operate   and   those\n\n     permitted, within the territorial areas of Municipal Corporation\n\n     and Municipal Council, shall sell only foreign liquor/IMFL. The\n\n     Bihar State Beverages Corporation Limited (hereinafter, in short,\n\n     referred to as the &#x27;BSBCL&#x27;) was to be the authorized body to\n\n     operate these vends/shops. Distilleries were to be permitted to\n\n     manufacture only ethanol from molasses.                      As a means of\n\n     enforcement of the policy so adopted, various other decisions\n\n     were taken, such as, transportation of foreign liquor/IMFL under\n\n     digital lock system under supervision and the BSBCL was to\n\n     mandatorily keep one depot for foreign liquor/IMFL in all districts.\n\n     The NEP reflects the State Government&#x27;s resolve to ensure that\n\n     rural public voluntarily move towards prohibition of alcohol and to\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\n\n\n     achieve this objective, social movement was necessary.                          De-\n\n     addiction centers were, therefore, to be opened in all districts.\n\n                     13.              In no uncertain words, the NEP made it\n\n     clear that the New Excise Policy, 2015, shall be reviewed by an\n\n     eleven member high powered committee headed by the Chief\n\n     Secretary of the State and the NEP also made it clear that in\n\n     terms of the aims and objects of the policy, necessary guidelines,\n\n     framed by the Department, needed to be approved by the said\n\n     Committee and required proposals would be sent to the Board of\n\n     Revenue for approval.             The Committee was to issue guidelines\n\n     and take decisions for opening new shops as per requirement\n\n     keeping, however, in view the coverage of foreign liquor shops\n\n     from the point of view of prohibition, tourism, etc. Further, this\n\n     Committee was also to fix guidelines in respect of possession,\n\n     consumption or sale in the army establishments. The NEP came\n\n     into force with effect from 01.04.2016.\n\n                     14.              From a minute and collective reading of\n\n     the NEP, as a whole, it would become transparent that under the\n\n     policy, a clear decision was taken to stop manufacture and sale of\n\n     any    form     of    country      liquor    with   effect   from   01.04.2016.\n\n     However,       so     far   as   foreign     liquor/IMFL     including   beer    is\n\n     concerned, the NEP clearly predicated creation of monopoly of the\n\n     BSBCL to the exclusion of private trade and, further, it restricted\n\n     the sale to municipal areas only and, in the process, completely\n\n     excluded rural areas from sale of not only country liquor, but also\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\n\n\n     foreign liquor/IMFL. Bars and restaurants could operate only in\n\n     municipal areas and not in rural areas.              In fact, the policy, if I\n\n     may clarify, empowered the High Level Committee to suggest\n\n     opening of more shops, if necessary.\n\n                     15.             There is, thus, nothing in the policy,\n\n     which indicated the State Government&#x27;s resolve to resort to\n\n     immediate prohibition of foreign liquor/IMFL too; rather, it\n\n     contemplated sale and consumption of foreign liquor/IMFL, in\n\n     restricted geographical area, through a monopolist State agency.\n\n                     16.             Most importantly, the NEP made it known\n\n     to every one that complete prohibition was the objective to be\n\n     achieved by the State Government, but this objective was to be\n\n     achieved in a phased manner and it was the Committee,\n\n     constituted under the NEP, which was to guide the Government\n\n     with regard to making the State free from sale and consumption\n\n     of liquor, i.e., a stage, where the State would have complete\n\n     prohibition.\n\n                     17.             Interestingly enough, pursuant to the\n\n     NEP, a Bill, proposing necessary amendments of the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_6\">Bihar Excise\n\n     Act, 1915</a>, was introduced in the Legislative Assembly.                    The\n\n     object and reasons, as stated therein, read as follows:\n\n                                     &quot;For phase wise implementation of\n                     prohibition in the State, the New Excise Policy,\n                     2015 is notified.            For effective implementation of\n                     prohibition, new provisions require to be incorporated\n                     in place of various sections of the <a href=\"/doc/41072484/\" id=\"a_7\">Bihar Excise Act</a>,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\n\n\n                     1915, which has become irrelevant in the present\n                     context. Therefore, incorporation of new provisions,\n                     amendment and substitution of some provisions of\n                     the Act is expected.\n                                     For amendment in the existing <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_8\">Bihar\n                     Excise Amendment Act, 1915</a>, several provisions have\n                     been made in this legislation, the enactment of which\n                     is the main object and intendment of this legislation.&quot;\n                                                             (Emphasis is added)\n\n\n                     18.             The     bill,     in    fact,     proposed     various\n\n     amendments including substitution of <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act.\n\n     It is pertinent to note, at this stage, that earlier, <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 19 (4)</a> of\n\n     the    Act    had     authorized       the      State    to     prohibit   possession,\n\n     consumption or both, of any intoxicant, in relation to &#x27;persons&#x27;\n\n     and <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act, thus, had not dealt with\n\n     manufacturing, sale and/or purchase, etc.; hence, amendment of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act was deemed necessary.\n\n                     19.             The State-respondents, in their counter\n\n     affidavit, have specifically averred, as indicated by my learned\n\n     brother, that it is pursuant to the New Excise Policy, 2015, that\n\n     the amendments were proposed as would also be indicated in the\n\n     objects and reasons for the amendments, which we have already\n\n     been pointed out above.

The\n\n     licenses of manufacturers of foreign liquor/IMFL, including beer,\n\n     were renewed for the year 2016-17.                   Not surprising, therefore,\n\n     that the licenses of the bar and restaurants were naturally\n\n     renewed, in urban areas, for the year 2016-17 inasmuch as the\n\n     earlier licenses were valid up to 31.03.2016 only. Thereafter, the\n\n     bars and the restaurants, immediately, purchased stocks for sale\n\n     or put their indents with the BSBCL on payment of money.

Similar directions were issued in March, 2016, by the\n\n     BSBCL to the district authorities to make necessary inventories\n\n     and take, consequently, possession of unsold stocks of foreign\n\n     liquor/IMFL lying with various dealers/retailers of rural areas, on\n\n     the close of 31.03.2016, inasmuch as their licenses were not to\n\n     be renewed before restoration of such stocks to the BSBCL so\n\n     that the BSBCL could pay the retailers accordingly.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">                     22.

Put in simpler words, it\n\n     would mean that it is the duty of the State to apply these\n\n     principles in making laws and taking executive actions in terms of\n\n     a defined policy or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">                     36.

When the State has the obligation to\n\n     apply the principles in making laws and when the State does\n\n     make a law to apply these principles, no one can be heard to say\n\n     that his fundamental rights are infringed merely because the\n\n     Directive Principles of State Policy stand incorporated in the\n\n     legislation, which relate to governance of the State.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">                     37.

Duty of the State to raise the\n                     level of nutrition and the standard of living and\n                     to improve public health.- The State shall regard\n                     the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard\n                     of living of its people and the improvement of public\n                     health as among its primary duties and, in particular,\n                     the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition\n                     of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of\n                     intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to\n                     health.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          -23-</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">                     38.             My learned brother&#x27;s observations are\n\n     that a plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 47</a> would show that it does not\n\n     mandate, in positive term, a State to impose &#x27;prohibition&#x27;, and\n\n     the expression, &quot;shall endeavor&quot;, clearly leaves it to the State to\n\n     decide whether to impose prohibition or not and, if so, when to\n\n     impose      prohibition.      With     great     respect,   this   view,   in   my\n\n     considered view, loses sight of the fact that the Directive\n\n     Principles of the State Policy and the fundamental rights have not\n\n     been embodied in the Constitution to give rise to a collision\n\n     course. While, the fundamental right acquires precedence, the\n\n     Directive Principles of the State Policy are equally necessary to be\n\n     embedded in the governance of the State. The two, therefore, the\n\n     fundamental rights and the Directive Principles have to be\n\n     considered in tandem with each other and not hostile and inimical\n\n     to each other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">                     39.             When the State has been, asked by the\n\n     Constitution to make endeavor to bring about prohibition of the\n\n     consumption except for medicinal purposes of, intoxicating drinks\n\n     and/or drugs, which are injurious to health, it, undoubtedly,\n\n     means that making of serious and sincere efforts to take the\n\n     society to       a situation, where              it accepts prohibition     as a\n\n     constitutionally declared obligation of the State. When and how it\n\n     would be done is a question, which needs to be answered by the\n\n     State depending upon the manner in which the endeavour may\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          -24-</span>\n\n\n\n     be made to bring about prohibition. If it is made in the manner,\n\n     as has been done in the present case, the endeavour may not\n\n     survive the test of constitutionality; but if it is done in accordance\n\n     with law and the constitutional scheme of governance, one\n\n     cannot be heard to say that his fundamental rights are violated.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                     40.             My learned brother has observed that\n\n     what one will choose to eat or drink is his decision and cannot be\n\n     interfered with by the State and that in support of these\n\n     observations a reference has been made to the case of Ramlila\n\n     Maidan Incident, In re, reported in (2012) 5 Supreme Court\n\n     Cases 1, wherein, paragraph 318, reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                                     &quot;318. Thus, it is evident that right of\n                     privacy and the right to sleep have always been\n                     treated to be a fundamental right like a right to\n                     breathe, to eat, to drink, to blink, etc.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">                                                      (Emphasis is added)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                     41.             Though what one will eat or what one will\n\n     drink is his decision, the fact remains that when the Directive\n\n     Principles of State Policy requires the State to make endeavour to\n\n     bring about prohibition, it logically follows that merely because\n\n     the State is making the endeavour to bring about prohibition, one\n\n     cannot claim that he has a fundamental and indefeasible right to\n\n     continue to consume liquor or alcohol or intoxicating drinks or\n\n     intoxicating drugs. When the right to consume intoxicating drink\n\n     cannot be claimed as a fundamental right, an intrusion into this\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                          -25-</span>\n\n\n\n     right, if, otherwise, legally valid, cannot be resisted by saying\n\n     that it is one&#x27;s right to privacy, which is infringed or violated.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                     42.             True it is, as observed by my learned\n\n     brother, that merely because the Directive Principles of the State\n\n     Policy is not followed, it does not mean that the State is violating\n\n     the Constitution. However, no one can have a grievance if the\n\n     State applies the Directive Principles in the governance or the\n\n     affairs of the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                     43.             Are we to understand that the Directive\n\n     Principles of the State Policy infringe fundamental rights? The\n\n     answer to this question has to be an emphatic &#x27;No&#x27;. When the\n\n     founding fathers of our Constitution have made the Directive\n\n     Principles fundamental in the governance of the country, these\n\n     principles cannot be said to collide with the fundamental rights.\n\n     The manner and method of applying these principles may become\n\n     subject of challenge; but the fact that the State has the power,\n\n     rather, duty, to apply the Directive Principles of the State Policy,\n\n     in its governance, cannot be disputed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"93885\" id=\"span_11\">44.

To me, it appears that the argument, in\n\n     effect, is that drinking of water is same as consumption of an\n\n     intoxicating drink, such as, alcohol. However, had it been the\n\n     same, the founding fathers of the Constitution would not have,\n\n     with the help of <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 47</a>, cast an obligation on the State to\n\n     bring about prohibition in the governance of the State. If the\n\n     right to consume intoxicating drink is held to be a fundamental\n\n     right, one would be justified in saying that this right cannot be\n\n     taken away or infringed by imposing total prohibition. Underlying\n\n     in this stand is the presumption that the right to consume\n\n     intoxicating drink, such as alcohol, is a fundamental right. With\n\n     greatest respect, I do not find any authority suggesting that the\n\n     right to consume intoxicating drink, such as, alcohol, is a\n\n     fundamental right and in the name of enforcement of Directives\n\n     Principles of State Policy, the right to consume alcohol cannot be\n\n     infringed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1939993\" id=\"span_18\">49.

Every State is goal-oriented and claims\n                     to strive for securing the welfare of its people. The\n                     distinction between the different forms of government\n                     consists in that a real democracy will endeavour to\n                     achieve      its   objectives    through     the   discipline    of\n                     fundamental freedoms like those conferred by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_41\">Articles\n                     14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_42\">19.</a> Those are the most elementary freedoms\n                     without which a free democracy is impossible and\n                     which must therefore be preserved at all costs.\n                     Besides, as observed by Brandies, J., the need to\n                     protect liberty is the greatest when government&#x27;s\n                     purposes are beneficent.

To put it a little differently, if the right to\n\n     consume alcohol is to be treated as a fundamental right, <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_68\">Article\n\n     47</a> of the Constitution of India, whereunder the State owes a duty\n\n     to make endeavour to bring about prohibition would remain not\n\n     only a distant dream, but a dead letter. Seen from this angle, it\n\n     clearly follows that consumption of alcohol by a person can never\n\n     be regarded as his fundamental right nor can it be said that the\n\n     right to consume alcohol can be merely regulated and not\n\n     prohibited.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">                     69.             What        crystallizes    from    the   above\n\n     discussion is that the right to consume alcohol is not a\n\n     constitutional right, and reasonable restrictions on consumption\n\n     of alcohol, or complete prohibition on consumption of alcohol, can\n\n     be imposed by the State in order to carry forward the goal set by\n\n     the Constitution in the form of Directive Principles of State Policy,\n\n     but such implementation of the policy shall be in accordance with\n\n     law and not in violation thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">                     70.

Having considered the various arguments,\n\n     basically the issues that arise for consideration of this Court can be\n\n     summarized under eight heads. I am noting all the issues as both\n\n     sides argued on all these issues at length.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_79\">                     75.             The first is based upon the interpretation\n\n     of the <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act. On behalf of the petitioners, it is\n\n     submitted that considering the legislative history and judicial\n\n     pronouncements in respect of the Section itself, the expression\n\n     &quot;any person&quot;, as used in the Section did not and cannot\n\n     contemplate &quot;all persons&quot;. Alternatively, &quot;any person&quot; has to be\n\n     read ejesdem generis and cannot include &quot;all persons&quot; not being\n\n     manufactory, bottling plant and license holder, which expression\n\n     precedes the expression &quot;any person&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">                     76.             The second ground of challenge is that\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_71\">Section     19(4)</a>      of   the    Act,     as   amended,   confers   unguided,\n\n     uncontrolled and unfettered power on the delegatee of the State\n\n     and, as such, the section is ultra vires the Constitution, being a\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                          -40-</span>\n\n\n\n     piece of excessive delegation. Consequently, the notification issued\n\n     thereunder would also be bad and unenforceable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">                     77.             The third issue would be that, without\n\n     prejudice to the above, the notification, issued under <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 19(4)</a>\n\n     of the Act by the State, is in conflict with the notified New Excise\n\n     Policy, 2015, which policy is the only guideline available for\n\n     issuance of notification under <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act and, as\n\n     such, the notification has to be struck down.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_82\">                     78.             The fourth issue is that the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_74\">Bihar Excise\n\n     Act, 1915</a>, is an Act for collecting State excise duty and regulation\n\n     incidental thereto, the impugned notification goes beyond the very\n\n     object of the Act and virtually obliterates the Act itself, which is\n\n     impermissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">                     79.             The fifth issue is that whether an individual\n\n     citizen has a right of choice as to how he would live, what he would\n\n     eat and what he should drink, as a part of right of privacy as\n\n     contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. I have noted\n\n     this issue only because it was argued at length though, I am not\n\n     basing my judgment on this aspect in any manner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_84\">                     80.             The sixth issue is that whether the effect\n\n     of    impugned        notification      would    amount   to   arbitrary   and\n\n     unreasonable restriction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">                     81.             The seventh issue is that whether the\n\n     punishment, as now provided by the amended provisions of the\n\n     Act, are draconian, in excess and grossly disproportionate to the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                          -41-</span>\n\n\n\n     delinquency sought to be punished. In other words, is the remedy\n\n     worse than the disease itself and, as such, ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_76\">Articles 14</a>\n\n     and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_77\">21</a> of the Constitution and, finally, the eighth issue would be\n\n     whether the impugned notification restricts possession of liquor\n\n     simpliciter by a person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\">                     82.             On behalf of the State, the issues as sought\n\n     to be raised by the petitioners have been contested. It has been\n\n     submitted that so far as the first issue is concerned, the\n\n     Legislative history and the judicial pronouncements in respect of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act are against the petitioners. In relation to\n\n     the second issue, it is submitted that the notification, issued under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act, is neither a piece of delegated legislation\n\n     nor even conditional legislation but a power of administrative act\n\n     and the liquor trade being extra commercium, no person can make\n\n     any grievance thereof. So far as the third issue is concerned, the\n\n     stand of the State is that the notified New Excise Policy, 2015,\n\n     contemplates prohibition,             though in a phased manner, and the\n\n     impugned notification, imposing a total ban, is or prohibition\n\n     beyond which the policy cannot control the State. In regards to the\n\n     fourth issue, the stand of the State is that the legislative power\n\n     being there, the object of the Act cannot control the power\n\n     exercised under <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act. In regards to the fifth\n\n     issue, it is submitted that no person has a right to consume liquor\n\n     and liquor trade being extra commercium, no person can think it as\n\n     a part of any fundamental right. In respect of the sixth issue, it is\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                          -42-</span>\n\n\n\n     submitted, once again, that liquor trade being extra commercium,\n\n     there will be no concept of reasonableness of restriction. In respect\n\n     of the seventh issue, regarding punishment, it is submitted that\n\n     State has the legislative power and authority to define the offence\n\n     and provide for a punishment. The legislative wisdom cannot be\n\n     questioned or interfered with by this Court. In respect of the\n\n     eighth issue, it is submitted, on behalf of the State, that once\n\n     trade in liquor is prohibited, then, automatically possession thereof\n\n     by any person would be deemed to be prohibited.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_87\">                     83.             I may note that along with the aforesaid\n\n     issues, which are all independent and in alternatives, there are\n\n     subsidiary issues, which I would discuss at appropriate places.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">                1.

Alternatively, it is\n\n     submitted that the said expression &quot;any person&quot; has to be read\n\n     ejesdem generis and would not cover individuals, not being\n\n     manufactory, bottling plant or licence holder.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                     84.01.                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1354010\" id=\"span_48\">In order to appreciate the contention,\n\n     it would be necessary to, first, notice <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, as\n\n     it originally stood, up to 1940, when it was interpreted by the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                           -43-</span>\n\n\n\n     Special Bench of five Judges of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1354010/\" id=\"a_84\">Kanhai\n\n     Sahu Vs.

The Special Bench of this Court, in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1354010/\" id=\"a_86\">Kanhai Sahu</a>&#x27;s case (supra), was called upon to interpret the\n\n     expression &quot;any person&quot; in the said provision.

Thus, the notification, in\n\n     respect of all persons under <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 19 (4)</a>, as it then stood, was\n\n     held to be clearly ultra vires.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1354010\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1354010\" id=\"span_52\">While doing so, the Special Bench, in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1354010/\" id=\"a_88\">Kanhai Sahu</a>&#x27;s case (supra), took into consideration the identical\n\n     provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_89\">Bombay Abkari Act</a>, as interpreted by a Special\n\n     Bench of Five Judges of the Bombay High Court, in the case of\n\n     Chinubhai Lal Bhai and others Vs.

As already noticed earlier, in <a href=\"/doc/1354010/\" id=\"a_105\">Kanhai\n\n     Sahu</a>&#x27;s case (supra), decided by Special Bench of this Court, the\n\n     restrictive meaning given to the expression &quot;any person&quot; was solely\n\n     because of it being qualified by the expression &quot;class of persons&quot;.\n\n     Presently in the amended <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 19(4)</a>, the expression, &quot;any\n\n     person&quot; is not so qualified. &quot;Any person&quot; or the use of expression\n\n     &quot;any&quot; would indicate expansive and be of widest import.                 &quot;Any\n\n     person&quot; by itself would mean &quot;all persons&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"52475\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1354010\" id=\"span_61\">The Special Bench, in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1354010/\" id=\"a_107\">Kanhai Sahu</a>&#x27;s case (supra), and this Court, in the case of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/52475/\" id=\"a_108\">Shivjee Prasad</a>&#x27; case                 (supra), both have noticed that the\n\n     expression &quot;any person&quot;, by itself, would mean and include &quot;all\n\n     persons&quot;, but only because it was qualified by the expression &quot;class\n\n     of persons&quot; it had to be restricted.

The reason is\n\n     simple as held by the Supreme Court in the case Raja Bhanu\n\n     Pratap Singh Vs. The Assistant Custodian, E.P., Bahraich,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                          -48-</span>\n\n\n\n     (AIR 1966 Supreme Court 245).                        While interpreting the\n\n     expression &quot;any other person&quot; in respect of <a href=\"/doc/1036526/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 10 (2) (n)</a> of\n\n     the Administration of Evacuee Properties Act, 1950, their Lordships\n\n     noticed the submission that &quot;any other person&quot; must be construed\n\n     ejesdem generis with &quot;evacuee&quot; or &quot;any member of his family&quot; only\n\n     to reject it. According to their Lordships, the rule of interpretation\n\n     ejesdem generis applies, where general word follow particular and\n\n     specific words of the same nature as itself. It has no application\n\n     where there is no genus or category indicated by the Legislature.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">                     84.11.                  Applying the said principle, as laid\n\n     down, in Raja Bhanu Pratap Singh (supra), to the present case,\n\n     it would be seen that the preceding expressions manufactory,\n\n     bottling plant, licence holders, having no common genus, at least,\n\n     if we consider the earlier stipulations in the section itself, which\n\n     talks of manufacture, bottling, distribution, sale, possession or\n\n     consumption. All are different in species and genus. Hence, the\n\n     rule of ejesdem generis would not apply to interpret the expression\n\n     &#x27;any person&#x27; and, therefore, the expression, &#x27;any person&#x27; now used\n\n     would include all persons. The impugned notification cannot, thus,\n\n     be held, if we may reiterate, to be bad on this count alone.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">                     2.

In other words,\n\n     whether <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, as amended, is authorizing\n\n     delegated legislation or conditional legislation?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">                     85.01.                  This issue is of some importance as\n\n     both, the amended <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act and the notification\n\n     issued thereunder, being notification, dated 05.04.2016, are under\n\n     challenge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">                     85.02.                  On behalf of the petitioners, the first\n\n     challenge is that <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act is a piece of delegated\n\n     legislation, which confers unbridled and unguided powers on the\n\n     State to issue notification, virtually superseding/abrogating the Act\n\n     itself. Being unchannelized and there being no legislative policy, as\n\n     contained in the legislation (the Act), the abdication of essential\n\n     legislative function would render the section ultra vires the\n\n     Constitution being a clear case of excessive delegation and,\n\n     consequently, the impugned notification, issued thereunder would\n\n     also be bad.        Alternatively, it is argued that the Act itself having\n\n     not provided any legislative guidelines, for the exercise of power\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, the guidelines are to be inferred\n\n     from the notified New Excise Policy, pursuant whereto, and in\n\n     furtherance whereof, <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, was amended and\n\n     notification was issued thereunder and if the notified policy is\n\n     studied and the scheme thereunder taken note of, then, the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                          -50-</span>\n\n\n\n     resultant notification would, undoubtedly, be in conflict with the\n\n     notified policy/guidelines rendering the notification invalid.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_105\">                     85.03.                    On the other hand, on behalf of the\n\n     State, it is submitted that <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, as amended,\n\n     and the notification issued thereunder is the result of a conditional\n\n     legislation alone and the delegation by <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act is,\n\n     thus, a valid piece of legislation. It is further submitted, on behalf\n\n     of the State, that the New Excise Policy itself provides for total\n\n     prohibition and the impugned notification, dated 05.04.2016, is\n\n     nothing but implementing the said policy and, therefore, the\n\n     impugned notification is not open to challenge on this ground.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"591481\" id=\"span_65\">85.04.                    In my view, the first thing that is to\n\n     be considered is, what is the nature of powers being delegated by\n\n     the amended <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act.

The distinction between\n                     conditional legislation          and delegated legislation\n                     is this that in the former the delegate&#x27;s\n                     power       is    that      of    determining   when    a\n                     legislative declared rule of conduct shall\n                     become effective; Hampton &amp; Co. v. United\n                     States, (1927) 276 US 394, and the latter\n                     involves delegation of rule making power\n                     which constitutionally may be exercised by\n                     the administrative agent. This means that\n                     the legislature having laid down the broad\n                     principles of its policy in the legislation can\n                     then leave the details to be supplied by the\n                     administrative authority. In other words by\n                     delegated legislation            the delegate completes\n                     the legislation by supplying details within\n                     the limits prescribed by the statute and in\n                     the case of conditional legislation the power of\n                     legislation is exercised by the legislature\n                     conditionally leaving to the discretion of an\n                     external authority the time and manner of\n                     carrying its legislation into effect as also the\n                     determination of the area to which it is to\n                     extend.

A reading of <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 19 (4)</a>\n\n     of the Act would show that it authorizes the State Government to\n\n     issue notification absolutely prohibiting various activities, either in\n\n     the whole of the State or in specified local areas, in respect of all or\n\n     any of the intoxicants, either totally or subject to such conditions\n\n     as may be prescribed.

In our opinion this\n                     portion of the section goes far beyond the\n                     purpose for which the Act was enacted and,\n                     the absence of the safeguards which the\n                     legislature has thought it necessary and\n                     expedient in other statutes e.g. the Indian\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                              -61-</span>\n\n\n\n                     <a href=\"/doc/1403255/\" id=\"a_179\">Drugs Act</a>, is an unreasonable restriction on\n                     the fundamental rights of the petitioners\n                     and therefore the first portion of the section\n                     i.e. &quot;any persons authorized by any of the\n                     provisions of this Act&quot; is unconstitutional.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">                     What       then          is     the     consequence       of    this\n                     unconstitutionality?

One of the questions that would arise\n\n     simultaneously, in case of delegated legislation, is, what can be\n\n     delegated?

It is now well established by the\n                     decision      of        this    Court    that    the   power     of\n                     delegation         is    a     constituent      element    of   the\n                     legislative power as a whole, and that in modern\n                     times when the Legislatures enact laws to meet\n                     the challenge of the complex socio-economic\n                     problems, they often find it convenient and\n                     necessary to delegate subsidiary or ancillary\n                     powers to delegates of their choice for carrying\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                            -62-</span>\n\n\n\n                     out the policy <a href=\"/doc/1340429/\" id=\"a_181\">laid down by</a> their Acts. The extent\n                     to which such delegation is permissible is also\n                     now well settled. The Legislature cannot delegate\n                     its essential legislative function in any case. It\n                     must lay down the legislative policy and\n                     principle, and           must      afford      guidance for\n                     carrying       out      the      said    policy     before   it\n                     delegates        its    subsidiary           powers   in   that\n                     behalf.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1355522\" id=\"span_89\">As has been observed by Mahajan C.

As noted\n\n     earlier, the Act does not indicate any legislative policy of either\n\n     prohibition or making liquor trade res extra commercium.

The NEP was notified in the Bihar Gazette\n\n     (Extraordinary), dated 21st December, 2015, for information of\n\n     general public, which is on record.

The NEP begins by stating that from\n\n     time to time, the Excise Policy underwent changes. The important\n\n     changes were carried out vide Excise Policy, 2007, whereunder\n\n     significant     increase      in   number         of     liquor    vends   to    increase\n\n     collections of excise duty, in the State, was done. Changes were\n\n     made to curtail tendencies of monopoly in the trade by allowing the\n\n     process of allotment of shops and that efforts were made to curb\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                          -70-</span>\n\n\n\n     illegal trading. Though this policy resulted in expected increase in\n\n     excise duty in the State, some negative impacts also surfaced in\n\n     the NEP, &quot;It was noticed that most adverse impact was on\n\n     the poorest class of people.                     Adverse consequences were\n\n     subsequently experienced in rural areas.&quot;                     The NEP also\n\n     stated, &quot;In this background, the State Government felt the\n\n     need to reconsider its Excise Policy of 2007. In this point of\n\n     view, it was decided to frame New Excise Policy, 2015.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">                     86.05.                  What is of immense importance to\n\n     note, now, is that the object of this New Excise Policy, 2015, was\n\n     clearly stated to be to implement total ban on consumption of\n\n     alcohol all over the State and this would be enforced in a phased\n\n     manner.       No wonder, therefore, that the NEP announced that in\n\n     the first phase, country liquor and spiced country liquor shall be\n\n     banned all over the State and no licence for the same would be\n\n     granted from 1st April, 2016 and, with effect from 1stApril, 2016,\n\n     only foreign liquor/IMFL would be available in urban areas only,\n\n     i.e., Municipal Corporation and Municipal Council level.            All vends\n\n     shall be &quot;off&quot;. All bars and all restaurants, in areas other than\n\n     Municipal Corporation and Municipal Council, would cease to\n\n     operate and those permitted, within the territorial areas of\n\n     Municipal Corporation and Municipal Council, would sell only foreign\n\n     liquor/IMFL.         The Bihar State Beverages Corporation Limited\n\n     (hereinafter, in short, referred to as the &#x27;BSBCL&#x27;) would only be the\n\n     authorized body to operate these vends/shops.

BSBCL shall mandatorily keep one depot\n\n     for foreign liquor/IMFL in all districts.            The NEP reflects that the\n\n     State Government resolved to ensure that rural public voluntarily\n\n     moves towards prohibition of alcohol to achieve this objective\n\n     social movement was necessary. De-addiction centers were to be\n\n     opened accordingly in all districts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">                     86.06.

The\n\n     Committee was to issue guidelines and take decisions for opening\n\n     of new shops as per requirement, keeping in view the coverage of\n\n     foreign liquor shops from the point of view of prohibition, tourism,\n\n     etc.     Further, this Committee was also to fix guidelines for\n\n     provisions in the army establishments.

For\n\n     exercise of this drastic action, is there any statutory guideline?\n\n     These are unavoidably momentous questions, which the State\n\n     ought to have answered, but has chosen not to answer or explain\n\n     except asserting that the State Government has such power under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 19 (4)</a> and it has chosen to exercise that power with no\n\n     guidelines having been provided by the legislation.

The      narration   of     facts   and    the\n\n     sequence of events as noted above, make it clear that if the policy\n\n     statement, as published, were to offer any guidelines for exercise\n\n     of power under <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, then, it surely did not\n\n     mandate sudden abrupt issuance of the impugned notification on\n\n     05.04.2016 and, thus, the Section itself, having not provided any\n\n     guidelines, and the policy having not authorized, such an action, as\n\n     the impugned notification conveys, one cannot escape from the\n\n     fact that exercise of power by the State Government, in issuing the\n\n     impugned notification, dated 05.04.2016, was completely, in\n\n     exercise of unguided, uncanalized and unfettered powers given to\n\n     the State by <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 19 (4)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">                      86.17.                  Coupled with the above, as the State\n\n     legislature was well aware of the State&#x27;s New Excise Policy, 2015,\n\n     the legislative intendment has to be inferred to be that the\n\n     legislature did not mean to impose complete prohibition, but\n\n     making the State move towards complete prohibition gradually, but\n\n     surely,     as    the   NEP     authorized       complete     ban     on    the   sale,\n\n     consumption, etc., of country made liquor, the exercise of the\n\n     delegated authority by the State, under <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act,\n\n     in issuing the impugned notification, imposing complete ban on\n\n     foreign liquor/IMFL, would be clearly arbitrary and ultra vires\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

Thus, actions, under specific policy decisions, were\n\n     enumerated; but in the absence of the policy of suddenly\n\n     prohibiting wholesale and retail trade and consumption of foreign\n\n     liquor/IMFL, the notification, issued by the State Government, was\n\n     totally uncalled for and in conflict with the NEP as notified.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_110\">86.18.

While on this subject, I may note\n\n     another argument of the State. It is submitted that <a href=\"/doc/34199990/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 19 (4)</a>\n\n     of the Bihar Excise Act, being part of legislative enactment, and\n\n     brought in by an amendment, could not be controlled by policy\n\n     guidelines. The notification issued thereunder cannot be tested by\n\n     policy guidelines earlier issued and notified.                   In my view, the\n\n     submission cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">                     86.20.                    As noted earlier, the new Excise\n\n     Policy, 2015, clearly envisaged total prohibition, but to be imposed\n\n     in a phased manner.               It clearly predicated total prohibition in\n\n     respect of country liquor with effect from 01.04.2016, but not so\n\n     with regard to IMFL or foreign liquor. With regard to the later, it\n\n     clearly lays down policy guideline as to how trade in foreign\n\n     liquor/IMFL would be monopolized by the State, there would be no\n\n     sale in rural areas and licences for Bars would only be limited to\n\n     urban areas of municipalities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">                     86.21.                    Thus, the clear notified policy was of\n\n     continuance        of    sale,        etc.,   of   foreign    liquor/IMFL    beyond\n\n     01.04.2016, though in a restricted and channelised manner. It is\n\n     pursuant to this policy, as noted earlier, that the Act was amended\n\n     and power conferred on the State, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 19(4)</a> of the\n\n     Act, to effectuate the Policy.

Coming to the second question,\n                     namely, the issuance of notification by the State\n                     Government in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/99572996/\" id=\"a_228\">Section 7</a>\n                     of the Bihar Finance Act, it is true that issuance\n                     of such notifications entitles the industrial units\n                     to avail of the incentives and benefits declared by\n                     the    State     government           in   its    own    industrial\n                     incentive      policy.    But      in      exercise      of   such\n                     power, it would not be permissible for the\n                     State     Government             to     deny      any     benefit,\n                     which is otherwise available to an industrial\n                     unit under the incentive policy itself. The\n                     industrial incentive policy is issued by the\n                     State      Government             after      such       policy   is\n                     approved by the Cabinet itself. The issuance\n                     of the notification under <a href=\"/doc/99572996/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 7</a> of the\n                     Bihar       Finance         Act       is     by     the       State\n                     Government           in     the       Finance      Department\n                     which notification is issued to carry out the\n                     objectives and the policy decisions taken in\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                          -82-</span>\n\n\n\n                     the industrial policy itself. In this view of the\n                     matter, any notification issued by government\n                     order in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/99572996/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 7</a> of the\n                     Bihar Finance Act, if is found to be repugnant\n                     to    the     industrial          policy    declared     in   a\n                     government            resolution,          then,   the    said\n                     notification must be held to be bad to that\n                     extent. In the case in hand, the notification\n                     issued by the State Government on 4-4-1994 has\n                     been examined by the High Court and has been\n                     found, rightly, to be contrary to the Industrial\n                     Incentive Policy, more particularly, the policy\n                     engrafted in clause 10.4(i)(b). Consequently, the\n                     High Court was fully justified in striking down\n                     that part of the notification which is repugnant to\n                     sub-clause (b) of clause 10.4(i) and we do not\n                     find any error committed by the High Court in\n                     striking down the said notification. We are not\n                     persuaded to accept the contention of Mr\n                     Dwivedi that it would be open for the\n                     Government            to    issue      a    notification      in\n                     exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/99572996/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 7</a> of the\n                     Bihar Finance Act, which may override the\n                     incentive policy itself. In our considered\n                     opinion, the expression &quot;such conditions\n                     and restrictions as it may impose&quot; in sub-\n                     section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/99572996/\" id=\"a_232\">Section 7</a> of the Bihar Finance\n                     Act will not authorise the State Government\n                     to negate the incentives and benefits which\n                     any     industrial         unit    would     be    otherwise\n                     entitled       to     under         the     general      policy\n                     resolution itself. In this view of the matter, we\n                     see no illegality with the impugned judgment of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                          -83-</span>\n\n\n\n                     the High Court in striking down a part of the\n                     notification dated 4-4-1994.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">                                                       (Emphasis is supplied)\n\n                     86.23.                  Thus          seen,      the       policy     did   not\n\n     envisage complete prohibition, at least, immediately in respect of\n\n     foreign liquor/IMFL. To the contrary, it had provided how the sales\n\n     would only be controlled and curtailed; yet the executive, contrary\n\n     to the notified policy, issued the notification, which, on the above\n\n     precedent, has to be held to be bad in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168037\" id=\"span_117\">86.24.

I have already referred to various\n\n     provisions, other than <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Act, to show that the\n\n     Act is basically for regulating the manufacturing, trade and\n\n     business of intoxicating liquor and for augmenting State revenue.\n\n     It gives no legislative intent for being an Act for imposing\n\n     prohibition, as is commonly understood.             Prohibition came about\n\n     upon a movement started in South India in the 4th decade of the\n\n     last century. Several provinces enacted independent provisions by\n\n     independent legislation dealing with prohibition. For the provinces\n\n     of Bihar and Orissa, too, the <a href=\"/doc/196852864/\" id=\"a_237\">Bihar Prohibition Act, 1938</a>, was\n\n     enacted, while at that time the <a href=\"/doc/41072484/\" id=\"a_238\">Bihar Excise Act</a> 1915 was already\n\n     there.      <a href=\"/doc/196852864/\" id=\"a_239\">Bihar Prohibition Act, 1938</a>, had elaborate provisions\n\n     dealing separately with different aspects of the matter. If one goes\n\n     through the provisions of this <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_240\">Prohibition Act</a>, it would be seen that\n\n     there is ample provision for imposing prohibition and, once that is\n\n     done, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_241\">Bihar Excise Act, 1915</a>, to that extent\n\n     would      stand      superseded/repealed.         The   legislature,   thus,\n\n     understood very well that <a href=\"/doc/41072484/\" id=\"a_242\">Bihar Excise Act</a> was not an Act, which\n\n     was to be used for imposing prohibition.                   While imposing\n\n     prohibition in the State under the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_243\">Prohibition Act</a>, various things\n\n     had to be taken care of, the transition period from non-prohibition\n\n     State to prohibition State, special provisions for travellers, visitors,\n\n     people travelling through the territory of the State from outside the\n\n     State to a place outside the State, movements of liquor from\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                          -87-</span>\n\n\n\n     outside the State to another place outside the State but, passing\n\n     through the territory of the State, and such other provisions, which\n\n     are not incorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_244\">Bihar Excise Act, 1915</a>. The reason\n\n     being simple that the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_245\">Bihar Excise Act, 1915</a>, was never intended\n\n     to be an Act empowering the State to impose prohibition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"52475\" id=\"span_123\">In this\n\n     connection, I may refer to the Division Bench judgment of this\n\n     Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/52475/\" id=\"a_246\">Shivjee Prasad Vs.

It is baffling to the mind\n                     as to why and how without even mentioning any\n                     provision of the 1938              <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_247\">Prohibition       Act</a> the\n                     notification was sought to be issued and actually\n                     issued on 27th March, 1979. It was purported to\n                     be so done in the exercise of power vested in the\n                     State Government by Sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/168539901/\" id=\"a_248\">Section\n                     19</a>    of   1915      Act.        Even   the     policymakers,\n                     therefore, cannot be said to be oblivious of the\n                     fact and the legal position that there was a law of\n                     prohibition      which should be made effective and\n                     forceful throughout the territory of the State with\n                     regard to intoxicating liquors and drugs.

The expression &quot;State shall endeavour&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">     clearly leaves it to the State to decide whether to impose\n\n     prohibition or not if so, when. If what was argued by the State,\n\n     that it was a constitutional mandate to impose prohibition, is\n\n     correct, then, by now, almost after 65 years of the Constitution,\n\n     the entire country should have imposed prohibition, which has\n\n     never happened. Can it be said that all the States are in violation\n\n     of the constitutional mandate? The answer is obviously no.                         The\n\n     second argument, canvassed by the State, was that once State\n\n     decides to act pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_288\">Article 47</a> of the Constitution, then, no\n\n     citizen can claim any right, much less right under Part-III of the\n\n     Constitution.

Even there,\n\n     the concept of reasonable restriction, creation of monopoly vis-à-\n\n     vis <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_295\">Article 19 (6)</a> of the Constitution itself predicated the right\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 19 (1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, in absence whereof, the\n\n     question of applicability or invocation of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_297\">Article 19 (6)</a> would not\n\n     arise.      Judgments would show that where there is no total\n\n     prohibition imposed, then, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 14</a> would have its application.\n\n     Similarly, with expanding interpretation of the right to privacy, as\n\n     contained in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_299\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, a citizen has a right to\n\n     choose how he lives, so long as he is not a nuisance to the society.\n\n     State cannot dictate what he will eat and what he will drink. We\n\n     have to view this concept in changing times, where international\n\n     barriers are vanishing. Any restriction by a State, on the right to\n\n     choose what to eat and what to drink, apart from being invasion of\n\n     right of privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_300\">Article 21</a>, would prejudicially affect free\n\n     movement and free residence, in any part of territory of India, for\n\n     the citizens.       Keeping in view these factors, a citizen cannot be\n\n     prohibited from his choice, within the confines of his house, subject\n\n     to orderly behaviour, of enjoying his drink, which he can procure\n\n     from any other part of the country, where prohibition is not in\n\n     force.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"993111\" id=\"span_145\">Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                          -99-</span>\n\n\n\n                     88.05.

Individual autonomy, perhaps\n                     the central concern of any system of limited\n                     Government, is protected in part under our\n                     Constitution by explicit constitutional guarantees.\n                     In    the    application         of   the    Constitution       our\n                     contemplation cannot only be of what has been\n                     but what may be. Time works changes and brings\n                     into existence new conditions. Subtler and far\n                     reaching means of invading privacy will make it\n                     possible to be heard in the street what is\n                     whispered       in    the     closet.     Yet,    too   broad     a\n                     definition of privacy raises serious questions\n                     about the propriety of judicial reliance on a right\n                     that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of course,\n                     privacy     primarily       concerns        the   individual.    It\n                     therefore      relates      to    and     overlaps      with    the\n                     concept of liberty. The most serious advocate of\n                     privacy must confess that there are serious\n                     problems of defining the essence and scope of\n                     the right.

Consumption of alcohol in a disciplined and\n\n     responsible manner is not per se unconstitutional, especially, if we\n\n     look to the global context, opening of economy and lowering of\n\n     international frontiers as also the fact that in majority of the States\n\n     of this country including those where there is extensive controls\n\n     (partial prohibition), consumption of alcohol by an individual in\n\n     their house is not banned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_178\">                     88.17.

I may note that the Constitution does not differentiate\n\n     or distinguishes between liquor trade or trade or business in any\n\n     other commodity.            It is Judge-made law that distinguishes the\n\n     rights in respect thereof. The present scenario in this State is that\n\n     manufacturing of IMFL is permitted in Bihar. Manufacturing of beer\n\n     is also permitted in Bihar, though in respect of both sale in Bihar is\n\n     prohibited.      Tari (toddy) is totally unregulated except the places,\n\n     where or in the vicinity whereof, it cannot be sold. It is not denied\n\n     by the State that alcohol content of tari is equal if not more than\n\n     beer. If these things are kept in mind, then can it be said that the\n\n     State is seeking to impose total prohibition or creating total State\n\n     monopoly.        It certainly cannot be said so.        Even if we consider\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_353\">Article 47</a> of the Constitution, it does not make it obligatory to\n\n     impose prohibition. The use of expression &quot;endeavour&quot; therein\n\n     shows that it has to come in a phased manner and not over night\n\n     to make something, which was legal for centuries, illegal suddenly\n\n     without warning of time to readjust.

They have no right to market. I\n\n     am surprised. An industry is set up as business venture and not to\n\n     do charity. Industry is established looking to local market. Merely\n\n     because market is available elsewhere, the local market, which is a\n\n     substantial market, having been taken away, the financial viability\n\n     itself is adversely affected.             Industry has to pay wages to the\n\n     workers. It has to make profits and to repay loans. It has other\n\n     statutory obligations to discharge; but, if substantial market is\n\n     taken away for its products, can it be said that practically, it make\n\n     little or no difference. If they have now to close down, who pays\n\n     compensation to workers and where do the workers go. The\n\n     restriction to sell its products for which it had primarily been set\n\n     up, can the restriction be held to be valid?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_178\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513801\" id=\"span_179\">88.02.

In this\n\n     connection, so far as the beer bars and restaurants are concerned,\n\n     as noticed earlier, the new Excise Policy did not restrict the\n\n     licensing thereof in urban areas, where they are predominately\n\n     situated. Keeping in view the new Excise Policy that their licences\n\n     would be renewed, they made substantial investments.

State, being State, within the meaning of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_368\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, has to act fairly and reasonably in all\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                                          -115-</span>\n\n\n\n     matters. It cannot say that a prohibition notification issued under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_369\">Section 19(4)</a> of the Act would override the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/174512241/\" id=\"a_370\">Sections\n\n     43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/164439770/\" id=\"a_371\">45</a> of the Act. If that be the stand of the State, then, the\n\n     action would clearly be confiscatory and, therefore, unreasonable\n\n     and ultra vires. It is too late in the day for the State to say that\n\n     what was legitimate till yesterday, we have today declared\n\n     illegitimate and illegal and for illegality, we do not have to\n\n     compensate. This is what makes the notification unreasonable and\n\n     void.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_186\">                     88.05.                  We may notice, now, the distilleries,\n\n     which had been in operation for over half a century, its local\n\n     market having been taken away, we have been informed that it\n\n     has decided to close it down. What is the effect of closure?                Not\n\n     only the phenomenal excise duty, which it was paying is lost for\n\n     which no one can make a grievance, because the Government\n\n     considers it justifiable loss; but what about the hundreds of\n\n     workers and their families, who were solely dependent upon it for\n\n     their living. There has been no consideration of this aspect by the\n\n     State.     The entire burden to pay the retrenchment compensation\n\n     and the like fall on the industry itself.              How will it discharge its\n\n     liability towards financial institutions, no thought has been given to\n\n     that by the State.

If he has to move to\n\n     this State and has an option, he would not do so, because he\n\n     would have to give up his life style.

In the first case, he\n\n     has pleaded that all along, his long career in the defence forces, he\n\n     was used to taking liquor regularly. Even after retirement, his\n\n     liquor    ration continues. Being domicile             of this State, upon\n\n     retirement, he is living in Patna. He picks up his ration of liquor\n\n     from Danapur Cantonment within the district of Patna; but, now,\n\n     all of a sudden, he cannot bring it home nor can he drink at home\n\n     and his long habit has come to an end, considerably upsetting him.\n\n     He cannot even go to the Cantonment to have a drink for fear of\n\n     being hounded on way back to home outside the Cantonment.

Thus, in my view, a citizen has a\n\n     right to enjoy his liquor within the confines of his house in an\n\n     orderly fashion and that right would be a part of right of privacy, a\n\n     fundamental right, under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_377\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and, any\n\n     deprivation thereof would have to withstand the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_378\">Articles 14</a>\n\n     and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_379\">19</a> of the Constitution as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_191\">                     88.10.                  Here, I would also like to notice that\n\n     the new Excise Policy, 2015, clearly acknowledged that the\n\n     problem with liquor was acute so far as the poor strata of the\n\n     citizens are concerned, especially, in rural areas, to whom country\n\n     liquor was cheaply and freely available.              The unfortunate fact is\n\n     that it was the State that encouraged cheap and easy availability of\n\n     country liquor for the poor in the past years. This is acknowledged\n\n     in the NEP 2015 itself. The policy itself did not say nor were there\n\n     any facts to justify, that this was a noticeable problem in urban\n\n     areas (municipalities). The policy clearly envisaged that in urban\n\n     areas, the sale of liquor (foreign liquor/IMFL) would continue,\n\n     though monopolized through BSBCL.                 As noted elsewhere, after\n\n     amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_380\">Bihar Excise Act, 1915</a>, on 31.03.2016,\n\n     pursuant to the aforesaid notified New Excise Policy, 2015, on\n\n     31.03.2016, State banned manufacture and sale of country liquor,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                                          -118-</span>\n\n\n\n     which was the cheap liquor available to the poor at their door\n\n     steps.     Curious to note that toddy (Tari), which is available in\n\n     abundance and tapped freely without any licence or permit and\n\n     sold freely not only in the rural areas but urban areas and which\n\n     has alcohol content, undisputedly matching or above beer, has not\n\n     been prohibited. It is freely available even today. There is no\n\n     notification barring it. Then to say, that on one hand toddy can be\n\n     freely tapped and sold unchecked, but foreign liquor or IMFL\n\n     including beer cannot be sold or consumed does not stand to\n\n     reason, if the true object of the State was to implement <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_381\">Article 47</a>\n\n     of the Constitution. Further, State has not prohibited manufacture\n\n     of IMFL/beer.          Apart from others, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_382\">Article 14</a> would clearly be\n\n     violated here. I may not be misunderstood, at this juncture, to be\n\n     referring to trade and commerce in Toddy merely for comparing it\n\n     with other liquor trade; but a reference thereto was necessary to\n\n     show that even after the Notification under <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_383\">Section 19(4)</a>, dated\n\n     05.04.2016, tapping, possession, sale and consumption of alcohol\n\n     in the shape of Tari (Toddy) is not banned. Would not that be a\n\n     case of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_384\">Article 14.</a> The Policy was to protect the poor;\n\n     but they are allowed unrestricted access to it through Tari but\n\n     IMFL/beer/foreign liquor is banned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">                     88.11.

Will it not be an\n\n     unreasonable restriction on the right to privacy enjoyed by an\n\n     individual in contradiction to trade or business.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_193\">                     88.12.                  In my view, it would clearly be an\n\n     unreasonable restriction and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_385\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_386\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_387\">21</a> of\n\n     the constitution. The notification, dated 05.04.2016, would, thus,\n\n     be bad if it were enforced against individuals.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_194\">                     88.13.                  Another aspect of unreasonableness\n\n     of the effect of the notification is its application to various other\n\n     aspects. A person traveling by car or by train and traversing the\n\n     territory of Bihar, he is caught in a predicament that he is going\n\n     from a State, where there is no prohibition, and going to State,\n\n     where there is no prohibition.               He may be an army or defence\n\n     personnel carrying his liquor ration or a ordinary citizen carrying\n\n     his drink to his destination. Neither of them consumed the same in\n\n     this State; still they are to be persecuted and prosecuted why?\n\n     Their only sin is that they chose or perforce traversed the territory\n\n     of Bihar. Similar would be the case of liquor being transported from\n\n     one State to another, but crossing through Bihar. As noted\n\n     elsewhere in this judgment, the <a href=\"/doc/196852864/\" id=\"a_388\">Bihar Prohibition Act, 1938</a>, does\n\n     take note of these situations.               The Legislature, when amending\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_389\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Bihar Excise Act, 1915, must be presumed to\n\n     be aware of the said Act and surely did not expect and/or authorize\n\n     the executive to ignore or override the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_390\">Prohibition Act</a>. Instances\n\n     have been brought to the notice of the Court that people traveling\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                                          -120-</span>\n\n\n\n     by train passing through Bihar, including army personnel, even\n\n     though not found consuming liquor but merely in possession\n\n     thereof, have been arrested and are being prosecuted.                   For these\n\n     transactions, it has to be held that the notification, dated 5th April,\n\n     2016, would have no application for it deals only with wholesale,\n\n     retail trade and consumption and no other aspect. Thus, the\n\n     notification, as impugned, would be ultra vires the Constitution\n\n     being unreasonable restriction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_195\">                     7. Regarding Punishment\n\n                     89.00.                  Now, I may come to one of the last\n\n     challenges that is in respect of punishment for offences under the\n\n     Act, which have been introduced by the amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/7128056/\" id=\"a_391\">Bihar\n\n     Excise Act, 1915</a>, made on 31.03.2016.                      Punishments are under\n\n     three categories:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_4\">                     (i)     Personal punishment and fine;\n\n                     (ii)    Confiscation of premises; and\n\n                     (iii)   Collective fine.\n\n                     89.01.                  The submission is that though the\n\n     legislature      has     the    right    to      provide   for   punishments   for\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">     contravention of provisions of Acts made by the legislature, the\n\n     procedure and the punishment has to be fair and not draconian,\n\n     for, that would be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_392\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The\n\n     punishment cannot be disproportionate to the offence.                     By the\n\n     present amendments to the Sections, to which I will refer to in\n\n     detail, it is submitted that virtually, the punishment for any offence\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                          -121-</span>\n\n\n\n     has been prescribed as not less than 10 years, which may extend\n\n     to imprisonment for life and with fine, which shall not be less than\n\n     Rs. one lakh, but may extend to Rs. ten lakhs. It is submitted that\n\n     firstly, it totally takes away the discretion of the Court to give a\n\n     lesser sentence depending upon the mitigating circumstances.\n\n     Then, it is highly disproportionate and can be termed as draconian.\n\n     The simple illustration for this would be that there being no\n\n     provision for licence, permit or pass, now, under the Act, any\n\n     person, in possession of liquor, even in course of transit through\n\n     the State, would be liable to 10 years of imprisonment with fine of\n\n     Rs. one lakh mandatorily.              It is then submitted that if liquor is\n\n     found in a room or in a house, which may or may not be occupied\n\n     by large number of people, the whole premises would be sealed\n\n     and confiscated. The third is that <a href=\"/doc/129906503/\" id=\"a_393\">Section 68I</a> dealing with collective\n\n     fine is too vague, uncertain and has no procedural safeguards.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_197\">                     89.02.                  On behalf of the State, it is submitted\n\n     that the legislature, having the plenary power to legislate and\n\n     provide for punishment, are the best Judge and the Court cannot\n\n     and should not interfere in the legislative wisdom.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_198\">                     89.03.                  Now,     I   proceed   to   consider   the\n\n     arguments.         The first thing, I would like to point out is that\n\n     punishments by itself cannot be seen but have to be seen along\n\n     with the procedure, for, the procedure may create certain liability,\n\n     which, coupled with the punishment, would made things worse. To\n\n     be precise, first, I may refer to <a href=\"/doc/113152166/\" id=\"a_394\">Section 48</a> of the Act, as amended,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                           -122-</span>\n\n\n\n     which is quoted hereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">                                     48.

This provision reverses the criminal\n\n     jurisprudence of prosecution having the liability to prove the guilt\n\n     beyond reasonable doubt. Here, a person is presumed to be guilty\n\n     unless he proves to the contrary. The presumption of innocence is\n\n     totally taken away and the burden of proof thereof is put on the\n\n     accused.

For any reason, if he fails to prove his innocence, he\n\n     would straightway be liable to punishment, which would be of\n\n     minimum 10 years imprisonment with astronomical fine and would\n\n     lose his entire property by virtue of confiscation and the Courts are\n\n     rendered helpless in the matter even though there may be\n\n     mitigating circumstances.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">                                     &quot;47.

Petitioners have shown and drawn attention of the\n\n     Court to penal provisions of the two other Acts, which, I think\n\n     would be relevant. The first is the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_400\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\n\n     Substances Act, 1985</a>. With reference to <a href=\"/doc/103220878/\" id=\"a_401\">Sections 15</a>, <a href=\"/doc/103787060/\" id=\"a_402\">17</a>, <a href=\"/doc/18234153/\" id=\"a_403\">18</a> and\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/112908320/\" id=\"a_404\">22</a> thereof, it is shown that while providing for punishment in\n\n     relation to poppy straw, opium, opium poppy and psychotropic\n\n     substances respectively, there is graded punishment in the sense\n\n     where      contravention        involves         small    quantity,   the    maximum\n\n     punishment is six months imprisonment or with fine, which may\n\n     extend to Rs. 10,000.00 or both.                        For contravention involving\n\n     quantities more than small quantity, but less then commercial\n\n     quantity, the punishment extends to 10 years with fine, which may\n\n     extend to Rs. one lakh and when it involves commercial quantity\n\n     the punishment is not less than 10 years imprisonment with fine\n\n     not less than Rs. one lakh, but may extend to Rs. 2 lakhs.\n\n     Reference may, then, be made to <a href=\"/doc/64007224/\" id=\"a_405\">Section 27</a> of the Act, which is\n\n     punishment in relation to consumption of Narcotic Drugs or\n\n     Psychotropic Substances, the punishment is maximum one year\n\n     with fine up to Rs.20,000.00.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_212\">                     89.07.                  The       provisions    would       show   that,\n\n     except for commercial quantity, there is ample discretion on the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                          -129-</span>\n\n\n\n     Court.     It is not that any quantity is found, the punishment of\n\n     imprisonment would be mandatory and, that too, like in the <a href=\"/doc/41072484/\" id=\"a_406\">Bihar\n\n     Excise Act</a>, minimum of 10 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_213\">                     89.08.

A reference to the provision would show\n\n     that for the acts mentioned therein, the punishment is straightway\n\n     10 years of imprisonment extending to life.                        It takes away the\n\n     power of the Court or the discretion of the Court in the matter and\n\n     further it has to be accompanied with a fine of Rs. one lakh\n\n     minimum.

This has to\n\n     be seen in juxtaposition of presumption clause as contained in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/113152166/\" id=\"a_415\">Section 48</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">                     89.12.                  Now, I may refer to <a href=\"/doc/148870647/\" id=\"a_416\">Section 53</a> of the\n\n     Act, which has varied punishment from not less then five years to\n\n     not less than ten years.

In <a href=\"/doc/181598145/\" id=\"a_417\">Section 54</a> of the\n\n     Act, the punishment goes up to minimum eight years extending to\n\n     ten years with fine that may extend to Rs. ten lakhs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">                     89.13.                  Now, I may refer to <a href=\"/doc/106975222/\" id=\"a_418\">Section 68</a> A(e),\n\n     in so far as relevant along with <a href=\"/doc/4733677/\" id=\"a_419\">Section 68G</a> of the Act. What it\n\n     predicates is that where any premises or part thereof is or has\n\n     been used for committing any offence under this Act, the same can\n\n     be sealed but liable to be confiscated also. The arbitrariness of the\n\n     provision is apparent from the fact that even when the owner of\n\n     the premises may not at all be aware of what is being done in his\n\n     premises, premises being rented out, in view of presumption\n\n     clause, as contained in <a href=\"/doc/113152166/\" id=\"a_420\">Section 48</a> of the Act, for an offence\n\n     committed by his tenant or anyone in his permissive possession,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">                                          -132-</span>\n\n\n\n     over which he has no control, his premises would be confiscated.\n\n     There may not be a more draconian provision.                  A house may\n\n     consist of several rooms occupied by different members of the\n\n     family. A particular member violates the law, the family premises\n\n     is up for confiscation.              I may further illustrate that if two\n\n     neighbours are on inimical terms, one could easily plant liquor in\n\n     the neighbours premises, the neighbour, being unaware; still, by\n\n     virtue of the presumption clause, not only he gets convicted but his\n\n     premises also get confiscated. These common day illustrations can\n\n     be multiplied to show the draconian effect of the law. The effect of\n\n     these provisions is virtually that we are converting the State into a\n\n     Police State. Citizens would always be living under a threat or, at\n\n     least, a threat perception of being easily implicated. That surely is\n\n     not conducive and should not be permitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1438183\" id=\"span_201\">89.14.

The     presumption                attached    to\n                     these laws is that they are meant to cater to\n                     the societal demands and meet the challenges\n                     of the time, for the legislature is presumed to\n                     be supremely wise and aware of such needs\n                     and challenges. The means for redressing a\n                     mischief are also in the realm of legislation and\n                     so long as those means are not violative of the\n                     constitutional provisions or the fundamental\n                     rights of the citizens, the courts will show\n                     deference towards them. That, however, is not\n                     to say that laws that are outrageously barbaric\n                     or penalties that are palpably inhuman or\n                     shockingly disproportionate to the gravity of\n                     the offence for which the same are prescribed\n                     cannot be interfered with.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"590378\" id=\"span_216\">89.21.

In        R.   v.

What must be demonstrated is that\n                     the        sentence             is        so           outrageously\n                     disproportionate that the Canadians would find\n                     the punishment abhorrent or intolerable.

The\n\n     notification, dated 05.04.2016, in respect of foreign liquor is being\n\n     quoted hereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">                                     &quot;In exercise of the powers conferred\n                     under <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_462\">Section 19 (4)</a> of the Bihar Excise Act,\n                     1915 (as amended by <a href=\"/doc/41072484/\" id=\"a_463\">Bihar Excise (Amendment)\n                     Act,    2016</a>),      the      State     Government      hereby\n                     imposes ban on wholesale or retail trade and\n                     consumption of foreign liquor by any license\n                     holder or any person in the whole of the State of\n                     Bihar with immediate effect.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_239\">                     90.02.                  A    simple     comparison     of   the   two\n\n     notifications issued by the same authority, in a short interval of\n\n     time under the same section of the Act, would clearly bring about\n\n     the    distinction      in   the    scope        and   applicability   of   the   two\n\n     notifications.      Further, <a href=\"/doc/169613240/\" id=\"a_464\">Section 19 (1)</a> of the Act has not been\n\n     repealed. It permits possession of intoxicant (liquor) not in excess\n\n     of quantity so specified by the Board of Revenue.                      The quantity\n\n     permitted by the Board of Revenue and not disputed by State is\n\n     notified and not cancelled.                 Similarly, even under the newly\n\n     amended <a href=\"/doc/38978497/\" id=\"a_465\">Section 47(g)</a>, possession up to prescribed quantity is not\n\n     penal. Thus, mere possession of IMFL/foreign liquor/beer is not\n\n     prohibited. To me, if it were to be so prohibited, it would give rise\n\n     to serious problems. All persons, having legitimate stocks even for\n\n     personal consumption, would on the next day ipso facto, become\n\n     criminals, in violation of law, the Beverages Corporation included.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">          Patna High Court CWJC No.6675 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                                   -142-</span>\n\n\n\n              So also manufacturers, transporters etc.              Advisedly this was not\n\n              intended.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_241\">                              90.03.                  To conclude, in my opinion, <a href=\"/doc/37226668/\" id=\"a_466\">Section\n\n              19(4)</a> of the Bihar Excise Act, 1915, as amended with effect from\n\n              01.04.2016 (passed by the State Legislatures on 31.03.2016) is\n\n              ultra vires the Constitution and unenforceable.
