From     the   testimony       of    Sunita       as   also\n\n\n\n\n     prosecutrix, it is evident that after attending the farewell\n\n\n\n\n\n     function in the school, prosecutrix was not to return home\n\n     but to spend the night in the house of her Mausi, who\n\n\n\n\n\n     lived closeby. It is the specific case of the prosecution\n\n     that instead of going to the house of her Mausi,\n\n     prosecutrix went to spend the night in the house of her\n\n     friend Kanchan (PW-10), where she met accused Varun\n\n     Kumar, who took her to Una.              Prosecution has also\n\n     examined Lalita (PW-9), another friend of the prosecutrix.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:48:31 :::HCHP</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">                                ...22...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">     We find that both Kanchan and Lalita have not supported\n\n     the prosecution.      They were declared hostile and\n\n\n\n\n                                                         .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">     extensively cross-examined by the prosecution.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">     34.         From the conjoint reading of testimonies of\n\n     these witnesses, it appears that accused Varun Kumar\n\n\n\n\n\n     tried to set up a defence of familiarity and consent. Effort\n\n     is made to establish that prosecutrix knew him from\n\n\n\n\n\n     before and voluntarily went with him.           Such fact still\n\n     would not absolve accused Varun Kumar from his\n\n     complicity in the alleged crime. Kanchan does admit that\n\n     she knew accused Varun Kumar alias Sonu very well. But\n\n     then she was confronted with her previous statement,\n\n     duly proved by the Investigating Officer, wherein she had\n\n\n\n     categorically stated to the police that accused took the\n\n     prosecutrix in a private Bus towards Una. She also admits\n\n\n\n\n     that she had given the telephone number of accused\n\n\n\n\n\n     Sonu to the family members of the prosecutrix.                 She\n\n\n\n\n\n     admits that accused Varun used to treat her as also Lalita\n\n     as his sisters.    Thus, to our mind version of the\n\n     prosecutrix, that from the house of Kanchan she was\n\n     taken away by the accused cannot be said to be false.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">     35.

Respect for reputation of women in the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 society shows the basic civility of a civilised\n                 society. No member of society can afford to\n                 conceive the idea that he can create a hollow in\n                 the honour of a woman. Such thinking is not\n                 only lamentable but also deplorable. It would\n\n\n\n\n\n                 not be an exaggeration to say that the thought\n                 of sullying the physical frame of a woman is the\n                 demolition of the accepted civilized norm, i.e.,\n                 &quot;physical morality&quot;. In such a sphere,\n                 impetuosity has no room. The youthful\n               r excitement has no place. It should be\n\n                 paramount in everyone&#x27;s mind that, on one\n                 hand, the society as a whole cannot preach\n                 from the pulpit about social, economic and\n                 political equality of the sexes and, on the other,\n                 some pervert members of the same society\n\n\n                 dehumanize the woman by attacking her body\n                 and ruining her chastity. It is an assault on the\n                 individuality and inherent dignity of a woman\n                 with the mindset that she should be elegantly\n\n\n\n\n                 servile to men. Rape is a monstrous burial of\n                 her dignity in the darkness. It is a crime against\n                 the holy body of a woman and the soul of the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 society and such a crime is aggravated by the\n                 manner in which it has been committed. We\n                 have emphasised on the manner because, in\n\n\n\n\n\n                 the present case, the victim is an eight year old\n                 girl who possibly would be deprived of the\n                 dreams of &quot;Spring of Life&quot; and might be\n                 psychologically compelled to remain in the\n                 &quot;Torment of Winter&quot;. When she suffers, the\n                 collective at large also suffers. Such a singular\n                 crime creates an atmosphere of fear which is\n                 historically abhorred by the society. It demands\n                 just punishment from the court and to such a\n                 demand, the courts of law are bound to respond\n                 within legal parameters. It is a demand for\n                 justice and the award of punishment has to be\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                       ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:48:31 :::HCHP</span>\n                                ...25...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                in consonance with the legislative command\n                and the discretion vested in the court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">     39.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"128137606\" id=\"span_58\">In <a href=\"/doc/128137606/\" id=\"a_53\">Narender Kumar v.

A prosecutrix of a sex\n              offence cannot be put on a par with an\n              accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the\n              crime. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_59\">The Evidence Act</a> nowhere says\n\n\n\n\n\n              that her evidence cannot be accepted\n              unless it is corroborated in material\n              particulars.    She    is  undoubtedly      a\n              competent witness under Section 118 and\n              her evidence must receive the same\n\n\n\n\n\n              weight as is attached to an injured in\n              cases of physical violence. The same\n              degree of care and caution must attach in\n              the evaluation of her evidence as in the\n              case of an injured complainant or witness\n           r  and no more. What is necessary is that\n              the court must be alive to and conscious\n\n              of the fact that it is dealing with the\n              evidence of a person who is interested in\n              the outcome of the charge levelled by\n              her. If the court keeps this in mind and\n              feels satisfied that it can act on the\n\n\n              evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no\n              rule of law or practice incorporated in the\n              <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_60\">Evidence Act</a> similar to Illustration (b) to\n              <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 114</a> which requires it to look for\n\n\n\n\n              corroboration. If for some reason the court\n              is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the\n\n\n\n\n\n              testimony of the prosecutrix it may look\n              for evidence which may lend assurance to\n              her testimony short of corroboration\n              required in the case of an accomplice. The\n\n\n\n\n\n              nature of evidence required to lend\n              assurance to the testimony of the\n              prosecutrix must necessarily depend on\n              the facts and circumstances of each case.\n              But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full\n              understanding the court is entitled to\n              base a conviction on her evidence unless\n              the same is shown to be infirm and not\n              trustworthy.

We would further like to observe that while\n\n\n\n\n\n        appreciating the evidence of the prosecutrix,\n        the court must keep in mind that in the context\n        of the values prevailing in the country,\n        particularly in rural India, it would be unusual\n\n\n\n\n\n        for a woman to come up with a false story of\n        being a victim of sexual assault so as to\n        implicate an innocent person.

Any statement of\n             rape    is   an    extremely      humiliating\n             experience for a woman and until she is a\n             victim of sex crime, she would not blame\n\n\n             anyone but the real culprit. While\n             appreciating     the    evidence     of    the\n             prosecutrix, the courts must always keep\n             in mind that no self-respecting woman\n\n\n\n\n             would put her honour at stake by falsely\n             alleging commission of rape on her and\n\n\n\n\n\n             therefore,     ordinarily    a     look     for\n             corroboration     of   her    testimony      is\n             unnecessary and uncalled for. But for high\n             improbability in the prosecution case, the\n\n\n\n\n\n             conviction in the case of sex crime may\n             be based on the sole testimony of the\n             prosecutrix. It has been rightly said that\n             corroborative     evidence     is    not    an\n             imperative      component       of     judicial\n             credence in every case of rape nor the\n             absence of injuries on the private parts of\n             the victim can be construed as evidence\n             of consent.&#x27; &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                              ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:48:31 :::HCHP</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">                                ...28...\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">     43.

Accused and the prosecutrix slept in one\n\n\n\n\n\n     room, whereas Deepak Rai slept with his wife in another\n\n     room. During night, accused Varun Kumar subjected her\n\n     to forcible intercourse. Next morning, she changed her\n\n     clothes on the asking of wife of Deepak Rai. But then she\n\n     is not an accused.    In the evening, she was told by\n\n     Deepak Rai that her family had lodged a report with the\n\n\n\n     police, who was searching for them.          Thereafter, they\n\n     went to the factory premises of Deepak Rai and stayed\n\n\n\n\n     there.

From Chintpurni and\n\n     spent some time, accused Varun Kumar called Deepak\n\n     Rai, who asked them to come to the factory at Tahaliwal.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                      ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:48:31 :::HCHP</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">                                  ...29...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">     When they reached there, Deepak Rai took them home\n\n     and handed over her custody to the family members of\n\n\n\n\n                                                            .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">     accused Varun Kumar, who took them to Police Station,\n\n\n\n\n\n     Hamirpur.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">     44.           From her testimony, it is evidently clear that\n\n\n\n\n\n     she was subjected to sexual intercourse by accused\n\n     Varun Kumar. We do not find this statement of hers to be\n\n\n\n\n\n     either false, untrue or unbelievable. It is fully inspiring in\n\n     confidence. Prosecutrix states that she did resist the acts\n\n     of the accused.      Evidently, prosecutrix travelled from\n\n     place to place, in a public transport and did not disclose\n\n     such act to any one. But then she explains that accused\n\n     had asked her to keep mum. Medical evidence does not\n\n\n\n     rule out possibility of rape. Assuming hypothetically, that\n\n     prosecutrix    had   willfully   volunteered      herself      to   be\n\n\n\n\n     subjected to sexual intercourse, it becomes immaterial,\n\n\n\n\n\n     for she is minor in law.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">     45.

Every acquittal should be understood as a\n                failure of the justice delivery system, in serving\n                the cause of justice. Likewise, every acquittal\n                should ordinarily lead to the inference, that an\n                innocent person was wrongfully prosecuted. It is\n\n\n                therefore, essential that every State should put\n                in place a procedural mechanism, which would\n                ensure that the cause of justice is served, which\n                would simultaneously ensure the safeguard of\n\n\n\n\n                interest of those who are innocent. In\n                furtherance of the above purpose, it is\n\n\n\n\n\n                considered essential to direct the Home\n                Department of every State, to examine all\n                orders of acquittal and to record reasons for the\n                failure of each prosecution case. A standing\n\n\n\n\n\n                committee of senior officers of the police and\n                prosecution departments, should be vested with\n                aforesaid responsibility.
