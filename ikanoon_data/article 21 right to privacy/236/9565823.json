The challenge in this petition is to an order passed by the\n      CIC dated November 24, 2015, whereby the CIC has directed the\n      respondent no.1 herein to provide to the respondent no.2, OBC\n      certificate of the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">      2.       The challenge to the order is on the ground that\n      respondent no.2 is a neighbor and co-sharer in the property of the\n      petitioner and has no cordial relationship due to a property\n      dispute.     Therefore, in order to harass and put pressure on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">    W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                          Page 1 of 9</span>\n   petitioner and his family to come for a settlement in the property\n  dispute, an application for seeking information has been filed.\n  According to the petitioner, respondent no.2 is not a bona fide\n  information seeker for the said reason.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">  3.       It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner\n  that the CIC has failed to appreciate that neither the PIO nor the\n  Appellate Authority has disposed of the RTI Application,\n  therefore, in the absence of any decision taken by any authority,\n  the appeal before the CIC was not maintainable. Hence, the CIC\n  without considering the background of the case, and the fact\n  personal information is protected under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 8</a> of the RTI Act\n  directed the Department of the petitioner to supply the same\n  while passing the impugned order, which is untenable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_2\">4.       According to the learned counsel for the petitioner the\n  caste and educational certificate of an employee are in the nature\n  of personal information about a third party. Hence, this type of\n  information is exempted from disclosure. He would rely upon\n  the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_2\">Girish\n  Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commissioner\n  and Ors.</a> (2013) 1 SCCC 212.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">  5.       Respondent no.1 has filed its counter-affidavit to state\n  that respondent no.2 has filed his first RTI application at ITI,\n  Jahangir Puri, Delhi on May 16, 2013 and August 12, 2013 in\n  which the post of Baljeet Singh, petitioner herein was not\n  mentioned clearly and accordingly reply was sent to Sh. Pratap\n  Singh, respondent no.2 by the PIO. It is also stated that the\n  petitioner was aware regarding the RTI filed by respondent no.2\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                      Page 2 of 9</span>\n   and he has accordingly submitted a written request to the PIO /\n  HOO and by giving reference to the property case requested not\n  to share his personal information with any person. Respondent\n  no.2 not being satisfied with the reply of PIO dated September 2,\n  2013 moved to the first Appellate Authority to obtain the record\n  in respect of the petitioner. Then the first Appellate Authority\n  supplied all the existing relevant records with the first Appellate\n  Authority to the respondent no.2 with a direction, if the\n  respondent no.2 is not satisfied, he may move the second\n  Appellate Authority, i.e., CIC. However, instead of moving the\n  second Appellate Authority, respondent no.2 filed various\n  complaints to the first Appellate Authority and other higher\n  authorities of the department to obtain the personal record of the\n  petitioner which lingered on / delayed the matter in the\n  department as respondent no.2 dragged the family dispute in his\n  complaint, which resulted in valuable time of the department\n  spoiled by the respondent no.2 as he wanted to settle his personal\n  grudge against the petitioner instead of moving towards second\n  appeal in CIC.       It is also stated that the CIC passed the order\n  November 24, 2015 after having heard the submissions of both\n  the parties and in compliance thereof ITI Jahangir Puri, Delhi\n  supplied the copy of the OBC certificate by blocking the address\n  and other personal information of the petitioner Sh. Baljeet Singh\n  to respondent no.2 Sh. Pratap Singh. Even though, the petitioner\n  has submitted a written representation dated December 18, 2015\n  to defer the supply of the personal record to the respondent no.2\n  which was received by PIO on December 21, 2015, meanwhile,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                        Page 3 of 9</span>\n   the PIO has already obeyed with the order of the CIC. Therefore,\n  there was no reason to consider the written representation of the\n  petitioner dated December 18, 2015.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">  6.       An issue has arisen whether the OBC certificate has been\n  received by the respondent no.2 from the department pursuant to\n  the order of the CIC as according to the department, the\n  certificate which has not returned back undelivered is deemed to\n  have been delivered.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">  7.       Be that as it may, respondent no.2 has filed a counter-\n  affidavit before this court wherein he has justified the impugned\n  order of the CIC. He in his counter-affidavit has not stated that\n  the order of the CIC has been complied with. In any case, the\n  counsels appearing for the petitioner and the respondent no.1\n  have reiterated the stand taken by them in their respective\n  pleadings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">  8.       The issue which arises for consideration is whether the\n  OBC certificate of the petitioner can be directed to be given by\n  the CIC. To answer this question, it is necessary to reproduce the\n  prayer clause in the writ petition as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">    &quot;In view of the above mentioned facts and circumstances of the\n    case, it is therefore, most respectfully prayed that this\n    Hon&#x27;ble Court may be pleased to:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           a) Call the record for perusal of this Hon&#x27;ble court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           b) Issue a writ/ order/direction/instructijon in the nature\n           of certiorari quashing the impugned order dated\n           24.11.2015 passed by CIC, in the interest of\n           justice.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                          Page 4 of 9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">            c) Or in alternate, direct the respondent no.l should not\n           disclose the personal information of the petitioner to\n           anyone in future.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">           d) Any other writ or further order or direction which this\n           Hon&#x27;ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and\n           circumstances of the case and in the interest of the\n           justice&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_6\">9.       From the above, it is clear that the petitioner in substance\n  has challenged the order of the CIC. Alternatively, he has prayed\n  that the respondent no.1 should not disclose the personal\n  information of the petitioner to anyone in future. In other words,\n  if the information as directed to be given has been supplied by the\n  respondent no.1 to the respondent no.2 then there is a compliance\n  of the order of the CIC. If in the eventuality, the said information\n  has not been received by respondent no.2, then the same should\n  not be given. The question is whether, respondent no.1 can still\n  give the information to the respondent no.2. The answer to this\n  question would surely be, whether the information, like the caste\n  certificate can be directed to be given. It is the case of the\n  petitioner that the caste certificate is a personal information qua\n  him and such certificate being a personal information cannot be\n  given. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the\n  Judgment of the Supreme Court in the <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_3\">Girish Ramchandra\n  Deshpande</a> (supra), wherein in Paras 12 to 14, the Supreme\n  Court has held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        &quot;12. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts\n        below that the details called for by the petitioner i.e.\n        copies of all memos issued to the third respondent, show\n        cause notices and orders of censure/punishment etc. are\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                         Page 5 of 9</span>\n         qualified to be personal information as defined in clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8(1)</a>of the RTI Act. The performance of an\n        employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter\n        between the employee and the employer and normally\n        those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall\n        under the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the\n        disclosure of which has no relationship to any public\n        activity or public interest. On the other hand, the\n        disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of\n        privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n        the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n        Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied\n        that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n        such information, appropriate orders could be passed but\n        the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter of\n        right.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        13. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax\n        returns are &quot;personal information&quot; which stand\n        exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n        8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public\n        interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the\n        State Public Information Officer or the Appellate\n        Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest\n        justifies the disclosure of such information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        14. The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona\n        fide public interest in seeking information, the disclosure\n        of such information would cause unwarranted invasion of\n        privacy of the individual under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI\n        Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_8\">10.      From the law <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_7\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court it is seen\n  the information like memos / show-cause notices / orders of\n  censure / punishment as sought by the respondent no.2 qualified\n  to be personal information as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)</a>\n  of the RTI Act. Similarly, the details disclosed by a person in his\n  income tax returns were also held to be personal information\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                        Page 6 of 9</span>\n   which stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n  8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless the CPIO / SPIO / Appellate\n  Authority is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the\n  disclosure of such information.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">  11.      In the case in hand, the respondent no.2 has sought the\n  caste certificate issued to the petitioner. The information is a\n  personal information as the caste to which the petitioner belongs\n  is an issue inter-se between the respondent no.1 and the petitioner\n  i.e. between employer and employee and this aspect is governed\n  by service rules. The disclosure of which has no relationship to\n  any public activity. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185579729\" id=\"span_10\">In fact, it is held so by a Coordinate Bench of\n  this court in <a href=\"/doc/185579729/\" id=\"a_10\">UPSC v. Pinki Ganeriwal, W.P.(C</a>) 5812/2010\n  decided on November 8, 2013, wherein in Para 5 of the Judgment\n  it is held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        &quot;5. In the present case, the information such as date of\n        birth, institution and year of passing graduation, field\n        experience and caste is personal information of the\n        selected candidates. There is no finding by the\n        Commission that it was in larger public interest to\n        disclose the aforesaid personal information of the\n        recommended candidates. Even in his application\n        seeking information, the respondent did not claim that\n        any larger public interest was involved in disclosing\n        the aforesaid information. In the absence of such a\n        claim in the application and a finding to this effect by\n        the Commission, no direction for disclosure of the\n        aforesaid personal information could have been\n        given.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">  12.      Further, it is also not the conclusion of the Tribunal that\n  in the larger public interest such information is required to be\n  disclosed.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                        Page 7 of 9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144795012\" id=\"span_12\">13.

It was yet further held that the nature of\n        restriction on right to privacy is of different order; in\n        the case of private individuals, the degree of protection\n        afforded is greater; in the case of public servants, the\n        degree of protection can be lower, depending upon\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.(C) No. 776/2016                                         Page 8 of 9</span>\n         what is at stake; this is so because a public servant is\n        expected to act for public good in the discharge of his\n        duties and is accountable for them.</span><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_18\">(emphasis supplied)\n        This Court in <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_20\">Vijay Prakash Vs.
