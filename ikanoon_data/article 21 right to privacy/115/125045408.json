JUSTICE V.B. GUPTA,\nPRESIDING MEMBER \n\n \n\n Since\nall the above noted appeals arise out of common order dated 26.12.2006, passed\nby State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short, State Commission) all these\nappeals are being disposed of by present common order. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.  Brief facts are that complainant - Ms.\nNivedita Sharma-Complainant (Respondent No.1\nherein) filed a complaint before the State Commission on the allegations that\nshe is a valid subscriber of the GSM mobile services provided by Bharti\nTele-Ventures-Appellant No.2/O.P. No.1 (in F.A. No.52 of 2012) under the brand name, Airtel. The complainant\nsubscribed to the post-paid services provided by it since the year 2006. At the time of taking the connection a kit\nwas provided to the complainant which inter alia included terms and conditions\ngoverning the services to be provided by Airtel to the complainant as a\nsubscriber. It is alleged that about a\nyear after subscribing to the post paid connection, complainant started getting\ncalls from various banks/financial institutions and other companies for\nmarketing their products and services. Initially such unwarranted calls were\nignored; however, soon the frequency of calls started increasing and on certain\ndays the complainant used to receive around ten to fifteen calls causing\ntremendous disturbances. The complainant lodged a complaint with the customer\nservice of the Airtel. There was however, no response of these complaints and the menace continued uninterrupted.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">3. Thereafter a written complaint was lodged\nwith the Airtel. In the said complaint, complainant clearly emphasized the fact\nthat such unsolicited calls were not only severely disrupting complainants\nwork but also posed a grave threat &amp; jeopardized safety &amp; security of\nthe complainant, due to the sharing of her confidential information such as\nname, address and financial standing etc. That compelled by such circumstances,\nthe complainant lodged another complaint with the Customer Service Department\nof the Airtel about the unsolicited calls &amp; SMS. The complainant clearly\ninstructed the opposite party that the complainant should not receive any such\ncalls or SMS in future. In response to\nsuch complaint, even though the SMS from the Airtel ceased, the calls and SMS\nfrom banks/financial institution continued unabated.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4. The lackadaisical attitude of the Airtel\ncompelled the complainant to serve a notice on it, vide its letter dated December 24, 2004\nclaiming damages to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- (RUPEES TEN LACS ONLY) towards\nthe harassment &amp; trauma suffered by the complainant due to constant calls\nfrom various banks/financial institutions and other financing companies for\ntele-marketing their products and service. In the said notice, the complainant\ncategorically reiterated its concern that such unsolicited calls not only\ndisrupted complainants work but also gravely jeopardized the complainants\nsafety and security. Additionally, the complainant pointed out that such calls\ncaused a lot of mental distress/strain as a lot of such callers misbehaved when\nthey did not receive positive response or were questioned as to the source of\ntheir information. Further, vide the aforesaid notice, the complainant demanded\nthe Airtel to restrain with immediate effect from providing any further\ninformation to any one regarding complainants personal information like mobile\nnumber, name, address or other such details and requested it to recall all\ninformation provided to such banks/companies or to any other company dealing\nwith such data. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5. It is also alleged that Airtel or its\nofficials have made absolutely no effort at their end to respond to the said\ncomplaint. The complainant continues to be harassed by such banks /financial\ninstitutions etc. \n\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">6.  It is further stated that as per the\ncontractual obligations of Airtel, it was clearly bound to maintain the\nconfidentiality of the personal and private information of the subscribers. The\nPrivacy Statement clearly stipulates; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">We\nhowever, assure you, that Airtel does not disclose your personal information to\nany other Cellular Service Provides, Banks Credit Card companies etc. or their\nagents, affiliates which could lead to invasion of your privacy. \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7. That despite assurances from Airtel, the complainant is still being harassed by\nunsolicited calls from banks/financial institution, like ICICI, UTI, HSBC, HDFC\netc. for tele-marketing their products and services. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">8. It is also alleged that ICICI Bank-Appellant\nNo.2 (in F.A. No.55 of 2012)/Opposite Party No.3, continues to make unwarranted\ncalls, despite the clear cut directions from the Supreme Courts order dated\nFebruary 07, 2005, wherein the Supreme Court directed the forthwith cessation\nof such unsolicited calls by banks, including opposite party no.3. In fact, on\nDecember 26, 2005, the complainant during the course of a meeting received a\npromotional call from an executive, named Shweta from American Express Bank\nLtd.-appellant (in F.A. No.109 of 2007)/Opposite Party no.4, marketing its loan\nfacilities. On being questioned as to the source of such information (mobile\nnumber of the complainant ) complainant was informed that they have been given\ninformation but refused to divulge the name and number of its senior executive,\nwho had a list of people, who were to be approached for such promotion. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">9. That it is a matter of grave concern that\nsuch confidential information of the subscriber is being traded without their\nknowledge/consent. The complainant has confirmed information that service\nproviders, like Airtel have entered into arrangements with banks, financial\ninstitutions to pass on details of its subscribers for financial benefit to the\ntune of crores of rupees. The complainant submits that the parties must be\ndirected to state on oath as to the exact nature of such arrangement and the\nbenefits derived therefrom. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">10. It is further stated by the complainant\nthat said fact was confirmed by an executive from Opposite Party No.3/ICICI\nBank Ltd., who substantiated that the complainants personal details, like\nmobile number, address and name etc. had been divulged by Airtel and that such\ninformation was being constantly exchanged between service providers, on one\nhand and banks/financial institutions, on the other hand for mutual benefits or\nfinancial gains. That this fact was also highlighted in the article titled\nMobile Subscribers seek government intervention to check telemarketing in Tribune dated October 02, 2005; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\"> Enquiries reveal that some of the\nprivate companies have illegally procured lists of mobile subscribers from the\nemployees of the Spice, Airtel, BSNL and Reliance, and are using them to\ncontact consumers as part of the marketing strategy. Though officials of the\ncellular companies deny these allegations, but the facts remains that even the\nSpice and Airtel are sending SMS to the customers of each other to woo towards\ntheir network. \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11. That such disclosure besides being\nviolative of the terms of the contract is also an invasion of the complainants\nfundamental right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. That this\nissue recently came into highlight due to the PIL filed by Dr. Harsh Pathak,\nalleging that undesired calls for promotion of business by various companies\nnot only harassed the citizens but also amounted to the violation of their\nright to privacy. The Court recognizing the menace created by such unsolicited\ncalls, issued notices to private mobile service providers like Hutch, Reliance,\nIdea including Airtel. The court also issued notices to banks like City Bank,\nHSBC, Standard Chartered Bank including ICICI Bank Ltd. barring them from\nmaking such unsolicited calls. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">12. That the said fact came to light in the\naftermath of Supreme Court issuing notices to banks and mobile phone companies,\nbarring them as well as telemarketers from making such nuisance calls. Despite\nspecific orders from the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court barring such telemarketing, the\nopposite party no.3 &amp; 4-ICICI Bank Ltd. and American Express Bank Ltd.\nrespectively, continue to willfully\ndisobey the orders of the court amounting to contempt of court. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">13. That this exchange of data or selling of\ninformation is clearly contrary to the agreement and its terms and conditions\nand amounts to unjust enrichment by the opposite parties. That, in spite of\nthe written assurance given to the complainant, the opposite party has\ndivulged/caused to divulge confidential information without any due authority\n&amp; without complainants consent/permission. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">14. That it is even more alarming that even the\nfinancial details of customers are being divulged without their information.\nThe complainant was alarmed to learn that the callers from Opposite Party No.3\n&amp; 4 were aware of the financial standing\nof the complainant, without such data being disclosed to them by the\ncomplainant herself. That the said exchange of information becomes even more\nominous in the wake of the recent data theft by an employee of a BPO company in\nIndia. The said incident clearly showed that confidential information can be\neasily sold out to anybody for money. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">15. That receiving such calls during\nprofessional engagement not only harasses but also unduly interferes with the\nright to privacy of the complainant. Such unwarranted calls also cause\nunnecessary financial loss to the subscribers when they attend such calls on\nnational &amp; international roaming. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">16. That the complainant as a consumer to\nAirtel has suffered wrongful financial loss on account of roaming charges and\nAirtel has wrongfully gained by charging the complainant for these calls and\nalso by selling exchange the information about the complainant. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">17. That the complainant seeks to claim; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">Rs.50,000/- - Towards call charges for receiving such\ncalls on roaming (for last years) \n\n \n\nRs.4 Lakhs - Towards time loss &amp; disruption of work\nover a continued period of four years. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">Rs.10 Lakhs - Towards jeopardizing the safety &amp;\nsecurity of the complainant. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">Rs.5 Lakhs  Towards mental\nagony &amp; harassmentRs.15 lakhs  Towards exemplary fine for failure to\nremedy the situation despite repeated complaints by the complainant as well as\nclear cut directions from the Supreme Court. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">18. That, the opposite parties have jointly and\nseverally through acts and omissions violated the right to privacy of the\ncomplainant under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, committed breach of\ncontract &amp; breach of trust to the\ncomplainants detriment, peril and financial loss. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">19. That therefore in the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case and in the interest of justice, it was prayed\nthat the State Commission should direct; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\"> a.  The opposite party to pay exemplary\ndamages to the tune of Rs.34,50,000/- (Rupees Thirty Four Lacs Fifty Thousand\nonly) towards the peril, harassment, mental agony, financial loss suffered by\nthe complainant; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\"> b.  Restrain the opposite parties from\nmaking unwarranted calls and causing\nfurther harassment to the complainant; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"> c.  That the opposite party be held liable to\npay interest @ 12% p.a. till the date of actual payment; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">  d.  Any\nother or further order as may be passed by the State Commission in the interest\nof justice and in the present facts and circumstances of the case. \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">20. State Commission, vide order dated 1.5.2006\ntook cognizance of the complaint and passed an ex parte interim order. The\noperative portion of which read as under; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\"> 8. We hereby take cognizance of\nthis complaint by admitting it and issue notice to the OP Nos. 1 to 4 to\nfacilitate them to give their reply within 30 days from the date of receipt of\nthe notice. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\"> 9.  We hereby, by interim order direct all\nthe service providers of mobile phone services not to disclose any personal\ninformation in their possession including the mobile phone number to any unauthorized\nperson including the Banks, financial institutions, finance companies as it is\na breach of Privacy Statement and undertaking and may invite the cancellation\nof their licence as no stranger can possess such information without being\nprovided by the service provider who alone is in its possession. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\"> 10. At the\nsame time all unauthorized persons including the Banks, financial institutions,\nfinance companies and any other persons who are not supposed to be in\npossession of the information of the subscribers including the mobile phone\nnumber are restrained from making calls or sending SMS to any consumer as they\nare vicariously, as well as directly liable for these acts. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"> 11. It is\ncommon knowledge that whenever a consumer tries to dial the number from where\nsuch calls or SMS are  \n\n \n\n received, the obvious response is that the number\ndoes not exist. This is a very serious matter for Regulatory Authorities.\nConsumers at large may bring to the notice of the Regulatory authorities by\nproviding them such numbers and Regulatory authorities shall take stringent\naction under the law. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\"> 12. Copies\nof this order be sent for publication in newspapers as a notice to all the\nservice providers/Banks/financial institutions/companies/persons who are\nengaged in this activity. They shall comply with the order forthwith failing\nwhich they may face proceedings  \n\n \n\n u/s 25 and 27 of the <a href=\"/doc/1733066/\" id=\"a_3\">Consumer Protection Act,\n1986</a>. \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\">21. Appellant-Cellular Operators Association of\nIndia (for short as COAI) (in F.A. No.52 of 2012) filed an application for impleadment as a\nparty in the complaint case filed by the complainant. Application for\nimpleadment was allowed by the State Commission vide its order dated 4.7.2006,\nwhich read as under; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">  An application for impleadment as OP No.4\nhas been moved by Cellular Operation Association of India of which all the\nmajor service providers of cellular services are members.

Counsel\nfor the respondent contends that service\nproviders of mobile telephone service have DND (Do not Disturb) service which is limited and which deals with\nthe messages emanating from the service provider in respect of new service\ninformation, billing etc. These are the only message that emanate from the\nservice provider and if any consumer requires that the same should not be sent,\nhe is entitled as of his right that he be put in the DND category. Once that\nhappens no message from the telephone\noperator is sent on that number. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\"> 6. In our\nview, such a mechanism evolved by the service provider itself clearly defines\ntheir strategy to augment their business as the consumer may reply in the\nprocess or respond and reply is treated as chargeable calls. If service\nproviders want their consumers to be put on DND service, they shall on their\nown invariably write to each and every consumer to seek response whether he\nwants to be put on DND service and if so in respect of what kinds of message or\ncalls. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\"> 7. While re-iterating our interim order dated\n25.5.2006, we hereby make the following directions to all the service providers\nof mobile telephone in the city as well as banks, financial institutions and\nany other agency who is engaged in making\nunsolicited calls and messages to those consumers with whom they have no\ncontract of any kind in this regard; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\"> (i)  That every service provider shall write to\ntheir consumers whether he is interested on being put on DND i.e. (Do not\ndisturb) service vis--vis their calls/messages and if so as to what kind of\ncalls and message a consumer wants to be put on this service. Till such a\ncommunication is sent by the service providers to their consumers and response\nis received, the service provider shall\nnot make any call or send any message including\nreminding about the telephone bills i.e. due date of payment etc. or\ninforming about the new service as they should do so by sending letters giving\ndetails of such services as the contract is only payment of the bills on\nreceipt of bill containing details of all the calls made by the consumers so as\nto allow the consumer to raise any objection if the calls shown are correct or\nnot. Sending a bill by way of message calling upon the consumer to make the\npayment is against the terms of the contract as such message creates\ndisturbance, inconvenience and mental agony to the consumer when he is busy in\nthe meeting or in some other urgent work or in the office or any other place. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\"> (ii) All\nthe banks, financial institutions or any other kind of agency are hereby\ndirected not to send unsolicited calls or messages to the consumers of the\nservice providers with whom they have no contract of any kind whatsoever in\nthis regard as this phenomenon is causing lot of inconvenience, mental agony\nand harassment to the consumers of service providers of mobile telephones.\nPresumption would be raised that they have obtained the information from the\nservice providers as to the details of the consumers as well as mobile\ntelephone number and for this the service provider or the banks, financial\ninstitutions shall be deemed to be severally and jointly liable. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">8. It is made clear that if in future any\nviolation or non-compliance of this order is brought to the notice of this\nCommission by any consumer of any service provider of such service, it would be\ntreated as failure or omission to comply with the order and shall invite not\nonly heavy punitive damages but sentence of imprisonment as provided<a href=\"/doc/1763766/\" id=\"a_5\"> u/s 27</a> of\nthe Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for a term which shall not be less than one\nmonth but which may extend to three years or with fine which shall not be less\nthan two thousands rupees but which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both. Chief\nExecutive Officers of the service providers, banks and the financial\ninstitutions shall be liable for this punishment. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">9.

Since we have treated this complaint as a\ncomplaint filed on behalf of numerous consumers running into lacs and since the\nCellular Operators Association of India has intervened on behalf of O.P. 1 and\n2 and all other Cellular operators and since the financial loss and injury is\nbeing suffered by a large number of consumers who are not identifiable\nconveniently, we, as a deterrent and to stop this evil, feel inclined to impose\nheavy punitive damages upon the O.Ps because of care-a-fig-for attitude and\ntheir having continued to indulge in these activities in spite of Supreme Court\nhaving issued notice in a PIL in 2003 and our observations and directions made\nin various orders passed from time to time:-  \n</p>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(i) Penalty of Rs. 50 Lacs (Fifty Lacs) is\nimposed upon O.Ps 1-2 Airtel and O.P.5 - Cellular Operators Association of\nIndia jointly and severally. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(ii) Penalty of Rs. 25 Lacs (Twenty Five Lacs) is\nimposed upon O.P.3  ICICI Bank and O.P.4  American Express Bank, to be shared\nby them equally. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(iii) We further award a compensation of Rs.50,000/-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">(Fifty Thousand) to be paid to the complainant by the O.Ps, out of which O.P.1,\n2 and 5 shall pay Rs.25,000/- (Twenty Five Thousand) jointly or severally and\nO.P.3 and O.P.4 shall pay Rs 25,000/- (Twenty Five Thousand) in equal shares. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">39.

Being aggrieved by the impugned order\npassed by the State Commission on 26.12.2006, the appellants herein filed Writ\nPetition (Civil) No. 583 and CM(M) No. 443 of 2007, before the Delhi High\nCourt. The High Court, disposed of all the petitions and set aside the\ndirections contained in the above order of the State Commission. The\ncomplainant herein, Nivedita Sharma challenged it before Honble Supreme Court\nin Civil Appeal No. 10706 of 2011 (Nivedita Sharma Vs. Cellular Operators\nAssociation of India &amp; others) which was decided on 7th\nDecember, 2011.  \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\"> The Supreme Court has referred to the\nprovisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1733066/\" id=\"a_6\">Consumer Protection Act, 1986</a> and observed that --- \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">A\nreading of the plain language of <a href=\"/doc/1749394/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 17</a> shows that every State Commission\nhas the jurisdiction to entertain complainants where the value of the goods or\nservices and compensation, if any, claimed exceeds Rs.20 lacs but does not\nexceed Rs.1 crore. By <a href=\"/doc/808805/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 18</a> the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1891987/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 12</a> to <a href=\"/doc/550350/\" id=\"a_10\">14</a> and the\nRules made thereunder, for the disposal of complaints by the District Forum,\nhave been made applicable for deciding the disputes by the State Commission.\n<a href=\"/doc/1907922/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 19</a> provides remedy of appeal against the order by the State\nCommission in exercise of its powers\nunder sub-clause (i) of Clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/1749394/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 17</a>. If <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 11</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1749394/\" id=\"a_14\">17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86602/\" id=\"a_15\">21</a> of\nthe 1986 Act which relate to the jurisdiction of the District Forum, the State\nCommission and the National Commission, there does not appear any plausible\nreason to interpret the same in a manner which would frustrate the object of\nlegislation.  \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">What\nhas surprised us is that the High Court has not even referred to <a href=\"/doc/1749394/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 17</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1907922/\" id=\"a_17\">19</a> of the 1986 Act and the law laid down in various judgments of this Court\nand yet it has declared that the directions given by the State Commission are\nwithout jurisdiction and that too by overlooking the availability of statutory\nremedy of appeal to the respondents  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nWe\nalso find that the High Court has taken cognizance of the statement made on\nbehalf of the counsel for the petitioners that their clients would challenge\nClause (iii) of para 38 of the State Commissions order by filing an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1907922/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 19</a> of the Act and the fact that\none of the aggrieved parties, namely, American Express Bank Limited has already\nfiled an appeal questioning paragrah 38 (iii) of the order of the State\nCommission. After having noticed that some of the petitioners were inclined to\navail the remedy of appeal against the particular portion of the order passed\nby the State Commission the High Court should not have entertained the writ\npetition filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and the miscellaneous\npetitions filed under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution and directed them to\navail remedy of appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1907922/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 19</a> of the 1986 Act. \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">The\nappeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned order is set aside.  \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">While allowing the Civil Appeal, the Supreme Court also\npermitted the respondents/OPs to file appeal before the National Commission.\nThe National Commission has been directed to decide the matter without being\ninfluenced by the observations of the High Court in the Writ Petition. The appeals presently being considered in\nthis order have been taken up in keeping with the above directions of the Apex\nCourt. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">27. We have heard the learned counsel for the\nparties at length. All the parties have also submitted written arguments in\nsupport of their contentions. We have carefully gone through the entire record\nand perused the written arguments also. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\">28. At the outset, we may point out that one\nof main plea taken in these appeals on behalf of the appellants is that, the\nState Commission has proceeded on presumptive adhoc adjudication without giving\nany finding of facts. No evidence has been led on the disputed question of\nfacts. It is further stated that on the issue of jurisdiction of the State\nCommission, parties were invited to address the Commission, whereas the \n\nState Commission proceeded to decide the\ncomplaint as a whole. The approach of the State Commission is perverse and\nwithout jurisdiction as the impugned order was passed in utter haste without\nwaiting for the outcome of the pending writ petition wherein the interim order\ndated 27.9.2006 was stayed and the matter was listed for 08.02.2007. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_74\">29. It is also argued on behalf of the\nappellant that the complaint was filed by an individual but the State\nCommission has converted it into a representative suit. The provision in this\nbehalf in <a href=\"/doc/1891987/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12(C)</a> of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 requires the complaint to be filed on behalf of\nnumerous consumers having the same interest. It was argued that no such case\nwas made out in the complaint, as filed before the State Commission. Nor did\nthe provision in <a href=\"/doc/1891987/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 12(C)</a> give the State Commission the power to convert,\nof its own accord, an individual complaint into a representative suit. Per\ncontra, learned counsel for respondent/complainant has argued that the Cellular\nOperators Association of India (COAI) had consciously chosen to implead itself\nbefore the State Commission on behalf of\nall cellular operators and did not limit itself to the case of the\nappellants/opposite parties. We find ourselves in full agreement with this\nargument. The fact remains that the matter was contested by the COAI on behalf\nof all cellular operators and that the affidavit of the COAI did not limit\nitself to answering the complaint of an individual. Therefore, the above\ncontention of the appellants that the State Commission had wrongly converted an\nindividual complaint into a representative suit, is rejected. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">30. <a href=\"/doc/1545556/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 13(2)</a> and (3) of the Act state; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\"> 13 (2).  The District Forum shall, if the\ncomplaints admitted by it under <a href=\"/doc/1891987/\" id=\"a_25\">section 12</a> relates to goods in respect of which\nthe procedure specified in sub-section (1) cannot be followed, or if the\ncomplaint relates to any services, \n\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">(a) refer\na copy of such complaint to the opposite party directing him to give his\nversion of the case within a period of thirty days or such extended period not\nexceeding fifteen days as may be granted by the District Forum; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">(b) where\nthe opposite party, on receipt of a copy of the complaint, referred to him\nunder clause (a) denies or\ndisputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or omits or fails to take\nany action to represent his case within the time given by the District Forum,\nthe District Forum shall proceed to settle the consumer dispute, \n\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">(i) on the basis of evidence brought to its\nnotice by the complainant and the opposite party, where the opposite party\ndenies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or \n\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">(ii) ex parte on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the\ncomplainant where the opposite party omits or fails to take any action to\nrepresent his case within the time given by the Forum. \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">(3) No proceedings complying with the\nprocedure laid down  in sub-sections\n(1) and (2) shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the\nprinciples of natural justice have not been complied with.  \n</p>\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">31. Whereas\n<a href=\"/doc/808805/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 18</a> of the Act states; \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\"> 18.  Procedure applicable to\nState Commissions.The provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1891987/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1977503/\" id=\"a_28\">13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/550350/\" id=\"a_29\">14</a> and the rules made thereunder for the disposal of\ncomplaints by the District Forum shall, with such modifications as may be\nnecessary, be applicable to the disposal of disputes by the State Commission. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">32. Sub-section (3) of 13 of the Act is a\nbarring provision, stating that when the proceedings have been conducted in\ncompliance with the procedure laid down in- \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\"> (a) sub-section\n(1), and \n\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\"> (b) sub-section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">(2) </span>\n\n \n\n They shall not be called in\nquestion,- \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">(i)       \nin\nany Court, \n\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">(ii)      \non\nthe ground that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">33. However, the above provision need not,\nhowever, be mistaken as statutory exclusion of the principles of natural\njustice, since due care has been taken both in sub-sections (1) and (2) to\nrequire the opposite party to make his defence. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">34. Thus, it is clear from the above\nprovisions that the Act, permits the reception of evidence by various Consumer\nFora on affidavits but when the party insists that he wants to cross-examine\nthe deponent of the affidavit to prove that the affidavit cannot be relied\nupon, natural justice requires that\npermission to cross-examine the witness should be given. Therefore, Consumer\nForum has to settle the dispute on the basis of evidence adduced by the\ncomplainant and the opposite party, in case the opposite party has disputed or\ndenied the averments made against it in\nthe complaint. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_91\">35. It has been contended on behalf of the\nappellants that the impugned order was passed by the State Commission without\nrecording any evidence. It is alleged that the State Commission has violated\nthe mandatory provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1977503/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 13</a> of the Act read with <a href=\"/doc/808805/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 18</a> thereof.\nOn this question of evidence, in our view the impugned order needs to be\nconsidered in two somewhat distinct parts. The first would be in relation to\nthe individual complainant and the second in relation to the consumers of telecom\nservice, as a class. As per record, on 4.7.2006, the State Commission allowed\nthe application of the COAI, to be impleaded as a respondent. Thereafter, on 27.9.2006,\nit decided to treat the matter as an application under <a href=\"/doc/9346579/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 12(1)(c)</a> of the\nAct. With this, the question of burden of proof got divided in two parts; one\nin relation to the individual complainant and the other in relation to the\nconsumers at large. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">36. In so far as the class action under\n<a href=\"/doc/9346579/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 12(1)(c)</a> of the Act is concerned, the affidavit of COAI brings it out\nas an existing major consumer concern, already receiving attention of the COAI\nand the Regulator. The reply of the COAI\nbefore the State Commission has been adopted by the other OPs. It is not the\ncase of the appellants that the problem of unsolicited calls and messages did\nnot exist. It is also not their case that the magnitude of the problem had not acquired\nalarming proportions. It is not denied that\nthe COAI and the TRAI were\nworking on positioning an effective mechanism to address the problem. COAI\ndid not file any written statement and relied only on their application for\nimpleadment. Significantly, its intervention was on behalf of all Cellular Operators\nand not merely the OPs. Therefore, in our view, contentions of the appellants\non the disputed question of fact remains relevant only to the extent of the\nclaims of the complainant as an individual and her eligibility to receive\ncompensation for the same. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">37. We hold that the complainant has not been\nable to discharge this burden of proof. Admittedly, calls and SMS from the\nAirtel had ceased after two written complaints were made to that Company.\nFurther, no evidence was brought before the State Commission to show that\nAirtel had continued to share personal information of the complainant with\nbanks and financial institutions, from whom she continued to receive\nunsolicited calls and SMS.
