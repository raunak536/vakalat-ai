As the allegations against the petitioner would refer, we are not\nconcerned with other provisions except under clause (i) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_18\">section 2 (d)</a>. The\nexpression &#x27;habitually&#x27; has been explained by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_19\">Vijay Narayan Singh v.

In &quot;Vijay Narayan Singh&quot; the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             &quot;31. It is seen from <a href=\"/doc/60098406/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 12</a> of the Act that it makes provision for\n             the detention of an anti-social element. If a person is not an anti-social\n             element, he cannot be detained under the Act. The detaining authority\n             should, therefore, be satisfied that the person against whom an order\n             is made under <a href=\"/doc/60098406/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12</a> of the Act is an anti-social element as\n             defined in <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act. Sub-clauses (ii), (iii) and (v) of\n             <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act which are not quite relevant for the purposes\n             of this case may be omitted from consideration for the present. The\n             two other sub-clauses which need to be examined closely are sub-\n             clauses (i) and (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 2(d)</a>. Under sub-clause (i) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n             2(d)</a> of the Act, a person who either by himself or as a member of or\n             leader of a gang habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets\n             the commission of offences punishable under Chapter XVI dealing\n             with offences affecting the human body or Chapter XVII dealing with\n             offences against property, of the Penal Code, 1860 is considered to be\n             an anti-social element. Under sub-clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 2(d)</a> of the\n             Act, a person who has been habitually passing indecent remarks to, or\n             teasing women or girls, is an anti-social element. In both these sub-\n             clauses, the word &quot;habitually&quot; is used. The expression &quot;habitually&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">             means &quot;repeatedly&quot; or &quot;persistently&quot;. It implies a thread of continuity\n             stringing together similar repetitive acts. Repeated, persistent and\n             similar, but not isolated, individual and dissimilar acts are necessary\n                                              4                    W.P. (Cr.) (D.B.) No. 542 of 2023\n\n\n\n\n            to justify an inference of habit. It connotes frequent commission of\n            acts or omissions of the same kind referred to in each of the said sub-\n            clauses or an aggregate of similar acts or omissions. This appears to\n            be clear from the use of the word &quot;habitually&quot; separately in sub-clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">            (i), sub-clause (ii) and sub-clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 2(d)</a> and not in sub-\n            clauses (iii) and (v) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 2(d)</a>. If the State Legislature had\n            intended that a commission of two or more acts or omissions referred\n            to in any of the sub-clauses (i) to (v) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 2(d)</a> was sufficient to\n            make a person an &quot;anti-social element&quot;, the definition would have run\n            as &quot;Anti-social element&quot; means &quot;a person who habitually is. ..&quot;. As\n            <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act now stands, whereas under sub-clause (iii) or\n            sub-clause (v) of <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 2(d)</a> a single act or omission referred to in\n            them may be enough to treat the person concerned as an &#x27;antisocial\n            element&#x27;, in the case of sub-clause (i), sub-clause (ii) or sub-clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">            (iv), there should be a repetition of acts or omissions of the same kind\n            referred to in sub-clause (i), sub-clause (ii) or in sub-clause (iv) by the\n            person concerned to treat him as an &quot;anti-social element&quot;.\n            Commission of an act or omission referred to in one of the sub-clauses\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">            (i), (ii) and (iv) and of another act or omission referred to in any other\n            of the said sub-clauses would not be sufficient to treat a person as an\n            &quot;anti-social element&quot;. A single act or omission falling under sub-\n            clause (i) and a single act or omission falling under sub-clause (iv) of\n            <a href=\"/doc/57338857/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(d)</a> cannot, therefore, be characterised as a habitual act or\n            omission referred to in either of them. Because the idea of &quot;habit&quot;\n            involves an element of persistence and a tendency to repeat the acts or\n            omissions of the same class or kind, if the acts or omissions in\n            question are not of the same kind or even if they are of the same kind\n            when they are committed with a long interval of time between them\n            they cannot be treated as habitual ones.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">10.   Mr. Jitendra S. Singh, the learned counsel for the petitioner refers to\nvarious provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/39478395/\" id=\"a_34\">Crimes Control Act</a> and the allegations in the\naforementioned criminal cases to submit that without there being the\nfoundational facts to confer jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/11483226/\" id=\"a_35\">section 3(1)(a)(b)(i)</a>&amp;(ii) of the\n<a href=\"/doc/39478395/\" id=\"a_36\">Crimes Control Act</a>, the order dated 21st July 2023 has been passed against\nthe petitioner. It is stated that except in Patratu P.S. Case No. 198 of 2019 in\nwhich a charge-sheet was laid on 01.02.2019 involving the petitioner in the\nsaid case, charge-sheets in other three criminal cases have been filed after a\nnotice in Case No. 22 of 2023 was issued to her. It is submitted that in Patratu\nP.S. Case No. 142 of 2018 arms were recovered and suspects were named in\nthe First Information Report but for the reasons best known to the prosecution,\na charge-sheet has been laid under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_37\">Arms Act</a> only against\nthe petitioner. It is further submitted that the allegation against the petitioner\nthat she is a coordinator of the &quot;Pandey Gang&quot; which is active in the area is\nnot supported by any material and, in fact, the husband of the petitioner died\nin the year 2014 and thereafter the petitioner involved herself in public cause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">11.   On the other hand, Mr. Ashok Kumar Yadav, the learned Senior SC-I\nwould refer to the stand of the State taken in the counter-affidavit dated\n                                         5                 W.P. (Cr.) (D.B.) No. 542 of 2023\n\n\n\n\n6th September 2023 to support the order dated 21st July 2023. The learned\nSenior SC-I contended that on the basis of local inputs and intelligence\nsharing the involvement of the petitioner in the incidents of threatening and\nintimidating businessmen, traders, contractors etc. has surfaced and such acts\nof the petitioner created fear and panic among the general people. The learned\nSenior SC-I has also taken to the statements made in the counter-affidavit to\npress hard upon the Court that the order dated 21 st July 2023 is based on the\nsubjective satisfaction of the Deputy Commissioner and, therefore, this Court\nmay not interfere with such an order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43921290\" id=\"span_2\">12.

In the order dated 21st July 2023, the Deputy Commissioner-cum-\nDistrict Magistrate at Ramgarh referred to four criminal cases in which\ncomplicity of the petitioner appeared during the investigation and now\ncharge-sheet has been laid in all four cases against her.

In\nthe first place, we need to indicate that the order dated 21st July 2023 has been\npassed for a maximum period of six months and no special reason has been\nrecorded for passing of the said order for the maximum period at one go.\nSecondly, the provisions under clause (b) to sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/41650272/\" id=\"a_42\">section 3</a> of the\nCrimes Control Act indicate that the Deputy Commissioner has three options\nunder clause (b); either (i) to require the person to notify his movement; or (ii)\nto prohibit or restrict possession of any article; or (iii) to direct him to conduct\nhimself in a particular manner. The fact that an order under clause (a) to\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/41650272/\" id=\"a_43\">section 3</a> which requires a person to remove himself outside\nthe District or a part thereof has not been passed against the petitioner is quite\nrelevant in the sense that the Deputy Commissioner in passing the order dated\n21st July 2023 seems to have accepted the position that the presence of the\npetitioner within the District of Ramgarh is not prejudicial to public order.\nThe counter-affidavit dated 6th September 2023 refers to as many as six\nStation Diary Entries which according to the Deputy Commissioner have been\nlodged on the basis of local inputs and intelligence reports, but, these all have\nbeen lodged within a span of ten days starting from 12 th March 2023 to\n21st March 2023. Mr. Jitendra S. Singh, the learned counsel for the petitioner\nwould submit that it was the incident of a demonstration before the office of\nthe Deputy Commissioner at Ramgarh which triggered the passing of the\nimpugned order to wreck vengeance on the petitioner. The learned counsel\nsubmits that in the proceeding of A.B.A. No. 5005 of 2022, the petitioner has\nbeen granted the privilege under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_44\">section 438</a> of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure in connection to Patratu P.S. Case No. 328 of 2018 and there is no\nallegation that she has not been complying with the conditions mentioned in\nthe order dated 10th August 2022.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_3\">15.    &quot;<a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_45\">Kharak Singh v.

Having regard to the facts and circumstances and the grounds on which\nthe order dated 21st July 2023 has been passed, we are of the opinion that the\nimpugned order does not satisfy the requirements in law. A power under\nclause (b) to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/41650272/\" id=\"a_48\">section 3</a> which provides that the Deputy\nCommissioner may make an order against an &quot;anti-social&quot; element cannot be\nstretched to absurdity. Notwithstanding the powers conferred upon the Deputy\nCommissioner under clause (b) (i)&amp;(ii) of sub-section (1) to <a href=\"/doc/41650272/\" id=\"a_49\">section 3</a> of the\nCrimes Control Act, a condition requiring the petitioner to report to the police\nstation and mark her attendance every day before the officer-in-charge of\nPatratu PS at 10:00 AM is arbitrary and illegal. Every executive decision even\nwhere it is made in the exercise of statutory power must be in consonance\nwith the Constitutional guarantee. The direction under the order dated\n21st July 2023 is definitely impinging upon the rights of the petitioner as\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and, therefore, the\norder dated 21st July 2023 cannot be countenance in law and is, accordingly,\nquashed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">17.
