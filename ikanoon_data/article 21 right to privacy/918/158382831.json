It has been filing its ST returns regularly. It is\n     stated that in every half-yearly return filed by the Petitioner, exemption\n     available to tour operators under Notification no. 26/2012-ST dated 20th June\n     2012 has been claimed. eBIZ states that the said returns have been duly\n     verified by the ST Department.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     3. It is stated that on 12th January 2007, the ST Department conducted a\n     search in the premises of eBIZ as a result of which eBIZ was compelled to\n     deposit service tax of Rs. 25,55,000/- and interest thereon amounting to Rs.\n     2,59,000/-. eBIZ further states that consequent upon the said search, the ST\n     Department issued a show cause notice (‗SCN&#x27;) dated 3rd July 2007.\n     Pursuant thereto, an adjudication order was passed and eBIZ paid a penalty\n     amount of Rs. 6,37,500 without prejudice to its right to go in appeal against\n     the said order. By an order dated 29th August 2012, the Commissioner,\n     Service Tax (Appeals) set aside the order passed by the adjudicating\n     authority on the aforesaid SCN. Consequently, on 27th January 2014 eBIZ\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                        Page 2 of 69</span>\n      applied for the refund of the amount paid in the sum of Rs. 34,51,500/-. It is\n     stated that till date the said refund application has not been disposed of by\n     the ST Department.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">     4. eBIZ states that for a second time, on 4th October 2012, a search was\n     conducted by the ST Department in its premises. The statement of Mr.\n     Pawan Malhan, Managing Director (MD), eBIZ was recorded and various\n     documents were seized/resumed. However, no SCN was issued pursuant to\n     the said search. A copy of the panchnama dated 4th October 2012 revealed\n     that inter alia the documents seized included the file containing the ST-3\n     returns from April 2009 to March 2012; copies of balance sheets from\n     Assessment Year (AY) 2007-2008 to 2011-2012 and the trial balance for\n     2012-2013; a file containing miscellaneous papers and two brochures.\n     Summons were issued on the same date to eBIZ requiring it to produce the\n     ST returns for 2007-2008 and 2008-2009; copy of agreement entered into\n     with M/s. Balaji Digital Solutions (P) Limited; copy of agreements/contracts\n     entered into with Hotels or Travel agents for tour packages and list of\n     associates of Noida and Bulandshahr for FY 2011-2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     5. eBIZ states that in 2014 the ST Department conducted an audit of the\n     records of eBIZ for the years 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. eBIZ was asked to\n     deposit Rs. 73,387/- together with interest and penalty. It is stated that on\n     12th December 2014, eBIZ deposited Rs. 75,589/-. When discrepancies were\n     pointed out by the ST Department for other years, they too were similarly\n     rectified. Further, whenever there was a dispute, SCNs were issued which\n     were then adjudicated. It is pointed out that in every half-yearly return filed\n     by eBIZ, on the gross amount received by it, it was claiming exemption\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 3 of 69</span>\n      under Notification No.26/2012-ST and the balance taxable amount as well as\n     the computation of service tax thereon and the tax payments made duly\n     reflected in the returns were verified by the officers of the ST Department.\n     Copies of such ST returns are enclosed along with the petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">     6. On 13th October 2015, the ST Department proposed, by a letter of that\n     date by the Superintendent (Group-4E), Audit-II of the Meerut\n     Commissionerate, conducting a service tax audit of the accounts/records of\n     eBIZ for the period up to March 2015. The said letter further asked eBIZ to\n     provide copies of balance sheet, trial balance and annual financial report for\n     financial years (‗FYs&#x27;) 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 along with all the\n     schedules, tax audit report (Form 3CD), TDS detail (Form 26AS), copies of\n     ST-3 returns submitted for the years 2010-2011 to 2014-2015; value and\n     payment of service tax (service wise/month wise) through cash and credit for\n     the last five years and soft copies of the aforesaid records and documents.\n     All the above information was submitted by eBIZ on 15th December 2015. It\n     is pointed out that since they were audited every year, therefore, it was\n     enclosing copy of balance sheet, P&amp;L account along with all the schedules,\n     tax reports, Form 3CD, TDS details, ST-3; and value and payment of service\n     tax (service wise/month wise) only for the relevant year i.e., 2014-2015. The\n     ST returns filed by eBIZ for all the aforementioned years have been\n     enclosed with the petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">     7. It is pointed out that after conducting the verification audit of eBIZ in\n     2015, a notice dated 6th January 2016 was issued for examining the\n     admissibility of the exemption claimed under Notification No.26/2012-ST\n     dated 20th June 2012. However, before the records could be submitted, a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 4 of 69</span>\n      search was conducted on 19th January 2016 by the DGCEI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">     8. eBIZ states that throughout the abovementioned periods, it was availing\n     abatement of 90% of the service tax payable by it as ‗tour operator&#x27; with the\n     approval of the ST Department. It further states that all its records were\n     verified and its service tax payments under the category ‗tour operator\n     services&#x27; for booking of tour packages was never disputed. This was despite\n     the audit and searches conducted on several occasions as referred to\n     hereinbefore. Reference is made to an SCN dated 17th November 2014\n     demanding service tax of Rs.34,00,425/- on the ground of reversal of\n     amount of unclaimed commission. This demand was subsequently\n     confirmed by the adjudicating authority on 21 st December 2015. eBIZ was\n     filing appeal against the said order. Reference is also made to another SCN\n     dated 2nd November 2015, demanding service tax of Rs.5,33,341/-, which is\n     yet to be adjudicated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">     Search and arrest proceedings\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">     9. In the above background, a search was conducted in the premises of eBIZ\n     on 19th January 2016 by the officers of the DGCEI and various\n     documents/records were seized with a panchnama being prepared on the\n     same date. Five summons dated 19th January 2016 were also issued to\n     various officers of eBIZ including Mr. Pawan Malhan, MD by the Senior\n     Intelligence Officer (‗SIO&#x27;), DGCEI. It is stated that the SIO forced Mr.\n     Pawan Malhan to record in his statement that he has evaded Rs.17 crores\n     service tax. When Mr. Malhan refused to do so, he was arrested late in the\n     evening at 7:40 pm on 20th January 2016 under <a href=\"/doc/110234480/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 91</a> of the FA and\n     sent to judicial custody. It was alleged that eBIZ had committed an offence\n     under <a href=\"/doc/175025000/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 89 (1) (ii)</a> of the FA. The bail application of Mr. Malhan dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                      Page 5 of 69</span>\n      21st January 2016 was rejected by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate\n     (MM) by an order dated 25th January 2016. While Mr. Malhan was still in\n     custody, two more summons were issued to two officers of eBIZ by the\n     DGCEI on 21st January 2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">     10. It is pointed out that on the basis of Notification No.26/2012-ST and an\n     earlier Notification No.01/2006-ST, exemption was being consistently\n     claimed by eBIZ and not disputed by the ST Department. eBIZ contends that\n     the action of the DGCEI in terming the said claim to be unlawful and\n     estimating the ST liability at Rs.17 crores for the last five years was based\n     only on the change of opinion and illegal search conducted in the premises\n     of eBIZ.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">     11. It is on the above basis that the present writ petition was filed praying\n     inter alia for a declaration that the action of the DGCEI was arbitrary,\n     malicious and motivated and against the provisions of the FA and to declare\n     the summons dated 19th and 21st January 2016 to be without authority of\n     law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">     Proceedings before the Court\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">     12. In this writ petition, the Court issued notice to the Respondents on 28 th\n     January 2016. At that stage, Mr. Malhan was still in custody and his bail\n     application was to be taken up on 29th January 2016 by the ASJ. Mr. Atul\n     Singh, Deputy Director, DGCEI and Mr. Sunil Joshi, SI-6, DGCEI were\n     present along with the records, which were perused by the Court. This\n     included a note proposing search in the premises of eBIZ and a separate note\n     proposing the arrest of Mr. Malhan. In para 8 of the order passed by the\n     Court on 28th January 2016, it was recorded as under:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 6 of 69</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             ―8. It is not clear from these notes that prior to going in for the\n            extreme measure of arresting the MD of the Petitioner, the DGCEI\n            examined the entire previous records of the Petitioner and in particular\n            the assessments in relation to the years 2011-12 onwards. In\n            particular, it is not clear whether the DGCEI was conscious of the\n            pending proceedings and show cause notices issued by the CST under\n            <a href=\"/doc/78626786/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 73 (1)</a> of the Finance Act, 1994 and the proceedings\n            consequent thereto. This aspect is significant since the invocation of\n            the powers of arrest without warrant under <a href=\"/doc/54020930/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 90 (l)</a> read with\n            <a href=\"/doc/112317332/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 89 (1) (ii)</a> of the Finance Act 1994 presupposes the arrival of\n            a satisfaction regarding the Assessee having collected service tax but\n            failing to pay to the Department as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/175025000/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 89 (l) (d)</a>\n            thereof. The question that would arise is whether there can be a pre-\n            determination regarding the offence under <a href=\"/doc/112317332/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the\n            Finance Act 1994 without issuance of a notice under <a href=\"/doc/78626786/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 73 (l)</a>\n            regarding the alleged evasion of payment of service tax in the sum of\n            Rs. 17 crores, followed by an adjudication.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">     13. The Court accordingly issued an interim direction restraining the DGCEI\n     from taking any further coercive action against eBIZ or its officials.\n     Thereafter, in para 10 it was clarified as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            ―10. It is clarified that as far as the proceedings consequent upon the\n            arrest of the MD of the Petitioner pending in the Court of the learned\n            ASJ is concerned, it will proceed in accordance with law and this\n            Court expresses no opinion in that regard. Further, it is made clear that\n            the Petitioner will continue to cooperate with the DGCEI, answer the\n            queries and provide whatever documents are available in its\n            possession as and when required by the DGCEI.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">     14. The Court was informed that a notice dated 21 st/22nd January 2016 had\n     been received from the ST Commissionerate, Ghaziabad asking for\n     documents relating to FYs 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, which had already\n     been seized by the DGCEI. In those circumstances, the Court directed the\n     Service Tax Commissionerate, Ghaziabad, to be impleaded as Respondent\n     No. 3 and further directed that the proceedings consequent upon such notice\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                        Page 7 of 69</span>\n      shall remain stayed till the next date.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">     15. On the hearing on 2nd May 2016, the records produced by the DGCEI\n     included a note dated 18th January 2016, proposing the arrest of Mr. Malhan.\n     The first line of the said note read thus: ―An information has been received\n     in this Directorate General that M/s. Ebiz.Com Private Ltd. B-18, Sector-63,\n     Noida, Uttar Pradesh 201301 are not discharging their service tax liability\n     properly‖. When the Court enquired whether the DGCEI had verified such\n     information with the Commissionerate of Service Tax in whose jurisdiction\n     the eBIZ was functioning and had been assessed and paying service tax, Mr.\n     Satish Aggarwala, learned counsel for the DGCEI stated, on instructions,\n     that DGCEI never contacted the Commissionerate of Service Tax at any\n     stage prior to the search, seizure and arrest of Mr. Malhan. He added that the\n     DGCEI was not obliged to do so. When asked what was the ‗information&#x27;\n     received, Mr. Aggarwala stated that this had been kept in another file in a\n     sealed cover in the custody of Mr. Vivek Pandey, Joint Director, DGCEI. In\n     the circumstances, the Court passed an order on 2nd May 2016, directing Mr.\n     Pandey to remain present in the Court on the next date along with the file\n     which carried the information on the basis of which the decision was taken\n     to arrest Mr. Malhan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">     16. In the meanwhile, since the counter affidavit had been filed by the\n     DGCEI and the rejoinder thereto filed by the Petitioner, further permission\n     at the request of Mr. Aggarwala was granted for the DGCEI to file a further\n     short affidavit which would only deal with any new point made in the\n     rejoinder which required such response.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">     17. On 18th May 2016, Mr. Vivek Pandey brought the abovementioned file\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 8 of 69</span>\n      containing the information in a sealed cover. Although Mr. Aggarwala\n     requested the Court to not open the sealed cover in the Court, since\n     according to him even the mere sight of the papers in the file might give an\n     indication to the counsel for the Petitioner the nature of the documents\n     contained therein and might reveal the identity of the informer who gave the\n     information, the Court on opening the packet found that there was absolutely\n     nothing in the said documents, which were actually photocopies and a\n     booklet, which could convey any such further information on mere sight as\n     suggested by Mr. Aggarwala.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">     18. The Court nevertheless perused the papers itself. It was found that the\n     information from the file was reduced to computer printed sheet containing\n     information recording the functioning of eBIZ, which was undated. There\n     was a thumb impression purportedly of the informant at the bottom of the\n     page without disclosing the name of the informer. The packet also contained\n     a declaration purportedly given by the informer to the DGCEI, which again\n     only bore a thumb print without any name and without any date or place.\n     The Court found nothing in the said information which was not already part\n     of the record of the case. In any event, it was not information which was not\n     already available with the ST Department.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">     19. Three separate counter affidavits have been filed. The counter affidavits\n     filed by Respondent No.1/Union of India and Respondent No.2/DGCEI are\n     word to word identical. A separate counter affidavit has been filed by the ST\n     Department/Respondent No.3, which was impleaded by the order dated 28 th\n     January 2016.

The counter affidavit on behalf of the ST Department (Respondent No.3)\n      has been filed by Mr. Udai Bhan Singh, Assistant Commissioner, Circle-4,\n      Audit-II, Commissionerate, Central Excise &amp; Service Tax, Ghaziabad. It\n      confirms that eBIZ is registered with the Service Tax Commissionerate at\n      Noida with the registration number AABCE3009PST001. It further confirms\n      that eBIZ has obtained service tax registration in respect of following\n      services:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             i. Tour operator service.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">             ii.

It is stated that the Central Excise &amp; Service, Audit-II Commissionerate,\n      Ghaziabad came into existence with effect from 15th October 2014. It is\n      pointed out that the Assessees are selected for audit from time to time as per\n      audit norms specified in the Audit Manual. It is stated that in the year 2014-\n      2015, for the first time, the Audit Commissionerate, Ghaziabad conducted an\n      audit of eBIZ in terms of Rule 5A of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 (‗ST\n      Rules&#x27;). It is stated that in response to the letter sent to eBIZ informing them\n      about the scheduled audit and requesting them to produce the relevant\n      documents, eBIZ submitted the balance sheet for FY 2013-2014, half-yearly\n      service tax returns for the same year, registration certificate in Form ST-2,\n      the statement of CENVAT credit etc. Thereafter, the audit team visited the\n      business premises of eBIZ in the months of November and December and\n      conducted the service tax audit. The list of financial records produced before\n      the audit team has also been set out in the counter affidavit.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.

It is further stated that on examination of the sale invoices issued by\n      eBIZ in respect of its tour operator services, it was seen that it had\n      specifically mentioned the description of services as ‗eBIZ Holiday\n      Accommodation Package&#x27; in its sale invoices and the same were issued in\n      favour of clients desirous to avail a ‗Holiday accommodation package&#x27;. The\n      invoices also contained a declaration by the client inter alia stating that the\n      client has ―read and completely understood the terms and conditions‖ for\n      availing the holiday accommodation package and had agreed to them. The\n      declaration from the client further read: ―I have received eBIZ Special\n      Educational package (Free) online immediately after registration.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">      23. Respondent No.3 also acknowledged that 90% abatement from the gross\n      value of ‗Tour Operator Service&#x27; is admissible under Notification\n      No.26/2012-ST subject to the following conditions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">             ―i) CENVAT credit on inputs, capital goods and [input services other\n             than the input service of a tour operator} [input services}, used for\n             providing the taxable service, has not been taken under the provisions\n             of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">             ii) The invoice, bill or challan issued indicates that it is towards the\n             charges for such accommodation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             (iii) This exemption shall not apply in such cases where the invoice,\n             bill or challan issued by the tour operator, in relation to a tour, only\n             includes the service charges for arranging or booking accommodation\n             for any person and does not include the cost of such accommodation.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">      24. It is specifically stated that the audit team accepted the said documents,\n      viz., sale invoices issued by eBIZ in respect of ‗Tour Operator Service&#x27; as\n      valid and genuine documents and further that since the conditions for\n      availing exemption under Notification No.26/2012-ST stood satisfied, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">W.P.

The audit team also\n      examined the brochure/catalogue of eBIZ which gave details of the various\n      packages offered by eBIZ. The brochure also provided the details of 48\n      hotels with domestic destinations and five international destinations for\n      ‗holiday accommodation package&#x27;. The invoices showed the gross amount\n      inclusive of all taxes charged towards price of such hotel holiday\n      accommodation. The income from such service was booked under the head\n      ‗Hotel Holiday accommodation&#x27; by eBIZ in their financial accounts and\n      appropriate service tax based on such claims was paid and also shown in the\n      statutory returns submitted to the Department. In that view of the matter,\n      there was no reason for the audit team to challenge the admissibility of the\n      exemption availed by the Petitioner under Notification No.26/2012-ST.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">      25. Para 11 of the counter affidavit of the ST Department mentions eight\n      audit objections of which five were accepted by eBIZ and these five\n      involved service tax to the tune of Rs. 15.68 lakh. This was deposited by\n      eBIZ on the spot. The remaining objections were not accepted and an SCN\n      dated 2nd November 2015 was issued for recovery of service tax of Rs.\n      5,33,541/- and the said SCN is stated to be pending adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">      26. Respondent No. 3 further states that eBIZ was again selected for audit in\n      2014-2015 and again asked by a letter dated 13th October 2015 issued by the\n      audit team to submit the relevant documents/records. After some of the\n      information/records were submitted on 15th December 2015, the audit of the\n      Unit was initiated but the same could not be completed. This was followed\n      by a written request on 6th January 2016 from the Audit Group-4E to eBIZ\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                         Page 12 of 69</span>\n       asking it to produce vouchers in respect of all types of holiday packages and\n      related bills raised by respective hotels for the accommodation arranged by\n      eBIZ for its customers for the FYs 2013-2014 and 2014-2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">      27. In its counter-affidavit, Respondent No. 3 states that the documents\n      required by notice dated 6th January 2016 were only to examine and verify\n      the quantum of abatement availed by eBIZ and not for examining the issue\n      of admissibility of exemption. Another reminder was sent on 22nd January\n      2016. However, in view of the order dated 28th January 2016 of this Court,\n      no further action was taken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">      28. Respondent No. 3 points out that the functioning of the audit is different\n      from the functioning of the DGCEI and that ―both work in their respective\n      exclusive domain.‖ It is sought to be suggested that private records\n      maintained by eBIZ are normally accepted as valid for the purposes of\n      computation of tax liability and no further assessment of tax liability as\n      declared by the Assessee is done by the ST Department. However, to ensure\n      that service tax liability is discharged correctly and that there is no escaping\n      of tax liability due to ―ignorance, bona fide mistake or otherwise, audit of\n      the financial and statutory records maintained by the Assessee is carried out\n      from time to time.‖ It is stated that the audit report issued after the audit\n      ―certifies the correctness of tax assessment only so far as it is based on the\n      records/documents as produced by the Assessee. Further, the authenticity of\n      such records/documents, produced by the Assessee, is generally accepted\n      and not challenged unless and until there is any apparent and obvious reason\n      to disbelieve.‖ It is stated that for unearthing any such planned and\n      deliberate evasion of tax as is done by the DGCEI, the audit is not equipped\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                        Page 13 of 69</span>\n       and that such deliberate evasion can be detected only with some specific\n      input/information against the Assessee and on carrying out further\n      investigation including search of business premises and other related\n      premises, seizure of records including incriminating records, recording of\n      statements of related persons and further follow-up investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">      29. It is, however, repeatedly stressed by the ST Department that when the\n      audit was conducted ―there was no reason to suspect the authenticity of the\n      records/documents produced by the party and the exemption under\n      Notification No. 26/2012-ST was found to be admissible to the Petitioner, on\n      the basis of audit of their records produced before the audit‖. The Audit\n      Department has nothing to say about the SCN issued by the jurisdictional\n      Service Tax Commissionerate, which has been referred to in para 9 of the\n      writ petition and that it pertained to some other issue and the same is not\n      related to the issue of admissibility of exemption under Notification\n      No.26/2012-ST. It is pointed out that under <a href=\"/doc/134470043/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 70(1)</a> of the FA, the\n      Assessee has to declare the true and correct nature of the services provided\n      and has to pay service tax due thereon. It is stated that fresh proceedings for\n      recovery of service tax for the same period are warranted, if the issues of\n      classification of services declared by the Assessee are found to be false or\n      different on the basis of facts not disclosed earlier in any of the statutory\n      record by the party.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">      Counter affidavits of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">      30. As earlier mentioned, two separate identically worded counter affidavits\n      have been filed by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. The same officer,\n      viz., Mr. Samanjasa Das, Additional Director General (‗ADG&#x27;), DGCEI has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.

The DGCEI states that the competent authority had reasons to believe on\n      the basis of the material available before him, that certain incriminating\n      documents showing large scale service tax evasion had been secreted away\n      in the premises of eBIZ. Therefore, a search was conducted in the premises\n      of eBIZ under Section 82 of the FA. Similarly, the arrest of Mr. Malhan was\n      also stated to be just and proper and in terms of Section 91 of FA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      32. It is sought to be suggested that although this Court by its order dated\n      28th January 2016 required eBIZ to cooperate with the DGCEI, the MD of\n      eBIZ had still not provided data of individual associates regarding the\n      amount received from individual associates and date of receipt etc. till date.\n      A reference is made to the statement made by Mr. Sulabh Jain, Accountant\n      of eBIZ on 14th March 2016, to the effect that in &#x27;Tally&#x27;, the data of\n      individual associates was not maintained and that it was not accessible. It\n      was stated by Mr. Jain that the revenue data was provided by the technical\n      team headed by Mr. Dhirendra. It is then stated that on 6 th April 2016, Mr.\n      Dhirendra was summoned and in his statement he stated that he was not\n      dealing with the records. On 9th April 2016, the MD submitted a letter that\n      the entire data with respect to details of business associates was available in\n      the CPU, which had been taken away during the search and seizure\n      operation. It was then acknowledged vide letter dated 18th April 2016 by the\n      son of the MD and advocate for eBIZ, Mr. Rajveer Singh, stating that they\n      had brought 123 cartons of documents relating to the associates of eBIZ in a\n      truck. It was then stated that DGCEI did not call for the said documents and\n      only certain details of individual associates had been called for. It was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.

It was stated that two of\n      the 123 cartons were opened and nothing relevant was found. This, it is\n      stated, is a glaring instance of non-cooperation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">      Rejoinder Affidavit by the Petitioner\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">      33.

An affidavit dated 16th May 2016 has been filed by Mr. Rajveer Singh,\n      counsel for eBIZ. Consequent to the letter dated 8th April 2016 of the\n      DGCEI requiring the MD of eBIZ to submit documents requested therein,\n      Mr. Rajveer Singh along with the Mr. Hitik Malhan, visited the office of the\n      DGCEI on 18th April 2016 carrying the documents in original in 123 cartons\n      loaded in a truck. It is stated that at the reception of the DGCEI office, the\n      deponent&#x27;s as well as Mr. Malhan&#x27;s mobile phones were seized by the\n      officer present at the reception citing rules and regulations that had to be\n      followed by anyone entering the office of the DGCEI. It is stated that one\n      Mr. Ravindra Tyagi, Intelligence Officer was directed to take possession of\n      the documents. However, Mr. Tyagi on reaching the truck was stated to have\n      used abusive language and made the advocate and the client wait till 4:30\n      p.m. and thereafter stated that they would not be taking possession of the\n      documents since they were irrelevant. It is stated that some wrong\n      statements were recorded in the panchnama and therefore the advocate and\n      his client requested for a change to be made. It is stated that Mr. Tyagi was\n      again abusive at that stage. With the intervention of Mr. Shivendu Pandey,\n      SIO, the officer, Mr. Tyagi, was made to apologise and thereafter the\n      panchnama was signed after necessary modification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">      37.

The facts\n      concerning the two earlier searches were not found mentioned in the note\n      prepared for proceeding with the arrest of Mr. Malhan. If only the DGCEI\n      had called for information from the ST Department, it would have been\n      informed that on 12th January 2007 a search had taken place as a result of\n      which a SCN dated 13th July 2007 had been issued. The adjudication order\n      as a result of the said SCN was set aside by the Commissioner (Appeals) by\n      an order dated 29th August 2012. This entailed a refund to eBIZ of Rs.\n      25,55,000 as service tax, Rs.2,59,000 as interest, Rs.6,37,000 as penalty\n      totalling Rs. 34,51,500. Despite an application dated 27 th January 2014, the\n      said amount, which had been deposited under protest by eBIZ, had not been\n      refunded to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_52\">      (vii) The arrest memo also did not mention that a second search had taken\n      place on 4th October 2012 of the premises of eBIZ by the Anti-Evasion Wing\n      of the Noida Commissionerate. However, till date no demand has been\n      raised as a result of the said search.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">      (viii) The ST Department has in its counter affidavit admitted to the fact that\n      for the past 10 years it had been regularly conducting audit of eBIZ&#x27;s books\n      of accounts and records while deputing its officers in exercise of the power\n      under Rule 5A of the Service Tax Rules, 1994. While there was no evidence\n      regarding any tax evasion, the discrepancies pointed out were immediately\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">W.P.

Throughout, eBIZ&#x27;s claim for entitlement of exemption under\n      Notification 29/2006-ST was not disputed. In other words, even during the\n      course of the audit, the ST Department acknowledged that eBIZ was\n      availing of 90% abatement under the said notification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">      (ix) In every half-yearly service tax return, copies of which have been placed\n      on record, eBIZ disclosed the full receipt of the charges collected for hotel\n      bookings as a ‗tour operator&#x27; with full computation by claiming exemption\n      under Notification No. 26/2012-ST. The records from 2009 till 2015 during\n      which such returns had been filed have been duly verified by the ST\n      Department and no discrepancy had been pointed out. The SCN issued on\n      17th November 2014 demanding service tax of Rs.34,00,425 and the SCN\n      dated 2nd November 2015 demanding service tax of Rs.5,33,341 covered the\n      periods 2009-10 and 2013-14. The disputed tax amount was around Rs. 40\n      lakhs whereas the refund claimed by Petitioner was around Rs. 35 lakhs.\n      There was no occasion whatsoever and it was impermissible in law for the\n      DGCEI to seek to invoke <a href=\"/doc/175025000/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 89</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/54020930/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 90</a> and <a href=\"/doc/110234480/\" id=\"a_22\">91</a> and arrest\n      of Mr. Malhan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"168710730\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"494062\" id=\"span_26\">(x) There was no provision in the FA for reopening of completed\n      assessments of earlier years.

It is submitted that the\n      decision to go in for a search operation was not arbitrary. The information\n      received is developed by a senior officer and then discussed with superior\n      officers. It is only after a brainstorming exercise by the officers on the\n      information received that the decision was taken. Accordingly, authorisation\n      to search the premises of eBIZ was issued following the due procedure of\n      law as laid down under <a href=\"/doc/74746419/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 82</a> of the FA.

It was essentially engaged in the\n      business of providing educational packages camouflaging them as ‗tour\n      operators services&#x27;. Therefore, eBIZ had committed fraud by claiming\n      exemption under Notification No. 26/2012. Inasmuch as eBIZ had not\n      arranged for a tour which was an essential ingredient of the service provided\n      by a ‗tour operator&#x27; in terms of <a href=\"/doc/186455273/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 65 (105) (n)</a> of the FA and which\n      was admitted by the officials of the eBIZ during the course of investigation,\n      the Competent Authority was justified in authorising the arrest of Mr.\n      Malhan. It is urged that the legality of the arrest of Mr. Malhan is not the\n      subject matter of the present petition. Nevertheless, the arrest had been\n      approved by the Competent Authority under <a href=\"/doc/110234480/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 91</a> of the FA and which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">W.P.

The procedure\n      established by law had been duly followed while carrying out the arrest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">      (iv) The details disclosed during the course of search reflected that against\n      the total income of Rs. 170 crores from December 2011 till 19th January\n      2016, the expenses on account of hotel bookings was only 0.09%. The\n      contents of the educational packages were provided free under the garb of\n      ‗holiday accommodation packages&#x27; while the price of Rs. 10,880 (inclusive\n      of all taxes) was same for both the education packages as well as the holiday\n      accommodation packages. This was, therefore, a clear fraud committed by\n      eBIZ to evade paying service tax at the full applicable rate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">      (v) Rule 5A of the ST Rules provided limited access to the declared records\n      whereas <a href=\"/doc/74746419/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 82</a> of the FA gave the power to search and seize documents\n      or books or things secreted in the premises which would be useful for or\n      relevant to any proceedings. Thus the scope of the audit by the Audit Team\n      of the ST Department was different from the search that could be undertaken\n      by the DGCEI. The audit party in the present case accepted the documents\n      presented before it by an Assessee as genuine without information of any\n      fraud committed by such Assessee. The regular/routine audit cannot be\n      construed as immunity against any other action which can be taken on the\n      basis of ―some specific information/inputs regarding evasion of tax.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">      (vi) Under <a href=\"/doc/78626786/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 73</a> of FA, the ST Department could make enquiries\n      covering a period of past five years in the event the Assessee had not paid\n      service tax by reason of &#x27;fraud&#x27; or &#x27;collusion&#x27; or &#x27;wilful misstatement&#x27; or\n      &#x27;suppression of facts&#x27; or &#x27;contravention of any of the provisions of this\n      Chapter or of the rules made thereunder with an intent to evade payment of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">W.P.

As regards the past searches undertaken\n      by the officers of Anti-Evasion, Jurisdictional Commissionerate, Noida, it\n      was submitted that the search conducted in 2007 was on the issue of non-\n      payment of service tax on handling charges for preparation of cheques,\n      courier charges and other support services related to payment of commission\n      issued by eBIZ to its associates. As far as the 2012 search was concerned, it\n      was on the issue that eBIZ was receiving services from foreign service\n      providers and not discharging its service tax liability on the amount paid to\n      such service provider under the reverse charge mechanism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1515862\" id=\"span_36\">(ix) Reliance is placed on the decisions in State of Gujarat v.

Sales Tax Act, 1948 the Supreme Court in\n             CST v.

The High Court has construed the expression\n                    ―as‖ in the beginning of the sub-clause as significant. Penalty is\n                    leviable for excess realisation of tax, therefore, realisation of\n                    the amount should be as tax and not in any other manner. Then\n                    excess should be over and above the amount of tax legally\n                    payable. This expression obviously means tax payable under\n                    the Act, rules or notification. Therefore, realisation by the\n                    assessee from customers should not be of only sales or\n                    purchases but it should be of the tax legally payable.

The\n                   spirit of the provision lends force to the construction that\n                   &quot;collected&quot; means &quot;collected and kept as his&quot; by the\n                   trader. If the dealer merely gathered the sum by way of tax\n                   and kept it in suspense account because of dispute about\n                   taxability or was ready to return if eventually it was not\n                   taxable, it is not collected. ―Collected‖, in an Australian\n                   Customs Tariff Act, was held by Griffth C.J., not ‗to\n                   include money deposited under an agreement that if it was\n                   not legally payable it will be returned&#x27; (Words &amp; Phrases\n                   p. 274).

In the present case, there is no determination by the DGCEI after issuing\n      an SCN that eBIZ has collected service tax which it has failed to deposit\n      with the Central Government. There is only a presumption drawn by\n      calculating what the probable evasion would be if the exemption had not\n      been availed by eBIZ as a &#x27;tour operator&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">      Analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1702652/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 72 A </a>of the FA and the corresponding Rules\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">      50. The FA does provide for special audits where there is reason to believe\n      that there has been an evasion of service tax by an Assessee. <a href=\"/doc/1702652/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 72 A </a>of\n      the FA provides for a special audit to be ordered by the Commissioner where\n      he has reason to believe that any person liable to pay service tax has failed to\n      declare or determine the value of a taxable service correctly, or has availed\n      and utilised credit of duty or tax paid inter alia by means of fraud, collusion,\n      or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts.

The power of the Commissioner to order a search has to be read together\n      with Rule 5 A (1) of the Service Tax Rules 1994 which permits the officer\n      authorised to carry out the search to &quot;have access to any premises registered\n      under these rules for the purpose of carrying out any scrutiny, verification\n      and checks as may be necessary to safeguard the interest of revenue.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">      52. Thus the audit of the accounts can be undertaken by the ST Department\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                        Page 37 of 69</span>\n       but a &#x27;special audit&#x27; can be undertaken only by the professionals that are\n      mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1702652/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 72 A </a>of the FA. The above provisions are being\n      referred to in the context of DGCEI seeking to make out a case that scope of\n      the audit carried out on two occasions of the records and accounts of eBIZ\n      by the ST Department was different from the scope of the search carried out\n      by DGCEI. It is sought to be suggested that the audit party accepted at face\n      value the information provided by eBIZ without inquiring further into the\n      matter. The Court finds it difficult to accept this contention since it finds that\n      the scope of the powers available to an officer authorised by the\n      Commissioner to carry out a search under Rule 5 A (1) is wide enough to\n      have &#x27;access&#x27; to the records of an Assessee since it empowers the officer to\n      carry out &quot;any scrutiny, verification and checks as may be necessary to\n      safeguard the interest of revenue.&quot; Therefore, the audit already carried out\n      by the anti-evasion wing of the ST Commissionerate cannot be brushed off\n      by the DGCEI as either insignificant or of a lesser scope for the purposes of\n      the determination whether there has been evasion of service tax. It is one\n      thing to say, after examining the records of past searches and audits, that\n      there is still reason to believe that there has been evasion of tax for the\n      grounds recorded but it is another to come to such conclusion without even\n      referring to the records of the audit and searches carried out earlier. The\n      latter would be vulnerable to being assailed on ground of lack of application\n      of mind to relevant material which would enable an officer vested with the\n      power in that behalf to come to a just, fair and reasonable conclusion. The\n      present case falls in the latter category.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">      53. The Court also finds that the fear that if the DGCEI had contacted the ST\n      Department prior to the search, the security of the informer would have been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">W.P.

The notes on file show that after\n      the search was concluded, the DGCEI wrote to the ST Department seeking\n      the relevant records. This could have easily have been done prior to the\n      search without making any mention of any informer. The fact remains that at\n      the time the search was contemplated by the DGCEI, there was no attempt at\n      finding out what the history of the Assessee was as far as its compliance\n      with the requirements of the FA was concerned. The records of the earlier\n      searches and audits were certainly relevant material as far as the decision to\n      order a fresh search was concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">      Power to search premises\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">      54.

A plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 89</a> reveals that a distinction is sought\n             to be made in the first instance between the offence where the amount\n             exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs (raised to Rs. 1 crore by a Circular dated 23rd\n             October, 2015 and now Rs. 2 crore by the 2016 amendment) and\n             where it is less than Rs. 50 lakhs.

The determination of commission\n             of the offence has to be made by the Court and not by any of the\n             officers of the Department.

It is important to note that determination of the commission of an\n             offence for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 89</a> has to be made by the Court.\n             Prior thereto, there can only be prima facie determination of such\n             commission of offence. It may also be noted that by the amendments\n             of 2013 the structure of <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 89</a> underwent a change. A distinction\n             was drawn between the offences of the type described under <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_101\">Section\n             89 (1) (a)</a>, (b) and (c) on the one hand and <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the FA\n             on the other. The former would be a non-cognizable whereas the latter\n             was made cognizable and linked to <a href=\"/doc/32493960/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 91 (1)</a> regarding the power\n             of arrest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">             66. There are two aspects of the proceedings as far as <a href=\"/doc/20704593/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 73A</a> and\n             <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the FA is concerned. <a href=\"/doc/20704593/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 73A</a> sets out the\n             procedure for determination whether the situation envisaged\n             thereunder exists. That procedure requires notice to be served on the\n             person liable to pay such amount requiring him ―to show cause why\n             the said amount, as specified in the notice, should not be paid by him\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 43 of 69</span>\n              to the credit of the Central Government.‖ Therefore, under <a href=\"/doc/20704593/\" id=\"a_107\">Section\n             73A (4)</a>, the Central Excise Officer concerned shall, after considering\n             the representation made by such person, determine the amount due\n             from such person, not being in excess of the amount specified in the\n             notice. Those two steps are essential before it can be concluded that a\n             person has collected service tax which is payable to the Central\n             Government and has not paid it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">             67. The second part of the procedure concerns the levy of penalty\n             under <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 89(1) (d)</a> of the FA. Here, two things are necessary\n             apart from first determining that a person has committed the offence\n             of collecting an amount of service tax but has failed to pay the amount\n             collected. One is that it should not be paid beyond a period of six\n             months from the date on which such payment becomes due. The\n             second aspect is that the sentence as provided under <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 89 (1) (ii)</a>\n             of the FA, where the amount exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs, is imprisonment\n             for a term which may extend to seven years. The proviso thereto\n             suggests that for special and adequate reasons, the imprisonment can\n             be lesser than six months in such cases. Where the amount does not\n             exceed Rs. 50 lakhs, the imprisonment is for a term which may extend\n             to one year. Where the person is again convicted for the subsequent\n             offence, then the imprisonment is for a term which may extend to\n             seven years. The above analysis is relevant for considering whether an\n             offence is cognizable or not and consequently whether the provisions\n             concerning arrest get attracted.‖\n\n      Power to arrest\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">      59.

In other words, on a\n                   construction of the definitions of the different expressions used\n                   in the Code and also in connected enactments in respect of a\n                   non-cognizable offence, a police officer, and, in the instant case\n                   an excise officer, will have no authority to make an arrest\n                   without obtaining a warrant for the said purpose. The same\n                   provision is contained in <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 4</a> of the Code which specifies\n                   when a police officer may arrest without order from a\n                   Magistrate or without warrant.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">             70. Consistent with this understanding, <a href=\"/doc/32493960/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 91(1)</a> of the FA\n             provides that where the offence has been committed under <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 89\n             (1) (ii)</a> of the FA, the Commissioner of Central Excise may authorize\n             any officer of the Central Excise not below the rank of Superintendent\n             of Central Excise to arrest such person. Where the arrest is of a person\n             for any non-cognizable and bailable offence, the Assistant\n             Commissioner (AC) or the Deputy Commissioner (DC), as the case\n             may be, has the same powers as an officer-in-charge of a police\n             station has under Section 436 of the Cr PC for the purpose of\n             releasing such arrested person on a bail. This contemplates the\n             offences under <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 89 (1) (ii)</a> of the\n             FA as being cognizable and the commission of offences other than\n             that under <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/71587725/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 89 (1) (ii)</a> of the FA as\n             being non-cognizable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">             71.

It is difficult to conceive of the DGCEI or for that matter the ST\n             Department being able to by-pass the procedure as set out in <a href=\"/doc/20704593/\" id=\"a_139\">Section\n             73A (3)</a> and (4) of the FA before going ahead with the arrest of a\n             person under <a href=\"/doc/68317/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 90</a> and <a href=\"/doc/105799473/\" id=\"a_141\">91</a> of the FA. The power of arrest is,\n             therefore, to be used with great circumspection and not casually. It is\n             not to be straightway presumed by the DGCEI, without following the\n             procedure under <a href=\"/doc/20704593/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 73A (3)</a> and (4) of the FA, that a person has\n             collected service tax and retained such amount without depositing it to\n             the credit of the Central Government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">             73. It is sought to be suggested by the DGCEI that, for the purposes of\n             arrest, it is not necessary for the adjudication proceedings to have\n             concluded. However, when the scheme of the provisions in the FA is\n             carefully analysed, the said submission appears to be legally\n             untenable. There are statutes concerning both direct and indirect taxes.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_148\">             <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_143\">The Income Tax Act, 1961</a> is an example of a direct tax statute. <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_144\">The\n             Customs Act, 1962</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_145\">Central Excise Act, 1944</a> are two of the\n             many indirect tax statutes. These statutes have specific provisions\n             which describe offences and the corresponding punishments.\n             However, the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_146\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a>, in regard to\n             offences and penalties, is distinct from the scheme under the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_147\">Central\n             Excise Act, 1944</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_148\">Customs Act, 1962</a>. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_149\">Under the Income Tax\n             Act, 1961</a> there is a detailed procedure for assessment and it is only at\n             the conclusion of the assessment that the Assessing Officer (‗AO&#x27;)\n             decides whether penalty proceedings should be initiated. It is only at\n             that stage a decision is taken on initiating prosecution against the\n             Assessee for the commission of any of the offences under that statute.\n             It is inconceivable that an Assessee is straightway sought to be\n             arrested without there being an assessment and a determination as to\n             evasion of tax.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">             74. <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_150\">The Customs Act, 1962</a>, has a different approach to the question\n             of offences. Chapter XVI thereof describes with specificity the types\n             of offences and the procedure adopted in prosecuting such offences.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 47 of 69</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">              Section 138A enables the court to draw a presumption, which is\n             rebuttable, of the culpable mental state of the person charged with an\n             offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_151\">Customs Act, 1962</a> which requires such culpable\n             mental state. Even for the purposes of confiscation of smuggled\n             goods, <a href=\"/doc/1571757/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 123</a> of the Customs Act, 1962 shifts the burden of\n             proof in the case of &#x27;smuggling&#x27;, to the person from whom the goods\n             are seized to show that they are not smuggled goods. Powers are given\n             to the Customs Officer under <a href=\"/doc/1970428/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 108</a> to record statements which\n             are admissible in law. The point to be noted is that coercive powers\n             under taxing statutes are hedged in by limits on the use of that power\n             by in-built restrictions and limitations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">             75. It is for this reason that the powers of a Central Excise Officer\n             under the FA cannot be compared with the powers exercised by the\n             same officer either under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_154\">Customs Act</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_155\">Central Excise Act</a>.\n             Each of those statutes has a different and distinct scheme which does\n             not bear comparison with the FA. For example, the FA envisages\n             filing of periodic returns which is comparable to the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_156\">Income Tax Act</a>,\n             whereas the assessment under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_157\">Customs Act</a> is of individual bills of\n             entry. AS noticed earlier, the scheme of the FA provisions points to an\n             assessment, followed by an adjudication of penalty under Section 83\n             A of the FA. There are a separate set of provisions for launching\n             prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"649094\" id=\"span_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1915525\" id=\"span_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1591163\" id=\"span_74\">76.

In the context of the provisions of the FA where an assessee has\n             been regularly filing service tax returns which have been accepted by\n             the ST Department or which in any event have been examined by it,\n             as in the case of the two Petitioners, it is difficult to imagine that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 48 of 69</span>\n              without the commencement of the process of adjudication of penalty\n             in terms of Section 83-A of the FA, another agency like the DGCEI\n             can without an SCN or enquiry or investigation straightway go ahead\n             to make an arrest merely on the suspicion of evasion of service tax or\n             failure to deposit service tax that has been collected. Therefore, for a\n             Central Excise officer or an officer of the DGCEI duly empowered\n             and authorised in that behalf to be satisfied that a person has\n             committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the FA, it would\n             require an enquiry to be conducted by giving an opportunity to the\n             person sought to be arrested to explain the materials and\n             circumstances gathered against such person, which according to the\n             officer points to the commission of an offence. Specific to <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 89\n             (1) (d)</a> of the FA, it has to be determined with some degree of\n             certainty that a person has collected service tax but has failed to pay\n             the amount so collected to the Central Government beyond the period\n             of six months from the date on which such payment is due and further\n             that the amount exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">             78. Therefore, while the prosecution for the purposes of determining\n             the commission of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the FA and\n             adjudication proceedings for penalty under Section 83 A of the FA\n             can go on simultaneously, both will have to be preceded by the\n             adjudication for the purposes of determining the evasion of service\n             tax. The Petitioners are, therefore, right that without any such\n             determination, to straightaway conclude that the Petitioners had\n             collected and not deposited service tax in excess of Rs. 50 lakhs and\n             thereby had committed a cognizable offence would be putting the cart\n             before the horse. This is all the more so because one consequence of\n             such determination is the triggering of the power to arrest under\n             Section 90 (1) of the FA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"161154219\" id=\"span_76\">79.

The Court held that &quot;the amount payable by a person can be said\n             to be payable only after there is determination as provided under\n             <a href=\"/doc/276544/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 72</a> or <a href=\"/doc/115049/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 73</a> of the Act.&quot; It further held, &quot;the conduct of\n             the Revenue, firstly coercing the Assessee to make payment and\n             thereafter not deciding the returns under <a href=\"/doc/276544/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 72</a> or not taking\n             recourse to <a href=\"/doc/115049/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 73</a>, and asking the Assessee to take recourse to\n             <a href=\"/doc/1674207/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 11-B</a> cannot be said to be just fair and reasonable approach.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"161154219\" id=\"span_78\">80. One caveat, however, may be where a person is shown to be a\n             habitual evader of service tax. Such person would have to be one who\n             has not filed a service tax return for a continuous length of time, who\n             has a history of repeated defaults for which there have been fines,\n             penalties imposed and prosecutions launched etc. That history can be\n             gleaned only from past records of the ST Department. In such\n             instance, it might be possible to justify resorting to the coercive\n             provisions straightaway. But then the notes on file must offer a\n             convincing justification for resorting to that extreme a measure. What,\n             however, requires reiteration is that the potent power of arrest should\n             not be lightly and casually exercised to induce fear into an assessee\n             and the consequential submission to the unreasonable demands made\n             by officers of the investigating agency during the interrogation and\n             while in custody.

Arrest at the\n             investigation stage should be resorted to only when it is\n             unavoidable.&quot; (emphasis supplied)‖\n\n      Constitutional safeguards\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">      61.

These safeguards have been\n      judicially evolved by reading constitutional limitations into the width and\n      ambit of these powers. This Court in MakeMy Trip (India) Pvt.

An officer whether\n             of the Central Excise department or another agency like the DGCEI,\n             authorised to exercise powers under the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_192\">CE Act</a> and/or the FA will\n             have to be conscious of the constitutional limitations on the exercise\n             of such power. This has been implicitly acknowledged in the circulars\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                          Page 53 of 69</span>\n              issued from time to time by the Central Board of Excise and Customs\n             (‗CBEC&#x27;). Insofar as officers of the Central Excise are concerned, the\n             Service Tax Wing of the CBEC initially issued Circular No.\n             171/6/2013-Service Tax dated 17th September, 2013 where specific\n             attention has been drawn to the types of cases covered under <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_193\">Section\n             89 (1) (i)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_194\">89 (1) (ii)</a>. In the latter case, it has been mandated that\n             after following the due procedure of arrest, the arrested person must\n             be produced before the Magistrate without unnecessary delay and\n             definitely within 24 hours. Para 2 of the said circular specifies\n             ‗conditions precedent&#x27;. Para 2.1 states that, since arrest impinges on\n             the personal liberty of an individual ―this power must be exercised\n             carefully‖. It has been mandated that an officer of the Central Excise\n             not below the rank of the Superintendent can carry out an arrest on\n             being authorised by the Commissioner of Central Excise. It is further\n             stated that to authorise the arrest, the ―Commissioner should have\n             reason to believe that the person proposed to be arrested has\n             committed an offence specified in clause (i) or clause (ii) of sub-\n             section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 89</a>‖ of the FA. Importantly, it states ―the reason\n             to believe must be based on credible material which will stand judicial\n             scrutiny‖. The further criterion is spelt out in para 2.3 which reads\n             thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">                    ―2.3 Apart from fulfilling the legal requirements, the need\n                    to ensure proper investigation, prevention of the possibility\n                    of tampering with evidence of intimidating or influencing\n                    witnesses and large amounts of service tax evaded are\n                    relevant factors before deciding to arrest a person.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">             85. It is, therefore, plain that the decision to arrest a person must not\n             be taken on whimsical grounds. To recapitulate, reasons to believe\n             must be based on ‗credible material&#x27;. The decision must also be\n             conveyed at the earliest to a superior officer who will constantly\n             monitor the progress in the investigations. He will ensure that there is\n             no tampering of the evidence gathered and at the same time ensure\n             that there is no intimidation or coercion of the suspects and/or\n             witnesses.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">      Notes on file\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">      62.

The question is not so much about the existence of\n      powers but the proper exercise of those powers by the DGCEI. Court would\n      begin by a caveat that it is not concerned here with the sufficiency or\n      relevance of the materials available with the DGCEI. The Court is called\n      upon to determine whether on the basis of the materials available to it, the\n      DGCEI could have proceeded to form a prima facie opinion regarding the\n      commission of an offence by eBIZ under <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_196\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> read with 89 (1)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">      (ii) of the FA.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">      63. There are two notes in the file of the DGCEI. The first is the note dated\n      18th January 2016 prepared by Mr. Shivendu Pandey, SIO regarding the\n      search of the premises of eBIZ. The note begins by referring to ‗an\n      information&#x27; that has been received that eBIZ is not discharging its service\n      tax liability properly. It is this information that was asked to be seen by the\n      Court when it asked for its production by Mr. Pandey in a sealed cover. This\n      sealed cover was separately produced. On opening the sealed cover, the\n      Court did not find anything incriminating that would indicate that an offence\n      had been committed. Interestingly, the name of the informer is not\n      mentioned in the statement given by the informer. The time and date when\n      the information was given is also not indicated. There is also no signature of\n      the informer. There is only a thumb impression, again without indicating\n      whether it is a left or right thumb impression. The declaration given by the\n      informer does not appear to be on a prescribed proforma but on a computed\n      printed sheet. Further, the information itself is not reduced in writing. It is\n      typed. It does not disclose any specific information other than those already\n      set out in the notes prepared by the DGCEI.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">W.P.

The note dated 18th January 2016 suggests that 90% rebate is claimed by\n      eBIZ by describing itself as a ‗tour operator&#x27;. There is a discussion on this\n      wrongful claim of rebate in terms of the Notification No. 26/2012. It\n      proceeds to compute the service tax that would have been payable if the\n      rebate was not availed of and then concludes that there is an evasion of\n      service tax to that extent. Significantly, the note does not acknowledge that\n      eBIZ is regularly filing service tax returns and paying service tax on that\n      basis. There is no mention of the fact that there had been two earlier searches\n      in the premises of eBIZ by the ST Department. Admittedly, at this stage no\n      attempt was made by the DGCEI to even contact the ST Department.

It appears that a decision to launch prosecution and a decision to\n             arrest have to be taken more or less simultaneously. In other words,\n             without a decision to launch prosecution there cannot be a decision\n             taken to arrest a person. The decision to launch prosecution must be\n             informed by the safeguards spelt out in Circular No. 1009/16/2015-\n             CX dated 23rd October, 2015. This circular, apart from raising\n             monetary limit, also talks of ‗habitual evaders&#x27;. Para 4.2 of this\n             circular states that prosecution can be launched ―in the case of a\n             company/assessee habitually evading tax/duty or misusing Cenvat\n             Credit facility. A company/assessee would be treated as habitually\n             evading tax/duty or misusing Cenvat Credit facility if it has been\n             involved in three or more cases of confirmed demand (at the first\n             appellate level or above) of Central Excise duty or Service Tax or\n             misuse of Cenvat Credit involving fraud, suppression of facts etc. in\n             the five years from the date of the decision such that the total duty or\n             tax evaded or total credit misused is equal to or more than Rs.

There is a detailed procedure set out in para 6 regarding procedure\n             to sanction a prosecution. Para 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 of this circular are\n             significant and read as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">                    ―6.2 Prosecution should not be launched in cases of\n                    technical nature, or where the additional claim of duty/tax\n                    is based totally on a difference of opinion regarding\n                    interpretation of law. Before launching any prosecution, it\n                    is necessary that the department should have evidence to\n                    prove that the person, company or individual had guilty\n                    knowledge of the offence, or had fraudulent intention to\n                    commit the offence, or in any manner possessed mens rea\n                    (guilty mind) which would indicate his guilt. It follows,\n                    therefore, that in the case of public limited companies,\n                    prosecution should not be launched indiscriminately\n                    against all the Directors of the company but it should be\n                    restricted to only against persons who were in charge of\n                    day-to-day operations of the factory and have taken active\n                    part in committing the duty/tax evasion or had connived at\n                    it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">                    6.3 Prosecution should not be filed merely because a\n                    demand has been confirmed in the adjudication\n                    proceedings particularly in cases of technical nature or\n                    where interpretation of law is involved. One of the\n                    important considerations for deciding whether prosecution\n                    should be launched is the availability of adequate evidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">                    The standard of proof required in a criminal prosecution is\n                    higher as the case has to be established beyond reasonable\n                    doubt whereas the adjudication proceedings are decided on\n                    the basis of preponderance of probability. Therefore, even\n                    cases where demand is confirmed in adjudication\n                    proceedings, evidence collected should be weighed so as to\n                    likely meet the test of being beyond reasonable doubt for\n                    recommending prosecution. Decision should be taken on\n                    case-to-case basis considering various factors, such as,\n                    nature and gravity of offence, quantum of duty/tax evaded\n                    or Cenvat credit wrongly availed and the nature as well as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">W.P.

However, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\n                    the case of Radheyshyam Kejriwal [2011 (266) ELT 294\n                    (SC)] has inter alia, observed the following (i) adjudication\n                    proceedings and criminal proceedings can be launched\n                    simultaneously; (ii) decision in adjudication proceedings is\n                    not necessary before initiating criminal prosecution; (iii)\n                    adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are\n                    independent in nature to each other and (iv) the findings\n                    against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication\n                    proceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal\n                    prosecution. Therefore, prosecution may even be launched\n                    before the adjudication of the case, especially where\n                    offence involved is grave, qualitative evidences are\n                    available and it is also apprehended that party may delay\n                    completion of adjudication proceedings.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">             96. What this circular again underscores is that there should be a\n             comprehensive analysis of the evidence gathered before deciding to\n             go in for prosecution. Importantly, prosecution should not be launched\n             merely because a demand has been confirmed or particularly where\n             the cases are of technical nature or where interpretation of law is\n             involved. It is also not to be launched where additional claim of\n             duty/tax is only based on difference of opinion regarding\n             interpretation of law. Importantly, it has to be normally taken only\n             ―immediately upon completion of adjudication proceedings‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">             97. There is a reason behind this stipulation that prosecution should\n             normally be launched only after the adjudication is complete. The\n             &#x27;adjudication&#x27; in this context is the adjudication of the penalty under\n             Section 83 A of the FA. That provision mandates that there must be in\n             the first place a determination that a person is &quot;liable to a penalty&quot;,\n             which cannot happen till there is in the first place a determination in\n             terms of <a href=\"/doc/276544/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 72</a> or 73 or 73 A of the FA. Till that point, the entire\n             case proceeds on the basis that there must be an apprehended evasion\n             of tax by the Assessee. This apprehension hinges upon the analysis of\n             the evidence gathered by the investigating agency. It is possible that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                        Page 60 of 69</span>\n              the officer will take a different view because he has the opportunity of\n             hearing both the sides and to more carefully analyze the evidence that\n             has been gathered. Where prosecution is sought to be launched even\n             before the adjudication of the penalty it has to be shown that (a) the\n             offence involved is grave (b) qualitative evidence is available and (c)\n             it is apprehended that the Assessee may delay the completion of\n             adjudication proceedings.

Significantly, in the present case, no attempt was made by the DGCEI\n      even to talk to the ST Department before proceeding to search the premises\n      of eBIZ and soon thereafter arrest Mr. Malhan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">      70. The explanation offered in Court by Mr. Satish Aggarwala, on\n      instructions, was that these Departments have to act ‗secretly&#x27; to the extent\n      that the DGCEI will not even tell the ST Department of their proposed\n      actions. To the Court, it seems unacceptable that with the guidelines issued\n      for launching of prosecution and procedure for arrest, the DGCEI or any\n      other agency other than the ST Department can form any reasonable opinion\n      regarding such launch of prosecution or go for arrest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"880391\" id=\"span_93\">71.

It has been mentioned in the notes on file in more than one place that Mr.\n      Malhan voluntarily paid Rs. 17 crores as arrears of service tax dues. Mr.\n      Aggarwala repeatedly stressed that such payment was not a pre-condition for\n      the grant of bail and that, in principle, the DGCEI would oppose grant of\n      bail in criminal proceedings only because an offer is made to pay the arrears\n      of service tax dues in such proceedings. The case of eBIZ on the other hand\n      is that such payment was made under extreme duress. The action of the\n      DGCEI has been described by it as malafide and &quot;just to harass&quot; eBIZ and\n      its officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\">      73. This Court has already observed that in the present case the DGCEI did\n      not observe any of the statutory or constitutional safeguards. Not only was\n      the search contrary to <a href=\"/doc/1195187/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 82</a> of the FA, the subsequent action of arrest\n      of Mr. Malhan was undertaken contrary to the legal requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_208\">Section\n      89</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1306192/\" id=\"a_209\">Sections 90</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272624/\" id=\"a_210\">91</a> of the FA.

Such a\n             statement can hardly be said to be voluntary even though it may be\n             made before a Court.

In particular, it is complained that\n      eBIZ was not providing the information sought by the DGCEI. It is stated\n      that a whole truckload of documents were submitted which according to the\n      DGCEI were not relevant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\">      77. The above submission appears to be contrary to the letter dated 8th April,\n      2016 issued to eBIZ by the DGCEI. If indeed only limited information was\n      sought, then the letter dated 8th April 2016 should have been worded\n      differently. What eBIZ was asked to submit was the information in a certain\n      format designed by the DGCEI itself. This format is appended to the letter\n      dated 11th May 2016, issued by Dr. Bedi to eBIZ. There is no requirement in\n      law that eBIZ should maintain the information in a particular format. Mr.\n      Aggarwala was unable to point out any provision in the FA or the ST Rules\n      that required eBIZ to maintain information in a particular format.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">      78. It appears to the Court after carefully considering the affidavits on record\n      that the conduct of the officers of the DGCEI in refusing to receive the\n      documents tendered to them and terming the conduct of eBIZ to be non-\n      cooperative is not justified in the facts and circumstances. At the same time,\n      the Court would reiterate the direction that eBIZ and its officers including\n      Mr. Malhan will continue to co-operate with the DGCEI in carrying the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">W.P.

To summarise the conclusions in this judgment:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">      (i) The scheme of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_214\">Finance Act</a> 1994 (FA), does not\n      permit the DGCEI or for that matter the Service Tax Department (ST\n      Department) to by-pass the procedure as set out in Section 73A (3) and (4)\n      of the FA before going ahead with the arrest of a person under <a href=\"/doc/1306192/\" id=\"a_215\">Sections 90</a>\n      and <a href=\"/doc/1272624/\" id=\"a_216\">91</a> of the FA. The power of arrest is to be used with great\n      circumspection and not casually. It is not to be straightway presumed by the\n      DGCEI, without following the procedure under Section 73A (3) and (4) of\n      the FA, that a person has collected service tax and retained such amount\n      without depositing it to the credit of the Central Government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">      ii) Where an assessee has been regularly filing service tax returns which\n      have been accepted by the ST Department or which in any event have been\n      examined by it, as in the case of the two Petitioners, without commencement\n      of the process of adjudication of penalty under Section 83 A of the FA,\n      another agency like the DGCEI cannot without an SCN or enquiry\n      straightway go ahead to make an arrest merely on the suspicion of evasion of\n      service tax or failure to deposit service tax that has been collected. Section\n      83 A of the FA which provides for adjudication of penalty provision\n      mandates that there must be in the first place a determination that a person is\n      &quot;liable to a penalty&quot;, which cannot happen till there is in the first place a\n      determination in terms of Section 72 or 73 or 73 A of the FA.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\">      (iii) For a Central Excise officer or an officer of the DGCEI duly empowered\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                       Page 65 of 69</span>\n       and authorised in that behalf to be satisfied that a person has committed an\n      offence under <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the FA, it would require an enquiry to be\n      conducted by giving an opportunity to the person sought to be arrested to\n      explain the materials and circumstances gathered against such person, which\n      according to the officer points to the commission of an offence. Specific to\n      <a href=\"/doc/1266570/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 89 (1) (d)</a> of the FA, it has to be determined with some degree of\n      certainty that a person has collected service tax but has failed to pay the\n      amount so collected to the Central Government beyond the period of six\n      months from the date on which such payment is due, and further that the\n      amount exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs (now enhanced to Rs. 1 crore).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">      (iv) A possible exception could be where a person is shown to be a habitual\n      evader of service tax. Such person would have to be one who has not filed a\n      service tax return for a continuous length of time, who has a history of\n      repeated defaults for which there have been fines, penalties imposed and\n      prosecutions launched etc. That history can be gleaned only from past\n      records of the ST Department. In such instances, it might be possible to\n      justify resorting to the coercive provisions straightaway, but then the notes\n      on file must offer a convincing justification for resorting to that extreme a\n      measure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_100\">(v) The decision to arrest a person must not be taken on whimsical grounds;\n      it must be based on ‗credible material&#x27;. The constitutional safeguards laid\n      out in <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_219\">D K. Basu</a>&#x27;s case (supra) in the context of the powers of police\n      officers under the Cr PC and of officers of central excise, customs and\n      enforcement directorates, are applicable to the exercise of powers under the\n      FA in equal measure. An officer, whether of the Central Excise Department\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">W.P. (C) 756/2016                                                      Page 66 of 69</span>\n       or another agency like the DGCEI, authorised to exercise powers under the\n      <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_220\">CE Act</a> and/or the FA will have to be conscious of the constitutional\n      limitations on the exercise of such power.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_186\">      (vi) In the present case, without even an SCN being issued and without there\n      being any determination of the amount of service tax arrears, the resort to\n      the extreme coercive measure of arrest followed by detention of Mr. Malhan\n      was impermissible in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_187\">      (vii) In terms of CBEC&#x27;s own procedures, for the launch of prosecution there\n      has to be a determination that a person is a habitual offender. There is no\n      such determination in the present case. The DGCEI cannot possibly come to\n      a conclusion that an Assessee is an habitual offender if there is no discussion\n      by the DGCEI with the ST Department regarding the history of such\n      Assessee. Assuming that for whatever reasons if the DGCEI does not talk to\n      ST Department, certainly it needs to access the service tax record of such\n      Assessee. Without even requisitioning that record, it could not have been\n      possible for the DGCEI to arrive at a reasonable conclusion whether there\n      was a deliberate attempt of evading payment of service tax.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">      (viii) The search undertaken by the DGCEI of the premises of eBIZ on 19th\n      January 2016 was illegal. For the exercise of powers of search under <a href=\"/doc/1195187/\" id=\"a_221\">Section\n      82</a> of the FA, (i) an opinion has to be formed by the Joint Commissioner or\n      Additional Commissioner or other officers notified by the Board that ―any\n      documents or books or things‖ which are useful for or relevant for any\n      proceedings under this Chapter are secreted in any place, and (ii) the note\n      preceding the search of a premises has to specify the above requirement of\n      the law. The search in the present case was in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1195187/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 82</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">W.P.

It is unconstitutional and legally unsustainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_189\">      (ix) The Court is unable to accept that payment by the two Petitioners of\n      alleged service tax arrears was voluntary. Consequently, the amount that was\n      paid by the Petitioners as a result of the search of their premises by the\n      DGCEI, without an adjudication much less an SCN, is required to be\n      returned to them forthwith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_190\">      (x) The payment of Rs. 17 crores by eBIZ was not &#x27;voluntary&#x27; but under\n      coercion and duress and is required to be returned to eBIZ by the DGCEI\n      forthwith and in any event not later than four weeks from today. It is\n      clarified that this will not in any manner affect the bail already granted to\n      Mr. Malhan. Those proceedings will be taken to their logical end.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_191\">      (xi) The conduct of the officers of the DGCEI in refusing to receive the\n      documents tendered to them and terming the conduct of eBIZ to be non-\n      cooperative is not justified in the facts and circumstances. At the same time,\n      the Court would reiterate the direction that eBIZ and its officers including\n      Mr. Malhan will continue to co-operate with the DGCEI in carrying the\n      investigations to their logical end.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">      80. The interim directions issued on 28th January 2016 are made absolute. It\n      is directed that the DGCEI will refund to eBIZ forthwith the sum of Rs. 17\n      crores deposited by it towards alleged dues of service tax and in any event\n      not later than four weeks from today. Any delay in refund beyond the said\n      period will make the DGCEI liable to pay simple interest at 6 % per annum\n      on the said amount from the date on which it becomes due in terms of this\n      order till the date of payment. The refund in terms of this order will not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">W.P.

The Court clarifies that it has in this decision determined the legality of\n      the DGCEI in proceeding to search the premises of eBIZ and then deciding\n      to arrest Mr. Malhan. The observations made by the Court on the merits of\n      the contentions of either party is in the above context. This is not intended to\n      influence the adjudication proceedings that might ensue if an SCN is issued\n      in accordance with law by the DGCEI to eBIZ.
