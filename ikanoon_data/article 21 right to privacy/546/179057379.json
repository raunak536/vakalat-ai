The apparent\n\nconflict between the right to privacy of a person not to submit\n\nhimself forcibly to medical examination and duty of the Court to\n\nreach the truth must be coherently decided by the Court.

However, there was a room for\n\nvoluntary administration of the techniques when party gives\n\nconsent to undergo any of these tests, the test result by\n\nthemselves cannot be admitted as evidence because the\n\nsubject does not exercise conscious control over the responses\n\nduring the administration of the test.

DNA is a scientific test and its\n\naccuracy is 99.99 % and therefore, it can be used as evidence\n\nnot only in sexual assault and criminal cases, but also in civil\n\ncases involving question of paternity and succession.\n\n[15].   <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is based\n\non presumption of public morality and public policy. The law\n\npresumes against vices and immorality in a civilized society\n\nwhere it is imperative to presume legitimacy of a child born\n\nduring the continuation of a valid marriage between his mother\n\nand any man or within 280 days after its dissolution, if the\n\nmother remained unmarried. Such legitimacy has presumption\n\nof conclusiveness, unless it is shown that the parties to the\n\nmarriage had no access to each other at any time when the\n\nchild could have been begotten. This presumption cannot be\n\ndisplaced by mere probability or doubt. The presumption can\n\nonly be rebutted by a strong and conclusive evidence. Once the\n\nvalidity of marriage is proved, then there is a strong presumption\n\nabout the legitimacy of children born out of that wedlock. It is\n\nalso a settled proposition of law that the law does not presume\n\nanything   odious     or   dishonourable.        The     presumption   of\n\nconclusive proof can only be rebutted by strong and clear\n\nconclusive evidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"114308876\" id=\"span_24\">9 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">           ::: Downloaded on - 03-10-2019 08:56:26 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\"> CR No.4907 of 2016 (O&amp;M)                                       10</span>\n\n[16].

This Court has acknowledged the legal position with\n\nreference to aforesaid precedents, but in view of facts and\n\ncircumstances of those cases the permission was not granted.\n\nIn Hawa Singh and others&#x27; case (supra), the plaintiffs/\n\npetitioners filed a suit for declaration to the effect that plaintiff\n\nNo.1 was owner in possession of 1/8th share and plaintiffs No.2\n\nto 5 were owners in possession of 1/8 th share each on the suit\n\nland. Plaintiffs also sought other declaration qua different\n\nshares in the suit property. Plaintiffs claimed that the suit\n\nproperty was inherited by Ramji Lal and Risala from their father\n\nBaksha, who had inherited the same from his father Masaniya.\n\nRamji Lal was married to Sarti. Risala was married to Bhurli.\n\nDefendants in that case were born from the wedlock of Risala\n\nand Bhurli. Plaintiffs in that case asserted that Ramji Lal was in\n\nArmy and he did not visit the village from the years 1940 to\n\n1946. His whereabouts were not known. Thereafter wife of\n\nRamji Lal started living with Risala as his wife. Plaintiffs of that\n\ncase took birth from that wedlock of Risala and Sarti. Ramji Lal\n\nwas in Army and he had returned to village in the year 1946 and\n\n\n\n\n                              10 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">            ::: Downloaded on - 03-10-2019 08:56:26 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\"> CR No.4907 of 2016 (O&amp;M)                                      11</span>\n\nthereafter again started living with Ramji Lal.

The dispute was with regard to the\n\nproperty of Risala. The issue involved in the said case was that\n\nSarti again united with Ramji Lal in the matrimonial house.\n\nRamji Lal never declared to be civilly dead and, therefore, there\n\nwas no occasion for Sarti to be treated as Karewa wife of\n\nRisala. Inter se comparison of blood samples of both the parties\n\nwould not have given any conclusive fact to establish that the\n\nplaintiffs were in fact the sons of Risala out of marriage of Risala\n\nwith Sarti. Ramji Lal died on 24.08.1972 and paternity was not\n\nascertained for more than 65 years in that case. No objection\n\nwas raised by Risala and Ramji Lal during their life time.\n\nMarriage between Sarti and Ramji Lal was never dissolved, nor\n\nRamji Lal was ever declared to be civilly dead. He returned to\n\nthe village in the year 1946 and cohabited with Sarti resulting in\n\nbirth of third son Manphool and daughter Maichandi.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">        Thus in the facts and circumstances of the aforesaid\n\n\n\n                             11 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">           ::: Downloaded on - 03-10-2019 08:56:26 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> CR No.4907 of 2016 (O&amp;M)                                     12</span>\n\ncase, this Court held that there was a valid presumption of\n\nlawful marriage between Ramji Lal and Sarti from whose\n\nwedlock the plaintiff took birth. Secondly the biological kins of\n\nRisala could have been established with the blood sampling of\n\nboth the sides. Blood sampling of plaintiffs in order to establish\n\nplaintiffs being sons of Risala was a far fetched proposition in\n\nview of the fact that Ramji Lal was alive upto the year 1972. It\n\nwas only on the basis of facts involved in the aforesaid case,\n\nthis Court distinguished the case from applicability of modern\n\nmechanism and held that the DNA profile cannot be granted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">        In Ragbir vs. Bharto Devi and others&#x27; case (supra),\n\nthis Court was dealing with issue where the question was yet to\n\nbe established in respect of existence of lawful marriage\n\nbetween Bharto Devi and Jagdish. The plaintiff in the aforesaid\n\ncase i.e. Bharto Devi had denied relationship with Jagdish.\n\nKarewa of plaintiff-Bharto Devi with Jagdish was not proved on\n\nrecord. Secondly, Chander Bhan was not impleaded as party to\n\nthe suit against whom DNA profile was sought to be conducted\n\nand the application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_24\">Order 1 Rule 10 CPC</a> was pending. In\n\nview of clear facts of the aforesaid case, this Court held that the\n\napplication was premature and no conclusive adjudication could\n\nhave been done in the light of precedents as have been cited in\n\nthe present case. The aforesaid case was dismissed at that\n\n\n\n\n                             12 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">           ::: Downloaded on - 03-10-2019 08:56:26 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> CR No.4907 of 2016 (O&amp;M)                                     13</span>\n\nstage only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1887316\" id=\"span_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1378226\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167495843\" id=\"span_36\">[17].   In the instant case, there is no such proposition\n\ninvolved. The plaintiff herself has come forward to establish her\n\nidentity on the basis of DNA profile with her mother in order to\n\nestablish that she is daughter of Jeet Singh. The claim is for a\n\nshare in the property of Jeet Singh. The legal proposition\n\ninvolved on the issue is settled by now. The presumption under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act is the subject matter of public\n\nmorality and public policy and the same was aimed not to brand\n\nan innocent child as bastard which may have devastating effect\n\non the mind of the child. The effect of such a test even in the\n\nlight of stand taken by the defendants would not be having any\n\nissue, nor possibility of branding plaintiff to be a bastard as the\n\ndefendants have already taken a stand that she is not daughter\n\nof Jeet Singh. In such a scenario the application for test of DNA\n\nprofile can be allowed.

In view of nature of litigation between the\n\nparties, determination of paternity of the plaintiff would be an\n\nimminent need for making appropriate orders for test of DNA\n\nprofile. The plaintiff has right to know about her paternity. Since\n\nthe issue has acquired new dimension, therefore, the concept of\n\npaternity and claim thereunder cannot be ousted by the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n[19].   For the reasons recorded hereinabove, I deem it\n\nappropriate to accept this revision petition. Consequently, the\n\nimpugned order dated 24.05.2016 passed by the Civil Judge (Jr.\n\nDivn.) Malerkotla is set aside. If the defendant No.1/respondent\n\nNo.1 refuses to get her blood sampling done, in such situation\n\nthe Court would be at liberty to draw adverse inference against\n\nthe defendants.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">September 17, 2019                      (RAJ MOHAN SINGH)\nAtik                                           JUDGE\nWhether speaking/reasoned               Yes/No\nWhether reportable                      Yes/No\n\n\n\n\n                             14 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">           ::: Downloaded on - 03-10-2019 08:56:26 :::</span>\n </pre>","numcites":18,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":179057379,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"sec 112-evidence act","formInput":"sec%20112-evidence%20act"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"dna","formInput":"dna"},{"value":"civil revision","formInput":"civil%20revision"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"conclusive proof","formInput":"conclusive%20proof"},{"value":"dna profile test, ","formInput":"dna%20profile%20test%2C%20"},{"value":"112 evidence act","formInput":"112%20evidence%20act"},{"value":"public morality","formInput":"public%20morality"},{"value":"legitimacy ","formInput":"legitimacy%20"},{"value":"dna profiling","formInput":"dna%20profiling"},{"value":"goutam kundu","formInput":"goutam%20kundu"},{"value":" blood samples","formInput":"%20blood%20samples"},{"value":"Evidence 112","formInput":"Evidence%20112"},{"value":"paternity","formInput":"paternity"},{"value":"section evidance act","formInput":"section%20evidance%20act"},{"value":"medical examination","formInput":"medical%20examination"},{"value":"divorce   filter:   declaration suit","formInput":"divorce%20%20%20filter%3A%20%20%20declaration%20suit"},{"value":"Jai Singh ","formInput":"Jai%20Singh%20"},{"value":"wedlock","formInput":"wedlock"}],"cats":[{"value":"birth-during-marriage-is-conclusive-proof-of-legitimacy","formInput":"tag:birth-during-marriage-is-conclusive-proof-of-legitimacy"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"opinions-of-experts","formInput":"tag:opinions-of-experts"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
