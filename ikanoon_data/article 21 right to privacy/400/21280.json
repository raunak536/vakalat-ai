The State of Rajasthan has filed these two applications under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. for cancellation of order granting bail to the accused non-applicants by Mr. R.S. Rathore, RHJS, Special Judge, Sessions Court (prevention of <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_2\">Corruption Act</a>) Jaipur, (for short &quot;Special Judge&quot;), in FIR No. 109/2004 of Anti Corruption Bureau, Jaipur. The Special Judge has granted bail to accused-non-applicant R.S. Srivastava (hereinafter referred as &quot;an accused&quot;) vide order dated 10th August 2004 on an application under <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 167(2)</a> Cr.P.C. whereas the another accused-non-applicant Ajay Data (hereinafter referred as &quot;Co-accused&quot;) has been allowed bail under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. vide order dated 11.8.2004. Both the applications under <a href=\"/doc/116391/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 439(2)</a> Cr.P.C. arise from FIR No. 109/2004 of Anti Corruption Bureau, Jaipur and both the orders have been passed in the same FIR by the same Judge, therefore, both these applications are disposed of a common order.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2. The facts in brief are that on 9th June 2004, two first information reports bearing No. 109/04 (for short &quot;First FIR&quot;) and 110/04 (for short &quot;second FIR&quot;) were registered against accused R.S. Srivastava and others by Anti Corruption Bureau, Jaipur for offences under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_7\">8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_8\">13(l)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_9\">13(l)(d)(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 120B</a> IPC.\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1616202\" id=\"span_1\">(i) In the first FIR, it was alleged that on 23.5.2004, an information was received that accused R.S. Srivastava, IAS, who was holding the post of Member, Revenue Board, Rajasthan, Ajmer, had decided a revenue case pending before him, namely, <a href=\"/doc/1616202/\" id=\"a_11\">Smt. Kamla Devi v. State</a> on 21.5.2004 against the plaintiff. Later on 9 persons came from Dholpur and met the Member, Board of Revenue, Mr. R.S. Srivastava, who agreed to decide the case in favour of plaintiff on bribe of Rs. 30 lacs. Mr. Suresh Bansal, Ramniwas Lawania, Mabesh and others remained in contact with accused to finalize the deal and other terms as to when and where and to whom the amount of illegal gratification is to be paid. Thereafter, accused suggested to file a review petition and assured that in case payment of Rs. 5 lacs is made by 3rd or 4th June, then he will decide the case within 3-4 days. He also assured that he will grant interim stay order in review petition. It was also agreed that Shri Suresh Bansal, Advocate, resident of Dholpur and Ram Niwas Lawania will make the payment of first installment of Rs. 5 lacs. During verification of the facts and investigation thereof, it transpired to the Anti Corruption Bureau that nine persons stayed in one hotel at Jaipur. Thereafter payment of Rs. 5 lacs was paid to co-accused Ajay Data at the instance of accused and ultimately the review petition was allowed by accused R.S. Srivastava, Member, Board of Revenue, Rajasthan, Ajmer, on 7.6.2004 itself without pronouncing judgment in open court.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(ii) The second FIR was registered in respect of some other revenue cases bearing nos. 2001/04, 2002/04 and 2003/04 relating to N.B.C. Unit of Birla Group situated at Jaipur in respect of a land measuring 54 acres. It was alleged that after settling huge amount as bribe or some share in the land, the accused decided the said revenue cases in favour of the concerned party.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1616202\" id=\"span_2\">(iii) The accused R.S. Srivastava was arrested on 10th June 2004 in second FIR No. 110/04. He was not arrested in the first FIR No. 109/04. The first FIR was relating to land situated at Dholpur and was subject matter of revenue case titled as <a href=\"/doc/1616202/\" id=\"a_12\">Smt. Kamla Devi v. State</a>. The second FIR was n respect of another land which was subject matter of other cases and the land in dispute was situated at different places. The co-accused persons n both the FIRs are also different except Mr. Pande, P.A. of main accused.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3. Facts relating to accused R.S. Srivastava\n  \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">(i) The accused, while in custody in second FIR, moved an application for anticipatory bail under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. before the Special Judge in first FIR on 22nd June, 2004, a copy of which has been placed on record as Annex. 1, wherein the main accused, in para 2, specifically mentioned that he has been arrested in second FIR, but has not been arrested is the first FIR. The Investigating Officer filed written reply for rejection of above application wherein it was mentioned that another co- accused Ajay Data is being searched and will be arrested very soon, thereafter, sufficient evidence will be available in the police diary and prosecution will make an application for taking police custody of accused in first FIR No. 109/04. The aforesaid application was rejected by the Special Judge, vide its order dated 25.6.2004, which is reproduced as under:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;APP present. Counsel for the accused present. ACB submitted an application, stating that some interrogation was done in the case while the accused was in police custody in the other case 110/04, as per the note incorporated in the case diary of 109/04.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">While some important evidence has been collected, yet much investigation needs to be done to bring about cogent evidence to make the arrest of the accused in this case and move a remand application for transferring the custody of the accused from J.C. to P.C.\n \n\nIn view of the above averments, I am not inclined to accept the application of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. Hence it is rejected.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">Sd/- R.S. Rathore \n \nSpecial Judge (PCA), Jaipur\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(ii) Therefore, the accused moved another application on 5.7.04 under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. to the effect that on 10.6.2004, he was arrested n second FIR and during custody in second FIR, he was interrogated in first FIR also but no formal arrest contended that the said interrogation was custodial interrogation and his custody in second FIR No. 110/04 was also deeded custody in first FIR No. 109/04 was also deemed custody in first FIR No. 109/04. He further submitted that a remand for police custody was given only in second FIR for five days on 11.6.2004 and again further remand was given in second FIR, therefore, his continued detention beyond 24 hours, without proper remand, in first FIR (in which he was not arrested) be treated as illegal and he should be set free on suitable bail bonds. The prosecution opposed the said application of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. The Special Judge, after hearing the arguments, vide order dated 7.7.2004, rejected the application of accused moved under Section 167 Cr.P.c. in first FIR. The operative portion of the order is reproduced as under:\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;After hearing the above arguments and the inference drawn from them, as enumerated above, I am in agreement with the correct position of law <a href=\"/doc/1616202/\" id=\"a_17\">laid down by</a> the learned Counsel for the accused. However, the court cannot become immune to the gravity of the offence and the fact that the lapses/inadvertence of the Investigation Agency should not, in any manner, thwart the fair and proper investigation of the case of corruption of such magnitude. This again would be sabotaging the investigation in its infantile stage and would certainly not serve the larger public interest which, in my humble view, the court should perceive and the sensitive about it. Therefore the application of the accused is not accepted.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">It is relevant to mention that the above order was not challenged by accused.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">(iii) Subsequently, the accused moved another application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. on 10th August, 04, at 4 p.m. in the first FIR to the effect that he was arrested on 10th June 2004 in second FIR and his custody was a deemed custody in the first FIR also and a period of sixty days has passed from 10th June 2004 and no charge-sheet has been field in first FIR, therefore, he should be granted bail in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. The Special Public Prosecutor filed reply to the above application and made a request in writing that the accused has not been taken into custody in first FIR. The accused remained most of the time sick and hospitalized during the custody and investigation is second FIR, therefore, he could not be arrested in first FIR. It was also mentioned that application has been filed at 4.30 p.m. and it was not possible to call investigation officer as well as the case-diary, therefore, in the interest of justice, a reasonable time should be granted to call the I.O., case diary and for arguments. A copy of this reply was delivered to the learned Counsel for the accused after taking his receipt on 10.08.2004 at 5.15 p.m., certified copy of which has been placed on record as Annex.8. The Special Judge did not grant time to prosecution to call I.O., police diary or for arguments and allowed application under <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 167(2)</a> Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of accused in first FIR No. 109/04 on the same day and released the main accused on bail in first FIR deeming his custody in this FIR also.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">(iv) The aforesaid order dated 10th August 2004 has been impugned by the state of Rajasthan in S.B. Criminal Misc. cancellation of Bail Application No. 3980/2004.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">4. Facts relating to co-accused Ajay Data\n  \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">(i) So far as co-accused Mr. Ajay Data is concerned, he was an accused in first FIR. His house No. D-47, Hanuman Nagar, Jaipur was searched by a team of Anti Corruption Bureau. However, he remained absconded and was not available. On 20th July, 2004, he moved an application for anticipatory bail under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. in the court of Special Judge, who vide his order dated 30.7.2004, rejected the application but in the same order, he granted interim bail to co-accused with certain conditions.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">(ii) On 3rd August, 2004, the Investigation Officer, moved an application before the Special Judge stating that co-accused had not appeared before him as directed regularly and further that as and when he appeared he avoided interrogation alleging physical and mental agony. He did not cooperate with the investigation. Therefore, it was prayed that interim bail granted to co-accused Ajay Data be cancelled. The Special Judge dismissed the application on 3rd August 2004 itself.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">(iii) Subsequently, on 11.8.2004, the Co-accused Ajay Data surrendered himself before the Special Judge along with application under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. The Special Judge allowed the same on the same day and released him on hail, The State, has challenged all the three orders dated 30.7.2004, 3.8.2004 and 11.8.2004 in S.B. Criminal Misc. Cancellation of Bail Application No. 3844/2004.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">5. The learned Additional Advocate General and the learned Counsel for the both the accused persons have argued the case at length. They have also cited number of judgments in supports of their contentions.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">In the present case, an important question of law has arisen as to whether the arrest of main accused Mr. Srivastava in second FIR, can be treated as deemed custody in first FIR also and on failure of filing charge-sheet in first FIR within stipulated period from the date of so called deemed custody, is the accused entitled to be released on bail under proviso (a) of Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C.?\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"345867\" id=\"span_3\">6. The Additional Advocate General has contended that in the case of accused Ravi Shanker Srivastava, the Special Judge has wrongly relied upon the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_24\">Jawahar Singh v. State</a> (1990 Cr.L.R. (Raj.) 95), to the effect that if an accused is available in one case then his custody will be deemed to have been treated in second case also from the date of custody in one case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244622\" id=\"span_4\">He submits that aforesaid view of the Division Bench is contrary to the law <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_25\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_26\">CBI v. Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> , wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has specifically laid down that if an accused is in judicial custody in connection with one case and to enable the police to complete their investigation of the other case, they can require his detention in police custody for the purpose of associating him with the investigation of the other case. In such a situation, he must be formally arrested in connection with other case and then obtain the order of the magistrate for detention in police custody.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1537336\" id=\"span_5\">He further contended that the Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1537336/\" id=\"a_27\">State v. Sukh Singh</a> , has already laid down the principle that an accused could be taken into police custody in another case while in judgment custody in first case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1537336\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"345867\" id=\"span_7\">He submits that a Divisional Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_28\">Jawahar Singh</a>&#x27;s case (supra) did not consider the principles <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_29\">laid down by</a> earlier Division Bench judgment of this Court itself in <a href=\"/doc/1537336/\" id=\"a_30\">State v. Sukh Singh</a> (supra).</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"345867\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244622\" id=\"span_9\">However, he submits that in view of the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_31\">C.B.I, v. Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> (supra), the ratio <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_32\">laid down by</a> the Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_33\">Jawahar Singh</a>&#x27;s case is not binding and the same is impliedly over-ruled.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1297901\" id=\"span_10\">He has also referred the recent Full Bench decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1297901/\" id=\"a_34\">State of Rajasthan v. Santosh Yadav</a> (2005(2) WLC (Raj.) 1 =RLW 2005(1) Raj. 538), wherein it has been held that police can seek permission to remove an accused from judicial custody to police custody for completion of investigation in another case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1897500\" id=\"span_11\">Therefore, he submits that without formal arrest of an accused, there cannot be deemed custody of an accused in another case, he further contended that the Special Judge himself rejected the bail application of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. vide order dated 25.6.2004, therefore, the accused had knowledge that he had not been arrested in first FIR; that the special Judge rejected the first application of the accused filed under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. after considering the judgment of Division Bench in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1897500/\" id=\"a_37\">Jawahar Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a> (supra), vide detailed order dated 7.7.2004 which was not challenged by accused. Thereafter there was no occasion or change of circumstances to allow second application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. filed by the accused, by the Special Judge on 10.8.2004. He contended that passing of impugned order dated 10.8.2004 amounts to review, by Special Judge, to his own orders dated 25.6.2004 rejecting the application for anticipatory bail and second order dated 7.7.2004 rejecting application of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. He submits that <a href=\"/doc/789330/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 362</a> Cr.P.C. completely bars review of an order by any criminal Court. He has placed reliance on the following judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in this regard:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(a) Hari Singh Mann v. Har Bhajan Subgg Bajwa (2001 (1) SCC 169),\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(b) Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal and Ors. ; and\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1192626\" id=\"span_12\">(<a href=\"/doc/1192626/\" id=\"a_41\">c) State of Kerala v. M.M. Manikantan Nair</a> .</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"244622\" id=\"span_13\">He further submits that in the present case, the Special Judge has exercised his discretion on the basis of irrelevant and extraneous ground and has wrongly granted bail under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. by holding deemed custody of the accused in first FIR. This order has occasioned miscarriage of justice and has been passed ignoring relevant provisions of law as well as material evidence on record. He submits that impugned order is absolutely incorrect and contrary to the provisions of law as well as to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_43\">CBI v. Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> (supra) and in such circumstances, the incorrect passed by the special Judge should be corrected by this Court while exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/116391/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 439(2)</a> Cr.P.C. He further contends that the impugned order is based on extraneous consideration for the reason that on 10th August 2004, second application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. was moved at 4.30 p.m. just half an hour before the Court&#x27;s time and at 5.15 p.m., the Public Prosecutor made a request in writing that it is not possible to call the case diary and the I.O. and he should be given time for calling the case diary as well as the I.O. and also for arguments as point involved in the present case is legal. However, no time was granted and on the same day, i.e. 10th August, 2004 itself, after court hours, the Special Judge passed a detailed order and allowed bail to accused Ravi Shanker Srivastava under <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 167(2)</a> Cr.P.C. It has further been contended that even in custody of accused in second case, in most of the period, he either remained sick or hospitalized, therefore, investigation could not be completed and as such he could not be arrested in another case. In support of his contention, learned AAG has placed reliance on the following judgments:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(a) Pooran v. Ram Bilas and Anr. ,\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"200840\" id=\"span_14\">(<a href=\"/doc/200840/\" id=\"a_47\">b) Pokar Ram v.

With regard to co-accused Ajay Data, learned AAG contended that while rejecting the anticipatory bail application filed by co-accused, vide order dated 30.7.2004, the special Judge committed an error in granting interim bail to the accused by the same order dated 30.7.2004, therefore, impugned order dated 30.7.2004 is contradictory and illegal. He further contends that when the co-accused did not comply with the terms and conditions of interim bail dated 30.7.2004, then an application was moved on 3.8.2004 by the I.O. regarding non-cooperative attitude on the part of the co-accused. The Special Judge, instead of vacating the order granting interim bail, passed more favourable order by putting more favourable conditions in favour of the co-accused as mentioned in the order dated 3.8.2004. He next contended that the Special Judge has committed an illegality in allowing the application under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. as co-accused was neither taken into police custody nor in judicial custody he further submits that even if he was presumed to have been taken into judicial custody, then without any recovery and interrogation from him, it was not proper to allow the co-accused on bail under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. An order for remand of police custody ought to have been passed. In support of his contention, learned AAG has placed reliance on the following judgments:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"544985\" id=\"span_15\">(<a href=\"/doc/544985/\" id=\"a_50\">a) Nirmal Jeet Kaur v.

The learned Counsel for the accused-non-applicants have vehemently opposed the applications under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"345867\" id=\"span_17\">9. Mr. S.S. Hora, learned Counsel for the main accused R.S. Srivastava contended that the order granting bail is based on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_52\">Jawahar Singh</a> (supra). Therefore, there is no illegality in the order passed by the Special Judge granting bail to the accused R.S. Srivastava under Section 167 (1) and (2) <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_53\">Cr.P.C</a>. deeming custody of the accused in first FIR also w.e.f. 10.6.2004. A person is arrested as per <a href=\"/doc/706971/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 46</a> Cr.P.C. He submits that no formal order is required for arrest of accused and in case no arrest memo is prepared then as till implied arrest of the accused was in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/706971/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 46</a> Cr.P.C. He has also referred <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_56\">Sections 41</a>, <a href=\"/doc/571025/\" id=\"a_57\">57</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_58\">167</a> Cr.P.C.

This application under <a href=\"/doc/116391/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 439(2)</a> Cr.P.C. should not be heard as an appeal or revision. He further contended that co-accused similarly situated, namely, Lalit Goyal, Girish Goyal, Suresh Bansal and Ram Niwas Lawania have already been granted bail. So far as Suresh Bansal and Ram Niwas Lawania are concerned, they preferred writ petition before this Court to quash the FIR. But while, rejecting their writ petition, this Court converted the warrant of arrest into bailable warrant. Therefore, he submits that the bail of co-accused granted under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. should not be cancelled. He also contended that from the bare reading of FIR, it is clear that Ajay Data has been made as an accused with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 120B</a> IPC whereas from the contents FIR, no prima facie case is made out against him for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 120B</a> IPC whereas from the contents of FIR, no prima facie case is made out against him for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 120B</a> IPC. The ACB has brought in there telephone transcripts pertaining to the alleged conversation between Ajay, Data and suspected officer. However, he submits that tapping of telephone is illegal in view of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_26\">In support of his contention, he has referred the judgment reported in People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_77\">Civil Liberties (PUCL) v.

Therefore, there is no need of any interrogation from Ajay Data. Hence, bail order should not be cancelled.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"988890\" id=\"span_27\">He has referred the case of <a href=\"/doc/988890/\" id=\"a_79\">The State of Rajasthan v.

The Special Judge, while passing impugned order dated 10.8.2004, granting bail to accused R.S. Srivastava treating him as in deemed custody in FIR No. 109/2004, has also placed reliance on the judgment of Division Bench in the case of <a href=\"/doc/345867/\" id=\"a_88\">Jawahar Singh</a> (supra). Paras 8 and 9 of the said judgments are reproduced as under:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">&quot;8. From the language of Section 167 of the Code and from the policy behind the said section it can be safely said that the starting point of limitation would be the date on which the accused person it available to the police for interrogation, while in detention under the order of the Court. It is not disputed that the accused-petitioner was in the judicial custody and joined the investigation in jail on 16th December, 1988 when the Identification Parade was arranged. The joining of the accused in the Identification Parade by the I.O. impliedly amounted to his arrest in the present case. It is not disputed that even when the arrest memo was prepared the accused was in jail and only formal arrest was shown by preparing the memo dated 8th June, 1989.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">9. We, therefore, answer the above question by saying that if an accused person is already in custody in another case and is available to the Police in a subsequent case for investigation, the period of limitation would start running from the date when he was so available to the Police. The reference stands answered accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">13. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1537336\" id=\"span_35\">In <a href=\"/doc/1537336/\" id=\"a_89\">State of Sukh Singh</a> (supra), the Division Bench of this Court has held as under:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">&quot;(4) We have read - &#x27;Dhaman Hiranand&#x27;s case (a)&#x27; with all the care that it demands and have not been able to understand why it was necessary to discuss the provisions of Sections. 167(2) and 344 of the Criminal P.C. there. The only question that really arose for decision was whether taking the facts which were proved in that case a certain confession could be relied upon as voluntary and true, even through it had been retracted. There is certainly an observation in this case that an accused cannot be in magisterial custody in one case and police custody in another case. But we have not been able to understand why this is inherently impossible.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">Supposing a person is accused of one offence, and investigation of that case is complete and the challan has been submitted to court, he will, in these circumstances, be sent to Jail or to judicial custody to await his trial. Supposing later evidence is discovered of his complicity in another case, and the police, in order to complete the investigation of that case, requires to question the accused, or the handing over of the accused to police custody, would aid the investigation in some way; in such a case we fail to understand why it may not be open to a Magistrate under Section 167 to take the accused out of jail or judicial custody and hand him over to the police for the maximum period of 15 days provided in that section. Of course, before the Magistrate does so, he will have to satisfy himself that a good case made out for detaining the accused in police custody in connection with the investigation of the other case.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">(5) We, therefore, accept the reference, set aside the order of the District Magistrate refusing to hand over Shera accused to the police of Thana Tharad for 15 days for investigation and the District Magistrate is directed, if the police of Thana Tharad still require the accused, to hand him over to them after satisfying himself that it is really necessary to do so for purposes of investigation of the case relating to Thana Tharad. So far as Sukh Singh is concerned, he is not longer in judicial custody, and we pass no order with respect to him.&quot;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">14. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1897500\" id=\"span_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1537336\" id=\"span_37\">In the above two judgments of this Court, the Division Bench has laid down the principles in respect of <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. I could have referred the matter to Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice to refer the matter to the Larger Bench as the case of <a href=\"/doc/1537336/\" id=\"a_91\">State v. Sukh Singh</a> (supra) was not considered in subsequent judgment of Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1897500/\" id=\"a_92\">Jawahar Singh v. State of Raj.</a> (supra).</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244622\" id=\"span_38\">However, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, in <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_93\">CBI v. Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> (supra), has already resolved the controversy and while considering the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 167(2)</a> Cr.P.C., has held as under:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">&quot;A question may then arise whether a person arrested in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by him during an occurrence can be detained again in police custody in respect of another offence committed by him in the same case and which fact comes to light after the expiry of the period of first fifteen days of his arrest. The learned Additional solicitor General submitted that as a result of the investigation carried on and the evidence collected by the police the arrested accused may be found to be involved in more serious offences than the one for which he was originally arrested and that in such a case there is no reason as to why the accused who is in magisterial custody should not be turned over to the police custody at a subsequent stage of investigation when the information discloses his complicity in more serious offences. We are unable to agree. In one occurrence it may so happen that the accused might have committed several offences and the police may arrest him in connection with one or two offences on the basis of the available information and obtain police custody. If during the investigation his complicity in more serious offences during the same occurrence is disclosed that does not authorize the police to ask for police custody for a further period after the expiry of first fifteen days. If that is permitted then the police can go on adding some offence of the other of a serious nature at various stages and seek further detention in police custody repeatedly. This would defeat the very object underlying Section 167. However, we must clarify that this limitation shall not apply to a different occurrence in which complicity of the arrested accused is disclosed. That would be a different transaction and if an accused is in judicial custody in connection with one case and to enable the police to complete their investigation of the other case, they can require his detention in police custody for the purpose of associating him with the investigation of the other case. In such a situation, he must be formally arrested in connection with other case and then obtain the order of the Magistrate for detention in police custody.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"387372\" id=\"span_39\">In <a href=\"/doc/387372/\" id=\"a_95\">S.

In a case like this effective interrogation of a suspected person is of tremendous advantage in disinterring many useful information and also materials which would have been concealed. Success in such interrogation would elude if the suspected person knows that he is well protected and insulated by a pre-arrest bail order during the time he is interrogated. Very often interrogation such a condition would reduce to a mere ritual. The argument that the custodial interrogation is fraught with the danger of the person being subjected to third-degree methods need not be countenanced for, such an arguments can be advanced by all accused in all criminal cases. The Court has to presume that responsible police officers would conduct themselves in a responsible manner and that those entrusted with the task of disinterring offences would not conduct themselves as offenders:&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">32. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"862701\" id=\"span_61\">In <a href=\"/doc/862701/\" id=\"a_133\">Aslam Babalal Desai</a> (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court held as under:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">&quot;The purpose of the proviso to Section 167(2) read with Chapter XXXIII of the Code is to impress upon the need for expeditious completion of the investigation by the police officer within the prescribed limitation and to prevent laxity in that behalf.

At the same time, during investigation or trial, the power of the Court to have the bail cancelled and have the accused taken into custody are preserved. But as interpreted by this Court on the happening of the catalyst act, i.e. expiry of 90/60 days the hammer of release on default would fall.

The aforesaid discussion of facts and law show that how a person is to be arrested is mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/706971/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 46</a> Cr.P.C. Here is the case where admittedly two FIRs Nos. 109/04 and 110/04 were registered by Anti Corruption Bureau against the accused non- applicant R.S. Srivastava. Both the first information reports relate to different offence. FIR No. 109/04 was relating to case titled as <a href=\"/doc/1397392/\" id=\"a_141\">Smt. Kamla v. State</a> in respect of land situated at Dholpur wherein case had already been decided against the plaintiff on 21.5.2004 and as per allegation of the prosecution, there was deal in between co-accused and the accused R.S. Srivastava about deciding the case in favour of the plaintiff and the accused suggested for filing the review petition, which was ultimately filed and the same was allowed within 17 days itself, i.e. on 7th June 2004 and the present FIR was registered on 9th June 2004 against the accused non-applicant alleging that the accused non-applicant R.S. Srivastava had a deal of Rs. 30 lacs as per prosecution case and Rs. 5 lacs were given to co-accused Ajay Data as directed by accused non-applicant R.S. Srivastava.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">38. So far as the FIR No. 110/04 is concerned, the same was relating to different cases which were decided by the accused non-applicant R.S. Srivastava relating to land situated at different places measuring about 54 acres. Therefore, it is clear that allegation in both the FIRs were altogether different and cannot be said to be connected with each other.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">39. The above discussions also reveal that Mr. R.S. Srivastava was arrested on 9th June 2004 in FIR No. 110/04 and he was not arrested in FIR No. 109/04. It is also clear that this fact was in knowledge of the accused as well as in the knowledge of the Special Judge. The accused R.S. Srivastava moved an application for anticipatory bail in FIR No. 109/04 on 22.6.2004 wherein the admitted that he has not been arrested in FIR No. 109/04. The said application was rejected by the same Special Judge on 25.6.2004. Further an application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. was moved on 5.7.2004 by Mr. Srivastava which was opposed by the prosecution and it was specifically mentioned in the reply that Mr. Srivastava has not been arrested in FIR No. 109/04. The same special Judge, by detailed order, rejected the application of Mr. Srivastava under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. holding that the court cannot become immune to the gravity of the offence and the fact that the lapse/inadvertence of the Investigating Agency should not in any manner thwart the fair and proper investigation of the case of corruption of such magnitude. The Special Judge further observed that this again would be sabotaging the investigation in its infantile stage and would certainly not serve the larger public interest, which in his humble view, the court should perceive and the sensitive about it.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1192626\" id=\"span_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"549946\" id=\"span_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1233560\" id=\"span_69\">40. After rejection of first application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. vide order dated 7.7.2004, on the basis of deemed custody in FIR No. 109/04, if accused Srivastava was aggrieved, then he could have challenged the said order before the higher court. There was no occasion to file second application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. on 10.8.2004. The Special Judge could not have reviewed his own orders which he passed while rejecting the application for temporary bail under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. and first application of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. vide order dated 25.6.2004 and 7.7.2004 respectively. There is no provision in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_148\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> for review, rather there is a specific Section 362, which completely bars review of an order by any criminal court which it had passed earlier and signed except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error as held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the cases reported in <a href=\"/doc/1233560/\" id=\"a_149\">Hari Singh v. Har Bhajan Singh</a> (<a href=\"/doc/549946/\" id=\"a_150\">supra), Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindaland Ors.</a> (<a href=\"/doc/1192626/\" id=\"a_151\">supra), and State of Kerala v. M.M. Manikantan Nair</a> (supra).

Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> as <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_156\">referred above</a>. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has categorically held that we must clarify that this limitation shall not apply to a different occurrence in which complicity of the arrested accused is disclosed. That would be a different transaction and if an accused is in judicial custody in connection with one case and to enable the police to complete their investigation of the other case, they can require his detention in police custody for the purpose of associating him with the investigation. In such a situation, he must be formally arrested in connection with other case and then obtain the order of Magistrate for detention in police custody. The action of Mr. R.S. Rathore, Special Judge (PCA), Jaipur, was not proper and reasonable in allowing the application under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. on 10.8.2004 itself which was filed at 4.30 p.m. on 10.8.2004. An opportunity ought to have been given to Public Prosecutor to call for case diary and I.O. and to argue the case as a legal question was involved in the case.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1297901\" id=\"span_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1537336\" id=\"span_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244622\" id=\"span_75\">41. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that the Special Judge (PCA), Jaipur committed a serious error and an illegality in presuming the deemed custody of the accused R.S. Srivastava (without any formal arrest in first FIR No. 109/04 w.e.f. 10.6.2004, a date on which he was arrested in second FIR No. 110/04. The impugned order dated 10.8.2004 passed by the Special Judge, Allowing the application of the accused R.S. Srivastava Under <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 167(2)</a> Cr.P.C. and releasing on bail is, therefore, contrary to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_159\">CBI v. Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> (supra) and Division Bench judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1537336/\" id=\"a_160\">State v. Sukh Singh</a> and the judgment of the Full Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1297901/\" id=\"a_161\">State of Raj. v. Santosh Kumar Yadav</a>. Therefore, this is a case wherein the impugned order is per se illegal and is liable to be cancelled under <a href=\"/doc/116391/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 439(2)</a> Cr.P.C. by this Court.</span></span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">42. Accordingly, I allow application for cancellation of bail No. 3980/2004 filed by a the State of Rajasthan against accused R.S. Srivastava and set aside the bail order passed in his favour by the Special Judge dated 10.8.2004 in bail application No. 51/2004 in FIR No. 109/04 of Anti Corruption Bureau, Jaipur. The personal bonds and surety bonds filed by him in pursuance to bail order No. 10.8.2004 stands automatically cancelled. The prosecution is free to proceed further in FIR No. 109/04 in accordance with law.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">43. So far as another application for cancellation of bail No. 3844/2004 relating to co-accused Ajay Data is concerned, it is borne out that although vide order dated 30.7.2004, the Special Judge rejected his bail application under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. but by the same order, he directed the co-accused to appear before the I.O. as per terms and conditions imposed in the order dated 30.7.2004 itself. Although the prosecution moved an application dated 3.8.2004 alleging that he is not cooperating with the investigating agency but the said allegation is denied by him before the Special Judge. The Special Judge dismissed the application of the prosecution. Subsequently, co-accused Ajay Data surrendered himself before the Special Judge and moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. on the same day. The Special Judge, after hearing both the parties, vide its order dated 11.8.2004, allowed the application of co-accused Ajay Data and released him on bail as per terms and conditions imposed in the order dated 11.8.2004. The Special Judge has passed a detailed, speaking and reasoned order. The co-accused was taken in judicial custody by Special Judge and he considered that the Co-accused had already appeared for interrogation as per order dated 30.7.2004 and 3.8.2004 and his presence is now not required. Therefore, he allowed the application and released him on bail under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 437</a> Cr.P.C. The facts mentioned in the FIR disclose that allegation against the main accused R.S. Srivastava is serious in nature whereas the allegation against the co- accused relates to <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 120B</a> IPC only. The prosecution has not controverted the submission of Mr. A.K. Gupta, learned Counsel for co-accused Ajay Data, that other similarly situated co-accused persons filed writ petition before this Court to quash the FIR and this Court although rejected their writ petition but converted the warrant of arrest of the similarly situated co- accused persons into bailable warrant. I have cancelled the bail order of main accused R.S. Srivastava on legal ground that his custody in FIR No. 110/04 could not have been treated as deemed custody in the present FIR No. 109/04 in view of the Division Bench judgment of this Court in State of Raj. v. Sukh Singh (supra), the judgment of Full Bench of this Court in State of Rajasthan. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244622\" id=\"span_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1297901\" id=\"span_77\">v. <a href=\"/doc/1297901/\" id=\"a_167\">Santosh Yadav</a> (supra) and the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_168\">CBI v. Anupam J. Kulkarni</a> (supra), as <a href=\"/doc/244622/\" id=\"a_169\">referred above</a>. Therefore, the case of co-accused Ajay Data is altogether different and in these circumstances, 1 am not inclined to interfere in the order granting bail to co-accused Ajay Data by the Special Judge. Therefore, application for cancellation of bail No. 3844/2004 filed by the State of Rajasthan against co-accused Ajay Data is rejected.</span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">44. Consequently, the application for cancellation of bail No. 3980/2004 filed by State of Rajasthan against accused R.S. Srivastava is allowed and the impugned order dated 10.8.2004 passed by the Special Judge granting bail to him under <a href=\"/doc/578037/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 176(2)</a> Cr.P.C. is set aside. The application for cancellation of bail No. 3844/2004 filed by State of Rajasthan against co-accused Ajay Data is dismissed. The prosecution is at liberty to proceed further against accused R.S. Srivastava in FIR No. 109/04 in accordance with the provisions of law. However, it is made clear that any observations made here-inabove, will not come in the way of accused R.S. Srivastava while considering his bail application after his arrest. \n</p> \n\n","numcites":65,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Rajasthan High Court - Jaipur","citetid":21280,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"cancellation of bail","formInput":"cancellation%20of%20bail"},{"value":"section 439(2) crpc","formInput":"section%20439%282%29%20crpc"},{"value":"439(2)cr.p.c.","formInput":"439%282%29cr.p.c."},{"value":"anticipatory bail","formInput":"anticipatory%20bail"},{"value":"no second fir","formInput":"no%20second%20fir"},{"value":"439(2)crpc","formInput":"439%282%29crpc"},{"value":"section 46 of criminal procedure code","formInput":"section%2046%20of%20criminal%20procedure%20code"},{"value":"section 167 (2) of crpc","formInput":"section%20167%20%282%29%20of%20crpc"},{"value":"application for bail cancellation","formInput":"application%20for%20bail%20cancellation"},{"value":"bail  filter:  anti corruption cases supreme court of india","formInput":"bail%20%20filter%3A%20%20anti%20corruption%20cases%20supreme%20court%20of%20india"},{"value":"grant of bail","formInput":"grant%20of%20bail"},{"value":"section 120b ipc","formInput":"section%20120b%20ipc"},{"value":"bail under section 437 of cr.p.c","formInput":"bail%20under%20section%20437%20of%20cr.p.c"},{"value":"\"arrest\" \"custody\"","formInput":"%22arrest%22%20%22custody%22"},{"value":"section 46 of crpc","formInput":"section%2046%20of%20crpc"},{"value":"167{2}crpc","formInput":"167%7B2%7Dcrpc"},{"value":"section 438 of crpc","formInput":"section%20438%20of%20crpc"},{"value":"anupam j kulkarni","formInput":"anupam%20j%20kulkarni"},{"value":"formal arrest","formInput":"formal%20arrest"},{"value":"bail u/s. 167 cr.p.c","formInput":"bail%20u/s.%20167%20cr.p.c"}],"cats":[{"value":"bail-in-non-bailable-offence","formInput":"tag:bail-in-non-bailable-offence"},{"value":"magistrate-may-order-detention","formInput":"tag:magistrate-may-order-detention"},{"value":"directions-for-grant-of-bail-to-person-apprehending-arrest","formInput":"tag:directions-for-grant-of-bail-to-person-apprehending-arrest"}],"courtcopy":false,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
