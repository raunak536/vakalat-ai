An order of\n                                   acquittal annulling or voiding a conviction operates from\n                                   nativity. As Kelson puts it, &quot;it is a true annulment, an\n                                   annulment with retroactive force.&quot; So when the conviction\n                                   of Rohit for Prabhu&#x27;s murder, was quashed, the High\n                                   Court-to borrow the felicitous words of Krishna lyer\n                                   J.-&#x27;Killed the conviction not then, but performed the\n                                   formal obsequies of the order which had died at birth”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                           7.It was further submitted that a judgment of acquittal gives the accused\n\n                a right of getting an automatic expungement of his name from all records and\n\n                particularly from those which are within public domain.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">                           8.The peculiarity of seeking redaction of the name of an accused persons\n\n                who have been acquitted, has essentially gained significance due to the\n\n                development of science and technology that has virtually brought everything\n\n                under the sky to the fingertips of any person who may have access to the\n\n                internet.

A person despite\n\n                getting acquitted after facing criminal trial has their name reflected in the order\n\n                or judgment as an accused which identity they want this world to forget.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">                           9. At the outset, this Court came to a prima facie conclusion that an\n\n                accused person is entitled to have their name redacted from the judgments or\n\n                orders and more particularly the ones that are available in the public domain\n\n                and which are accessible through search engines. However, this Court felt that\n\n                there may be ramifications if such a generalised order is passed and directions\n\n                are issued. In other words, this Court felt that there are certain finer aspects\n\n                which have to be considered failing which, it may open up flood gates. The\n\n                need for assistance from the Bar therefore seemed imperative. Initially, this\n\n                Court was inclined towards right to privacy, right of reputation and right to live\n\n                with dignity being read to have a wide scope. The Court felt that it had to come\n\n                to the rescue until the legislature ultimately enacts the Data Protection Act.\n\n                However, on a deeper review of the issue, this Court has taken cognisance of\n\n                the fact that the same is not as simple and straight as it sounded.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                11/36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                                                            W.P(MD).No.12015 of 2021</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">                           10.There is no doubt with regard to the fact that the moment Judge\n\n                records an order of acquittal, the identity of a person as an accused is\n\n                completely wiped out. This effect takes place due to the operation of law.\n\n                However, while undertaking the process of redaction, a Court is called upon to\n\n                literally strike of the name of the person from the order or judgment which\n\n                recorded the acquittal of the person from the criminal proceedings. In short, an\n\n                identity which has already been wiped out by operation of law is sought to be\n\n                wiped out at a gross level wherever there is reference to the name in the order\n\n                or judgment. One other question that solicits the attention of this Court is at\n\n                which level of jurisdiction should the process of redaction be done. Is it at the\n\n                trial court stage or at the appellate stage or at the revisional stage and how\n\n                should it be done in cases which have already concluded and become a part of\n\n                record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">                           11.Mr.Arun Anbumani, who was one of the Amicus, brought to the\n\n                attention of this Court a very important point for consideration. The learned\n\n                counsel rightly argued that this Court is only looking at the end product of a\n\n                criminal litigation, which is the final judgment or an order of acquittal which\n\n                gets published.

At every stage, there is a\n\n                publication and while seeking for redaction, none of these publications will be\n\n                touched. The learned counsel further submitted that it is only an order or\n\n                judgment of acquittal which actually saves the honour of a person whose name\n\n                has already been tarnished due to various publications that take place and\n\n                which are also readily available on the search engines.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                           12.There is a lot of force in this submission made by Mr.Arun\n\n                Anbumani. This country does not have a system like the one that is available\n\n                in United States, where through a Court order there can be complete\n\n                destruction of the entire records of an accused person, who is acquitted. Such\n\n                person can start their life tabula rasa and lead a normal life with the rights\n\n                provided by the Constitution, including the right to fill nil in the relevant\n\n                employment application column for criminal records. In other words, the entire\n\n                personal information gets expunged/destroyed and sealed from the public\n\n                domain.

Only in proportion as publicity has place can\n                           any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is\n                           no publicity there is no justice. Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is\n                           the keenest spur to exertion, and surest of all guards against improbity.\n                           It keeps the Judge himself while trying under trial (in the sense that) the\n                           security of securities is publicity”\n\n                Well over a century ago, this principle was firmly cemented as a fundamental\n\n                facet of the system of administration of justice by the House of Lords in Scott v\n\n                Scott [1913 A.C 417]. Viscount Haldane pointed out that the general principle\n\n                is that Courts must administer justice in public. There were, however, some\n\n                exceptions like matrimonial cases, cases relating to minors etc. which required\n\n                a departure from this principle. The rationale for the exceptions were premised\n\n                on a more fundamental principle that the chief object of courts of justice must\n\n                be to do justice between parties. Therefore, in cases like minors and\n\n                matrimonial disputes, where publicity may be harmful to the subject matter of\n\n                the lis, the principle of open justice must yield to the still more paramount duty\n\n                to do justice. After all, publicity is only a means to an end.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                           16.In R (Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster\n\n                Magistrates’ Court (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19</a> intervening) [2013 QB 618], Lord Toulson\n\n                offered the rule of law justification in support of the principle of open justice.\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                17/36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                                                                    W.P(MD).No.12015 of 2021</span>\n\n\n\n                The learned judge observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                                    “Open justice.

None can publish\n                                   anything concerning the above matters without his\n                                   consent — whether truthful or otherwise and whether\n                                   laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating\n                                   the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be\n                                   liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be\n                                   different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into\n                                   controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                20/36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                                                                     W.P(MD).No.12015 of 2021</span>\n\n\n\n                                         (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception,\n                                   that any publication concerning the aforesaid aspects\n                                   becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based\n                                   upon public records including court records. This is for\n                                   the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public\n                                   record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it\n                                   becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and\n                                   media among others. We are, however, of the opinion\n                                   that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(2)]</a> an\n                                   exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female\n                                   who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction\n                                   or a like offence should not further be subjected to the\n                                   indignity of her name and the incident being publicised\n                                   in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">                                         (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\n                                   above — indeed, this is not an exception but an\n                                   independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is\n                                   obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of\n                                   action for damages is simply not available with respect to\n                                   their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their\n                                   official duties. This is so even where the publication is\n                                   based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless\n                                   the official establishes that the publication was made (by\n                                   the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a\n                                   case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the\n                                   press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                21/36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                                                                      W.P(MD).No.12015 of 2021</span>\n\n\n\n                                   verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\n                                   prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where\n                                   the publication is proved to be false and actuated by\n                                   malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have\n                                   no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally\n                                   obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge of his\n                                   duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as\n                                   any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above.

In various cases involving heinous\n\n                crimes, this Court helplessly passes orders and judgments of acquittal due to\n\n                slipshod investigation, dishonest witnesses and lack of an effective witness\n\n                protection system.

It will be more appropriate to await the enactment of\n\n                the Data Protection Act and Rules thereunder, which may provide an objective\n\n                criterion while dealing with the plea of redaction of names of accused persons\n\n                who are acquitted from criminal proceedings. If such uniform standards are\n\n                not followed across the country, the constitutional courts will be riding an\n\n                unruly horse which will prove to be counterproductive to the existing system.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">                           32.In view of the above discussion, this Court is not inclined to grant the\n\n                relief sought for in the writ petition and accordingly, the writ petition stands\n\n                dismissed.
