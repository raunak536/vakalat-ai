On 11.02.2009, after the\n\npetitioner has left for his school, his son Nachiketa reached his residential\n\nquarter and after informing his mother, he sent to the Bermo Police Station.\n\nHe thereafter informed his mother on phone that he had given his\n\nstatement before the police and that the police officials were asking him to\n\nbe taken to Bokaro.

The petitioner informed the Superintendent of Police, Bokaro\n\nwith copy to the Hon&#x27;ble Governor of State of Jharkhand about the\n\naforesaid illegal act of respondent no.6. In the evening on 12.02.2009 itself\n\nat around 07:00 PM, the respondent no.6 along with police constables came\n\nto his quarter which comprises of only two rooms and invaded his house by\n\noccupying one of the rooms where the said police constables got\n\nthemselves stationed. He also submits that on 14.02.2009, the behaviour of\n\nthe local police was published in the newspaper on the number of dates. On\n\n14.02.2009, a notice was posted under the signature of the Officer-in-\n\nCharge dated 14.02.2009 in which it has been alleged that in the name of\n\nthe petitioner&#x27;s son Nachiketa that he has committed acts of eve teasing on\n\nphone against the wife of a higher official.

He further submits that in the counter\n\naffidavit filed by the respondent-State, Nachiketa mobile number is said to\n\nbe 9239879935 and the allegation was made that by that mobile the call\n\nwas made on mobile number 9204980385. He submits that in paragraph 5\n\nof the counter affidavit, the mobile number disclosed as 9239879935 is not\n\nof Nachiketa. He further submits that when the news was published,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4                     W.P. (Cr.) No. 54 of 2009</span>\n\n\nthereafter, the said constables were removed from the house of the\n\npetitioner. He also submits that in paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit,\n\nfiled by respondent no.6 there was an error while noting down the mobile\n\nnumber on the direction of the Superintendent of Police, Bokaro. The\n\ncorrect numbers are 9234879935 and 9204780385. He submits that\n\nrespondent no.6 in his counter affidavit, has disclosed totally different\n\nmobile number as 9234879935, whereas, earlier it was 9239879935. To\n\nsubstantiate this argument, he refers Annexures-A and G of the counter\n\naffidavit filed by the respondent-State. He further submits that further\n\ndocuments brought on record by way of counter affidavit at Annexure-R/6-A\n\nare after thought. He further submits that vide order dated 14.08.2015, this\n\nCourt has directed the State to produce Command Register/Guard Register\n\nto suggest whether the Guards were posted at the residence of the\n\npetitioner or not and in view of that order, the same was not brought on\n\nrecord and in the counter affidavit, it has been stated that it has been lost.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"113663\" id=\"span_4\">He also submits that all these have happened in absence of any FIR and if\n\nsuch harassment has been put to the petitioner and his family members,\n\nappropriate order is the need of the hour at least to suggest that such thing\n\nmay not happen in future with other persons. He submits that the\n\nreputation of the petitioner has been badly harmed due to the action, that\n\ntoo of an alleged act done by the son of the petitioner. He submits that if\n\nthe Court comes to the conclusion that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia has been violated, the Court can pass appropriate order under public\n\nlaw remedy. To buttress this argument, he relied upon the judgment passed\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/113663/\" id=\"a_3\">Chairman, Railway Board and others\n\nv. Chandrima Das (MRS) and others</a>; [(2000) 2 SCC 465] . He relied\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      5                         W.P. (Cr.)

Carrington [(1765)\n19 Howells&#x27; State Trials 1029 : 95 ER 807 : 2 Wils KB 275]\nLord Camden declared the warrant and the behaviour as\nsubversive &quot;of all the comforts of society&quot; and the issuance of\na warrant for the seizure of all of a person&#x27;s papers and not\nthose only alleged to be criminal in nature was &quot;contrary to\nthe genius of the law of England&quot;. Besides its general\ncharacter, the warrant was, according to the Court, bad\ninasmuch as it was not issued on a showing of probable cause\nand no record was required to be made of what had been\nseized. In USA, in Boyd v. United States [116 US 616 : 29 L Ed\n746 (1886)] , US at p. 626, the US Supreme Court said that\nthe great Entick [(1765) 19 Howells&#x27; State Trials 1029 : 95 ER\n807 : 2 Wils KB 275] judgment was &quot;one of the landmarks of\nEnglish liberty. ... one of the permanent monuments of the\nBritish Constitution&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">  20.

(2) So far as administrative or executive action is\nconcerned, it has again to be reasonable having regard to the\nfacts and circumstances of the case. (3) As to judicial\nwarrants, the court must have sufficient reason to believe that\nthe search or seizure is warranted and it must keep in mind\nthe extent of search or seizure necessary for the protection of\nthe particular State interest. In addition, as stated earlier,\ncommon-law-recognised rare exceptions such as where\nwarrantless searches could be conducted but these must be in\ngood faith, intended to preserve evidence or intended to\nprevent sudden danger to person or property.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">Development of law in India\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                            9                         W.P.

The earliest case in India to deal with &quot;privacy&quot; and\n&quot;search and seizure&quot; was <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_30\">M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra</a> [1954\nSCR 1077 : 1954 Cri LJ 865] in the context of <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(1)(f)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution. The contention that\nsearch and seizure violated <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 19(1)(f)</a> was rejected, the\nCourt holding that a mere search by itself did not affect any\nright to property, and though seizure affected it, such effect\nwas only temporary and was a reasonable restriction on the\nright. The question whether search warrants for the seizure of\ndocuments from the accused were unconstitutional was not\ngone into. The Court, after referring to the American\nauthorities, observed that in the US, because of the language\nin the Fourth Amendment, there was a distinction between\nlegal and illegal searches and seizures and that such a\ndistinction need not be imported into our Constitution. The\nCourt opined that a search warrant was addressed to an\nofficer and not to the accused and did not violate <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_34\">Article\n20(3).</a> In the present discussion the case is of limited help. In\nfact, the law as to privacy was developed in later cases by\nspelling it out from the right to freedom of speech and\nexpression in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the right to &quot;life&quot; in Article</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">21.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">  36. Two later cases decided by the Supreme Court of India\nwhere the foundations for the right were laid, concerned the\nintrusion into the home by the police under State regulations,\nby way of &quot;domiciliary visits&quot;. Such visits could be conducted\nany time, night or day, to keep a tab on persons for finding\nout suspicious criminal activity, if any, on their part.

The majority did\nnot go into the question whether these visits violated the\n&quot;right to privacy&quot;. But, Subba Rao, J. while concurring that the\nfundamental right to privacy was part of the right to liberty in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a>, part of the right to freedom of speech and\nexpression in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, and also of the right to\nmovement in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 19(1)(d)</a>, held that the Regulations\npermitting surveillance violated the fundamental right of\nprivacy.</span> In the discussion the learned Judge referred to Wolf v.\nColorado [338 US 25 : 93 L Ed 1782 (1949)] .

Parliament is currently considering the Protection\nof Woman against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Bill,\n2010, which is intended to protect female workers in\nmost workplaces. Provisions of that Bill are not\nsufficient to curb eve-teasing. Before undertaking\nsuitable legislation to curb eve-teasing, it is necessary\nto take at least some urgent measures so that it can be\ncurtailed to some extent. In public interest, we are\ntherefore inclined to give the following directions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">  34.1. All the State Governments and Union Territories\nare directed to depute plain clothed female police\nofficers in the precincts of busstands and stops, railway\nstations, metro stations, cinema theaters, shopping\nmalls, parks, beaches, public service vehicles, places of\nworship, etc. so as to monitor and supervise incidents\nof eve-teasing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">  34.2. There will be a further direction to the State\nGovernment and Union Territories to install CCTV\ncameras in strategic positions which itself would be a\ndeterrent and if detected, the offender could be caught.\n  34.3. Persons in charge of the educations institutions,\nplaces of worship, cinema theaters, railway stations,\nbus-stands have to take steps as they deem fit to\nprevent eve-teasing, within their precincts and, on a\ncomplaint being made, they must pass on the\ninformation to the nearest police station or the\nWomen&#x27;s Help Center.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">  34.4. Where any incident of eve-teasing is committed\nin a public service vehicle either by the passengers or\nthe persons in charge of the vehicle, the crew of such\nvehicle shall, on a complaint made by the aggrieved\nperson, take such vehicle to the nearest police station\nand give information to the police. Failure to do so\nshould lead to cancellation of the permit to ply.\n 34.5. The State Governments and Union Territories are\ndirected to establish Women Helpline in various cities\nand towns, so as to curb eve-teasing within three\nmonths.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"> 34.6. Suitable boards cautioning such act of eveteasing\nbe exhibited in all public places including precincts of\neducational institutions, bus-stands, railway stations,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                       14                           W.P.

Mr. Aashish Kumar, learned counsel for respondent no.6 submits that\n\non 10.02.2009, respondent no.6 was attending the crime meeting at\n\nBokaro, which was headed by the Superintendent of Police, Bokaro. In the\n\nsaid meeting itself, the Superintendent of Police has received a call from\n\nRanchi and thereafter he was verbally told that one Nachiketa, son of the\n\npetitioner, from whose mobile number 9239879935 obscene call was on\n\nmobile number 9204980385, which was the number of wife of senior official\n\nat Ranchi and in view of that, respondent no.6 was directed to enquire into\n\nthe matter. He further submits that on 14.02.2009, the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Bokaro has issued direction in writing to respondent no.6 to enquire\n\ninto the matter. He submits that call was made from mobile number\n\n9234879935 by Nachiketa to mobile number 9204780385 to the wife of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    15                     W.P.

He submits that respondent no.6 enquired the\n\nmatter from the service provider and it was found that there was an error\n\nwhile noting down the mobile number by the Superintendent of Police,\n\nBokaro and the correct numbers are 9234879935 and of victim\n\n9204780385. He submits that the enquiry was not cooperated by the\n\npetitioner and his son Nachiketa and that is why, constables were posted\n\nthere at the residence of the petitioner. He denies in the counter affidavit\n\nthe deputation of constables. He submits that the constables were already\n\nremoved when the news publication was there. He draws attention of the\n\nCourt to Annexure-R/6-A and submits that the said mobile number is of\n\nNachiketa, which has been provided by the service provider and in view of\n\nthat, respondent no.6 has done nothing wrong and this Court may kindly\n\ndismiss this petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">10.   In view of the above submissions of the learned counsel for the\n\nparties, this Court has gone through the materials on the record and finds\n\nthat admittedly on 10.02.2009 itself, the Officer-in-Charge of Bermo Police\n\nStation went to the house of the petitioner and enquired in absence of any\n\nwritten order, which was continued up to 13.02.2009 and written letter with\n\nregard to the said enquiry was received by respondent no.6 on 14.02.2009.\n\nEven the argument of the learned counsel for the State and respondent\n\nno.6 are accepted to be true that after lodging of Sanha, the investigation\n\nwas going on, the Court finds that from 10.02.2009 to 13.02.2009, there\n\nwas no order. The question further remains that if the alleged act was done\n\nby the son of the petitioner, namely, Nachiketa, why the petitioner and his\n\nfamily members were being harassed by the police whereas on their\n\nrequest, Nachiketa appeared before respondent no.6 on 11.02.2009 itself.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                     16                     W.P. (Cr.) No. 54 of 2009</span>\n\n\nThe document annexed with the writ petition suggests that on 14.02.2009 a\n\nnotice was posted to the house of the petitioner stating that his son has\n\ncommitted acts of eve teasing. If that was the situation, only son was\n\nrequired to be enquired into and interrogated, wheres, in the case in hand,\n\nthe entire family has been put on such harassment. The Court finds that in\n\nparagraph 15 of the counter affidavit filed by respondent no.6, it has been\n\nstated that the police force deputed in the house of the petitioner, has been\n\nremoved and that news items appeared on 18.02.2009 and in earlier\n\nparagraph, the deputation of the police officer has been denied. The stand\n\ntaken by respondent no.6 is contradictory. Vide order dated 14.08.2015, this\n\nCourt called upon the State to produce Command Register/Guard Register\n\nwith regard to deputation of constables, however, the said Command\n\nRegister/Guard Register has not been brought on record and the said order\n\nis of the year 2015 itself and only statement is made that the said Register\n\nis missing, which further suggests that version of the respondent-State and\n\nrespondent no.6 are not correct with regard to deputation of the police\n\nofficials. In the counter affidavit filed by respondent no.5 at Annexure-A,\n\nmobile number of Nachiketa is said to be 9239879935 and mobile number\n\nof victim is said to be 9204980385 and in the same counter affidavit at\n\nAnnexure-G, the mobile number of Nachiketa is said to be 9239859935 and\n\nthe mobile number of victim is said to be 9204980385. It has been stated in\n\nthe counter affidavits filed by the respondent-State and respondent no.6\n\nthat the wife of a Colonel of Indian Army was being harassed by the son of\n\nthe petitioner, whereas, in the counter affidavit filed by respondent no.6, it\n\nhas been stated that Rekha Singh Ganguli got herself transferred to a far\n\naway place in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, which further suggests that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                      17                      W.P. (Cr.) No. 54 of 2009</span>\n\n\nearlier the statements were made that the wife of the a Colonel is being\n\nharassed and in paragraph 27 of the counter affidavit, it has been stated\n\nthat she has got herself transferred to Jammu and Kashmir, which suggest\n\nthat she was in Government job. There are contradictions of the status of\n\nthe victim and even where about of the said lady is not known to the\n\nrespondent-State in view of paragraph 27 of the counter affidavit filed by\n\nrespondent no.6. In paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit filed by\n\nrespondent no.6, the mobile number of Rekha Singh Ganguli has been\n\ndisclosed as 9204780385, whereas at Annexure-G of the counter affidavit of\n\nrespondent no.5, the fact is otherwise, which suggests that mobile number\n\nis 9204980385.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_40\">11.   Thus, it appears that without following the due process of law, all\n\nthings happened and if such a situation is there whether the High Court can\n\nbe a mute spectator when the things are brought before the Court i.e. the\n\nquestion and answer is simply &#x27;No&#x27; in view of the fact that the State cannot\n\nhave unrestricted access to inspect and seize or make roaming enquiry into\n\nall things relating to a person without any reliable information before it prior\n\nto such inspection. Search, taking of notes or extracts or seizure of the said\n\ndocuments would amount to a breach of confidentiality and be violative of\n\nprivacy rights of a person if there is no cogent reason expressed or provided\n\nin the affidavit and if it has been done, <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_70\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and (d) and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">21</a>\n\ncomes into play and that was considered by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_72\">District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad</a> (supra).</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">12.   Admittedly, till 14.02.2009, there was no order and no Sanha and in\n\nspite of any FIR, the Officer-in-Charge was visiting the house of the\n\npetitioner w.e.f. 10.02.2009 to 13.02.2009. There are contradictions of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                      18                      W.P. (Cr.) No. 54 of 2009</span>\n\n\ndeputing police officials. On the one hand, the order of this Court dated\n\n14.08.2015 is not complied with by bringing on record the Command\n\nRegister/Guard Register, on the other hand in the counter affidavit of\n\nrespondent no.6, it has been stated that the Guards were removed. The\n\nstatement is further made that the said Register is missing. In a two room\n\nhouse of the petitioner, the constables had been put therein. In view of that\n\nany form of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment would fall\n\nwithin the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and even it occurs\n\nduring investigation, interrogation or otherwise. The right to life of a citizen\n\ncannot be put in abeyance on his arrest and there are line of judgments and\n\neven the convicts under trial detenu or other prisoners, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India cannot be allowed to be violated.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">13.   In the case in hand, there is no allegation against the petitioner and\n\nthe allegation is against the son of the petitioner and in spite of that the\n\nentire family has been harassed and their reputation has been put at stake.\n\nIf any violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is found by the\n\nCourt, the Court can pass appropriate order under public law remedy. This\n\nis not a case that only son was harassed, but the entire family member has\n\nbeen put to mental torture at the hand of none other than the protector of\n\nthe citizen of the district.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">14.   The judgment relied by Mr. Deepak Kumar Dubey, learned counsel for\n\nthe State is not in dispute. In the said PIL, the subject matter was eve-\n\nteasing and no Court will allow to evade the investigation if such allegation\n\nis there and that is why rightly that order has been passed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"66588430\" id=\"span_42\">In the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/66588430/\" id=\"a_76\">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> (supra) relied by Mr. Dubey, learned counsel\n\nfor the State, the High Court has quashed the FIR which was under</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                 19                   W.P.
