No.71293\n         of 2023. Vide the impugned interim Order, the High Court\n         accepted the submission of the Sub-Divisional Police\n         Officer, Mahua, that she will conduct a narco-analysis test\n         of all the accused persons and posted the case for hearing\n         on 12th July 2024.

We have heard the learned counsel for the Appellant and the\nlearned Addl.

Consequently, the issues which arise for consideration of this\nCourt are :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      i. Firstly, whether in the attending facts and circumstances,\n         the High Court could have accepted such a submission.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     ii.

Lastly, whether an accused can voluntarily seek a narco-\n         analysis test, as a matter of an indefeasible right.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">7.    For the purposes of clarity, a narco-analysis test is an\ninterrogation method whereby a suspect of a crime is injected with\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                                Page 5 of 17</span>\n\fa psychoactive drug under controlled conditions to suppress their\nreasoning power or the ability to determine what is good/bad for\nthemselves.3 As submitted by the learned Amicus Curiae, the drug\nused for this test is sodium pentothal, which is also used in higher\ndosages for inducing general anesthesia in surgeries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_15\">8.      However, conducting such tests on persons accused of\ncommitting a crime raises serious questions, vis-à-vis, the\nconstitutional protection granted from compulsion to become a\nwitness against oneself under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 20(3).</a> The constitutional\nvalidity of this test, along with similar tests like the polygraph test,\ncame to be challenged before this Court in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_14\">Selvi</a> (supra). After an\nelaborate discussion, this Court (three-Judge Bench) held\ninvoluntary administration of this test to be hit by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 20(3)</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">21</a> of the Constitution. The following principles came to be\nexpounded:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      8.1. <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_17\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">21</a> of the Constitution are non-derogable\n            and sacrosanct rights to which the judiciary cannot carve\n            out exceptions;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      8.2. Involuntary administration of narco-analysis and similar\n            tests is in contravention of the protection given by Article\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">3</span>\n B R Sharma, Forensic Science in Criminal Investigation &amp; Trials, Sixth Edition, 2020 –\nParagraph 32.1.1.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                                            Page 6 of 17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\f         20(3) of the Constitution, i.e. the right against self-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">         incrimination;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">     8.3. The results of such involuntary tests cannot be considered\n         as ‘material evidence’ in the eyes of the law;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">     8.4. Conducting such tests in the absence of consent violates\n         ‘substantive due process’ – which is an essential element\n         required for restraining one’s personal liberty. Permitting\n         such tests may lead to a disproportionate exercise of police\n         powers;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">     8.5. The boundaries of privacy of a person are also breached\n         when these tests are conducted without consent; and\n\n     8.6. For voluntary tests, it must be ensured that appropriate\n         safeguards are in place. Moreover, the results of the same\n         cannot be admitted directly as evidence. Pertinently, any\n         fact or information that is discovered subsequent thereto,\n         with the help of the information supplied in the result, can\n         be admitted into evidence with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 27</a> of the\n         Indian Evidence Act 1872.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">9.    From the above exposition of law, it is clear that under no\ncircumstances, is an involuntary or forced narco-analysis test\npermissible under law. Consequently, a report of such involuntary\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                             Page 7 of 17</span>\n\ftest or information that is discovered subsequently is also not per se\nadmissible as evidence in criminal or other proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_19\">10.   Adverting to the facts at hand, we cannot find a reason in the\nHigh Court accepting a submission by the Investigating Officer,\nstating that they will conduct a narco-analysis test of all the accused\npersons. Such a submission and its acceptance, is in direct\ncontravention to the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_20\">Selvi</a> (supra), being\nhit by the protections under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_21\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">21</a> of the\nConstitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">11.   Moreover, we fail to understand how such an endeavour was\naccepted by the High Court when adjudicating an application for\nregular bail under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973. It is settled law that while entertaining an application for grant\nof bail, the Court has to take into consideration the allegations\nagainst the accused; period of custody undergone; nature of\nevidence and the crime in question; likelihood of influencing\nwitnesses and other such relevant grounds. It does not involve\nentering into a roving enquiry or accepting the use of involuntary\ninvestigative techniques. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"30798674\" id=\"span_20\">In similar circumstances, where the High\nCourt had ordered lie detector, brain mapping and narco-analysis\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                               Page 8 of 17</span>\n\ftests, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/30798674/\" id=\"a_24\">Sangitaben Shaileshbhai Datana v.

Having heard the counsel for the parties, it is\n               surprising to note the present approach adopted by the\n               High Court while considering the bail application. The\n               High Court ordering the abovementioned tests is not\n               only in contravention to the first principles of criminal\n               law jurisprudence but also violates statutory\n               requirements. While adjudicating a bail application,\n               <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is\n               the guiding principle wherein the court takes into\n               consideration, inter alia, the gravity of the crime, the\n               character of the evidence, position and status of the\n               accused with reference to the victim and witnesses, the\n               likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice and\n               repeating the offence, the possibility of his tampering\n               with the witnesses and obstructing the course of justice\n               and such other grounds. Each criminal case presents its\n               own peculiar factual matrix, and therefore, certain\n               grounds peculiar to a particular case may have to be\n               taken into account by the court. However, the court has\n               to only opine as to whether there is a prima facie case\n               against the accused. The court must not undertake\n               meticulous examination of the evidence collected by the\n               police, or rather order specific tests as done in the present\n               case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">               7. In the instant case, by ordering the abovementioned\n               tests and venturing into the reports of the same with\n               meticulous details, the High Court has converted the\n               adjudication of a bail matter to that of a mini trial indeed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">               This assumption of function of a trial court by the High\n               Court is deprecated.”\n                                                      (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">4</span>\n    (2019) 14 SCC 522.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                                             Page 9 of 17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">\f12.     We are not inclined to accept the submission of the\nRespondent- State that since modern investigative techniques are\nthe need of the hour, the High Court was correct in accepting the\nsubmission that narco-analysis test of all accused persons will be\nconducted. While the need for modern investigative techniques may\nbe true, such investigative techniques cannot be conducted at the\ncost of constitutional guarantees under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_26\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">21.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">13.     Therefore, the first question framed is answered in the\nnegative.

In the course of proceedings, the issue of undergoing a narco-\nanalysis test voluntarily came to be raised, which brings us to the\nsecond question framed. As discussed above, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_28\">Selvi</a>\n(supra) had considered voluntary narco-analysis tests and opined\nthat the reports thereof cannot be admitted directly into evidence.\nInformation that is discovered, as a consequence thereof, can be\nadmitted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act,\n1872.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                            Page 10 of 17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167720008\" id=\"span_26\">15.

The law relating to the evidentiary value of\n              recovery made under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence\n              Act, 1872 is settled by this Court in the case of Manoj\n              Kumar Soni v. State of M.P.. Paragraph 22 of the said\n              decision reads thus:—\n\n                 “22. A doubt looms : can disclosure\n                 statements per se, unaccompanied by any\n                 supporting evidence, be deemed adequate to\n                 secure    a    conviction?    We      find    it\n                 implausible. Although disclosure statements\n                 hold significance as a contributing factor in\n                 unriddling a case, in our opinion, they are\n                 not so strong a piece of evidence sufficient on\n                 its own and without anything more to bring\n                 home the charges beyond reasonable\n                 doubt.”\n              Therefore, in our view, the appellant&#x27;s guilt was not\n              proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">16.

In our view, as rightly submitted by the learned Amicus, the\nabove view of the Rajasthan High Court cannot be sustained. It\ncannot be said that undergoing a narco-analysis test is part of the\nindefeasible right to lead evidence, given its suspect nature, and\nmoreover, we find the same to be in the teeth of the judgment of this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_41\">Selvi</a> (supra). It had been categorically observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               “240. We must also contemplate situations where a\n               threat given by the investigators to conduct any of the\n               impugned tests could prompt a person to make\n               incriminatory statements or to undergo some mental\n               trauma. Especially in cases of individuals from weaker\n               sections of society who are unaware of their fundamental\n               rights and unable to afford legal advice, the mere\n               apprehension of undergoing scientific tests that\n               supposedly reveal the truth could push them to make\n               confessional statements. Hence, the act of threatening to\n               administer the impugned tests could also elicit\n               testimony. It is also quite conceivable that an individual\n               may give his/her consent to undergo the said tests on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">14</span>\n     2022 SCC Online Raj 1443.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                                        Page 13 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\f          account of threats, false promises or deception by the\n          investigators. For example, a person may be convinced\n          to give his/her consent after being promised that this\n          would lead to an early release from custody or dropping\n          of charges. However, after the administration of the\n          tests, the investigators may renege on such promises. In\n          such a case the relevant inquiry is not confined to the\n          apparent voluntariness of the act of undergoing the tests,\n          but also includes an examination of the totality of\n          circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">          253. . We are of the view that an untrammelled right of\n          resorting to the techniques in question will lead to an\n          unnecessary rise in the volume of frivolous litigation\n          before our courts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">          264. In light of these conclusions, we hold that no\n          individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the\n          techniques in question, whether in the context of\n          investigation in criminal cases or otherwise. Doing so\n          would amount to an unwarranted intrusion into personal\n          liberty. However, we do leave room for the voluntary\n          administration of the impugned techniques in the context\n          of criminal justice, provided that certain safeguards are\n          in place. Even when the subject has given consent to\n          undergo any of these tests, the test results by themselves\n          cannot be admitted as evidence because the subject does\n          not exercise conscious control over the responses during\n          the administration of the test. However, any information\n          or material that is subsequently discovered with the help\n          of voluntary administered test results can be admitted in\n          accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872.”\n\n                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">21.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_48\">In view of the above exposition in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_43\">Selvi</a> (Supra), the third\nquestion is answered in the following terms :</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">Crl.A.@ SLP(Crl.)No.5392/2024                                   Page 14 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\f      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_50\">The accused has a right to voluntarily undergo a narco-\nanalysis test at an appropriate stage.
