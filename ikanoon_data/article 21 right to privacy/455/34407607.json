However, in the course of the arguments, the learned\n\ncounsel     for   the   petitioner      submitted   that   he    would\n\nwithdraw the prayer pertaining to restoration of GST\n\nregistration with liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh writ\n\npetition    or    approach     the      Competent     Authority       for\n\nrestoration of the same, as the same is not consequential\n\nfor the issuance of the impugned show cause notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">Learned counsel for the respondents has no objection for\n\nthe same. Hence, the writ petition insofar as it relates to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 -5-</span>\n                                                NC: 2024:KHC:49045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                             WP No. 18305 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe prayer of restoring the GST registration of the\n\npetitioner stands dismissed reserving the liberty to the\n\npetitioner to approach the appropriate authority or file a\n\nfresh writ petition pertaining to the same.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.     With regard to other prayers, the case of the\n\npetitioner is that investigation was initiated by respondent\n\nno.2 against the petitioner without jurisdiction.                 It is\n\nsubmitted   that     pursuant    to    the     initiation   of    such\n\ninvestigation; inspection, search and seizure of several\n\npremises belonging to the petitioner as envisaged under\n\nChapter 14 of the <a href=\"/doc/95399496/\" id=\"a_7\">CGST Act</a>/<a href=\"/doc/29709391/\" id=\"a_8\">KGST Act</a> was carried out,\n\ncertain materials were seized and the petitioner was called\n\nfor questioning and his submissions have been recorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">It is further submitted that the petitioner was forced to\n\nmake a payment of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakhs\n\nonly) towards probable liability during investigation and\n\nthe same has been paid by the petitioner under protest on\n\n20.01.2021.     It    is   submitted    that     all   these     things\n\nhappened when the investigation was being done by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                              -6-</span>\n                                          NC: 2024:KHC:49045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     WP No. 18305 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nrespondent no.2.      It is further submitted that the\n\npetitioner is not liable to pay the said amount of\n\nRs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakhs only) and has not\n\ncommitted any mistake as alleged.     It is contended that\n\nrespondent no.2 never had the jurisdiction to conduct the\n\ninvestigation or inspection, search or seizure or demand\n\npayments    towards    the     probable    liability   during\n\ninvestigation. It is submitted that respondent no.2 is not\n\nthe proper Officer as envisaged under the said Acts. It is\n\nfurther submitted that thereafter respondent no.2 realized\n\nthat he does not have the necessary jurisdiction and\n\ntransferred the case to respondent no.3, who is the proper\n\nOfficer, to conduct the necessary investigation.         But,\n\nrespondent no.3 instead of conducting the investigation\n\nafresh, relying upon the records built by respondent no.2,\n\na show cause notice has been issued under Section 74 of\n\nthe CGST Act and KGST Act. It is contended that as the\n\ninspection, search and seizure is not conducted by a\n\nproper Officer, the consequential show cause notice\n\nthough issued by a proper Officer under <a href=\"/doc/21142678/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 74</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                              -7-</span>\n                                           NC: 2024:KHC:49045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       WP No. 18305 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nCGST Act and KGST Act has to be set aside and\n\nconsequently,    the   respondents   are   also   required    to\n\nreimburse the sum of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakhs\n\nonly) deposited by the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.     Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents,\n\nupon    instructions, submits that    though bulk      of    the\n\ninvestigation, inspection, search and seizure have been\n\ndone by respondent no.2, respondent no.3 has also\n\nrecorded certain statement of the petitioner.      He further\n\nsubmits that though in the show cause notice respondent\n\nno.1 has relied upon the investigation, inspection, search\n\nand seizure done by respondent no.2, as the show cause\n\nnotice is issued by a proper Officer, the same cannot be\n\nset aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.     Thus, based on the submissions made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner and the respondents, it has to be\n\nconcluded that substantial portion of the investigation,\n\ninspection, search and seizure in respect of the case of the\n\npetitioner has been conducted by respondent no.2 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                  -8-</span>\n                                              NC: 2024:KHC:49045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                            WP No. 18305 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nonly the formalities have been completed by respondent\n\nno.3, who is the proper Officer and subsequently the show\n\ncause notice under Section 74 of the CGST Act and KGST\n\nAct has been issued by respondent no.1.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">7.   Under the said circumstances, the question that arises\n\nfor consideration in the instant writ petition is, when the\n\ninvestigation,     inspection,     search     and    seizure   is\n\nsubstantially completed by an improper Officer, is the\n\nshow cause notice issued by a proper Officer under Section\n\n74 of the CGST Act and KGST Act liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">8.      It is pertinent to note that in the instant case, the\n\ninvestigation, inspection, search and seizure against the\n\npetitioner was commenced in the year 2020 by respondent\n\nno.2.     He has inspected and seized several documents,\n\nelectronic devices and other goods belonging to the\n\npetitioner and his staff and has recorded the statements of\n\nthe petitioner and other concerned persons in relation to\n\nthe business of the petitioner and the petitioner has\n\ndeposited a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    -9-</span>\n                                                   NC: 2024:KHC:49045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                               WP No. 18305 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nonly) under protest towards the probable liability towards\n\nGST on 20.01.2021 and that the investigation was\n\ntransferred to respondent no.3 only in the month of June\n\n2021 and respondent no.3 has only formally concluded the\n\ninvestigation and the show cause notice has been issued.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"558753\" id=\"span_13\">9.   The respondents contend that show cause notice is\n\nissued   based      on    the    investigation       done      and       the\n\nincriminating materials seized and they rely upon the\n\ndecision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/558753/\" id=\"a_10\">Pooran Mal v.

Nor is it open to us to strain\nthe language of the Constitution, because some American\nJudges of the American Supreme Court have spelt out\ncertain constitutional protections from the provisions of\nthe American Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_14\">M.P. Sharma v. Satish\nChander</a>, already referred to, a search and seizure made\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> was challenged as\nillegal on the ground of violation of the fundamental right\nunder <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 20(3)</a>, the argument being that the evidence\nwas no better than illegally compelled evidence. In\nsupport of that contention reference was made to the\nFourth and Fifth Amendments of the American\nConstitution and also to some American cases which\nseemed to hold that the obtaining of incriminating\nevidence by illegal seizure and search tantamounts to the\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment\ndoes not place any embargo on reasonable searches and\nseizures. It provides that the right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons, papers and effects against\nunreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.\nThus the privacy of a citizen&#x27;s home was specifically\nsafeguarded under the Constitution, although reasonable\nsearches and seizures were not taboo.

The obvious consequence is that the requirement\n     about the existence of reason to believe, consequent upon\n     the information in possession and concerned authority is\n     not satisfied, the search cannot be said to be a search\n     under <a href=\"/doc/38608080/\" id=\"a_22\">section 132</a> of the Act as contemplated by the\n     provisions of <a href=\"/doc/95399496/\" id=\"a_23\">section 158B</a> of the Act. A search under\n     <a href=\"/doc/38608080/\" id=\"a_24\">section 132</a> as contemplated in the Chapter has to be a\n     valid search. An illegal search is no search and the\n     necessary corollary, in such a case, Chapter XIV-B would\n     have no application. If the search conducted is without\n     jurisdiction, then it would be void ab initio. If the action is\n     illegally taken or power under the section is exercised for\n     a collateral purpose, it is liable to be struck down by the\n     court. If the conditions for the exercise of power are not\n     satisfied, the proceeding is liable to be quashed. The\n     eminent conclusion would be that Chapter XIV-B cannot\n     be undertaken against the assessee.

If the said contention is upheld, the\nassessment order would have no reason to stand.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">60. A mere search or seizure, by itself would not result in\nfoisting the liability on the assessee though it would\ninvade his right to privacy and the fundamental right to\ncarry on business. But, if the said search and seizure\nresults in determination of liability and levy of tax then\nthe assessee is said to be an aggrieved person. The said\ndetermination of liability and levy of tax would be by way\nof an assessment order. Then only he can avail of the\nremedy of appeal provided under the statute. In other\nwords, he cannot prefer an appeal against authorisation\nof search and seizure as illegal. But, once such\nunauthorised or illegal search and seizure culminates in\nan assessment order, than he gets a right to challenge\nthe assessment on several grounds including the\nauthorisation and initiation of search and seizure without\nwhich no order of assessment could have been passed.\nThough the authorisation and search and seizure may not\nbe by the Assessing Officer, the basis of such assessment\norder by him is the authorisation and consequent search\nand seizure and the material collected during the said\nproceedings. If the very initiation of block assessment\nproceeding is vitiated and is void, the assessment order\npassed in such proceedings would be non est and void ab\ninitio. That is a ground available to the assessee to\nchallenge the assessment order in an appeal. May be a\nprocedural irregularity in conducting search and seizure\nmay not vitiate the assessment order, but the very\ninitiation of the proceedings if it is not in accordance with\nlaw, the initiation would be without jurisdiction, void and\nthe consequent order would also be void. It is not a\ncurable defect. It is not voidable at the option of the\nassessee. If he has not challenged the same by way of\nwrit petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">article 226</a> of the Constitution, he\nwould not lose his right to challenge the same in an\nappeal. There cannot be an estoppel against the statute.\nIn this regard it is useful to notice the specific words used\nin sub-section (1)(b) of section 253, i.e, &quot;an order passed\nby the Assessing Officer under clause (c) of section 158BC\nin respect of search initiated under <a href=\"/doc/38608080/\" id=\"a_26\">section 132</a>&quot;.

In interpreting fiscal statute, the court cannot\nproceed to make good deficiencies, if there be any, the\ncourt must interpret the statute as it stands, and in case\nof doubt, in a manner favourable to the taxpayer. When\nthe statute expressly refers to &quot;a search initiated under\n<a href=\"/doc/38608080/\" id=\"a_28\">section 132</a> of the Act&quot;, while interpreting the said\nprovision it cannot be ignored. The expression used is\ncapable of comprehensive impact. The words used are &quot;a\nsearch initiated&quot;. Therefore, the subject-matter of appeal\nunder the provision is not only the assessment order by\nthe Assessing Officer but also &quot;a search initiated&quot; under\n<a href=\"/doc/38608080/\" id=\"a_29\">section 132</a> of the Act. Therefore, the necessary corollary\nis, if the assessee contends that the search initiated under\n<a href=\"/doc/38608080/\" id=\"a_30\">section 132</a> of the Act is not in accordance with law, it\nwould not satisfy the legal requirements as contemplated\nunder <a href=\"/doc/134164496/\" id=\"a_31\">section 132(1)(a)</a>, (b), (e), then the said contention\nhas to be considered and adjudicated upon by the\nTribunal, in an appeal filed against the assessment order.\nSince this action of the Assessing Officer is inextricably\nlinked with the initiation of assessment proceedings the\nsame can be assailed before the appellate authority. If\nthe initiation of these block assessment proceedings is\nvitiated, in the eye of law, there is no search and the\nentire proceedings based on such search has no legs to\nstand.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">61. Therefore, in an appeal filed challenging the block\nassessment order, it is open to the assessee to contend\nthat this foundation for block assessment is an illegal\nsearch. Therefore, it is obligatory on the part of the\nTribunal first to go into the jurisdictional aspect and\nsatisfy itself that the said search was valid and legal. It is\nonly then it can go into the correctness of the order of\nblock assessment. Therefore, it cannot be said merely\nbecause the assessee did not choose to challenge the\nsearch conducted in his premises on the aforesaid\ngrounds by way of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">article 226</a> of the\nConstitution before the High Court, he cannot challenge\nthe said order in appeal. In the absence of a specific\nprovision provided under the Act for appeal against such\norders, in the appeal filed against the assessment order,\nthe Tribunal is not estopped from going into such\nquestion.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                                   - 15 -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">                                                  NC: 2024:KHC:49045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                              WP No. 18305 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"558753\" id=\"span_24\">62.

There is no quarrel with the said legal proposition.\n      In the first place, the provisions relating to the block\n      assessment was not in the statute on the day <a href=\"/doc/558753/\" id=\"a_35\">the said\n      judgment</a> was delivered by the apex court. Secondly,\n      prior to the incorporation of the provisions of block\n      assessment for an assessment, search was not a\n      condition precedent. It is in that context it was held even\n      if search and seizure is illegal, the material recovered\n      during such illegal search and seizure could be looked into\n      for the purposes of assessment and act, but that is not\n      possible, in case of block assessment. Even if a return is\n      filed in pursuance of a direction issued under the said\n      Chapter and the material secured during search and\n      seizure which is declared as illegal is looked into, still the\n      order of assessment passed in this proceedings would be\n      a nullity because the very initiation of the proceedings is\n      void. Those materials secured in the illegal search and\n      seizure would certainly be made use of in the assessment\n      proceedings under the Act other than the block\n      assessment proceedings and, therefore, the contention\n      that the assessment order would not get vitiated because\n      of illegal search and seizure as it is based on the returns\n      filed and the materials secured during the illegal search\n      and seizure is, without any substance.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"50338328\" id=\"span_25\">11.
