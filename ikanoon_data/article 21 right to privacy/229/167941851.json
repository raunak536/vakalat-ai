On\n\n     3 May 2021, MBL submitted an application for renewal of uplinking and downlinking\n\n     permission to MIB. The application stated that the uplinking and downlinking\n\n     permissions granted to Media One would expire on 30 September 2021 and 29\n\n     September 2021 respectively. In the statement filed by the ASG before the Kerala\n\n     High Court, it was submitted that:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">         (i)            the application for ‘renewal’ filed by the MBL was forwarded by MIB to\n\n                        MHA; and\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">         (ii)           by a letter dated 29 December 2021, MHA denied security clearance to\n\n                        MBL for ‘renewal’ of uplinking and downlinking permission.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">20   MIB issued a show cause notice stating that, MBL has “ceased to fulfil the eligibility\n\n     requirement for ‘renewal’ of permission for uplinking and downlinking” due to the\n\n     denial of security clearance. MBL was asked to show cause as to why the\n\n     ‘permission granted to them should not be revoked or cancelled’. By its letter dated\n\n     31 January 2022, MIB ordered that the permission granted to MBL to uplink and\n\n     downlink Media One be ‘revoked’. Though the show cause notice stated that\n\n     security clearance which is a requirement for ‘renewal’ of license is denied, MIB\n\n     was asked to show cause as to why its license should not be ‘revoked’. A similar\n\n     phraseology of ‘revocation’ was used in MIB’s order dated 31 January 2022.

However, both the former and the latter note that MBL has not fulfilled one\n\n     of the conditions for renewal of license since it was denied a security clearance by\n\n     the MHA. Counsel for the appellants have not made submissions on the\n\n     inconsistency arising out of the use of the phrases ‘renewal’ and ‘revocation’\n\n     interchangeably. Thus, we will proceed on the understanding that the order of MIB\n\n     dated 31 January 2022 rejected the application for renewal of the licence to operate\n\n     the channel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">\nD.

If the\n\n     conditions are fulfilled, the application is sent to MHA for security clearance. Thus,\n\n     Paragraph 9.2 prescribes a condition in addition to those stipulated in Paragraphs\n\n     2 and 3 of the Uplinking guidelines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">\n29   The heading of Paragraph 9,namely, “procedure for obtaining permission,’ does\n\n     not detract from the prescription of a substantive condition. Paragraph 10.4\n\n     excludes the eligibility criteria of net worth of the company and managerial\n\n     experience from the consideration of the renewal application. All other conditions\n\n     prescribed by the guidelines for permission are applicable for renewal of\n\n     permission. The requirement of security clearance arises at a stage subsequent to\n\n     the fulfilment of conditions prescribed under Paragraphs 2 and 3. If the preliminary\n\n     conditions prescribed are applicable at the time of renewal, there is no reason to\n\n     exclude the application of the requirement of the security clearance for renewal of\n\n     permission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">\n30   Further, Paragraph 10. 4 of the Uplinking Guidelines stipulates that the conditions\n\n     ‘as modified by the permission letter’ are applicable at the time of renewal of the\n\n     license. The annexure to the ‘permission letter’ does not specify any condition\n\n     modifying or eliminating the condition of security clearance. Rather, the annexure\n\n     provides that the licence shall be revoked on grounds of ‘public order and national\n\n     security’. Though in view of Paragraph 10 of the Uplinking Guidelines, the licensee\n\n     does not have a vested interest for renewal of the permission, the grounds for\n\n     denying a renewal of license cannot be materially different from the grounds for\n\n     revoking the licence. This is because both non-renewal of license and revocation\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                              25</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART E\n\n     of license are restrictions on the right to freedom of press. The intent behind the\n\n     exclusion of the eligibility criteria of net worth and managerial experience for the\n\n     purpose of a renewal application is because the freedom of press cannot be\n\n     restricted on grounds other than stipulations under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution.\n\n     Thus, Paragraph 10. 4 of the Uplinking Guidelines as modified by the ‘permission\n\n     letter’ indicates that MHA could deny security clearance on the grounds of national\n\n     security and public order. Thus, according to the Uplinking and Downlinking\n\n     guidelines, security clearance from MHA is one of the conditions that is required to\n\n     be fulfilled for renewal of permission for Uplinking and Downlinking of news\n\n     channels.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_57\">\nE.

Audi Alterum Partem\n\n     encapsulates the rule of fair hearing. Nemo Judex In Causa Sua encapsulates the\n\n     rule against bias, that is, no person should be a judge of their own case. It is the\n\n     case of MBL that MIB did not comply with the principle of Audi Alterum Partem\n\n     because the reasons for the denial of security clearance and the material relevant\n\n     to the decision of revocation were not disclosed. This, it is argued, infringes upon\n\n     the right of MBL to a fair hearing. On the other hand, MIB contends that it was not\n\n     required to comply with the principles of natural justice since the denial of security\n\n     clearance is on a matter involving national security, which is an established\n\n     exception to the application of the principles of natural justice.\n\n\n33   There are three important considerations that have to be answered in the context:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">         (i)      Whether the non-disclosure of reasons and relevant material for the\n\n                  decision to deny security clearance infringes upon the right to a fair\n\n                  hearing, that is protected under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">21;</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107483\" id=\"span_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1285195\" id=\"span_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"884513\" id=\"span_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732220\" id=\"span_40\">15 See <a href=\"/doc/1732220/\" id=\"a_22\">State of Andhra Pradesh v.

The House of Lords set aside\n\n     the decision on the ground that the non-disclosure of allegations was violative of\n\n     the principles of natural justice. The Court cautioned that there was an extreme\n\n     danger in proceeding without putting forth the allegations against him because the\n\n     veracity of the allegations could never be tested:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_65\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">                     “As an example of the extreme danger of proceeding in\n                     this way, it must be observed that, as one of the two\n                     clinching matters which seem to have influenced him, the\n                     appellant says in his affidavit: “Further, it became known”\n                     (sic) “to senior officers that the applicant and his wife had\n                     lived a ‘hippy’ type life-style at Tyddyn Mynyddig Farm,\n                     Bangor.” This had never been put to the respondent at all,\n                     and had the appellant or his deputy to whom he delegated\n                     the inquiry taken the trouble to ask the respondent about\n                     it, he would have discovered at once that this allegedly\n                     clinching allegation was palpably untrue, and simply the\n                     result of a mistaken address.

Government of Malaya 18, an Inspector of Police challenged his dismissal on\n\n     the ground that the disciplinary proceedings were not conducted in accordance\n\n     with the principles of natural justice. It was contended that he did not have\n\n     knowledge of the contents of the enquiry report that was before the adjudicating\n\n     officer. The crux of the case was whether his lack of knowledge of the contents of\n\n     the report led to a likelihood of bias – both conscious and unconscious. The Court\n\n     held that the likelihood of bias test cannot be solely used to determine the violation\n\n     of natural justice. The Court held that it is not necessary that the accused must\n\n     prove bias or prejudice. Rather, it is sufficient if the non-disclosure would lead to a\n\n     possibility of bias and prejudice since “no one who has lost a case will believe he\n\n     has been fairly treated if the other side has had access to the judge without his\n\n     knowing.” The House of Lords held that non-disclosure of information is per se\n\n     violative of the principles of fair trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\n39   Legitimacy of the decision and decision making authority: When a decision is\n\n     formed following the principles of natural justice, there is a perception that the\n\n     decision is accurate and just. It preserves the integrity of the system as the\n\n     decisions, in addition to being fair, also ‘appear’ to be fair. The perception of the\n\n     general public that the decisions appear to be fair is important in building public\n\n     confidence in institutions, which aid in securing the legitimacy of the courts and\n\n     other decision making bodies. 19\n\n\n\n\n     18 (1962) 28 MLJ 169\n     19 Mark Elliotts, Jack Beatson, Martin Mathews, Administrative Law: text and Materials (3rd ed.

The\n\n     Government of India declined to disclose its reasons for the action by relying on\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/75497/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 10(5)</a> of the Passports Act 1967 which stipulates that the reason for\n\n     impounding the passport may not be given where the passport authority is of the\n\n     opinion that the disclosure of reasons is not in the interests of the sovereignty and\n\n     integrity of India, security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country\n\n     or in the interest of general public.

In view of this\n\n     shift, the Courts are now precluded from solely assessing procedural infringements\n\n     based on whether the procedure would have prejudiced the outcome of the case. 35\n\n     Instead, the courts would have to decide if the procedure that was followed\n\n     infringed upon the right to a fair and reasonable procedure, independent of the\n\n     outcome. In compliance with this line of thought, the courts have read the principles\n\n     of natural justice into an enactment to save it from being declared unconstitutional\n\n     on     procedural        grounds. 36       Secondly,         natural      justice      principles       breathe\n\n     reasonableness into the procedure.</span> Responding to the argument that the principles\n\n     of natural justice are not static but are capable of being moulded to the\n\n     circumstances, it was held that the core of natural justice guarantees a reasonable\n\n     procedure which is a constitutional requirement entrenched in Articles 14,19 and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"859161\" id=\"span_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306907\" id=\"span_59\">21.

The\n\n     State usually claims that the limitation of the right is justified because following a\n\n     fair procedure would, inter alia, be prejudicial to public interest. What standard of\n\n     review should the courts employ to test the reasonableness of the limitation?\n\n     Rights are not absolute in a constitutional democracy. The jurisprudence that has\n\n     emanated from this Court is that rights can be limited but such a limitation must be\n\n     justified on the ground of reasonableness.</span></span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_65\">Though, only <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 19</a> of the\n\n     constitution expressly prescribes that the limitation must be reasonable, after the\n\n     judgments of this Court in RC Cooper(supra) and <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_58\">Maneka Gandhi</a> (supra) it is\n\n     conclusive that the thread of reasonableness runs through the entire chapter on\n\n     fundamental rights guiding the exercise of procedural and substantive limitations.\n\n     That leaves us to answer the question of the standard used to assess the\n\n     ‘reasonableness’ of the limitation.

After the judgment of this court in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_66\">Maneka Gandhi</a> (supra), where\n\n     this court prioritised the process (and the effect of the process) as opposed to the\n\n     outcome (and the objective of the outcome), it is sufficient if the affected party\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                               41</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART F\n\n     proves that the procedure that was followed by the adjudicating authority was not\n\n     procedurally fair and reasonable without any reference to the impact on the\n\n     outcome due to non-compliance. While doing so, it is well within the power of the\n\n     claimant to argue that multiple facets of the right to a fair trial were infringed.\n\n     However, the court while undertaking the exercise of assessing the validity of such\n\n     a claim must view violation claims from a holistic procedural perspective. This is\n\n     for the simple reason that the principles of natural justice are mouldable. The\n\n     requirement of procedural fairness “does not impose a uniform, unvarying standard\n\n     to be applied irrespective of the context, facts, and circumstances.46 Adjudicatory\n\n     bodies must be provided sufficient flexibility in deciding procedural requirements.\n\n     As observed above, a non-compliance of every facet and component of natural\n\n     justice does not render the procedure unreasonable. The claimant must prove that\n\n     the effect of non-compliance of a component of natural justice is so grave that the\n\n     core of the right to a fair trial is infringed while making an argument from a\n\n     component-facet perspective.

A reasoned order is one of the fundamental requirements of fair\n\n     administration. It holds utmost significance in ensuring fairness; scholars and\n\n\n     46 A &amp; Ors. v. The United Kingdom, Application no. 3455/05\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                          42</span>\n\f                                                                                               PART F\n\ncourts now term it as the third principle of natural justice. 47 The rule of a reasoned\n\norder serves five important purposes. Firstly, it ensures transparency and\n\naccountability. It places a check on arbitrary exercise of power. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_77\">Lord Denning\n\nobserved that in giving reasons “lies a whole difference between a judicial decision\n\nand an arbitrary one”.48 Justice Bhagwati observed in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_67\">Maneka Gandhi</a> (supra) that\n\nthe rule is “designed to secure the rule of law and the court should not be too ready\n\nto eschew it in its application to a given case.” Secondly, non-reasoned orders\n\nhave the practical effect of placing the decision out of the purview of judicial review.\n\nA non-reasoned order limits the power of the courts to exercise judicial review\n\nbecause the scope of judicial review is not limited to the final finding on law or facts\n\nbut extends to the reasons to arrive at the finding. A limitation on the right to appeal\n\nnecessarily means that the scope of judicial review is restricted. Thirdly, articulation\n\nof reasons aids in arriving at a just decision by minimalizing concerns of arbitrary\n\nstate action. 49 It introduces clarity of thought 50 and eschews irrelevant and\n\nextraneous considerations. Fourthly, it enhances the legitimacy of the institution\n\nbecause decisions will appear to be fair. There is a higher probability that the\n\nfinding through a reasoned order is just. Fifthly, reasoned orders are in furtherance\n\nof the right to information and the constitutional goal of open government. Secrecy\n\nbroods partiality, corruption and other vices that are antithetical to a governance\n\nmodel that is premised on the rule of law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1696325\" id=\"span_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"54693\" id=\"span_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1304475\" id=\"span_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508507\" id=\"span_81\">47 See SN Mukherjee v.

It is crucial to note that the freedom of press which is protected under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> has effectively been trumped without providing them with an\n\n     effective and reasonable avenue to challenge the decision. This infringes upon the\n\n     core of a right to fair hearing. The appellants have proved that the disclosure of\n\n     reasons is necessary for them to have a reasonable hearing. The reply to the show\n\n     cause notice and the writ petition challenging the validity of the revocation order\n\n     also indicate that the appellants have been constrained in a situation where they\n\n     are unable to effectively lay a challenge against the decision.\n\n\n58   MHA disclosed the material forming the opinion for denying of security clearance\n\n     solely to the High Court. The High Court instead of deciding if any other less\n\n     restrictive but equally effective means could have been employed, straight away\n\n     received the material in a sealed cover without any application of mind. It is now\n\n     an established principle of natural justice that relevant material must be disclosed\n\n     to the affected party. This rule ensures that the affected party is able to effectively\n\n     exercise their right to appeal. When the state government claims non-disclosure\n\n     on the ground of public interest under <a href=\"/doc/1958937/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 124</a> of the Evidence Act, the material\n\n     is removed from the trial itself. As opposed to this method, when relevant material\n\n     is disclosed in a sealed cover, there are two injuries that are perpetuated. First, the\n\n     documents are not available to the affected party. Second, the documents are\n\n     relied upon by the opposite party (which is most often the state) in the course of\n\n     the arguments, and the court arrives at a finding by relying on the material. In such\n\n     a case, the affected party does not have any recourse to legal remedies because\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                               44</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART F\n\n     it would be unable to (dis)prove any inferences from the material before the\n\n     adjudicating authority.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">\n59   This form of adjudication perpetuates a culture of secrecy and opaqueness, and\n\n     places the judgment beyond the reach of challenge.

It also tilts the balance\n                  of power in a litigation in favour of a dominant party which\n                  has control over information. Most often than not this is the\n                  state. A judicial order accompanied by reasons is the\n                  hallmark of the justice system.

The Single Judge does not provide any clarity on the\n\n     nature of the ‘inputs that were of a serious nature’.

The\n\n     Union of India has relied on the judgments of this Court in Ex-Armymen’s\n\n     Protection Services (supra) and Digi Cable Network (supra) to contend that the\n\n     principles of natural justice will not apply when considerations of national security\n\n     are involved. The validity of this argument has to be assessed before deciding if\n\n     the State has discharged its burden justifying that the infringements on procedural\n\n     guarantees are reasonable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">\n     G. 1 Natural justice and national security: decisions in Digi and Ex-armymen\n\n63   In Ex-Armymen’s Protection Services (supra), the appellant was granted the\n\n     business of ground handling services. Rule 92 of the Aircraft Rules 1937 stipulates\n\n     that the business shall be provided subject to security clearance. The appellant\n\n     was informed that security clearance was withdrawn on grounds of ‘national\n\n     interest’. The appellant initiated proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n\n     before the High Court of Patna. The writ petition was disposed with a direction that\n\n     the appellant should be furnished materials that were relied on by the Central\n\n     Government for withdrawal of security clearance. However, the Central\n\n     Government passed an order that the documents in the file were classified as\n\n     ‘secret’ and could not be shared with the appellant. The documents were placed in\n\n     a ‘sealed cover’ before the Single Judge of the High Court. On a perusal of the\n\n     documents, the Single Judge directed that a gist of the allegations be disclosed.\n\n     The Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal and held that the\n\n     materials could not be disclosed to the appellant in national interest. The appellant\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                              48</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART G\n\ninitiated proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 136.</a> A two-Judge Bench of this Court dismissed\n\nthe proceedings. Justice Kurian Joseph writing for the Bench observed that if\n\nconcerns of national security are involved, then the party cannot ‘insist on the strict\n\nobservance of the principles of natural justice’. It was further observed that it is\n\nopen to the Court to satisfy itself that the claim of the government that national\n\nsecurity is involved is indeed true. This Court relied on the judgments in the\n\nZamora 55 and Secretary of State for Home Department v. Rehman 56 to hold\n\nthat deference must be given to the Government’s decision when it is of the opinion\n\nthat issues of national security are involved. However, it was held that the Court\n\nmay call for records to satisfy itself that issues of national security are involved.\n\nFurther, the judgment in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister of Civil\n\nService 57 was relied on to hold that strict observance of the principles of natural\n\njustice may not be possible when national security is involved. It is important to\n\nnote that this Court did not decide on the factual considerations in the matter\n\nbecause the security clearance that was granted to the appellant had already\n\nexpired.

Relying on the judgment in Council of Civil Service\n\n     Unions (supra), it was held that the decision on the validity of deportation is not\n\n     conceded to the Secretary of the State. The Commission has to determine (i) the\n\n     factual basis for the executive’s opinion that deportation would be in the interests\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                56</span>\n\f                                                                                PART G\n\nof national security’; (ii) if the decision of the Secretary of the State was one which\n\na reasonable minister would have arrived at; and (iii) any other legal defence that\n\nwas available to the appellant. The relevant observations are extracted below:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">             54. This does not mean that the whole decision on whether\n             deportation would be in the interests of national security is\n             surrendered to the Home Secretary, so as to &quot;defeat the\n             purpose for which the Commission was set up&quot;: see the\n             Commission&#x27;s decision. It is important neither to blur nor to\n             exaggerate the area of responsibility entrusted to the\n             executive. The precise boundaries were analysed by Lord\n             Scarman, by reference to Chandler&#x27;s case in his speech\n             in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil\n             Service [1985] AC 374, 406. His analysis shows that the\n             Commission serves at least three important functions\n             which were shown to be necessary by the decision\n             in Chahal. First, the factual basis for the executive&#x27;s\n             opinion that deportation would be in the interests of\n             national security must be established by evidence. It\n             is therefore open to the Commission to say that there\n             was no factual basis for the Home Secretary&#x27;s opinion\n             that Mr Rehman was actively supporting terrorism in\n             Kashmir. In this respect the Commission&#x27;s ability to differ\n             from the Home Secretary&#x27;s evaluation may be limited, as I\n             shall explain, by considerations inherent in an appellate\n             process but not by the principle of the separation of\n             powers. The effect of the latter principle is only, subject\n             to the next point, to prevent the Commission from\n             saying that although the Home Secretary&#x27;s opinion\n             that Mr Rehman was actively supporting terrorism in\n             Kashmir had a proper factual basis, it does not accept\n             that this was contrary to the interests of national\n             security. Secondly, the Commission may reject the Home\n             Secretary&#x27;s opinion on the ground that it was &quot;one which\n             no reasonable minister advising the Crown could in the\n             circumstances reasonably have held&quot;. Thirdly, an appeal\n             to the Commission may turn upon issues which at no point\n             lie within the exclusive province of the executive. A good\n             example is the question, which arose in Chahal itself, as to\n             whether deporting someone would infringe his rights under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_79\">article 3</a> of the Convention because there was a substantial\n             risk that he would suffer torture or inhuman or degrading\n             treatment. The European jurisprudence makes it clear that\n             whether deportation is in the interests of national security\n             is irrelevant to rights under <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_80\">article 3.</a> If there is a danger of\n             torture, the Government must find some other way of\n             dealing with a threat to national security. Whether a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                57</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART G\n\n                   sufficient risk exists is a question of evaluation and\n                   prediction based on evidence. In answering such a\n                   question, the executive enjoys no constitutional\n                   prerogative.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n74   The following principles emerge from the above judgements:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">        (i)     The party affected by the decision must establish that the decision was\n\n                reached by a process that was unfair without complying with the\n\n                principles of natural justice;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">        (ii)    The State can claim that the principles of natural justice could not be\n\n                followed because issues concerning national security were involved;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">        (iii)   The Courts have to assess if the departure was justified. For this\n\n                purpose, the State must satisfy the Court that firstly, national security is\n\n                involved; and secondly, whether on the facts of the case, the\n\n                requirements of national security outweigh the duty of fairness. At this\n\n                stage, the court must make its decision based on the component of\n\n                natural justice that is sought to be abrogated; and\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">        (iv)    While satisfying itself of the national security claim, the Courts must give\n\n                due weightage to the assessment and the conclusion of the State. The\n\n                Courts cannot disagree on the broad actions that invoke national security\n\n                concerns - that is, a question of principle such as whether preparation of\n\n                terrorist activities by a citizen in a foreign country amounts a threat of\n\n                national security. However, the courts must review the assessment of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                                 58</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART G\n\n               State to the extent of determining whether it has proved through cogent\n\n               material that the actions of the aggrieved person fall within the principles\n\n               established above.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">75   The contention of the respondent that the judgment of this Court in Ex-Armymen’s\n\n     Protection Services (supra) held that the principles of natural justice shall be\n\n     excluded when concerns of national security are involved is erroneous. The\n\n     principle that was expounded in that case was that the principles of natural justice\n\n     may be excluded when on the facts of the case, national security concerns\n\n     outweigh the duty of fairness. Thus, national security is one of the few grounds on\n\n     which the right to a reasonable procedural guarantee may be restricted. The mere\n\n     involvement of issues concerning national security would not preclude the state’s\n\n     duty to act fairly. If the State discards its duty to act fairly, then it must be justified\n\n     before the court on the facts of the case. Firstly, the State must satisfy the Court\n\n     that national security concerns are involved. Secondly, the State must satisfy the\n\n     court that an abrogation of the principle(s) of natural justice is justified. These two\n\n     standards that have emerged from the jurisprudence abroad resemble the\n\n     proportionality standard. The first test resembles the legitimate aim prong, and the\n\n     second test of justification resembles the necessity and the balancing prongs.\n\n\n     G.2 Application of the proportionality standard\n\n\n76   Having held that the concerns of national security do not permit an absolute\n\n     abrogation of the principles of natural justice, we are now required to assess if the\n\n     restriction on procedural guarantees is reasonable on an application of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                                 59</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART G\n\n     proportionality standard.

The\n\n     aim must be of sufficient importance to override fundamental rights. At this stage,\n\n     the State is required to discharge the burden of proving that the action is in\n\n     furtherance of an aim that is legitimate. The State is also required to discharge the\n\n     additional burden of proving that the action is indeed in furtherance of the legitimate\n\n     aim that is contended to be served. The Union of India claims that the reasons and\n\n     the documents cannot be disclosed in the interest of national security and\n\n     confidentiality of intelligence inputs. The State at this stage is required to prove that\n\n     confidentiality and national security are legitimate aims, and that the purposes of\n\n     confidentiality and national security are served by non-disclosure.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                 60</span>\n\f                                                                                                         PART G\n\n78   At this stage, the court has to examine the threshold question whether in a\n\n     constitutional democracy, a fundamental right can be limited to realise the purpose\n\n     underlying the law or action. 59 The criteria for determining proper purpose differs\n\n     from one legal system to another. For instance, the South African Constitution\n\n     prescribes a general limitation clause which prescribes the general grounds to limit\n\n     all fundamental rights. 60 The Indian Constitution does not prescribe a general\n\n     limitations’ clause. A few of the provisions in Part III such as <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_82\">25</a> have\n\n     a specific purpose based limitation clause. This does not mean that the provisions\n\n     that do not have an express limitation clause are absolute. Other rights that do not\n\n     have an express limitation clause can be limited through an implied reading of the\n\n     provisions of the Constitution. Our constitutional jurisprudence does not accept the\n\n     theory that constitutionally protected rights live and survive in contextual isolation.\n\n     Each is linked to the other. Hence, the entire text has to evolve in meaning and\n\n     content with the canvas which bears the tapestry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">\n79   Aharon Barak argues that one of the accepted grounds of proper purpose for the\n\n     limitation of rights is public interest (or public good). 61 Though the existence of such\n\n     a purpose is never in contention, the content of public interest is unclear. Public\n\n     interest, he argues, must reflect the notions of justice and tolerance shared by the\n\n     society. The courts while identifying if the purpose is legitimate must not fall into\n\n     the den of dominant impulses but instead prioritise purposes in furtherance of\n\n     constitutional ideals and values. However, the court must necessarily be cautious\n\n\n\n     59 Aharon Barak (n 38) 247;Justice Sikri in Modern Dental (paragraph 55)\n     60 <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 26(1)</a> states that the limitation on human rights should be reasonable and justifiable in an open and\n\n     democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.\n     61 Aharon Barak (n 38 ) 289\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                          61</span>\n\f                                                                                PART G\n\n     to not cross the thin line between adjudication and policy making. Certain purposes\n\n     are absolutely antithetical to public interest in a constitutional democracy. The\n\n     Constitution, as we all know, is a living document. Its meaning and the values it\n\n     espouses develop with time. The court while determining the purpose must be\n\n     cognizant of such developments and must read the Constitution in the socio-\n\n     political context – bearing in mind both history and the prospect of societal change\n\n     at the time of interpretation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">\n80   The Constitution prescribes national security as one of the grounds which can be\n\n     used to reasonably restrict rights expressly in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 19.</a> Further,\n\n     other provisions of the Constitution prescribe a departure from principles during\n\n     emergency situations that impact national security. 62 Similarly, informational\n\n     privacy and confidentiality are now values that have been read into the\n\n     Constitution, particularly in view of the decision of a nine Judge Bench in Justice\n\n     KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra) and the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_85\">Right to Information Act</a>\n\n     2005.

MHA in response to MBL’s request for disclosure of reasons for\n\n     denial of security clearance states that the reasons cannot be disclosed because\n\n     reports from investigative agencies are “secret” in nature. MHA has made a general\n\n     claim that all reports of the investigative agencies are confidential. We are unable\n\n\n\n     62 <a href=\"/doc/1594774/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 359</a> of the Constitution\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                               62</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART G\n\n     to accept such an argument. Investigative agencies such as the CBI and IB are\n\n     required to conduct background checks on innumerable personnel and entities for\n\n     a multitude of reasons. The interaction between private individuals and the State\n\n     has increased by virtue of which the involvement of intelligence agencies has also\n\n     proliferated. The reports of the intelligence agencies are not merely fact-finding\n\n     reports. As it would be evident from the extractions of the material below, reports\n\n     of investigative agencies make observations and provide inferences on the\n\n     conduct of individuals which are then relied upon by the decision making authority.\n\n     To argue that reports of the intelligence agencies may contain confidential\n\n     information is one thing but to argue that the all such reports are confidential is\n\n     another. Such an argument is misplaced and cannot be accepted on the\n\n     touchstone of constitutional values. The reports by investigative agencies impact\n\n     decisions on the life, liberty, and profession of individuals and entities, and to give\n\n     such reports absolute immunity from disclosure is antithetical to a transparent and\n\n     accountable system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">\n     (II)   National Security\n\n82   The MHA also opined that the relevant material must not be disclosed in the\n\n     interest of national security. The issue before us is whether the court can judicially\n\n     review this inference, and if it can, the extent of such review. We must refer to the\n\n     jurisprudence on the extent of judicial review of national security claims before\n\n     assessing if the action serves the purpose of national security.\n\n\n83   It is now settled that the Courts do not resort to a hands-off approach when it is\n\n     claimed that national security implications are involved. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1491910\" id=\"span_103\">In <a href=\"/doc/1491910/\" id=\"a_87\">Manohar Lal Sharma\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                               63</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART G\n\nv. Union of India</a> 63, a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that though the extent\n\nof judicial review in matters concerning national security is limited, it does not mean\n\nthat the State gets a free pass every time the argument of national security is made.\n\nThis Court held that the State must plead on affidavit and prove that disclosure of\n\ninformation would injure national security. The court observed:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">                 “50. Of course, the Respondent-Union of India may decline\n                 to provide information when constitutional considerations\n                 exist, such as those pertaining to the security of the State,\n                 or when there is a specific immunity under a specific\n                 statute. However, it is incumbent on the State to not only\n                 specifically plead such constitutional concern or statutory\n                 immunity but they must also prove and justify the same in\n                 Court on affidavit. The Respondent-Union of India must\n                 necessarily plead and prove the facts which indicate that\n                 the information sought must be kept in secret as their\n                 divulgence would affect national security concerns. They\n                 must justify the stand that they take before a Court. The\n                 mere invocation of national security by the State does not\n                 render the Court a mute spectator.”\n\nThe issue is not whether the inference that national security concerns are involved\n\nis judicially reviewable. It is rather on the standard of proof that is required to be\n\ndischarged by the State to prove that national security concerns are involved. It is\n\nnecessary that we understand the meaning and implications of the term national\n\nsecurity before embarking on an analysis of the issue. This Court has held that it\n\nis not possible to define national security in strict terms. 64 National security has\n\nnumerous facets, a few of which are recognised under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\n\nConstitution.

It will thus appear that just as “public order” in the\n                       rulings of this Court (earlier cited) was said to comprehend\n                       disorders of less gravity than those affecting “security of\n                       State”, “law and order” also comprehends disorders of less\n                       gravity than those affecting “public order”. One has to\n                       imagine three concentric circles. Law and order\n                       represents the largest circle within which is the next\n                       circle representing public order and the smallest circle\n                       represents security of State. It is then easy to see that\n                       an act may affect law and order but not public order\n                       just as an act may affect public order but not security\n                       of the State. By using the expression “maintenance of law\n                       and order” the District Magistrate was widening his own\n                       field of action and was adding a clause to the Defence of\n                       India Rules.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">                                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n84   Thus, the expression national security does not have a fixed meaning. While courts\n\n     have attempted to conceptually distinguish national security from public order, it is\n\n     impossible (and perhaps unwise) to lay down a text-book definition of the\n\n\n\n     65 1950 SCC 436\n     66 AIR 1966 SC 740\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                                       65</span>\n\f                                                                                                        PART G\n\nexpression which can help the courts decide if the factual situation is covered within\n\nthe meaning of the phrase. The phrase derives its meaning from the context. It is\n\nnot sufficient for the State to identify its purpose in broad conceptual terms such\n\nas national security and public order. Rather, it is imperative for the State to prove\n\nthrough the submission of cogent material that non-disclosure is in the interest of\n\nnational security. It is the Court’s duty to assess if there is sufficient material for\n\nforming such an opinion. A claim cannot be made out of thin air without material\n\nbacking for such a conclusion. The Court must determine if the State makes the\n\nclaim in a bona fide manner. The Court must assess the validity of the claim of\n\npurpose by determining (i) whether there is material to conclude that the non-\n\ndisclosure of the information is in the interest of national security; and (ii) whether\n\na reasonable prudent person would arrive at the same conclusion based on the\n\nmaterial 67. The reasonable prudent person standard which is one of the lowest\n\nstandards to test the reasonableness of an action is used to test national security\n\nclaims by courts across jurisdictions because of their deferential perception\n\ntowards such claims. This is because courts recognise that the State is best placed\n\nto decide if the interest of national security would be served. The court allows due\n\ndeference to the State to form its opinion but reviews the opinion on limited grounds\n\nof whether there is nexus between the material and the conclusion. The Court\n\ncannot second-guess the judgment of the State that the purpose identified would\n\nviolate India’s national security. It is the executive wing and not the judicial wing\n\n\n\n\n67 This standard of judicial review is derived from the standard that has been laid down on the limited extent of\n\njusticiability of the aid and advice of the council of ministers to the President/Governor.

Other than\n\n     merely claiming that national security is involved, both in the affidavit that was filed\n\n     before the High Court and in the submissions before us, the Union of India made\n\n     no attempt to explain how non-disclosure would be in the interest of national\n\n     security. The Union of India has adopted this approach inspite of reiterations by\n\n     this Court that judicial review would not be excluded on a mere mention of the\n\n     phrase ‘national security’. The State is using national security as a tool to deny\n\n     citizens remedies that are provided under the law. This is not compatible with the\n\n     rule of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_141\">\n98   Security clearance was denied to MBL because of its alleged link with JEI-H, and\n\n     its alleged anti-establishment stance. To conclude that MBL is linked to JEI-H, IB\n\n     has relied on the ‘tenor’ of the articles published by dailies of MBL, and the\n\n     shareholding pattern of MBL. To conclude that JEI-H has an anti-establishment\n\n     stance, IB has solely relied upon the programmes that were broadcast by Media-\n\n     One. Some of the views that were highlighted in the IB report to conclude that MBL\n\n     has an anti-establishment stand are that (i) it portrays security forces and the\n\n     judiciary in a bad light; (ii) it highlighted the discrimination faced by minorities in the\n\n     country and contrasted it with the State’s alleged soft attitude towards the Hindus\n\n     who were involved in the destruction of Babri Masjid; and (iii) its comments on\n\n     UAPA, Armed Forces (Special Power) Act, developmental projects of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                                    75</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART G\n\n      Government,      encounter      killings,   <a href=\"/doc/949775/\" id=\"a_94\">Citizenship   (Amendment)    Act</a>,    and\n\n      CAA/NPR/NRC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">\n99    Significantly, with respect to the list of shareholders who are alleged sympathizers\n\n      of JEI-H, the file does not contain any evidence on the alleged link between the\n\n      shareholders and JEI-H. The report of IB is purely an inference drawn from\n\n      information that is already in the public domain. There is nothing ‘secretive’ about\n\n      this information to attract the ground of confidentiality. Additionally, it cannot be\n\n      argued that the purpose of national security will be served by non-disclosure\n\n      merely by alleging that MBL is involved with JEI-H which is an organisation with\n\n      alleged terrorist links. While we have held above that it would be impractical and\n\n      unwise for the courts to define the phrase national security, we also hold that\n\n      national security claims cannot be made out of thin air. There must be material\n\n      backing such an inference. The material on the file and the inference drawn from\n\n      such material have no nexus. The non-disclosure of this information would not be\n\n      in the interest of any facet of public interest, much less national security. On a\n\n      perusal of the material, no reasonable person would arrive at the conclusion that\n\n      the non-disclosure of the relevant material would be in the interest of national\n\n      security and confidentiality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">\n      G.2 (b) Suitability\n\n\n100   We proceed to apply the subsequent prongs of the proportionality standard, even\n\n      assuming that the action taken is in the interest of confidentiality and national\n\n      security. The second prong of the proportionality analysis requires the State to\n\n      assess whether the means used are rationally connected to the purpose. At this\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                  76</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART G\n\n      stage, the court is required to assess whether the means, if realised, would\n\n      increase the likelihood of protecting the interests of national security and\n\n      confidentiality. It is not necessary that the means chosen should be the only means\n\n      capable of realising the purpose of the state action. This stage of the analysis does\n\n      not prescribe an efficiency standard. It is sufficient if the means used constitute\n\n      one of the many methods by which the purpose can be realised, even if it only\n\n      partially gives effect to the purpose. 74 The Canadian Supreme Court in the case of\n\n      Oakes (supra) emphasised that the means adopted must not be “arbitrary, unfair,\n\n      or based on irrational connection”. The requirements under this prong will not be\n\n      fulfilled if the State uses constitutionally impermissible means. Though it is not\n\n      necessary that the means opted should be the ‘best possible means’, the means\n\n      must still pass the muster of the constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_144\">\n101   The Ministry of Home Affairs disclosed the relevant material solely to the court in\n\n      a sealed cover. By this method of disclosure, information that is claimed to be\n\n      confidential and in the interests of national security is sought to be protected by not\n\n      disclosing it to the public and the claimant. The means that are used may not\n\n      necessarily be the best possible means to protect the interest involved because\n\n      the sealed cover procedure permits partial disclosure as opposed to complete non-\n\n      disclosure. However, it still shares a rational connection to the purpose that is\n\n      sought to be achieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">\n102   On the other hand, the non-disclosure of even a summary of reasons for denying\n\n      security clearance does not share a rational connection with the purpose identified.\n\n\n      74 Aharon Barak (n 38) 305\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                77</span>\n\f                                                                                                        PART G\n\n      In A v.

As a part of the analysis of the least\n\n      restrictive means prong, we deem it necessary to refer to alternative procedures\n\n      that are available in India and in other countries that substantially aid in realising\n\n      the objective and which protects the interest of the affected party in a better\n\n      fashion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">      (I)      Totten claim: non-justiciability of the issue\n\n106   The Courts in the United States have recognised that in exceptional circumstances,\n\n      the court must act in the interest of national security to prevent the disclosure of\n\n      state secrets.

One of the grounds of the\n\n      appellant’s challenge to the deportation order was that although the Home\n\n      Secretary’s decision is amenable to judicial review, the effective determination of\n\n      his risk to national security was made by an internal Home Office advisory panel\n\n      on the basis of material which was not disclosed to him.

The Court referred to the procedure that is applied in\n\n      Canada under the Canadian Immigration Act 1976 under which a Federal Court\n\n      judge holds an in - camera hearing of all the evidence; the applicant is provided a\n\n      statement summarising the case that is made against them; and the confidential\n\n      material is then disclosed to a security-cleared counsel who assists the court in\n\n      testing the strength of the State’s case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">\n108   In response to the judgment in Chahal (supra), the Government of the United\n\n      Kingdom passed the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 which\n\n      paved the way for security-cleared Special Advocates to represent the applicant in\n\n      substantive proceedings that take place behind closed doors.

However, each of the\n\n      alternative means have a different effect on fundamental rights because they\n\n      operate in different penumbrae. In a public interest immunity claim, the material is\n\n      not relied on by both the parties and the court in the course of the substantive\n\n      hearings. The court removes the material from the proceeding, and the public\n\n      interest immunity proceedings are conducted in a closed setting. In a Totten claim,\n\n      the court at the admission stage itself declares that the issue is non-justiciable if\n\n      the material on state secrets may have to be disclosed. The court does not\n\n      undertake any balancing exercise to decide if the injury due to the disclosure of\n\n      information is heavier than the injury due to non-disclosure. Rather, if the material\n\n      is, according to the state, related to a state secret then the applicant is deprived of\n\n      the remedy of judicial review. Under the closed material procedure, non-\n\n      disclosable material is relied on by the State and referred to by the court in the\n\n      course of the substantive hearing. The special advocate would represent the\n\n      interests of the affected party. However, the special advocate would be precluded\n\n      from discussing the evidence with the affected party. It must be noted that special\n\n      advocates are involved even in public interest immunity claims to represent the\n\n      affected party in the closed hearing to decide if the relevant information must be\n\n      disclosed. Thus, the special advocates’ system is a means to counterbalance the\n\n      effect of the limitation on procedural guarantees of the affected party.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                84</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART G\n\n113   When these three means identified are placed on the continuum, public interest\n\n      immunity claims would be placed on one end as they have the least impact on\n\n      rights as opposed to the Totten claim which would be placed on the other end. The\n\n      closed material procedure would be placed in the middle because Special\n\n      Advocates are used in an attempt to counterbalance the infringement of procedural\n\n      rights. The difference in the impact must be determined firstly, based on the stage\n\n      of consideration. The public interest immunity claim and closed material procedure\n\n      claim are raised at the discovery stage. As opposed to this procedure, under the\n\n      Totten claim, the claim is held to be non-justiciable at the pleading stage if the State\n\n      contends that the proceedings are premised on state secrets. Secondly, the Totten\n\n      claim limits the fundamental right to judicial review since claims based on state\n\n      secrets are rendered non-justiciable. However, in a public interest immunity claim,\n\n      whichever way the claim is decided, the parties will have equality of arms because\n\n      the same evidence will have to be relied on in the course of the proceedings. It\n\n      may be argued that the removal of the documents from the proceedings would, in\n\n      effect, render the claim non-justiciable if the documents that are sought to be not\n\n      disclosed are closely intertwined with the cause of action. We have addressed this\n\n      argument in detail in Section J of this judgment. Similar to the sealed cover\n\n      procedure, in the closed material proceeding, the non-disclosable evidence that is\n\n      used in a substantive hearing of the case is excluded for the claimant. However,\n\n      the closed material procedure in the United Kingdom does not exist independent\n\n      of special advocates who aim to provide sufficient counterbalance. The closed\n\n      material proceeding is more injurious to the claimant’s procedural guarantees as\n\n      compared to public interest immunity because non-disclosed material is used by\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                                85</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART G\n\nthe State to defend its actions and relied on by the court to arrive at a conclusion.\n\nAs compared to this, in public interest immunity, the non-disclosable evidence is\n\ncompletely removed at the discovery stage. Though the Special Advocates aim to\n\nprovide sufficient counterbalance, the process still causes prejudice to the claimant\n\nsince the security cleared advocates are not permitted to interact with the claimant\n\nabout the evidence. The (in)sufficiency of the counterbalance provided by special\n\nadvocates largely depends on the facts of the case, particularly on the material that\n\nis sought to be unrevealed and revealed. The interrelationship between the\n\nallegations, open material, and closed material was aptly addressed by the ECHR\n\nin A (supra). The relevant observations are extracted below:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">             “ 220. The Court further considers that the special advocate\n             could perform an important role in counterbalancing the lack of\n             full disclosure and the lack of a full, open, adversarial hearing\n             by testing the evidence and putting arguments on behalf of the\n             detainee during the closed hearings. However, the special\n             advocate could not perform this function in any useful way\n             unless the detainee was provided with sufficient information\n             about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective\n             instructions to the special advocate. While this question must\n             be decided on a case-by-case basis, the Court observes\n             generally that, where the evidence was to a large extent\n             disclosed and the open material played the predominant role in\n             the determination, it could not be said that the applicant was\n             denied an opportunity effectively to challenge the\n             reasonableness of the Secretary of State&#x27;s belief and\n             suspicions about him. In other cases, even where all or most of\n             the underlying evidence remained undisclosed, if the\n             allegations contained in the open material were sufficiently\n             specific, it should have been possible for the applicant to\n             provide his representatives and the special advocate with\n             information with which to refute them, if such information\n             existed, without his having to know the detail or sources of the\n             evidence which formed the basis of the allegations. An\n             example would be the allegation made against several of\n             the applicants that they had attended a terrorist training\n             camp at a stated location between stated dates; given the\n             precise nature of the allegation, it would have been\n             possible for the applicant to provide the special advocate\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                              86</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART G\n\n                   with exonerating evidence, for example of an alibi or of an\n                   alternative explanation for his presence there, sufficient to\n                   permit the advocate effectively to challenge the allegation.\n                   Where, however, the open material consisted purely of general\n                   assertions and SIAC&#x27;s decision to uphold the certification and\n                   maintain the detention was based solely or to a decisive\n                   degree on closed material, the procedural requirements of\n                   <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 5</a> § 4 would not be satisfied.”\n\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n      In view of the above discussion, public interest immunity is perhaps a less\n\n      restrictive means of the alternative methods listed above.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">114   Having held that there are alternative means which further the purpose of non-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">      disclosure at the disposal of the State, we shall now undertake a comparative\n\n      analysis of the impact of the alternative means identified (public interest immunity)\n\n      and the means used (sealed cover) on fundamental rights. In section F, we have\n\n      already discussed the effect of the disclosure of material solely to the courts in a\n\n      sealed cover on the fundamental precepts of procedural fairness and how the\n\n      courts do not employ any safeguards to protect the procedural rights of the\n\n      applicant. In the next section, we will be discussing the jurisprudence on public\n\n      interest immunity. A reference of how the courts have dealt with public interest\n\n      immunity claims will allow us to analyse if the courts have employed sufficient\n\n      procedural guarantees to protect the rights of the applicant or have on the contrary\n\n      been deferential to the claims of the State. This analysis is important because it is\n\n      only a comparative analysis of how the courts would deal with sealed cover and\n\n      public interest immunity claims that would allow us to evaluate their relative effect\n\n      on procedural rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                  87</span>\n\f                                                                                        PART H\n\nH.

Justice\n\n      Gajendragadkar, writing the majority opinion of the Constitution Bench, laid down\n\n      the scope of review of a claim of non-disclosure. <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_108\">Sections 164</a> and <a href=\"/doc/208203/\" id=\"a_109\">123</a> were\n\n      construed to deal with the conflict between public interest and private interest.

A valid claim for privilege made\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/208203/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 123</a> proceeds on the basis of the theory that\n                      the production of the document in question would cause\n                      injury to public interest, and that, where a conflict arises\n                      between public interest and private interest, the latter must\n                      yield to the former.

If the document relates to state affairs,\n\n      then the decision of the head of the department on whether the disclosure would\n\n      violate public interest would be final.

The divergence was one of principle. While the majority pitted the issues on\n\n      the lines of public interest and private interest, Justice Subba Rao held that both\n\n      disclosure and non-disclosure further public interest. It was held that the disclosure\n\n      of information aids the party in the proceedings but beyond that the disclosure also\n\n      serves the purpose of administration of justice. On the extent of scrutiny by the\n\n      Court, Justice Subba Rao observed that the Court has the power to disallow a\n\n      claim of privilege. For this purpose, the court has to determine if the public interest\n\n      in disclosure outweighs the public interest in non-disclosure. It was observed that\n\n      the Courts should ordinarily accept the affidavit of the Minister claiming privilege\n\n      but when the court has reason to disbelieve the claim, it can examine the Minister.\n\n      Justice Subba Rao agreed with the opinion of Justice Gajendragadkar that the\n\n      court shall not inspect the document that is sought to be protected from disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                89</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART H\n\n117   In <a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_112\">State of Uttar Pradesh v.

The learned Judge classified such documents as\n\n      those belonging to noxious classes and others. It was held that if the documents\n\n      belong to noxious classes (such as national security), it would per se infringe on\n\n      public interest. For other documents that do not belong to noxious classes, the\n\n      courts ought to survey aspects of public interest involved in both disclosure and\n\n      non-disclosure to assess the relative claims of the different aspects of public\n\n      interest:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">                      “71.

When a question of national security is involved, the\n                      Court may not be the proper forum to weigh the matter and\n                      that is the reason why a minister&#x27;s certificate is taken as\n                      conclusive. “Those who are responsible for the national\n                      security must be the sole judges of what national security\n                      requires.” [ Lord Parker of Weddington in The Zamora,\n                      (1916) 2 AC 77, 107] As the Executive is solely responsible\n                      for national security including foreign relations, no other\n                      organ could judge so well of such matters.

The doctrine of class\n                   immunity is therefore no longer impregnable; it does not\n                   any more deny judicial scrutiny; it is no more a mantra to\n                   which the court pays obeisance. Whenever class immunity\n                   is claimed in respect of a document, the court has to weigh\n                   in the scales the one aspect of public interest which\n                   requires that the document should not be disclosed\n                   against the other that the court in performing its functions\n                   should not be denied access to relevant documents and\n                   decide which way the balance lies. And this exercise has\n                   to be performed in the context of the democratic ideal of\n                   an open Government.”\n\n\n\n119   Justice Bhagwati further observed that the non-appointment of a Judge for an\n\n      additional term, which was under challenge in this case, could only be challenged\n\n      on the ground that there was no full and effective consultation between the three\n\n      constitutional functionaries, or that the decision was mala fide. Hence, the\n\n      correspondence that is sought is the only documentary evidence that would aid in\n\n      establishing the claim. On the other hand, the non-disclosure would have the effect\n\n      of ensuring the dismissal of the writ petition. Moreover, it was held that other than\n\n      the impact of non-disclosure on the applicant’s case, it would also affect the wider\n\n      constitutional principles of independence of the judiciary if the appointment process\n\n      is insulated from public view. Further, when the transfer of a High Court Judge is\n\n      challenged, the burden to prove that the transfer was not mala fide is on the Union\n\n      of India.

Cammell Laird 94. The House of Lords in this case\n\n      gave precedence to form over substance while assessing a public interest\n\n      immunity claim for non-disclosure. Lord Simon framed two issues: (i) the form in\n\n      which an objection to disclosure has to be made; and (ii) if the objection is made in\n\n      a proper form, whether the court ought to treat the objection as conclusive without\n\n      scrutiny. The Law Lord held that the claim for non-disclosure must be allowed if the\n\n      form of the objection is valid, and the interests of a private citizen may have to be\n\n      subsumed by public interest. Consequently, courts cannot examine the documents\n\n      while determining the validity of the claim because it would violate the ‘first principle\n\n      of justice that the Judge should have no dealings on the matter in hand with one of\n\n      the litigants save in the presence of and to the equal knowledge of the other.’ Thus,\n\n      the House of Lords did not frame the issue as a conflict between conceptions of\n\n      public interest but that of private interest and public interest. The House of Lords\n\n      established two principles for the application of public interest immunity: that the\n\n      interest of a litigant must give way to the secrecy of the government, and the\n\n      Minister has the sole power to decide if the document ought to be withheld.\n\n\n123   The House of Lords altered its approach in Conway v. Rimmer 95. Lord Reid\n\n      observed that that impact of non-disclosure must not be viewed through the narrow\n\n      lens of private interest and it is public interest in the administration of justice that is\n\n      injured due to non-disclosure of documents. The House of Lords established three\n\n\n      94 [1942] AC 624\n      95 [1968] AC 910\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                                  96</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART H\n\n      principles of seminal importance. Firstly, the power to decide if evidence has to be\n\n      withheld from the court resides with the court and not the executive. Secondly, the\n\n      court while exercising this power must balance the potential harm to the public\n\n      interest due to disclosure with the court’s inability to administer justice. The Court\n\n      while determining the later harm must assess the effect of non-disclosure on\n\n      ascertaining the ‘true facts’ and on the wider principle of public confidence in the\n\n      court system. Thirdly, the court is entitled to inspect, in private, the material on\n\n      which immunity is claimed. On scrutinising the material, the court has to determine\n\n      if non-disclosure is necessary due to public interest, and not merely advantageous\n\n      to the functioning of public service. Lord Hudson held that the Court in its scrutiny\n\n      must discard the generalities of classes and must weigh the injuries to the public\n\n      ‘of a denial of justice on the one side and, on the other, a revelation of governmental\n\n      documents which were never intended to be made public and which might be\n\n      inhibited by an unlikely possibility of disclosure.’ The conflict of the claims of public\n\n      interest must be determined based on the importance of the documents sought to\n\n      be withheld in the case before the court (a question of outcome), and whether the\n\n      non-disclosure would result in a ‘complete’ or ‘partial’ denial of justice (a question\n\n      of process and outcome).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\">\n124   In Reg v.

In this case, an Ethiopian national who was a former\n\n      resident of the United Kingdom was held by the authorities of the United States in\n\n      a detention facility in Cuba where he was alleged to have been treated inhumanly.\n\n      He sought the disclosure of the information in the possession of the United\n\n      Kingdom Government which may have supported his defence that the confessions\n\n      he made while in detention were inadmissible.

In the course of the\n\n      judgment, the reports by the United States Government to the United Kingdom\n\n      security and intelligence services were summarised in seven paragraphs. These\n\n      seven paragraphs were sought to be redacted by the Court by claiming public\n\n      interest immunity. It was contended that the United States Government would re-\n\n      evaluate its intelligence sharing relationship with the United Kingdom if the\n\n      paragraphs were published, which would in turn prejudice the national security of\n\n      the United Kingdom.

In the specific context of the case, it was observed that the\n\n      disclosure would further public discourse on torture and inhuman treatment. Due\n\n      weightage was given to the affidavit filed. The Court scrutinised the reasons in the\n\n      affidavit and concluded that the assessment of public injury was made in good\n\n      faith. This conclusion was arrived at based on the public statements that were\n\n      made by members at the highest level of the United States Government. Applying\n\n      the facts to the ‘alternate means test’, the court observed that the paragraphs that\n\n      were sought to be redacted did not disclose all the information but the redacted\n\n      portions of the information; and that it would not be possible to further redact the\n\n      information without engendering national security and violating the constitutional\n\n      principles of open justice. While answering this test, the court looked at whether\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                                99</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART H\n\n      the interest of both the litigant and the State could be secured by means other than\n\n      the full disclosure of information. While applying the balancing test, the court held\n\n      that the democratic principles which the disclosure of information serves can be\n\n      protected by information that has already been placed in the public forum.\n\n\n      H. 3 United States\n\n127   Judicial decisions in the United States have recognised that in exceptional\n\n      circumstances, the court must act in the interest of national security to prevent the\n\n      disclosure of state secrets. One example of the application of this principle is the\n\n      Reynolds privilege. Reynolds privilege is an evidentiary principle where the\n\n      successful assertion of the privilege will remove the privileged evidence from\n\n      litigation. The test propounded in Reynolds is “if there is reasonable danger that\n\n      compulsion of evidence will expose….matters which, in the interest of national\n\n      security, should not be divulged.” The privileged evidence is excluded from the\n\n      case which may incidentally also result in the dismissal of the claims 98.\n\n\n128   Unlike the standard in the United Kingdom, even the ‘most compelling necessity’\n\n      in disclosure cannot overcome the claim of privilege if the court is satisfied that\n\n      state secrets are at stake. Ordinarily, the evidence is excluded unlike a Totten bar\n\n      where the issue is declared non-justiciable, if the information relates to a class of\n\n      protected evidence. However, in some cases, the application of ‘privilege may\n\n      require dismissal of the action and at this point, the Reynolds privilege converges\n\n      with the Totten bar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">\n\n\n      98 United States v.

If the information relates to the protected class, the\n\n      claim is allowed irrespective of the effect of non-disclosure on the case and broader\n\n      constitutional principles; and thirdly, the burden of proof is on the affected party to\n\n      prove its case with non-privileged evidence and not on the State to prove the\n\n      necessity of non-disclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">\n      H. 4 Canada\n\n131   Similar to the Courts in the United Kingdom, the Canadian jurisprudence on non-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">      disclosure of information has shifted away from ‘class’ scrutiny towards the scrutiny\n\n\n\n\n      99 614 F 3d 1070 (9th Cir 2010) (United States)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                                        101</span>\n\f                                                                                         PART H\n\n      of individual documents. 100 The consistent view of the Canadian Courts has been\n\n      that the documents maybe withheld only ‘for the proper functioning of the executive\n\n      branch and not to facilitate its improper conduct’. 101\n\n\n132   Section 38 of the Canada Evidence Act 1985 stipulates the conditions for\n\n      disclosure of information that is sought to be protected.

However, this\n\n                 position has undergone a sea-change. It is now a settled position of law\n\n                 that courts possess the power to assess the validity of public interest\n\n                 immunity claims. The extent of such power is the bone of contention;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">         (ii)    The extent of scrutiny of public interest immunity claims by the courts\n\n                 hinges on four primary factors: (a) the identification of the injury that is\n\n                 caused due to non-disclosure of information; (b) the extent of\n\n                 permissibility of class claims; (c) the burden of proof; and (d) evidentiary\n\n                 requirement to prove the claim;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">         (iii)   The identification of injury due to non-disclosure and the assessment of\n\n                 the ground for non-disclosure impacts the court’s standard of\n\n                 assessment of the permissibility of class claims, the burden of proof and\n\n                 the evidentiary requirement. The standard of scrutiny is higher when the\n\n                 effect of non-disclosure of information is not identified based on a narrow\n\n                 reference to the facts before the court but on its wider implications to\n\n                 democratic governance and rule of law;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">         (iv)    The courts in India, the United Kingdom, and Canada have held that the\n\n                 non-disclosure of relevant material affects public interest, and the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                               104</span>\n\f                                                                         PART H\n\n       interests of the party seeking disclosure. The non-disclosure of\n\n       information injures the principle of open government which is one of the\n\n       basic premises of a democracy. It denies the citizens an opportunity to\n\n       initiate a discussion or question the functioning of the government.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">       However, the Courts in the United States have been deferential to the\n\n       claim of non-disclosure, particularly on the ground of national security so\n\n       much so that the court does not undertake a balancing exercise between\n\n       the claims of disclosure and non-disclosure. This is also because the\n\n       courts in the United States give prominence to the objective of non-\n\n       disclosure as opposed to its effect;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_209\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">(v)    The standard laid down in India (in SP Gupta), United Kingdom, and\n\n       Canada on the assessment of PII claims is similar to the extent that the\n\n       impact of non-disclosure on broader principles of constitutional\n\n       governance is also considered;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_211\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_212\">(vi)   In Canada, the party seeking production is required to prove relevancy\n\n       of the material sought after the PII claim is made by the state. The\n\n       inclusion of the relevancy test as one of the tests imposes a heightened\n\n       burden of proof than what is required otherwise. This is because the court\n\n       is at that stage aware that the state is contesting the production on\n\n       grounds of national security. Such claims are always met with a\n\n       deferential tone by the courts. Secondly, and most importantly, this leads\n\n       to an integration of the discovery stages and the objection stages. This\n\n       integration is problematic because the considerations of the court at the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                     105</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART H\n\n                  discovery stage and objection stage are distinct. The party seeking\n\n                  discovery of documents must prima facie prove the relevance of the\n\n                  document to the proceedings. Once the party discharges this burden,\n\n                  and the court orders disclosure, the state may object to disclosure on the\n\n                  ground that it would injure public interest. At this stage, the burden is\n\n                  wholly on the state to prove injury to public interest. After the objection is\n\n                  raised, the relevancy of the disclosure must only be weighed at the\n\n                  balancing stage. Identifying the relevancy of the document even before\n\n                  the state is required to discharge the burden of proving public interest\n\n                  introduces a fundamental misconception in the application of public\n\n                  interest immunity which is an exception to the production of documents.\n\n                  Furthermore, at an elementary level, it would be impossible to prove the\n\n                  relevancy of the document to the proceedings without the party having\n\n                  viewed it; and\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">          (vii)   Once the injury due to disclosure is proved, the Courts in the UK and\n\n                  Canada follow the structured proportionality test to balance the\n\n                  conflicting claims of public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_214\">\n134   According to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_130\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> 1908, a party to a proceeding may file an\n\n      application for discovery to secure knowledge of information that the other party\n\n      holds.

It\n\n      must be noted that <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_133\">Order XI Rule 13 CPC</a> stipulates that the form of discovery may\n\n      be changed if circumstances require. The purpose of referring to the provisions <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_134\">of\n\n      the CPC</a> on discovery, inspection, and production is to elucidate and expand upon\n\n      the principle that guides these provisions. That is, while a party seeks discovery of\n\n      documents that are in the possession of the other party, it is not necessary to prove\n\n      that disclosure of the documents would be relevant to the outcome of the\n\n      proceedings. Such a consideration does not arise at the stage of discovery. It is\n\n      only justified that the burden of proof lies entirely on the party objecting disclosure\n\n      to prove injury to public interest, and to justify the claim of public interest immunity.\n\n      It is of utmost importance that the burden that is placed on the party seeking\n\n      production at the discovery stage is not conflated with the burden placed on the\n\n      party opposing such discovery at the stage of objection to the discovery.\n\n\n136   The Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/32442561/\" id=\"a_135\">SP Gupta</a> (supra) has held that if the state\n\n      objects to disclosure of documents on the ground of public interest immunity, then\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                   108</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART I\n\n      the Courts shall assess the validity of the objection based on the reasons in the\n\n      affidavit. The Court has the power to inspect the document if on a perusal of the\n\n      affidavit, the Court has ‘any doubt on whether the document relates to the affairs\n\n      of the state’. 109 It is therefore, of abundant importance that the affidavit stipulating\n\n      the reasons of the non-disclosure (along with the grounds) is made in sufficient\n\n      detail so as to enable the courts to assess the claim of PII.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"32442561\" id=\"span_169\">This Court in <a href=\"/doc/32442561/\" id=\"a_136\">SP Gupta</a>\n\n      (supra) has observed that the claim has to be made by the minister who is the\n\n      political head of the department concerned or, failing him, by the secretary of the\n\n      department. The claim should always be made in the form of an affidavit. The\n\n      extent of information required to be placed in the affidavit to enable the government\n\n      to discharge the onus of justification is based on the standard of scrutiny that the\n\n      Court applies to assess public interest immunity claims.\n\n\nI.    Proportionality standard to test public interest immunity claims\n\n137   The substance of a public interest immunity claim is to seek an exception to the\n\n      compliance of principles of natural justice.

This claim by its very nature\n\n        infringes upon the right to a fair trial or hearing that flows from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 21</a>\n\n        of the Constitution. The role of the courts while assessing the validity of\n\n        the claim of public interest immunity is restricted to determining if the\n\n        infringement of the right that is protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n        Constitution is reasonable;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"32442561\" id=\"span_171\">(ii)    Secondly, though the Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/32442561/\" id=\"a_139\">SP Gupta</a>\n\n        (supra) did not use the standard of structured proportionality as it exists\n\n        in the present form to assess the claim of PII, the standard that was laid\n\n        down resembled the sub-facets of the proportionality standard as the\n\n        focus was on: (i) effect and not the purpose of non-disclosure; and (ii)\n\n        balancing the effects of disclosure and non-disclosure (both on facts and\n\n        principle). This Court shifted the focus away from the claim based on\n\n        ‘class of documents’ and towards the impact of non-disclosure of\n\n        individual material.</span> These two principles are important components of the\n\n        standard of structured proportionality that was <a href=\"/doc/32442561/\" id=\"a_140\">laid down by</a> this Court in\n\n        Justice KS Puttaswamy (9J) (supra);\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_219\">(iii)   The proportionality standard in addition to introducing a culture of\n\n        justification by prescribing a standard four step test that must be satisfied\n\n        also provides sufficient flexibility within each step for the courts to apply\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">                                       110</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART I\n\n                the jurisprudence that has already been evolved by the courts on the\n\n                subject matter; and\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">         (iv)   Lastly, PII claim is founded on common law doctrine.

The jurisprudence that has emanated from other\n\n                common law countries on this subject has a persuasive value. The courts\n\n                in both the United Kingdom and Canada use the proportionality standard\n\n                to assess the validity of a PII claim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">\n139   The structured proportionality standard used by the courts to test the infringement\n\n      of fundamental rights has to be remodelled along the lines of the jurisprudence on\n\n      public interest immunity, if need be.

Public interest immunity or sealed cover: the less restrictive means\n\n143   The court must follow the structured proportionality standard, modified on the\n\n      basis of the content of <a href=\"/doc/1958937/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 124</a> of the Evidence Act, to assess claims of public\n\n      interest immunity. Under the structured proportionality standard, the court places\n\n      the burden of proof on the party opposing disclosure of documents to prove the\n\n      claim of public interest in non-disclosure. The proportionality test prescribes a strict\n\n      standard to test the reasonableness of an action. As opposed to the structured\n\n      standard of proportionality which must be used by the court to assess public\n\n      interest immunity claims, the exercise of power by courts to secure material in a\n\n      sealed cover has rather been ad-hoc and extemporaneous.\n\n\n144   <a href=\"/doc/1537130/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 145</a> of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to make rules\n\n      for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. In pursuance of its power\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1537130/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 145</a>, the Supreme Court Rules 1966 110 were notified. These Rules\n\n      did not contain any provision on disclosure of documents to the court in a sealed\n\n      cover. The 1966 Rules were substituted by the Supreme Court of India Rules 2013.\n\n      Order XIII Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules 2013 stipulates that a party to a\n\n      proceeding in the Supreme Court shall be entitled to apply for and receive certified\n\n\n      110 “1966 Rules”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                                113</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART J\n\n      copies of all pleadings, judgments, decrees or orders, documents and deposition\n\n      of witnesses made or exhibited in the proceeding.

The rule states that\n\n      documents that fall within any of the above clauses can be disclosed only with the\n\n      permission of the court or the Chief Justice. Order XIII Rule 7 is extracted below\n\n      for reference:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_226\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">                    “7. Notwithstanding anything contained in this order, no\n                    party or person shall be entitled as of right to receive\n                    copies of or extracts from any minutes, letter or document\n                    of any confidential nature or any paper sent, filed or\n                    produced, which the Chief Justice or the Court directs to\n                    keep in a sealed cover or considers to be of confidential\n                    nature or the publication of which is considered to be not\n                    in the interest of the public, except under and in\n                    accordance with an order made by the Chief Justice or by\n                    the Court.”\n\n145   The power of the court to receive material relevant to a proceeding in a sealed\n\n      cover is read from Order XIII Rule 7. Unlike the closed material procedure in the\n\n      United Kingdom and Canada, the sealed cover procedure is not a creation of the\n\n      legislature but of the courts. In fact, Rule 7 while prescribing the power of the court\n\n      to receive material in a sealed cover also recognises non-disclosure on the ground\n\n      of public interest immunity. The provision does not stipulate any guidelines for the\n\n      exercise of power by the court to secure material in a sealed cover. However, the\n\n      Rule as a whole indicates that the court may exercise its power to secure material\n\n      in a sealed cover if the material is confidential or the disclosure of which would\n\n      injure public interest. As discussed above, public interest immunity claims also\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                                   114</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART J\n\n      seek to address the same harms. It was not intended that the sealed cover\n\n      procedure shall replace public interest immunity proceedings which constitute an\n\n      established method for dealing with claims of confidentiality. The sealed cover\n\n      procedure cannot be introduced to cover harms that could not have been remedied\n\n      by public interest immunity proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">146   In both the sealed cover procedure and public interest immunity claims, the\n\n      documents that are sought to be withheld from disclosure are not revealed to the\n\n      counsel for the applicant. The proceedings, in effect, are conducted ex-parte where\n\n      the counsel for the party claiming disclosure is precluded from accessing a part of\n\n      the record in the proceedings. However, one crucial difference between the sealed\n\n      cover procedure and public interest immunity claims is that in the former, the court\n\n      relies on the material that is disclosed in a sealed cover in the course of the\n\n      proceedings, as opposed to the latter where the documents are completely\n\n      removed from the proceedings and both the parties and the adjudicator cannot rely\n\n      on such material. Sealed cover procedures violate both principles of natural justice\n\n      and open justice. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23865972\" id=\"span_179\">In <a href=\"/doc/23865972/\" id=\"a_159\">Al Rawi v. The Security Service</a> 111, the Supreme Court of the\n\n      United Kingdom recognised that the closed material procedure causes a greater\n\n      degree of harm as compared to the public interest immunity. As held above, the\n\n      closed material procedure is similar to the sealed cover procedure in as much as\n\n      relevant material that is not disclosed to the applicant is used in the course of\n\n      substantive hearings.</span> In that case, the issue before the Court was whether the\n\n      court has the power to order a closed material procedure for the whole or a part of\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">      111 (2011) UKSC 34\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                              115</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART J\n\n      the trial.

The\n\n      Supreme Court of the United Kingdom observed that a closed material procedure,\n\n      unlike the law relating to public interest immunity, departs from the principles of\n\n      both open justice and natural justice. Lord Dyson in his opinion observed as\n\n      follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">                   “41.

If documents are\n                   disclosed as a result of the process, they are available to\n                   both parties and to the court. If they are not disclosed, they\n                   are available neither to the other parties nor to the court.\n                   Both parties are entitled to full participation in all aspects\n                   of the litigation.

First,\n\n      it may lead to the dismissal of the proceedings instituted by the claimant, rendering\n\n      the issue non-justiciable. Second, it may render the defendant (in this case, the\n\n      State) defenceless. The court must also take into account these considerations\n\n      while deciding if a public interest immunity claim is a less restrictive means. Thus,\n\n      at the second stage, the enquiry turns into whether the information excluded on a\n\n      successful PII claim can be fairly removed from the proceeding.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">148   The report by the New Zealand Law Commission on National Security Information\n\n      in Proceedings provides a two-step procedure for dealing with sensitive\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                                    116</span>\n\f                                                                                                    PART J\n\ninformation. 112 The first consideration is whether the information should be\n\ndisclosed to the party on a balance of considerations. The second consideration is\n\nwhether the information can be fairly excluded from the proceedings. The\n\nCommission recommended that the court should opt for the closed material\n\nproceedings only if the material is ‘sufficiently relevant to the proceedings that it\n\nwould be in the interest of justice to use a closed procedure rather than to exclude\n\nthe information and proceed without it.” That is, the court concludes that national\n\nsecurity considerations are so high that they trump over the relevancy of the\n\ndocument in proceedings but the information cannot be fairly excluded from the\n\nproceedings because it would cause one of the two injuries recognised above. The\n\nCommission recommends that it would be in the interest of justice to follow the\n\nclosed proceedings to obviate such unfairness. The report recommended that the\n\nclosed material procedure was to be used in addition to the public interest immunity\n\nprocedure to protect the interest of justice. The report of the Law Commission of\n\nNew Zealand also recognised that though the option of a closed procedure would\n\nbe available to the State, it would be difficult for the State to prove that this would\n\nbe in the interests of justice because it seeks to withhold information from the\n\nclaimant and use it against them.

In other words, the case of\n\n      the State was that the court has the power to substitute a closed material procedure\n\n      for public interest immunity exercise in exceptional circumstances. While the Court\n\n      unanimously agreed that the courts cannot substitute a public interest immunity\n\n      procedure with the closed material procedure, the judges disagreed on whether a\n\n      closed material procedure can be used in addition, and not in alternative, to the\n\n      public interest immunity procedure.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">\n150   Lord Dyson in his opinion held that the court does not have the power to direct\n\n      closed material procedure in addition to public interest immunity claim because: (i)\n\n      closed material procedure is the antithesis of public interest immunity procedure.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                                   118</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART J\n\n      There is no equality of arms in closed material procedure; (ii) the party in\n\n      possession of the document possesses sole knowledge of whether the document\n\n      would be beneficial in their case.

It is\n                   precisely because of this that the right to know the\n                   case that one’s opponent makes and to have the\n                   opportunity to challenge it occupies such a central\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">                                                   119</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART J\n\n                   place in the concept of a fair trial.

The peril that such a\n                   procedure presents to the fair trial of contentious\n                   litigation is both obvious and undeniable.”\n\n                                                   (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_233\">152   Lord Kerr further observed that the State faces a healthy dilemma with public\n\n      interest immunity claims since it will want to produce as much material as it can to\n\n      defend its claim and would not resort to public interest immunity claims comfortably\n\n      because if their claim is allowed, then the material will be removed from the\n\n      proceedings itself. The learned Judge observed that it would be tempting for the\n\n      State to seek a closed material procedure claiming that all the documents when\n\n      disclosed would injure national security.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23865972\" id=\"span_186\">153   Lord Mance (with whom Lord Hale agreed) and Lord Clarke held that the court has\n\n      the power to order a closed material procedure in certain circumstances after the\n\n      public interest immunity claim is decided. However, they disagreed on what those\n\n      certain circumstances would be. In Lord Mance’s view, after the public interest\n\n      immunity claim is allowed, the court may order a closed material procedure if the\n\n      material is in the defendant’s possession and the claimant consents for such a\n\n      procedure to avoid their claim from being struck out. In Lord Clarke’s view, after\n\n      the public interest immunity process has been completed, the parties should\n\n      consider their respective positions and make representations to the judge who may\n\n      order a closed material procedure depending on the facts of the case.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                                                120</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART J\n\n154   The recommendations of the Law Commission of New Zealand and the opinions\n\n      of Lord Clarke and Lord Mance in <a href=\"/doc/23865972/\" id=\"a_161\">Al Rawi</a> (supra) introduce closed material\n\n      proceedings as an additional step after the completion of public interest immunity\n\n      proceedings. The court in a closed material procedure, similar to the sealed cover\n\n      process, relies on the material that the claimant is not privy to while disposing the\n\n      proceedings. The closed material proceedings are sought to be introduced to\n\n      counterbalance the injustice(s) caused on the conclusion of the public interest\n\n      immunity proceedings.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23865972\" id=\"span_188\">155   The claimant would be jumping into a pit of fire with their eyes closed even if they\n\n      consent to a sealed cover procedure. As Lord Kerr remarked in <a href=\"/doc/23865972/\" id=\"a_162\">Al Rawi</a> (supra),\n\n      the claim that closed material procedure would provide a fairer outcome is\n\n      premised on the assumption that the adjudicator is impartial. However, beyond this\n\n      assumption, it must be recognised that the court could be misled by the material\n\n      that is not subject to inspection and examination. This would lead a situation where\n\n      the court renders an unfair judgment and such an unfair decision would not be\n\n      amenable to both judicial review and public criticism on merits.\n\n\n156   While it cannot be denied that allowing a public interest immunity claim may cause\n\n      some degree of injury to the procedural guarantees of the claimant and the\n\n      defendant, a sealed cover procedure will not ensure a fairer proceeding. The\n\n      purpose of public interest immunity proceedings would become redundant if the\n\n      defendant is provided the option of requesting a closed material procedure after\n\n      the conclusion of public interest immunity proceedings, which the defendant\n\n      makes, is allowed. Rather, we are of the opinion that the effect of public interest\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                              121</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART J\n\n      immunity proceedings of removing the evidence completely from the proceedings\n\n      would persuade the State in making restricted claims of public interest immunity.\n\n      Further, as Lord Dyson remarked, the procedure would be inherently\n\n      disadvantageous to the claimant because they are unaware of the contents of the\n\n      document.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">\n157   It may be argued that the removal of the documents from the proceedings would\n\n      render the proceedings non-justiciable if the documents that are sought to be\n\n      protected are so closely intertwined with the cause of action. Though the argument\n\n      holds merit on a cursory glance, it does not hold water when delved into deeper.\n\n      As observed above, one of the relevant considerations for the court in the\n\n      balancing stage of adjudicating the public interest immunity claim is whether the\n\n      non-disclosure of the material would render the issue non-justiciable. The court\n\n      while analysing the relevancy of the material and the potential non-justiciability of\n\n      the issue due to non-disclosure may direct that the material should be disclosed.\n\n      The purpose of the balancing prong is to weigh in the conflicting claims and effects\n\n      of such claims. Even if the disclosure would conceivably injure public interest, the\n\n      courts may still dismiss the claim of public interest immunity if the non-disclosure\n\n      would render the issue non-justiciable, and on the facts of the case it is decided\n\n      that the injury due to non-disclosure overweighs the injury due to disclosure.\n\n\n158   The courts could adopt the course of action of redacting the confidential portions\n\n      of the document and providing a summary of the contents of the document instead\n\n      of opting for the sealed cover procedure to fairly exclude the document from the\n\n      proceedings on a successful public interest immunity claim. Both the parties can\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                              122</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART J\n\n      then only be permitted to refer to the redacted version of the document or the\n\n      summary in the proceeding. In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion\n\n      that public interest immunity proceeding is a less restrictive means to deal with\n\n      non-disclosure on the grounds of public interest and confidentiality. This leaves the\n\n      final issue to be answered: if public interest immunity is a less restrictive means,\n\n      then whether the procedure of sealed cover can be used at all, and if so, in what\n\n      circumstances would it be permissible for the court to exercise its power to secure\n\n      evidence in a sealed cover. While it would be beyond the scope of this judgment\n\n      to lay down the possible situations when the sealed cover procedure can be used,\n\n      it is sufficient to state that if the purpose could be realised effectively by public\n\n      interest immunity proceedings or any other less restrictive means, then the sealed\n\n      cover procedure should not be adopted. The court should undertake an analysis\n\n      of the possible procedural modalities that could be used to realise the purpose,\n\n      and the means that are less restrictive of the procedural guarantees must be\n\n      adopted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_237\">\n159   In view of the observations above, we are of the opinion that the respondents by\n\n      not providing a reasoned order denying the renewal of license, not disclosing the\n\n      relevant material, and by disclosing the material only to the court in a sealed cover\n\n      have violated the appellant’s right to a fair hearing protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_163\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n      Constitution.

Thus, notwithstanding\n\n      the conclusion that we have reached above setting aside the order of the MIB dated\n\n      31 January 2022 and the judgment of the High Court dated 2 March 2022 on\n\n      procedural grounds, we will proceed to decide the substantive challenge to the\n\n      order denying renewal of permission on the ground of denial of security clearance\n\n      by the MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">\n161   In 2010, MBL applied for permission to uplink and downlink the news and current\n\n      affairs television channel, ‘Media One’. MHA sought reports from IB and CBI for\n\n      granting security clearance. CBI remarked that there was nothing adverse on\n\n      record against MBL. IB reported that MBL shares a close association with\n\n      ‘Madhyamam Daily’, and that the tenor of the articles carried out by Madhyamam\n\n      Daily are adverse. To substantiate its conclusion on the adverse tenor of the\n\n      articles, IB referred to reports of Madhyamam Daily on the alleged discrimination\n\n      against Muslims in India and the allegedly soft attitude taken against “Hindu\n\n      fundamentalists responsible for bomb blasts as opposed to the view taken against\n\n      Muslim fundamentalists”. MHA considered the report and concluded that the\n\n      remarks were not strong enough to deny permission on security grounds, thereby\n\n      granting security clearance to MBL.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_239\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                             124</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART K\n\n162   Between 2014-2019, similar reports were submitted by IB when security clearance\n\n      was sought for other proposals of MBL. IB made adverse remarks on MBL’s main\n\n      source of income which was alleged to be from JEI-H sympathizers, and its anti-\n\n      establishment stance. To substantiate its conclusion that MBL has been taking an\n\n      anti-establishment stance, references were made to its reports on UAPA, Armed\n\n      Forces (Special Powers) Act, development projects of the Government, encounter\n\n      killings, <a href=\"/doc/949775/\" id=\"a_164\">Citizenship (Amendment) Act</a>, NRC, NPR, the Indian Judiciary’s alleged\n\n      “double standards in terrorism cases”, and the alleged portrayal of security forces\n\n      in a bad light. MHA denied security clearance based on the IB reports. We are\n\n      required to decide if these reasons provide a justifiable ground for the denial of\n\n      security clearance, and consequently, restricting MBL’s right to the freedom of\n\n      press under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_240\">\n163   The freedom of the press which is protected as a component of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> can\n\n      only be restricted on the grounds stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution.

The position laid down by this court is\n\n      that all violations of fundamental rights have to be tested on the standard of\n\n      proportionality. The court under <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_170\">Article 13</a> of the Constitution has the power to\n\n      declare ‘laws’ that violate fundamental rights to be void. For the purpose of the\n\n      provision, ‘law’ includes administrative action. The position of law that\n\n      administrative action infringing fundamental freedoms has to be tested on the\n\n      proportionality standard has been established by this court in its earlier\n\n      judgments. 113 Thus, the action of the MIB denying renewal of permission will be\n\n      judicially reviewed based on the proportionality standard.\n\n\n165   The first test of the proportionality standard as laid down by this Court in Modern\n\n      Dental (supra) requires the court to assess if the measure restricting the right has\n\n      a legitimate goal. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_171\">Article 19</a>, unlike other provisions of Part III of the Constitution,\n\n      prescribes the purposes for which the rights recognised can be reasonably\n\n      restricted. Thus, the purpose of the state action that is challenged must necessarily\n\n      be traceable to the grounds stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 19(2)</a> to test if the freedom of press\n\n      has been reasonably restricted. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107483\" id=\"span_194\">Security clearance was denied on the basis of two\n\n      grounds: the alleged anti-establishment stand of MBL, and the alleged link of MBL\n\n      with JEI-H.\n\n\n\n\n      113 Om Kumar v.

The effect is that\n\n                   the courts have recognised that there is an inherent value in securing\n\n                   compliance with the principles of natural justice independent of the\n\n                   outcome of the case.

The power of courts to\n\n           secure material in a sealed cover when contradistinguished with the\n\n           scope of assessment of public interest immunity claims is rather\n\n           unguided and ad-hoc. The standard of review that is used by the\n\n           courts in public interest immunity claims and the lack of such a\n\n           standard in sealed cover proceedings to protect procedural\n\n           safeguards indicates that public interest immunity claims constitute\n\n           less restrictive means. Additionally, while public interest immunity\n\n           claims conceivably impact the principles of natural justice, sealed\n\n           cover proceedings infringe the principles natural justice and open\n\n           justice;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_249\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_250\">        (h) The courts could take the course of redacting confidential portions of\n\n           the document and providing a summary of the contents of the\n\n           document to fairly exclude materials after a successful public interest\n\n           immunity claim; and\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_251\">(iii)   The challenge to the order of MIB is allowed on substantive grounds.

It is only the Court and the party seeking non-disclosure of\n\n      the material who are privy to the public interest immunity proceedings. The court\n\n      has a duty to consider factors such as the relevance of the material to the case of\n\n      the applicant while undertaking the proportionality standard to test the public\n\n      interest immunity claim. However, the applicant who is unrepresented in the\n\n      proceedings would be effectively impaired. While there may be material on serious\n\n      concerns of national security which cannot be disclosed; the constitutional principle\n\n      of procedural guarantees is equally important and it cannot be turned into a dead\n\n      letter. As the highest constitutional court, it is our responsibility to balance these\n\n      two considerations when they are in conflict. To safeguard the claimant against a\n\n      potential injury to procedural guarantees in public interest immunity proceedings,\n\n      we have recognised a power in the court to appoint an amicus curiae. The\n\n      appointment of an amicus curiae will balance concerns of confidentiality with the\n\n      need to preserve public confidence in the objectivity of the justice delivery process.\n\n\n172   The amicus curiae appointed by the Court shall be given access to the materials\n\n      sought to be withheld by the State. The amicus curiae shall be allowed to interact\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                                               132</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART L\n\n      with the applicant and their counsel before the proceedings to ascertain their case\n\n      to enable them to make effective submissions on the necessity of disclosure.\n\n      However, the amicus curiae shall not interact with the applicant or their counsel\n\n      after the public interest immunity proceeding has begun and the counsel has\n\n      viewed the document sought to be withheld. The amicus curiae shall to the best of\n\n      their ability represent the interests of the applicant. The amicus curiae would be\n\n      bound by oath to not disclose or discuss the material with any other person,\n\n      including the applicant or their counsel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_253\">\n173   <a href=\"/doc/1537130/\" id=\"a_181\">Article 145</a> of the Constitution stipulates that all judgments of the Supreme Court\n\n      shall only be delivered in open court. Though public interest immunity proceedings\n\n      will take place in a closed setting, the Court is required to pass a reasoned order\n\n      for allowing or dismissing the claim in open court. We are cognizant of the objection\n\n      that may be raised that an order justifying the reasons for allowing the claim would\n\n      have to inevitably disclose information on the very material that it seeks to protect.\n\n      The Court in such cases is still required to provide a reasoned order on the\n\n      principles that it had considered and applied, even if the material that is sought to\n\n      not be disclosed is redacted from the reasoned order. However, the redacted\n\n      material from the reasoned order shall be preserved in the court records which may\n\n      be accessed by the courts in the future, if the need arises.\n\n\n174   The Civil Appeals are accordingly allowed. MIB shall now proceed to issue renewal\n\n      permissions in terms of this judgment within four weeks and all other authorities\n\n      shall co-operate in issuing necessary approvals.
