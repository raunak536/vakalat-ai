As a result of said forcible sexual intercourse, the\n     petitioner is carrying pregnancy, which she wants to abort, as the said\n     pregnancy is causing her anguish and she does not want to have a child\n     born out of a person who has ravished her without her consent and has\n     subjected her to humility and embarrassment before the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">2.

In the present setting this means\n                that the Court must undertake a careful inquiry of the\n                medical opinion on the feasibility of the pregnancy as\n                well as social circumstances faced by the victim. It is\n                important to note that the Court&#x27;s decision should be\n                guided by the interests of the victim alone and not\n                those of the other stakeholders such as guardians or the\n                society in general. It is evident that the woman in\n                question will need care and assistance which will in\n                turn entail some costs. However, that cannot be a\n                ground for denying the exercise of reproductive rights.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125724114\" id=\"span_6\">6.

The condition of the\n                foetus is not compatible with life. The medical\n                evidence clearly suggests that there is no point in\n                allowing the pregnancy to run its full course since the\n                foetus would not be able to survive outside the uterus\n                without a skull.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                7.
