Police Station Gangoh, District Saharanpur.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2. An F.I.R. has been lodged on 2nd September,2006 by one Safdar, the respondent No. 4 herein saying that Afzal alias Mohd. Afzal, kidnapped Km. Nausheeda, on 8th August,2006, who is allegedly about 15 years of age.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3. In the writ petition, the concerned girl Nausheeda is the petitioner No. 1 when the accused Afzal is the petitioner No. 2 along with others. The writ petition is supported by the affidavit of Nausheeda herself describing her age is 22 years. The writ petition is supported by various annexures including annexure 3 which is very relevant for the purpose of due consideration. Such annexure is a certificate of the concerned Chief Medical Officer (hereinafter called as C.M.O.) Saharanpur dated 22nd September, 2006 on the basis of the order dated 18th September, 2006 of the Additional Disitrict Magistrate, Administration, Saharanpur. It is stated therein that the girl was present for examination. The examination was done. According to her own statement the age is 22 years. On the physical appearance the C.M.O. certified that her age is about 20/22 years.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">4. A Division Bench consisting of (Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice R.C. Deepak and Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice V.D. Chaturvedi) were divided in entertaining the writ petition.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">5.  R.C. Deepak, J. was pleased to pass the following interim order:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">In my opinion without expressing anything on the merit of the case, it is fit and proper in the interest of justice and equity both that the investigation into the case crime No. 257 of 2006 under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_12\">366</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1672685/\" id=\"a_13\">352</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_14\">504</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_15\">506</a> IPC at Police Station Gangoh, District Saharanpur shall go on, but the arrest of the petitioners No. 2 to 5 (Afzal @ Mohd.Afzal, Imran, Gulshana @ Gullo and Sabra) shall not be effected by the investigating agency till the date fixed, provided they cooperate with the investigation. The order is passed accordingly.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Let a counter affidavit be filed by the investigating officer within three weeks. Notice be issued to respondent No. 4 to file counter affidavit within the period indicated above.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">The case shall appear on list on 1st November, 2006.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">6. In the process of delivering judgment  R.C. Deepak, J. relied upon the following judgments:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">   Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. AIR 1975 SC 1375  Govind v. State of M.P.   P.U.C.L. v. Union of India 2002 (1) J.I.C. 937  Shamsher Aalam alias Sheru v. State of U.P. 1994 (31) ACC 431  Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. \n \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7. On the other hand  V.D. Chaturvedi, J. felt as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1101322\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1133533\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1025500\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"254621\" id=\"span_4\">In view of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s verdict given in AIR 1957 529 (Paragraphs 5 &amp; 6)  Sohan Lal v. Union of India  (Paragraph <a href=\"/doc/254621/\" id=\"a_16\">17)  Mahant Moti Das v. S.P. Sahi and Ors. (Paragraph</a> <a href=\"/doc/1025500/\" id=\"a_17\">7)  Union of India and Ors. v.

Delhi Municipal Corporation and Ors. the High</a> Court in writ jurisdiction cannot enter into the field of investigating the facts and cannot adjudicate such questions of disputed facts which require the investigation and the evidence. The questions of facts which invite the investigation or enquiry or probe cannot be decided in the writ jurisdiction.</span></span></span></span> \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8. His Lordship further held that &quot;the adjudication of such facts would also be an interference in the investigation of the offence.&quot;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9. Ultimately it was held that the writ petition is not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed\n in limine without issuing Rule-Nisi.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">10. In coming to conclusion  V.D. Chaturvedi, J. made the following observations:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">I am further of the opinion that the consent expressed by the victim Km. Nausheeda either in the affidavit or elsewhere, while she was in the custody of the accused of Crime No. 257 of 2006, fails to inspire the confidence that the alleged consent was free from fraud, coercion, misrepresentation, under influence or threat etc. At this juncture such consent cannot be termed more than a spurious consent.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Petitioner Km. Nausheeda is undisputedly in the custody of the petitioner Afzal. So long as she lives in his custody, her continuous sexual exploitation by at least Afzal cannot be prevented. If after the trial of Crime No. 257 of 2006, she is found minor or that she was induced or enticed by Afzal and others to go with them or that her consent was not a free consent, her loss, as a result of such sexual exploitation would be an irreparable and the biggest loss, which a unmarried girl of her age may suffer in her life. She is a living person and not a case property. Her welfare and future is in peril. Only suitable order may save her future and protect her welfare.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">Km. Nausheeda, being the victim of a case under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_21\">366</a> IPC is the prime witness of Crime No. 257/2006. Her custody with the accused of such offence would enable them to win over the prime witness before her statement in the investigation and in the trial. Thus the fairness of the investigation and the trial is in jeopardy. It may defeat the ends of justice. For the maintenance of the administration of justice and to avert the defeat of the ends of justice, it is therefore, necessary that she be kept out of the clutches of the accused of case Crime No. 257 of 2006. It is the high time to pass a suitable and appropriate order regarding her custody or for her living in a healthy atmosphere under the care and watch of a responsible person. Her natural guardian is best person to whom her custody may be restored. I do order that her custody be restored forthwith to her natural guardian.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11. In any event while  R.C. Deepak, J. was pleased to place the matter before Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice to refer the matter to the third Judge, keeping the writ petition pending.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"> V.D. Chaturvedi, J. was pleased to send the matter to the office to place the matter before the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice to constitute a full Bench for determination of the above mentioned points.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">12. Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice constituted this Bench and forwarded the matter.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">13. The following questions are formulated by the Bench after hearing the matter on 15th December, 2006:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(a) What would be the wisdom of the writ Court under this jurisdiction?\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(b) What relief could be granted by the writ Court?\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">14. We have carefully considered the submission of learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners and learned Government Advocate. Both the petitioners i.e., boy and girl, who were directed to be personally present before this Court were identified by learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners. Irrespective of the consideration of issue, this Court was pleased to direct the petitioners on 15th December, 2006 to get the age proof of both the boy and girl through an ossification test. The part of the order dated 15th December, 2006 is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"> For the purpose of getting age proof, both the girl and the boy (petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 herein) will be produced before the C.J.M., Allahabad along with their photographs, which will be attested by the subordinate officer of the C.J.M. concerned and then the petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 will be sent to the Chief Medical Officer, Allahabad along with the attested photographs for their identification and completion of ossification test, report of which will be produced before the Officer of the Court within a period of one month by the learned Government Advocate. If any copy of the same is available with the petitioners, they can also file the same. \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">15. From the ossification test report it appears that as per the test dated 20th December, 2006 the age of the boy is 22 years when the age of the girl is 19 years. The F.I.R. was lodged on 2nd September, 2006 describing 8th August,2006 is the date of the incident. Hence it appears to this Court that on the fateful day both the petitioners were major.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">16. Now we have to consider the questions formulated by this Court. According to us, both the questions, are intermingled with each other. The relief will be dependable upon the wisdom: Therefore, the entire endeavour of this Bench is confined to the question of wisdom of the writ Court. It is well known that the writ Court does not interfere with the investigation or inquiry or adjudicate the disputed question of fact. At the same time it is also to be remembered that writ Court possess unfettered right under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India particularly in respect of fundamental right of the people. Therefore even within our self restraint we should not forgetful about proper utilization of the tool at least for the sake of fundamental right, principles of natural justice, question of jurisdiction and ultra vires. A boy and a girl are at liberty to choose their own bride and bridegroom. This is neither a crime nor disrespect to the elders even within the social framework of the country. No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. The question of crime, if any, arises when one is underaged that too eloped by any one by force for the purpose of marriage or for some other reason. Even where a consent of the minor is not backed by the parents&#x27; consent, cannot be said to be a consent in the eye of law. Therefore, court has to visualise whether the consent is valid or not. In the process the age is not verified. Otherwise there would be likelihood of infringement of fundamental right.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">17. It is a border line issue. Therefore the writ Court can not dismiss the writ petition  in limine. After the age verification, if the Court found that either of them is underaged, then Court may not interfere with the matter of investigation under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_25\">366</a> of Indian Penal Code (hereinafter called as <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">I.P.C</a>). Normally age is to be verified from the school certificate or from an authentic document. If those are not available or one is illiterate, it would be proper for the Court to send him/her to medical expert for the purpose of determination of age scientifically. If such determination supports the requisite age, then the right of marriage of such persons cannot be said to be a criminal offence. As soon as it is proved by the medical test that both the boy and girl are not minors, their willingness of the marriage to each other cannot be ignored. If it is ignored, the same will be interference with the fundamental right of such persons.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">18. Independently it is to be remembered that in our State we have no provision for granting anticipatory bail as yet. Since such protection is not available there is no other alternative for a person aggrieved but to invoke the writ jurisdiction on the two fold grounds i.e., (i) to quash the F.I.R. and (ii) not to arrest the petitioner/s. Even thereafter very seldom, we pass an order quashing the F.I.R. We normally pass order not to arrest a person for a limited period on the prima facie case within our self restraint. We normally refuse to pass any order in respect of heinous crimes. But where the question of social object is involved, we can not give an absolute go bye. Therefore, we cannot construe that the writ petition is not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed  in limine without the test of bonafide.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">19. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1364215\" id=\"span_5\">In 2006 (56) ACC 234  Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/1364215/\" id=\"a_27\">Lata Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr.</a> on a different factual background but on the question of marriage, the Supreme Court held:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> ...this is a free and democratic country, and once a personbecomes a major, he or she can marry whosoever he/she likes.... \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">20. A Division Bench of our High Court in 2006 (54) ACC 235  Nitin Agnihotri v. State of U.P. and Ors. considered the question of girl&#x27;s willingness and ultimately directed the police authorities to ensure peaceful living of the married couple and prevented the parent of the family members of the husband from giving any threat.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">21. A Division Bench of this High Court in which one of us (Amitava Lala, J.) is member, as reported in 2006 (55) ACC 424   Sayed Sadab Hasan and Anr. v. State of U.P. and Ors. it was held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"> ...once the girl become major she has her own right to stay as per her will and she cannot be protected even by sending her to any home i.e. Nari Niketan etc. \n \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">22. The guardian&#x27;s prayer as a complainant to allow to stay with her was also refused by the Court.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">23. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"277485\" id=\"span_6\">In 2002 (<a href=\"/doc/277485/\" id=\"a_28\">1) JIC 937 (All)  Shamsher Alam @ Sheru and Anr. v. State of U.P. and Ors.</a> this High Court even quashed the F.I.R. in view of the moot issue that when a person become major and is not under the guardianship of her father and she had left the paternal home and married one out of her own free-will, the allegations in the F.I.R. that the boy has threatened to kidnap the girl, does not prima facie constitute the committal of offence.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">24. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_7\">In   People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_29\">Civil Liberties (PUCL) v. Union of India and Anr.</a>  the Supreme Court held right to privacy is a part of the right to &#x27;life&#x27; and &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Although the different facts were involved therein but interference with the right to privacy was a major issue. The right to privacy by itself has not been identified under the Constitution. As a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the each case.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">25. In the well celebrated judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 1994 (31) ACC 431  Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. it was held that the existence of the power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite another.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">26. We are considering the cause of justification, which can not be equated with probability. When there is a cause of justification, the matter cannot be dismissed  in limine but will be disposed of either way after justification of the cause. Probability means you think that it is very  likely to happen when justification means an  acceptable position with reason/s or explanation for it. Justification means judge the cause and pass the order when dismissal  in limine means there is no necessity of judging the case at all.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">27. Hence in totality we respectfully disagree with view of  Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice V.D. Chaturvedi, and we respectfully agree with the view of  Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice R.C. Deepak, but with a rider&#x27; that in case of any doubt or in absence of any valid age proof document, persons concerned will be directed to go for ossification being the valid scientific test to determine the age and pass order on such determination.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">28. With the above view, the reference is formally treated to be disposed of. The matter is directed to be sent back to the appropriate Division Bench for the purpose of final adjudication.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">V.C. Misra, J.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">29.
