The case before us is a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 32</a> of \n\n\nthe   Constitution,   and   has   been   filed   on   behalf   of   the   petitioner   Aruna \n\n\nRamachandra Shanbaug by one Ms. Pinki Virani of Mumbai, claiming to be \n\n\na next friend.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">3.      It is stated in the writ petition that the petitioner Aruna Ramachandra \n\n\nShanbaug   was   a   staff   Nurse   working   in   King   Edward   Memorial   Hospital, \n\n\nParel, Mumbai. On the evening of 27th November, 1973 she was attacked by \n\n\na   sweeper   in   the   hospital   who   wrapped   a   dog   chain   around   her   neck   and \n\n\nyanked   her   back   with   it.   He   tried   to   rape   her   but   finding   that   she   was \n\n\nmenstruating,   he   sodomized   her.   To   immobilize   her   during   this   act   he \n\n\ntwisted the chain around her neck. The next day on 28th November, 1973 at \n\n\n7.45 a.m. a cleaner  found her lying on the floor with blood all over in an \n\n\nunconscious   condition.   It   is   alleged   that   due   to   strangulation   by   the   dog \n\n\nchain the supply of oxygen to the brain stopped and the brain got damaged. \n\n\nIt is alleged that the Neurologist in the Hospital found that she had plantars&#x27; \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                                               3</span>\n\n\n\nextensor,   which   indicates   damage   to   the   cortex   or   some   other   part   of   the \n\n\nbrain. She also had brain stem contusion injury with associated cervical cord \n\n\ninjury. It is alleged at page 11 of the petition that 36 years have expired since \n\n\nthe   incident   and   now   Aruna   Ramachandra   Shanbaug   is   about   60   years   of \n\n\nage. She is featherweight, and her brittle bones could break if her hand or leg \n\n\nare   awkwardly   caught,   even   accidentally,   under   her   lighter   body.   She   has \n\n\nstopped menstruating and her skin is now like papier mache&#x27; stretched over a \n\n\nskeleton. She is prone to bed sores. Her wrists are twisted inwards. Her teeth \n\n\nhad decayed causing her immense pain. She can only be given mashed food, \n\n\non which she survives. It is alleged that Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug is in \n\n\na persistent negetative state (p.v.s.) and virtually a dead person and has no \n\n\nstate of awareness, and her brain is virtually dead. She can neither see, nor \n\n\nhear anything nor can she  express herself  or communicate,  in any  manner \n\n\nwhatsoever.   Mashed   food   is   put   in   her   mouth,   she   is   not   able   to   chew   or \n\n\ntaste any food. She is not even aware that food has been put in her mouth. \n\n\nShe is not able to swallow any liquid food, which shows that the food goes \n\n\ndown on its own and not because of any effort on her part. The process of \n\n\ndigestion goes on in this way as the mashed food passes through her system. \n\n\nHowever,   Aruna   is   virtually   a   skeleton.   Her   excreta   and   the   urine   is \n\n\ndischarged on the bed itself. Once in a while she is cleaned up but in a short \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                                            4</span>\n\n\n\nwhile again she goes back into the same sub-human condition.   Judged by \n\n\nany parameter, Aruna cannot be said to be a living person and it is only on \n\n\naccount of mashed food which is put into her mouth that there is a facade of \n\n\nlife which is totally devoid of any human element. It is alleged that there is \n\n\nnot   the   slightest   possibility   of   any   improvement   in   her   condition   and   her \n\n\nbody lies on the bed in the KEM Hospital, Mumbai like a dead animal, and \n\n\nthis has been the position for the last 36 years. The prayer of the petitioner is \n\n\nthat   the   respondents   be   directed   to   stop   feeding   Aruna,   and   let   her   die \n\n\npeacefully. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_4\">4.      We could have dismissed this petition on the short ground that under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India (unlike <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a>) the petitioner has \n\n\nto   prove   violation   of   a   fundamental   right,   and   it   has   been   held   by   the \n\n\nConstitution   Bench   decision   of   this   Court   in  <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_4\">Gian   Kaur    vs.    State   of \n\n\nPunjab</a>, 1996(2) SCC 648 (vide paragraphs 22 and 23) that the right to life \n\n\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution does not include the right to die. \n\n\nHence   the   petitioner   has   not   shown   violation   of   any   of   her   fundamental \n\n\nrights.     However,   in   view   of   the   importance   of   the   issues   involved   we \n\n\ndecided to go deeper into the merits of the case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n  \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                                             5</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">5.

A counter affidavit was earlier filed on behalf \n\n\nof the respondent nos.3 and 4, the Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the \n\n\nDean, KEM Hospital by Dr. Amar Ramaji Pazare, Professor and Head in the \n\n\nsaid hospital, stating in paragraph 6 that Aruna accepts the food in normal \n\n\ncourse   and   responds   by   facial   expressions.   She   responds   to   commands \n\n\nintermittently  by  making sounds.  She  makes  sounds  when  she  has  to pass \n\n\nstool and urine which the nursing staff identifies and attends to by leading \n\n\nher to the toilet.

According to the history from them, though she is not \n\nvery   much   aware   of   herself   and   her   surrounding,   she \n\nsomehow   recognizes   the   presence   of   people   around   her \n\nand expresses her like or dislike by making certain types \n\nof   vocal   sounds   and   by   waving   her   hands   in   certain \n\nmanners.  She appears to be happy and smiles  when she \n\nreceives   her   favorite   food   items   like   fish   and   chicken \n\nsoup.

After   that,   her   oral \n\nintake   reduced   and   a   feeding   tube   (Ryle&#x27;s   tube)   was \n\npassed   into   her   stomach   via   her   nose.

Court   observed   that   there   were   many   technical   terms \n\nwhich a non-medical man would find it difficult to understand, and requested us to submit a \n\nsupplementary   report   in   which   the   meaning   of   these   technical   terms   in   the   report   is   also \n\nexplained. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">\nWe have therefore prepared this Supplement to include a glossary of technical terms used in \n\nthe   earlier   Report,   and   also   to   clarify   some   of   the   terminology   related   to   brain   damage. \n\nFinally, we have given our opinion in the case of Aruna Shanbaug. \n\n\n\n\nTerminology \n\n\nThe   words   coma,   brain   death   and   vegetative   state   are   often   used   in   common   language   to \n\ndescribe severe brain damage. However, in medical terminology, these  terms have specific \n\nmeaning and significance. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_74\">\n\n\nBrain death \n\n\nA state of prolonged irreversible  cessation of all brain activity,  including lower brain stem \n\nfunction with the complete absence of voluntary movements, responses to stimuli, brain stem \n\nreflexes, and spontaneous respirations. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">\nExplanation:   This   is   the   most   severe   form   of   brain   damage.   The   patient   is   unconscious, \n\ncompletely   unresponsive,   has   no   reflex   activity   from   centres   in   the   brain,   and   has   no \n\nbreathing   efforts   on   his   own.   However   the   heart   is   beating.   This   patient   can   only   be \n\nmaintained alive by advanced life support (breathing machine or ventilator, drugs to maintain \n\nblood pressure, etc). These patients can be legally declared dead (`brain dead&#x27;) to allow their \n\norgans to be taken for donation. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">\nAruna Shanbaug is clearly not brain dead. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\">\n\n\nComa \n\n\nPatients   in   coma   have   complete   failure   of   the   arousal   system   with   no   spontaneous   eye \n\nopening and are unable to be awakened by application of vigorous sensory stimulation. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                                                            20</span>\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation: These patients are unconscious. They cannot be awakened even by application \n\nof   a   painful   stimulus.   They   have   normal   heart   beat   and   breathing,   and   do   not   require \n\nadvanced life support to preserve life. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">\nAruna Shanbaug is clearly not in Coma. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">\nVegetative State (VS) \n\n\nThe complete absence of behavioral evidence for self or environmental awareness. There is \n\npreserved capacity for spontaneous or stimulus-induced arousal, evidenced by sleep-wake \n\ncycles. .i.e. patients are awake, but have no awareness. \n\n\nExplanation: Patients appear awake. They have normal heart beat and breathing, and do not \n\nrequire   advanced   life   support   to   preserve   life.   They   cannot   produce   a   purposeful,   co-\n\nordinated,   voluntary   response   in   a   sustained   manner,   although   they   may   have   primitive \n\nreflexive   responses   to   light,   sound,   touch   or   pain.   They   cannot   understand,   communicate, \n\nspeak, or have emotions. They are unaware of self and environment and have no interaction \n\nwith   others.   They   cannot   voluntarily   control   passing   of   urine   or   stools.   They   sleep   and \n\nawaken. As the centres in the brain controlling the heart and breathing are intact, there is no \n\nthreat to life, and patients can survive for many years with expert nursing care. The following \n\nbehaviours may be seen in the vegetative state : \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_80\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">Sleep-wake cycles with eyes closed, then open \n\n\nPatient breathes on her own \n\n\nSpontaneous blinking and roving eye movements \n\n\nProduce sounds but no words \n\n\nBrief, unsustained visual pursuit (following an object with her eyes) \n\n\nGrimacing to pain, changing facial expressions \n\n\nYawning; chewing jaw movements \n\n\nSwallowing of her own spit \n\n\nNonpurposeful limb movements; arching of back \n\n\nReflex withdrawal from painful stimuli \n\n\nBrief movements of head or eyes toward sound or movement without apparent localization or \n\nfixation \n\n\nStartles with a loud sound \n\n\nAlmost all of these features consistent with the diagnosis of permanent vegetative state were \n\npresent during the medical examination of Aruna Shanbaug. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                                                               21</span>\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimally Conscious State \n\n\nSome patients  with severe alteration in consciousness have neurologic findings that do not \n\nmeet   criteria   for   VS.

We realize that \n\nanswers to these questions are difficult, and involve several ethical, legal and social issues. \n\nOur opinion is based on medical facts and on the principles of medical ethics. We hope that \n\nthe Honourable Court will provide guidance and clarity in this matter. \n\n\nTwo of the cardinal principles of medical ethics are Patient Autonomy and Beneficiance. \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">1. Autonomy means the right to self-determination, where the informed patient has a right to \n\nchoose the manner of his treatment. To be autonomous the patient should be competent to \n\nmake decisions and choices. In the event that he is incompetent to make choices, his wishes \n\nexpressed in advance in the form of a Living Will, OR the wishes of surrogates acting on his \n\nbehalf (&#x27;substituted judgment&#x27;) are to be respected. \n\n\nThe surrogate is expected to represent what the patient may have decided had he / she been \n\ncompetent, or to act in the patient&#x27;s best interest. It is expected that a surrogate acting in the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                                                                                   25</span>\n\n\n\npatient&#x27;s best interest follows a course of action because it is best for the patient, and is not \n\ninfluenced by personal convictions, motives or other considerations. \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">2. Beneficence is acting in what is (or judged to be) in patient&#x27;s best interest. Acting in the \n\npatient&#x27;s best interest means following a course of action that is best for the patient, and is not \n\ninfluenced   by   personal   convictions,   motives   or   other   considerations.   In   some   cases,   the \n\ndoctor&#x27;s expanded goals may include allowing the natural dying process (neither hastening \n\nnor   delaying   death,   but   `letting   nature   take   its   course&#x27;),   thus   avoiding   or   reducing   the \n\nsufferings of the patient and his family, and providing emotional support. This is not to be \n\nconfused with euthanasia, which involves the doctor&#x27;s deliberate and intentional act through \n\nadministering a lethal injection to end the life of the patient. \n\n\n\n\nIn the present case under consideration \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">1.

Aruna   Ramchandra   Shanbaug   has   been \n\n       admitted   in   a   single   room   in   Ward   No.4   which   is   a   ward   of \n\n       general   internal   medicine   patients   and   she   has   been   there   for \n\n       last   37   years.     She   is   looked   after   entirely   by   doctors,   nurses \n\n       and   para-medical   staff   of   KEM   Hospital.     She   has   been   our \n\n       staff   nurse   and   the   unfortunate   tragic   incidence   has   happened \n\n       with   her   in   KEM   Hospital   and   I   must   put   on   record   that   the \n\n       entire medical, administrative, nursing and para-medical staff is \n\n       extremely  attached to her and consider her as one of us.   Her \n\n       relatives and a gentleman (her fiancee) used to visit her in the \n\n       initial period of her illness but subsequently she has been left to \n\n       the care of KEM staff.  I visit her frequently and my last visit to \n\n       her was on 22nd  February, 2011.   I give my observations as a \n\n       Clinician about Smt. Aruna Shanbaug as under :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">               b)       It   would   be   incorrect   to   say   that   Smt.   Aruna \n\n       Shanbaug is an appropriate case for Coma.  It appears that for a \n\n       crucial, critical period her brain was deprived of Oxygen supply \n\n       and   this   has   resulted   in   her   present   state   similar   to   that   of \n\n       Cerebral   Palsy   in   the   newborn   child.     It   is   a   condition   where \n\n       brain   looses   it&#x27;s   co-ordinatory,   sensory   as   well   as   motor \n\n       functions and this includes loss of speech and perception.  This \n\n       has   resulted   into   a   state   which   in   a   layman&#x27;s   words  &quot;Aruna \n\n       lives in her own world for last 37 years&quot;.   She is lying in a \n\n       bed   in   a   single   room   for   33   years.     She   has   not   been   able   to \n\n       stand or walk, nor have we attempted to do that of late because \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                                         27</span>\n\n\n\nwe   fear   that   she   is   fragile   and   would   break   her   bones   if   she \n\nfalls.   Her extremities and fingers have developed contractures \n\nand   subsequent   to   non-use;   there   is   wasting   of   her   body \n\nmuscles.     Her   eyes   are   open   and   she   blinks   frequently; \n\nhowever,   these   movements   are   not   pertaining   to   a   specific \n\npurpose or as a response to a question.   At times she  is quiet \n\nand at times she shouts or shrieks.  However, I must say that her \n\nshouts   and   shrieks   are   completely   oblivious   to   anybody&#x27;s \n\npresence in her room.  It is not true that she shouts after seeing \n\na man.  I do not think Aruna can distinguish between a man and \n\na   woman,   nor   can   she   even   distinguish   between   ordinate   and \n\ninordinate   object.     We   play   devotional   songs   rendered   by \n\nSadguru Wamanrao Pai continuously in her room and she lies \n\ndown   on   her   bed   listening   to   them.     She   expresses   her \n\ndispleasure   by   grimaces   and   shouts   if   the   tape   recorder   is \n\nswitched   off.     All   these   years   she   was   never   fed  by   tube   and \n\nwhenever   a   nurse   used   to   take   food   to   her   lips,   she   used   to \n\nswallow   it.     It   is   only   since   September   2010   she   developed \n\nMalaria and her oral  intake dropped.   In order  to take care of \n\nher   calorie   make   need,   nurses   cadre   resorted   to   naso-gastric \n\ntube   feed   and   now   she   is   used   to   NG   feeding.     However,   if \n\nsmall morsels are held near her lips, Aruna accepts them gladly. \n\nIt   appears  that  she  relishes   fish  and  occasionally   smiles   when \n\nshe   is   given   non-vegetarian   food.     However,   I   am   honest   in \n\nadmitting   that   her   smiles   are   not   purposeful   and   it   would   be \n\nimproper to interpret them as a signal of gratification.   I must \n\nput on record that in the world history of medicine there would \n\nnot   be   another   single   case   where   such   a   person   is   cared   and \n\nnurtured in bed for 33 long years and has not developed a single \n\nbed sore.  This speaks of volumes of excellence of nursing care \n\nthat KEM Nursing staff has given to her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_106\">        c)      This care is given not as a part of duty but as a part \n\nof   feeling   of  oneness.     With   every   new   batch   of   entrants,   the \n\nstudent nurses are introduced to her and they are told that she \n\nwas one of us and she continues to be one of us and then they \n\nwhole-heartedly take care of Aruna.  In my opinion, this one is \n\nfinest   example   of   love,   professionalism,   dedication   and \n\ncommitment to one of our professional colleagues who is ailing \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                                                    28</span>\n\n\n\n       and cannot support herself.  Not once, in this long sojourn of 33 \n\n       years, anybody has thought of putting  an end to her so called \n\n       vegetative   existence.     There   have   been   several   Deans   and \n\n       Doctors   of   KEM   Hospital   who   have   cared   her   in   succession. \n\n       Right from illustrious Dr. C.K. Deshpande in whose tenure the \n\n       incidence   happened   in   1973,   Dr.   G.B.   Parulkar,   Dr.   Smt. \n\n       Pragna   M.   Pai,   Dr.   R.J.   Shirahatti,   Dr.   Smt.   N.A.   Kshirsagar, \n\n       Dr. M.E. Yeolekar and now myself Dr. Sanjay N. Oak, all of us \n\n       have   visited   her   room   time   and   again   and   have   cared   for   her \n\n       and   seen   her   through   her   ups   and   downs.     The   very   idea   of \n\n       withholding   food  or  putting  her to  sleep  by  active  medication \n\n       (mercy   killing)   is   extremely   difficult   for   anybody   working   in \n\n       Seth GSMC &amp; KEM Hospital to accept and I sincerely make a \n\n       plea   to   the   Learned   Counsel   and   Hon&#x27;ble   Judges   of   Supreme \n\n       Court   of   India   that   this   should   not   be   allowed.     Aruna   has \n\n       probably crossed 60 years of life and would one day meet her \n\n       natural   end.     The   Doctors,   Nurses   and   staff   of   KEM,   are \n\n       determined   to   take   care   of   her   till   her   last   breath   by   natural \n\n       process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">               d)      I   do   not   think   it   is   proper   on   my   part   to   make   a \n\n       comment on the entire case.  However, as a clinical surgeon for \n\n       last 3 decades and as an administrator of the hospitals for last 7 \n\n       years   and   as   a   student   of   legal   system   of   India   (as   I   hold \n\n       &quot;Bachelor of Law&quot; degree from Mumbai University), I feel that \n\n       entire society has not matured  enough to accept the execution \n\n       of an Act of Euthanasia or Mercy Killing.   I fear that this may \n\n       get misused and our monitoring and deterring mechanisms may \n\n       fail to prevent those unfortunate incidences.  To me any mature \n\n       society is best judged by it&#x27;s capacity and commitment to take \n\n       care of it&#x27;s &quot;invalid&quot; ones.  They are the children of Lesser God \n\n       and in fact, developing nation as we are, we should move in a \n\n       positive manner of taking care of several unfortunate ones who \n\n       have deficiencies, disabilities and deformities.&quot;                          \n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">12.

One   retired   nurse,   Tidi \n\n\nMakwana, who used to take care of Aruna while in service, has even offered \n\n\nto continue to take care of her without any salary and without charging any \n\n\ntraveling expenses.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_111\">13.

What   they   have   done   is \n\n\nsimply marvelous.  They feed Aruna, wash her, bathe her, cut her nails, and \n\n\ngenerally   take   care   of   her,   and   they   have   been   doing   this   not   on   a   few \n\n\noccasions but day and night, year after year.  The whole country must learn \n\n\nthe meaning of dedication and sacrifice from the KEM hospital staff.

It   is   thus   obvious   that   the   KEM   hospital   staff   has   developed   an \n\n\nemotional bonding and attachment to Aruna Shanbaug, and in a sense they \n\n\nare her real family today.  Ms. Pinki Virani who claims to be the next friend \n\n\nof Aruna Shanbaug and has filed this petition on her behalf is not a relative \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                                          30</span>\n\n\n\nof Aruna Shanbaug nor can she claim to have such close emotional bonding \n\n\nwith   her   as   the   KEM   hospital   staff.

No doubt Ms. Pinki Virani \n\n\nhas written a book about Aruna Shanbaug and has visited her a few times, \n\n\nand we have great respect for her for the social causes she has espoused, but \n\n\nshe   cannot   claim  to  have   the   extent  of  attachment  or  bonding   with  Aruna \n\n\nwhich the KEM hospital staff, which has been looking after her for years, \n\n\nclaims to have.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">\n\n\nSUBMISSIONS OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"588316\" id=\"span_32\">15.

He submitted that in general in common law it is the right \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                                                                35</span>\n\n\n\nof   every   individual   to   have   the   control   of   his   own   person   free   from   all \n\n\nrestraints or interferences of others.   Every human being of adult years and \n\n\nsound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body. \n\n\nIn the case of medical treatment, for example, a surgeon who performs an \n\n\noperation without the patient&#x27;s consent commits assault or battery.   \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">23.     It   follows   as   a   corollary   that   the   patient   possesses   the   right   not   to \n\n\nconsent i.e. to refuse treatment. (In the United States this right is reinforced \n\n\nby a Constitutional right of privacy).  This is known as the principle of self-\n\n\ndetermination or informed consent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">24.     Mr.   Andhyarujina   submitted   that   the   principle   of   self-determination \n\n\napplies   when   a   patient   of   sound   mind  requires   that   life   support   should   be \n\n\ndiscontinued.  The same principle applies where a patient&#x27;s consent has been \n\n\nexpressed   at   an   earlier   date   before   he   became   unconscious   or   otherwise \n\n\nincapable   of   communicating   it   as   by   a   `living   will&#x27;   or   by   giving   written \n\n\nauthority to doctors in anticipation of his incompetent situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">        Mr.   Andhyarujina   differed   from   the   view   of   the   learned   Attorney \n\n\nGeneral   in   that   while   the   latter   opposed   even   passive   euthanasia,   Mr. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                                              36</span>\n\n\n\nAndhyarujina was in favour of passive euthanasia provided the decision to \n\n\ndiscontinue life support was taken by responsible medical practitioners.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">25.     If the doctor acts on such consent there is no question of the patient \n\n\ncommitting suicide or of the doctor having aided or abetted him in doing so. \n\n\nIt   is  simply that  the   patient,   as  he  is   entitled   to  do,  declines   to  consent  to \n\n\ntreatment which might or would have the effect of prolonging his life and \n\n\nthe   doctor   has   in   accordance   with   his   duties   complied   with   the   patient&#x27;s \n\n\nwishes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">26.     The troublesome question is what happens when the patient is in no \n\n\ncondition to be able to say whether or not he consents to discontinuance of \n\n\nthe   treatment   and   has   also   given   no   prior   indication   of   his   wishes   with \n\n\nregard  to  it as  in  the case   of  Aruna.     In  such  a  situation the  patient   being \n\n\nincompetent to express his self-determination the approach adopted in some \n\n\nof   the   American   cases   is   of   &quot;substituted   judgment&quot;   or   the   judgment   of   a \n\n\nsurrogate.     This   involves   a   detailed   inquiry   into   the   patient&#x27;s   views   and \n\n\npreferences.  The surrogate decision maker has to gather from material facts \n\n\nas   far   as   possible   the   decision   which   the   incompetent   patient   would   have \n\n\nmade if he was competent.  However, such a test is not favoured in English \n\n\nlaw in relation to incompetent adults.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                                                37</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_140\">27.     Absent   any   indication   from   a   patient   who   is   incompetent   the   test \n\n\nwhich   is   adopted   by   Courts   is   what   is   in   the  best   interest   of   the   patient \n\n\nwhose   life   is   artificially   prolonged   by   such   life   support.     This   is   not   a \n\n\nquestion whether it is in the best interest of the patient that he should die. \n\n\nThe question is whether it is in the best interest of the patient  that his life \n\n\nshould be prolonged by the continuance of the life support treatment.   This \n\n\nopinion   must   be   formed   by   a   responsible   and   competent   body   of   medical \n\n\npersons in charge of the patient.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">28.     The withdrawal of life support by the doctors is in law considered as \n\n\nan omission and not a positive step to terminate the life.  The latter would be \n\n\neuthanasia, a criminal offence under the present law in UK, USA and India.\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">29.     In   such   a   situation,   generally   the   wishes   of   the   patient&#x27;s   immediate \n\n\nfamily will be given due weight, though their views cannot be determinative \n\n\nof   the   carrying   on   of   treatment   as   they   cannot   dictate   to   responsible   and \n\n\ncompetent   doctors   what   is   in   the   best   interest   of   the   patient.     However, \n\n\nexperience   shows   that   in   most   cases   the   opinions   of   the   doctors   and   the \n\n\nimmediate relatives coincide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                                                 38</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_48\">30.

It is not the function of the Court to evaluate the situation and form \n\n\nan opinion on its own.   In England for historical reasons the parens patriae \n\n\njurisdiction   over     adult   mentally   incompetent   persons   was   abolished   by \n\n\nstatute and the Court has no power now to give its consent.

In   case   of \n\n\ndiscontinuance of artificial feeding the patient will as a result starve to death \n\n\nwith all the sufferings and pain and distress associated with such starving. \n\n\nThis is a very relevant consideration in a PVS patient like Aruna who is not \n\n\ntotally  unconscious  and   has  sensory  conditions  of  pain  etc.  unlike  Antony \n\n\nBland in  Airedale  vs.  Director MHD  (1993) 2 WLR 316 who was totally \n\n\nunconscious.  Would the doctor be able to avoid such pain or distress by use \n\n\nof sedatives etc.?     In such a condition would it not be more appropriate to \n\n\ncontinue with the nasogastric feeding but not take any other active steps to \n\n\ncombat any other illness which she may contract and which may lead to her \n\n\ndeath?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_152\">34.

Coming   now   to   the   legal   issues   in   this   case,   it   may   be   noted   that \n\n\neuthanasia is of two types : active and passive.  Active euthanasia entails the \n\n\nuse of lethal substances or forces to kill a person e.g. a lethal injection given \n\n\nto a person with terminal cancer who is in terrible agony.  Passive euthanasia \n\n\nentails   withholding   of   medical   treatment   for   continuance   of   life,   e.g. \n\n\nwithholding of antibiotics where without giving it a patient is likely to die, \n\n\nor removing the heart lung machine, from a patient in coma. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">39.    The general legal position all over the world seems  to be that while \n\n\nactive  euthanasia   is  illegal  unless  there  is  legislation   permitting   it,  passive \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                                                            42</span>\n\n\n\neuthanasia is legal even without legislation provided certain conditions and \n\n\nsafeguards are maintained. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">40.     A further categorization of euthanasia is between voluntary euthanasia \n\n\nand non voluntary euthanasia.  Voluntary euthanasia is where the consent is \n\n\ntaken   from   the   patient,   whereas   non   voluntary   euthanasia   is   where   the \n\n\nconsent   is   unavailable   e.g.   when   the   patient   is   in   coma,   or   is   otherwise \n\n\nunable to give consent.   While there is no legal difficulty in the case of the \n\n\nformer, the latter poses several problems, which we shall address.    \n\n\n\n\n\nACTIVE EUTHANASIA \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\">41.     As already stated above active euthanasia is a crime all over the world \n\n\nexcept where permitted by legislation.   In India active euthanasia is illegal \n\n\nand a crime under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_21\">section 302</a> or at least <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_22\">section 304</a> IPC.  Physician assisted \n\n\nsuicide is a crime under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_23\">section 306</a> IPC (abetment to suicide). \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">42.     Active euthanasia is taking specific steps to cause the patient&#x27;s death, \n\n\nsuch   as   injecting   the   patient   with   some   lethal   substance,   e.g.   sodium \n\n\npentothal which causes a person deep sleep in a few seconds, and the person \n\n\ninstantaneously and painlessly dies in this deep sleep.\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                                        43</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">43.    A  distinction   is  sometimes  drawn between  euthanasia   and  physician \n\n\nassisted   dying,   the   difference   being   in  who  administers   the   lethal \n\n\nmedication.  In euthanasia, a physician or third party administers it, while in \n\n\nphysician assisted suicide it is the patient himself who does it, though on the \n\n\nadvice of the doctor.   In many countries/States the latter is legal while the \n\n\nformer is not.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">44.    The   difference   between   &quot;active&quot;   and   &quot;passive&quot;   euthanasia   is   that   in \n\n\nactive   euthanasia,   something   is done to   end   the   patient&#x27;s   life&#x27;   while   in \n\n\npassive   euthanasia,   something   is not   done that   would   have   preserved   the \n\n\npatient&#x27;s life.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">45.    An   important   idea   behind   this   distinction   is   that   in   &quot;passive \n\n\neuthanasia&quot; the doctors are not actively killing anyone; they are simply not \n\n\nsaving him. While we usually applaud someone who saves another person&#x27;s \n\n\nlife, we do not normally condemn someone for failing to do so. If one rushes \n\n\ninto a burning building and carries someone out to safety, he will probably \n\n\nbe called a hero. But if one sees a burning building and people screaming for \n\n\nhelp, and he stands on the sidelines -- whether out of fear for his own safety, \n\n\nor   the   belief   that   an   inexperienced   and   ill-equipped   person   like   himself \n\n\nwould only get in the way of the professional firefighters, or whatever -- if \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                                                             44</span>\n\n\n\none does nothing, few would judge him for his inaction. One would surely \n\n\nnot be prosecuted for homicide. (At least, not unless one started the fire in \n\n\nthe first place.) \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_170\">46.      Thus, proponents of euthanasia say that while we can debate whether \n\n\nactive   euthanasia   should   be   legal,   there   can   be   no   debate   about   passive \n\n\neuthanasia: You cannot prosecute someone for failing to save a life. Even if \n\n\nyou think it would be good for people to do X, you cannot make it illegal for \n\n\npeople   to not do   X,   or   everyone   in   the   country   who   did   not   do   X   today \n\n\nwould have to be arrested.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_172\">47.      Some persons are of the view that the distinction is not valid.   They \n\n\ngive the example of the old joke about the child who says to his teacher, &quot;Do \n\n\nyou   think   it&#x27;s   right   to   punish   someone   for   something   that   he   didn&#x27;t   do?&quot; \n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">&quot;Why, of course not,&quot; the teacher replies. &quot;Good,&quot; the child says, &quot;because I \n\n\ndidn&#x27;t do my homework.&quot;  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">48.      In fact we have many laws that penalize people for what they did not \n\n\ndo.     A   person   cannot   simply   decide   not   to   pay   his   income   taxes,   or   not \n\n\nbother to send his/her   children to school (where the law requires  sending \n\n\nthem), or not to obey a policeman&#x27;s order to put down one&#x27;s gun.\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                                              45</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">49.    However,   we   are   of   the   opinion   that   the   distinction   is   valid,   as   has \n\n\nbeen   explained   in   some   details   by   Lord   Goff   in  Airedale&#x27;s  case   (infra) \n\n\nwhich we shall presently discuss.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">\n\n\n\nLEGISLATION   IN   SOME   COUNTRIES   RELATING   TO \n\nEUTHANASIA OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTED DEATH\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">50.

While   the   physician   was   convicted,   the   court&#x27;s \n\n\n   judgment set out criteria when a doctor would not be required to keep \n\n\n   a patient alive contrary to his will.

For \n\n\nexample, if a patient requires kidney dialysis to survive, not giving dialysis \n\n\nalthough   the   machine   is   available,   is   passive   euthanasia.   Similarly,   if   a \n\n\npatient is in coma or on a heart lung machine, withdrawing of the machine \n\n\nwill ordinarily result in passive euthanasia.  Similarly not giving life saving \n\n\nmedicines   like   antibiotics   in   certain   situations   may   result   in   passive \n\n\neuthanasia.

As   already   stated   above,   euthanasia   can   be   both   voluntary   or   non \n\n\nvoluntary.     In   voluntary   passive   euthanasia   a   person   who   is   capable   of \n\n\ndeciding for himself decides that he would prefer to die (which may be for \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                                                                      58</span>\n\n\n\nvarious reasons e.g., that he is in great pain or that the money being spent on \n\n\nhis treatment should instead be given to his family who are in greater need, \n\n\netc.), and for this purpose he consciously and of his own free will refuses to \n\n\ntake life saving medicines.  In India, if a person consciously and voluntarily \n\n\nrefuses to take life saving medical treatment it is not a crime.   Whether not \n\n\ntaking food consciously and voluntarily with the aim of ending one&#x27;s life is a \n\n\ncrime under <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_26\">section 309</a> IPC (attempt to commit suicide) is a question which \n\n\nneed not be decided in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">53.

Bland (1993) All E.R. 82) \n\n(H.L.)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">55.       In the  Airedale  case decided by the House of Lords in the U.K., the \n\n\nfacts were that one Anthony Bland aged about 17 went to the Hillsborough \n\n\nGround on 15th  April 1989 to support the Liverpool Football Club.   In the \n\n\ncourse  of the  disaster  which  occurred  on that  day,   his  lungs  were  crushed \n\n\nand punctured and the supply to his brain was interrupted.   As a result, he \n\n\nsuffered   catastrophic   and   irreversible   damage   to   the   higher   centres   of   the \n\n\nbrain.  For three years, he was in a condition known as `persistent vegetative \n\n\nstate (PVS).  This state arises from the destruction of the cerebral cortex on \n\n\naccount   of   prolonged   deprivation   of   oxygen,   and   the   cerebral   cortex   of \n\n\nAnthony   had   resolved   into   a   watery   mass.     The   cortex   is   that   part   of   the \n\n\nbrain which is the seat of cognitive function and sensory capacity.  Anthony \n\n\nBland could not see, hear or feel anything.   He could not communicate  in \n\n\nany way.   His consciousness, which is an essential feature of an individual \n\n\npersonality, had departed forever.  However, his brain-stem, which controls \n\n\nthe   reflective   functions   of  the  body,   in  particular   the   heart   beat,   breathing \n\n\nand   digestion,   continued   to   operate.     He   was  in  persistent   vegetative   state \n\n\n(PVS)   which   is   a   recognized   medical   condition   quite   distinct   from   other \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                                            60</span>\n\n\n\nconditions   sometimes   known   as   &quot;irreversible   coma&quot;,   &quot;the   Guillain-Barre \n\n\nsyndrome&quot;, &quot;the locked-in syndrome&quot; and &quot;brain death&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_198\">56.     The distinguishing characteristic of PVS is that the brain stem remains \n\n\nalive   and   functioning   while   the   cortex   has   lost   its   function   and   activity. \n\n\nThus   the   PVS   patient   continues   to   breathe   unaided   and   his   digestion \n\n\ncontinues to function.   But although his eyes are open, he cannot see.   He \n\n\ncannot hear.  Although capable of reflex movement, particularly in response \n\n\nto painful stimuli, the patient is uncapable of voluntary movement and can \n\n\nfeel no pain.  He cannot taste or smell.  He cannot speak or communicate in \n\n\nany   way.     He   has   no   cognitive   function   and   thus   can   feel   no   emotion, \n\n\nwhether   pleasure   or   distress.     The   absence   of   cerebral   function   is   not   a \n\n\nmatter  of surmise;  it can be scientifically  demonstrated.    The  space  which \n\n\nthe brain should occupy is full of watery fluid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">57.     In order to maintain Mr. Bland in his condition, feeding and hydration \n\n\nwere achieved by artificial means of a nasogastric tube while the excretory \n\n\nfunctions were regulated by a catheter and enemas.   According to eminent \n\n\nmedical opinion, there was no prospect whatsoever that he would ever make \n\n\na recovery from his condition, but there was every likelihood that he would \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                                          61</span>\n\n\n\nmaintain   this   state   of   existence   for   many   years   to   come   provided   the \n\n\nartificial means of medical care was continued. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\">58.     In this state of affairs the medical  men in charge of Anthony Bland \n\n\ncase   took   the   view,   which   was   supported   by   his   parents,   that   no   useful \n\n\npurpose   would   be   served   by   continuing   medical   care,   and   that   artificial \n\n\nfeeding   and   other   measures   aimed   at   prolonging   his   existence   should   be \n\n\nstopped.  Since however, there was a doubt as to whether this course might \n\n\nconstitute   a   criminal   offence,   the   hospital   authorities   sought   a   declaration \n\n\nfrom the British High Court to resolve these doubts. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">59.

The   broad   issued   raised   before   the   House   of   Lords   in   the  Airedale \n\n\ncase (supra) was &quot;In what circumstances, if ever, can those having a duty to \n\n\nfeed an invalid lawfully stop doing so?&quot;  In fact this is precisely the question \n\n\nraised in the present case of Aruna Shanbaug  before us.  \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                                                 62</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_206\">61.

Such a person is completely at liberty to decline \n\n\nto undergo treatment, even if the result of his doing so will be that he will \n\n\ndie.   This   extends   to   the   situation   where   the   person   in   anticipation   of   his \n\n\nentering into a condition such as PVS, gives clear instructions that in such an \n\n\nevent   he   is   not   to   be   given   medical   care,   including   artificial   feeding, \n\n\ndesigned to keep him alive.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">62.

For   a   time,   no   doubt,   there   was   some   hope   that   he \n\n\nmight   recover   sufficiently   for   him   to   be   able   to   live   a   life   that   had   some \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                                                                  63</span>\n\n\n\nmeaning.

But sound medical opinion takes the view that if a P.V.S. patient \n\n\nshows no signs of recovery after six months, or at most a year, then there is \n\n\nno prospect whatever of any recovery. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">64.     There are techniques available which make it possible to ascertain the \n\n\nstate   of   the   cerebral   cortex,   and   in  Anthony   Bland&#x27;s  case   these   indicated \n\n\nthat,   it   had   degenerated   into   a   mass   of   watery   fluid.     In   this   situation   the \n\n\nquestion before the House of Lords was whether the doctors could withdraw \n\n\nmedical treatment or feeding Anthony Bland thus allowing him to die. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">65.     It was held by Lord Keith that a medical practitioner is under no duty \n\n\nto   continue   to   treat   such   a   patient   where   a   large   body   of   informed   and \n\n\nresponsible medical opinion is to the effect that no benefit at all would be \n\n\nconferred by continuance of the treatment.   Existence in a vegetative state \n\n\nwith   no   prospect   of   recovery   is   by   that   opinion   regarded   as   not   being   of \n\n\nbenefit to the patient.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">66.

Lord   Keith   observed   that   the   principle   of   sanctity   of   life   is   not   an \n\n\nabsolute one.   For instance, it does not compel the medical practitioner on \n\n\npain   of   criminal   sanction   to   treat   a   patient,   who   will   die,   if   he   does   not, \n\n\naccording to the express wish of the patient. It does not authorize forcible \n\n\nfeeding   of   prisoners   on   hunger   strike.   It   does   not   compel   the   temporary \n\n\nkeeping alive of patients who are terminally ill where to do so would merely \n\n\nprolong   their  suffering.     On  the  other   hand,  it  forbids  the  taking  of  active \n\n\nmeasures   to   cut   short   the   life   of   a   terminally-ill   patient   (unless   there   is \n\n\nlegislation which permits it). \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">68.       Lord   Keith   observed   that   although   the   decision   whether   or   not   the \n\n\ncontinued treatment and cure of a PVS patient confers any benefit on him is \n\n\nessentially one for the medical practitioners in charge of his case to decide, \n\n\nas a matter  of routine the hospital/medical practitioner  should apply to the \n\n\nFamily   Division   of   the   High   Court   for   endorsing   or   reversing   the   said \n\n\ndecision.

The   Court   of   Appeal,   like   the   President, \n\n            answered  this  question  generally   in the  affirmative,  and \n\n            (in   the   declarations   made   or   approved   by   them) \n\n            specifically also in the affirmative in relation to Anthony \n\n            Bland   .   I   find   myself   to   be   in   agreement   with   the \n\n            conclusions   so   reached   by   all   the   judges   below, \n\n            substantially   for   the   reasons   given   by   them.   But   the \n\n            matter is of such importance that I propose to express my \n\n            reasons in my own words.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">\n            I start with the simple fact that, in law, Anthony is still \n\n            alive.   It   is   true   that   his   condition   is   such   that   it   can   be \n\n            described   as   a   living   death;   but   he   is   nevertheless   still \n\n            alive.   This   is   because,   as   a   result   of   developments   in \n\n            modern medical technology, doctors no longer associate \n\n            death   exclusively   with   breathing   and   heart   beat,   and   it \n\n            has   come   to   be   accepted   that   death   occurs   when   the \n\n            brain, and in particular the brain stem, has been destroyed \n\n            (see   Professor   Ian   Kennedy&#x27;s   Paper   entitled   &quot;Switching \n\n            off   Life   Support   Machines:   The   Legal   Implications&quot; \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">            reprinted in Treat Me Right, Essays in Medical Law and \n\n            Ethics, (1988)), especially at pp. 351-2, and the material \n\n            there   cited).   There   has   been   no  dispute   on   this   point   in \n\n            the present case, and it is unnecessary for me to consider \n\n            it   further.   The   evidence   is   that   Anthony&#x27;s   brain   stem   is \n\n            still   alive   and   functioning   and   it   follows   that,   in   the \n\n            present   state   of   medical   science,   he   is   still   alive   and \n\n            should be so regarded as a matter of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_223\">\n            It is on this basis that I turn to the applicable principles of \n\n            law.   Here,   the   fundamental   principle   is   the   principle   of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                                               66</span>\n\n\n\nthe sanctity of human life - a principle long recognized \n\nnot only in our own society but also in most,  if not all, \n\ncivilized   societies   throughout   the   modern   world,   as   is \n\nindeed   evidenced   by   its   recognition   both   in   <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_27\">article   2</a>   of \n\nthe European Convention of Human Rights, and in <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_28\">article \n\n6</a>   of   the   International   Covenant   of   Civil   and   Political \n\nRights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">\nBut   this   principle,   fundamental   though   it   is,   is   not \n\nabsolute.   Indeed   there   are   circumstances   in   which   it   is \n\nlawful to take another man&#x27;s life, for example by a lawful \n\nact   of   self-defence,   or   (in   the   days   when   capital \n\npunishment   was   acceptable   in   our   society)   by   lawful \n\nexecution.   We   are   not   however   concerned   with   cases \n\nsuch   as   these.   We   are   concerned   with   circumstances   in \n\nwhich   it   may   be   lawful   to   withhold   from   a   patient \n\nmedical treatment or care by means of which his life may \n\nbe prolonged. But here too there is no absolute rule that \n\nthe patient&#x27;s life must be prolonged by such treatment or \n\ncare, if available, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n\nFirst,   it   is   established   that   the   principle   of   self-\n\ndetermination requires that respect must  be given to the \n\nwishes of the patient, so that if an adult patient of sound \n\nmind   refuses,   however   unreasonably,   to   consent   to \n\ntreatment   or   care   by   which   his   life   would   or   might   be \n\nprolonged, the doctors responsible for his care must give \n\neffect to his wishes, even though they do not consider it \n\nto be in his best interests to do so (see Schloendorff   v . \n\nSociety   of   New   York   Hospital   105   N.E.   92,   93,   per \n\nCardozo  J. (1914);  S.   v . McC. (Orse  S.) and  M (D.S. \n\nIntervene); W  v . W [1972] A.C. 24, 43, per Lord Reid; \n\nand   Sidaway     v   .   Board   of   Governors   of   the   Bethlem \n\nRoyal   Hospital   and   the   Maudsley   Hospital   [1985]   AC \n\n871, 882, per Lord Scarman). To this extent, the principle \n\nof the sanctity of human life must yield to the principle of \n\nself- determination (see Court of Appeal Transcript in the \n\npresent   case,   at   p.   38F   per   Hoffmann   L.J.),   and,   for \n\npresent   purposes   perhaps   more   important,   the   doctor&#x27;s \n\nduty   to   act   in   the   best   interests   of   his   patient   must \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                                                  67</span>\n\n\n\nlikewise be qualified. On this basis, it has been held that \n\na   patient   of   sound   mind   may,   if   properly   informed, \n\nrequire   that   life   support   should   be   discontinued:   see \n\nNancy B.    v. Hotel  Dieu de Quebec  (1992) 86 D.L.R. \n\n(4th) 385. Moreover the same principle applies where the \n\npatient&#x27;s refusal to give his consent has been expressed at \n\nan   earlier   date,   before   he   became   unconscious   or \n\notherwise incapable of communicating it; though in such \n\ncircumstances  especial  care  may be necessary to ensure \n\nthat   the   prior   refusal   of   consent   is   still   properly   to   be \n\nregarded   as   applicable  in  the  circumstances  which  have \n\nsubsequently occurred (see, e.g. In re T. (Adult: Refusal \n\nof treatment) [1992] 3 W.L.R. 782). I wish to add that, in \n\ncases   of   this   kind,   there   is   no   question   of   the   patient \n\nhaving   committed   suicide,   nor   therefore   of   the   doctor \n\nhaving aided or abetted him in doing so. It is simply that \n\nthe patient has, as he is entitled to do, declined to consent \n\nto   treatment   which   might   or   would   have   the   effect   of \n\nprolonging   his   life,   and   the   doctor   has,   in   accordance \n\nwith his duty, complied with his patient&#x27;s wishes.\n\n\nBut   in   many   cases   not   only   may   the   patient   be   in   no \n\ncondition to be able to say whether or not he consents to \n\nthe relevant treatment or care, but also he may have given \n\nno prior indication of his wishes with regard to it. In the \n\ncase of a child who is a ward of court, the court itself will \n\ndecide whether medical treatment should be provided in \n\nthe   child&#x27;s   best   interests,   taking   into   account   medical \n\nopinion. But the court cannot give its consent on behalf \n\nof an adult patient who is incapable of himself deciding \n\nwhether   or   not   to   consent   to   treatment.   I   am   of   the \n\nopinion that  there is nevertheless no absolute obligation \n\nupon the doctor who has the patient in his care to prolong \n\nhis life, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, it would \n\nbe most startling, and could lead to the most adverse and \n\ncruel   effects   upon   the  patient,   if   any   such   absolute   rule \n\nwere   held   to   exist.   It   is   scarcely   consistent   with   the \n\nprimacy   given   to   the   principle   of   self-determination   in \n\nthose   cases   in   which   the   patient   of   sound   mind   has \n\ndeclined to give his consent, that the law should provide \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                                                                68</span>\n\n\n\nno   means   of   enabling   treatment   to   be   withheld   in \n\nappropriate   circumstances   where   the   patient   is   in   no \n\ncondition to indicate, if that was his wish, that he did not \n\nconsent to it. The point was put forcibly in the judgment \n\nof   the   Supreme   Judicial   Court   of   Massachusetts   in \n\nSuperintendent   of   Belchertown   State   School     v. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_225\">Saikewicz (1977) 370 N.E. 2d. 417, 428, as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">&quot;To presume that the incompetent person must always be \n\nsubjected   to   what   many   rational   and   intelligent   persons \n\nmay   decline   is   to   downgrade   the   status   of   the \n\nincompetent   person   by   placing   a   lesser   value   on   his \n\nintrinsic human worth and vitality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_226\">I must however stress, at this point, that the law draws a \n\ncrucial   distinction   between   cases   in   which   a   doctor \n\ndecides not to provide, or to continue to provide, for his \n\npatient   treatment   or   care   which   could   or   might   prolong \n\nhis   life,  and  those  in  which  he  decides,  for  example  by \n\nadministering a lethal drug, actively to bring his patient&#x27;s \n\nlife   to   an   end.   As   I   have   already   indicated,   the   former \n\nmay be lawful, either because the doctor is giving effect \n\nto   his   patient&#x27;s   wishes   by   withholding   the   treatment   or \n\ncare,   or   even   in   certain   circumstances   in   which   (on \n\nprinciples   which   I   shall   describe)   the   patient   is \n\nincapacitated   from   stating   whether   or   not   he   gives   his \n\nconsent. But  it is not lawful for a doctor to administer a \n\ndrug to his patient to bring about his death, even though \n\nthat course is prompted by a humanitarian desire to end \n\nhis   suffering,   however   great   that   suffering   may   be:   see \n\nReg. v. Cox  (Unreported), Ognall J., Winchester Crown \n\nCourt,   18   September   1992.  So   to   act   is   to   cross   the \n\nRubicon which runs between on the one hand the care of \n\nthe   living   patient   and   on   the   other   hand   euthanasia   - \n\nactively causing his death to avoid or to end his suffering. \n\nEuthanasia is not lawful at common  law. It is of course \n\nwell known that there are many responsible members of \n\nour society who believe that euthanasia should be made \n\nlawful; but  that result could, I believe, only be  achieved \n\nby legislation which expresses the democratic will that so \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                                                                   69</span>\n\n\n\nfundamental   a   change   should   be   made   in   our   law,   and \n\ncan, if enacted, ensure that such legalised killing can only \n\nbe   carried   out   subject   to   appropriate   supervision   and \n\ncontrol. It is true that the drawing of this distinction may \n\nlead   to   a   charge   of   hypocrisy;   because   it   can   be   asked \n\nwhy, if the doctor, by discontinuing treatment, is entitled \n\nin   consequence   to   let   his   patient   die,   it   should   not   be \n\nlawful   to   put   him  out   of   his   misery   straight   away,   in   a \n\nmore   humane   manner,   by   a   lethal   injection,   rather   than \n\nlet him linger on in pain until he dies. But the law does \n\nnot   feel   able   to   authorize   euthanasia,   even   in \n\ncircumstances   such   as   these;   for   once   euthanasia   is \n\nrecognized as lawful in these circumstances, it is difficult \n\nto see any logical basis for excluding it in others.\n\n\nAt the heart of this distinction lies a theoretical question. \n\nWhy   is   it  that   the  doctor   who   gives   his   patient   a  lethal \n\ninjection   which   kills   him   commits   an   unlawful   act   and \n\nindeed   is   guilty   of   murder,   whereas   a   doctor   who,   by \n\ndiscontinuing life support, allows his patient to die, may \n\nnot act unlawfully - and will not do so, if he commits no \n\nbreach   of   duty   to   his   patient?   Professor   Glanville \n\nWilliams   has   suggested   (see   his   Textbook   of   Criminal \n\nLaw,   2nd   ed.,   p.   282)   that   the   reason   is   that  what   the \n\ndoctor does when he switches off a life support machine \n\n&#x27;is   in   substance   not   an   act   but   an   omission   to   struggle, \n\nand   that   &#x27;the   omission   is   not   a   breach   of   duty   by   the \n\ndoctor because he is not obliged to continue in a hopeless \n\ncase&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">\nI   agree   that   the   doctor&#x27;s   conduct   in   discontinuing   life \n\nsupport can properly be categorized as an omission. It is \n\ntrue  that it may be difficult  to describe what  the doctor \n\nactually does as an omission, for example where he takes \n\nsome positive step to bring the life support to an end. But \n\ndiscontinuation of life support is, for present purposes, no \n\ndifferent from not initiating life support in the first place. \n\nIn each case, the doctor is simply allowing his patient to \n\ndie   in   the   sense   that   he   is   desisting   from   taking   a   step \n\nwhich might, in certain circumstances, prevent his patient \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                               70</span>\n\n\n\nfrom dying  as a result of his pre-existing condition; and \n\nas a matter of general principle an omission such as this \n\nwill not be unlawful unless it constitutes a breach of duty \n\nto the patient. I also agree that the doctor&#x27;s conduct is to \n\nbe differentiated from that of, for example, an interloper \n\nwho   maliciously   switches   off   a   life   support   machine \n\nbecause, although the interloper may perform exactly the \n\nsame act as the doctor who discontinues life support, his \n\ndoing so constitutes interference with the life-prolonging \n\ntreatment   then   being   administered   by   the   doctor. \n\nAccordingly,   whereas   the   doctor,   in   discontinuing   life \n\nsupport, is simply allowing his patient to die of his pre-\n\nexisting   condition,   the   interloper   is   actively   intervening \n\nto stop the doctor from prolonging the patient&#x27;s life, and \n\nsuch   conduct   cannot   possibly   be   categorised   as   an \n\nomission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">\nThe   distinction   appears,   therefore,   to   be   useful   in   the \n\npresent context in that it can be invoked to explain how \n\ndiscontinuance of life support can be differentiated from \n\nending a patient&#x27;s life by a lethal injection. But in the end \n\nthe   reason   for   that   difference   is   that,   whereas   the   law \n\nconsiders   that   discontinuance   of   life   support   may   be \n\nconsistent with the doctor&#x27;s duty to care for his patient, it \n\ndoes not, for reasons of policy, consider that it forms any \n\npart of his duty to give his patient a lethal injection to put \n\nhim out of his agony.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">\nI return to the patient who, because for example he is of \n\nunsound   mind   or   has   been   rendered   unconscious   by \n\naccident or by illness, is incapable of stating whether or \n\nnot   he   consents   to   treatment   or   care.   In   such \n\ncircumstances,   it   is   now   established   that   a   doctor   may \n\nlawfully treat such a patient if he acts in his best interests, \n\nand indeed that, if the patient is already in his care, he is \n\nunder a duty so to treat him: see In re F [1990] 2 AC 1, in \n\nwhich   the   legal   principles   governing   treatment   in   such \n\ncircumstances  were stated  by this House. For my part  I \n\ncan   see   no   reason   why,   as   a   matter   of   principle,   a \n\ndecision   by   a   doctor   whether   or   not   to   initiate,   or   to \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                                                71</span>\n\n\n\ncontinue   to   provide,   treatment   or   care   which   could   or \n\nmight have the effect of prolonging such a patient&#x27;s life, \n\nshould   not   be   governed   by   the   same   fundamental \n\nprinciple.   Of   course,   in   the   great   majority   of   cases,   the \n\nbest   interests   of   the   patient   are   likely   to   require   that \n\ntreatment of this kind, if available, should be given to a \n\npatient. But this may not always be so. To take a simple \n\nexample  given  by   Thomas  J.  in  Re   J.H.L.  (Unreported) \n\n(High Court of New Zealand) 13 August 1992, at p. 35), \n\nto whose judgment  in that case  I wish  to pay  tribute,  it \n\ncannot   be   right   that  a   doctor,   who   has   under   his   care  a \n\npatient   suffering   painfully   from   terminal   cancer,   should \n\nbe   under   an   absolute   obligation   to   perform   upon   him \n\nmajor   surgery   to   abate   another   condition   which,   if \n\nunabated,   would   or   might   shorten   his   life   still   further. \n\nThe doctor who is caring for such a patient cannot, in my \n\nopinion,   be   under   an   absolute   obligation   to   prolong   his \n\nlife   by   any   means   available   to   him,   regardless   of   the \n\nquality  of  the  patient&#x27;s   life.  Common   humanity  requires \n\notherwise,   as   do   medical   ethics   and   good   medical \n\npractice accepted in this country and overseas. As I see it, \n\nthe doctor&#x27;s decision whether or not to take any such step \n\nmust  (subject to his patient&#x27;s  ability to give or withhold \n\nhis consent) be made in the best interests of the patient. It \n\nis this principle too which, in my opinion, underlies the \n\nestablished   rule   that   a   doctor   may,   when   caring   for   a \n\npatient   who   is,   for   example,   dying   of   cancer,   lawfully \n\nadminister   painkilling   drugs   despite   the   fact   that   he \n\nknows that an incidental effect of that application will be \n\nto   abbreviate   the   patient&#x27;s   life.   Such   a   decision   may \n\nproperly be made as part of the care of the living patient, \n\nin his best interests; and, on this basis, the treatment will \n\nbe lawful. Moreover, where the doctor&#x27;s treatment of his \n\npatient  is   lawful,  the   patient&#x27;s  death   will  be   regarded  in \n\nlaw   as   exclusively   caused   by   the   injury   or   disease   to \n\nwhich his condition is attributable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">\nIt   is   of   course   the   development   of   modern   medical \n\ntechnology,   and   in   particular   the   development   of   life \n\nsupport   systems,   which   has   rendered   cases   such   as   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                                                  72</span>\n\n\n\npresent so much more relevant than in the past. Even so, \n\nwhere (for example) a patient is brought into hospital in \n\nsuch a condition that, without the benefit of a life support \n\nsystem, he will not continue to live, the decision has to be \n\nmade whether or not to give him that benefit, if available. \n\nThat   decision   can  only   be  made   in   the  best   interests   of \n\nthe   patient.   No   doubt,   his   best   interests   will   ordinarily \n\nrequire that he should be placed on a life support system \n\nas   soon   as   necessary,   if   only   to   make   an   accurate \n\nassessment   of   his   condition   and   a   prognosis   for   the \n\nfuture. But if he neither recovers sufficiently to be taken \n\noff it nor dies, the question will ultimately arise  whether \n\nhe   should   be   kept   on   it   indefinitely.   As   I   see   it,   that \n\nquestion   (assuming   the   continued   availability   of   the \n\nsystem)   can   only   be   answered   by   reference   to   the   best \n\ninterests   of   the   patient   himself,   having   regard   to \n\nestablished   medical   practice.   Indeed,   if   the   justification \n\nfor   treating   a   patient   who   lacks   the   capacity   to   consent \n\nlies in the fact that the treatment is provided in his best \n\ninterests,   it   must   follow   that   the  treatment  may,   and \n\nindeed ultimately should, be discontinued where it is no \n\nlonger   in   his   best   interests   to   provide   it.   The   question \n\nwhich lies at the heart of the present case is, as I see it, \n\nwhether on that principle the doctors responsible for the \n\ntreatment   and   care   of   Anthony     Bland     can   justifiably \n\ndiscontinue  the process of artificial  feeding  upon which \n\nthe prolongation of his life depends.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">\nIt is crucial for the understanding of this question that the \n\nquestion   itself   should   be   correctly   formulated.   The \n\nquestion  is not whether  the doctor  should take a  course \n\nwhich will  kill  his patient,  or even take  a course which \n\nhas  the  effect  of accelerating  his  death.  The  question  is \n\nwhether   the   doctor   should   or   should   not   continue   to \n\nprovide his patient with medical treatment or care which, \n\nif continued, will prolong his patient&#x27;s life. The question \n\nis   sometimes   put   in   striking   or   emotional   terms,   which \n\ncan   be   misleading.   For   example,   in   the   case   of   a   life \n\nsupport system, it is sometimes asked: Should a doctor be \n\nentitled to switch it off, or to pull the plug? And then it is \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                                                                            73</span>\n\n\n\n                  asked: Can it be in the best interests of the patient that a \n\n                  doctor   should   be   able   to   switch   the   life   support   system \n\n                  off, when this will inevitably result in the patient&#x27;s death? \n\n                  Such   an   approach   has   rightly   been   criticised   as \n\n                  misleading, for example by Professor Ian Kennedy (in his \n\n                  paper   in   Treat   Me   Right,   Essays   in   Medical   Law   and \n\n                  Ethics (1988), and by Thomas J. in Re J.H.L. at pp. 21- \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_232\">                  22.

The \n\n                  question is whether it is in the best interests of the patient \n\n                  that   his   life   should   be   prolonged   by   the   continuance   of \n\n                  this form of medical treatment or care.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_233\">\n                  The   correct   formulation   of   the   question   is   of   particular \n\n                  importance   in   a   case   such   as   the   present,   where   the \n\n                  patient is totally unconscious and where there is no hope \n\n                  whatsoever   of   any   amelioration   of   his   condition.

The   Missouri   trial   court   in   this   case \n\n              found that permanent brain damage generally results after \n\n              6 minutes in an anoxic state; it was estimated that Cruzan \n\n              was   deprived   of   oxygen   from   12   to   14   minutes.   She \n\n              remained in a coma for approximately three weeks, and \n\n              then progressed to an unconscious state in which she was \n\n              able   to   orally   ingest   some   nutrition.

The   notion   of   bodily   integrity   has   been   embodied   in   the \n\n\nrequirement   that   informed   consent   is   generally   required   for   medical \n\n\ntreatment.   As observed by Justice Cardozo, while on the Court of Appeals \n\n\nof New York &quot;Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right \n\n\nto   determine   what   shall   be   done   with   his   own   body,   and   a   surgeon   who \n\n\nperforms an operation without his patient&#x27;s consent commits an assault, for \n\n\nwhich   he   is   liable   in   damages.&quot;   vide  Schloendorff    vs.    Society   of   New \n\n\nYork Hospital, 211 N.Y. 125, 129-30, 105 N.E. 92, 93 (1914).     Thus the \n\n\ninformed consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American Tort \n\n\nLaw.   The logical corollary   of the doctrine of informed consent is that the \n\n\npatient   generally   possesses   the   right   not   to   consent,   that   is   to   refuse \n\n\ntreatment.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_263\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_264\">88.    The question, however, arises in cases where the patient is unable to \n\n\ndecide whether the treatment should continue or not e.g. if he is in coma or \n\n\nPVS.

Also,   since   medical   science   is   advancing   fast,   doctors   must   not \n\n\ndeclare   a   patient   to   be   a   hopeless   case   unless   there   appears   to   be   no \n\n\nreasonable   possibility   of   any   improvement   by   some   newly   discovered \n\n\nmedical   method   in   the   near   future.     In   this   connection   we   may   refer   to   a \n\n\nrecent news item which we have come across on the internet of an Arkansas \n\n\nman Terry Wallis, who was 19 years of age and newly married with a baby \n\n\ndaughter   when   in   1984   his   truck   plunged   through   a   guard   rail,   falling   25 \n\n\nfeet.     He   went   into   coma   in   the   crash   in   1984,   but   after   24   years   he   has \n\n\nregained consciousness.   This was perhaps because his brain spontaneously \n\n\nrewired   itself   by   growing   tiny   new   nerve   connections   to   replace   the   ones \n\n\nsheared apart in the car crash.  Probably the nerve fibers from Terry Wallis&#x27; \n\n\ncells   were   severed   but   the   cells   themselves   remained   intact,   unlike   Terri \n\n\nSchiavo, whose brain cells had died (see Terri Schiavo&#x27;s case on Google).  \n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_290\">104.    However, we make it clear that it is experts like medical practitioners \n\n\nwho can decide whether there is any reasonable possibility of a new medical \n\n\ndiscovery which could enable such a patient to revive in the near future.\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                                                                                   88</span>\n\n\n\nWHEN CAN A PERSON IS SAID TO BE DEAD \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_291\">105.

A person&#x27;s most important organ is his/her brain.   This organ cannot \n\n\nbe replaced.  Other body parts can be replaced e.g. if a person&#x27;s hand or leg \n\n\nis   amputed,   he   can   get   an   artificial   limb.     Similarly,   we   can   transplant   a \n\n\nkidney,   a   heart   or   a   liver   when  the   original   one   has   failed.     However,  we \n\n\ncannot transplant a brain.  If someone  else&#x27;s brain is transplanted into one&#x27;s \n\n\nbody,   then   in   fact,   it   will   be   that   other   person   living   in   one&#x27;s   body.     The \n\n\nentire   mind,   including   one&#x27;s   personality,   cognition,   memory,   capacity   of \n\n\nreceiving signals from the five senses and capacity of giving commands to \n\n\nthe other parts of the body, etc. are the functions of the brain.  Hence one is \n\n\none&#x27;s brain.  It follows that one is dead when one&#x27;s brain is dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_294\">107.    As is well-known, the brain cells normally do not multiply after the \n\n\nearly years of childhood (except in the region called hippocampus), unlike \n\n\nother cells like skin cells, which are regularly dying and being replaced by \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                                                                              89</span>\n\n\n\nnew cells produced by multiplying of the old cells.  This is probably because \n\n\nbrain cells are too highly specialized to multiply.   Hence if the brain cells \n\n\ndie, they usually cannot be replaced (though sometimes one part of the brain \n\n\ncan   take   over   the   function   of   another   part   in   certain   situations   where   the \n\n\nother part has been irreversibly damaged).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_295\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_296\">108.    Brain cells require regular supply of oxygen which comes through the \n\n\nred cells in the blood.  If oxygen supply is cut off for more than six minutes, \n\n\nthe brain cells die and this condition is known as anoxia.  Hence, if the brain \n\n\nis dead a person is said to be dead.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_297\">\n\n\n\nBRAIN DEATH\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_298\">109.    The   term   `brain   death&#x27;   has   developed   various   meanings.   While \n\n\ninitially,   death   could   be   defined   as   a   cessation   of   breathing,   or,   more \n\n\nscientifically, a cessation of heart-beat, recent medical advances have made \n\n\nsuch   definitions   obsolete.   In   order   to   understand   the   nature   and   scope   of \n\n\nbrain   death,   it   is   worthwhile   to   look   at   how   death   was   understood. \n\n\nHistorically,   as   the   oft-quoted   definition   in   Black&#x27;s   Law   Dictionary \n\n\nsuggests, death was:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_299\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">&quot;The cessation of life; the ceasing to exist; defined by physicians as a total  \n\n\nstoppage of the circulation of the blood, and a cessation of the animal and  \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                                                                 90</span>\n\n\n\nvital   functions   consequent   thereon,   such   as   respiration,   pulsation,   etc.&quot;.1 \n\n\nThis definition saw its echo in numerous other texts and legal case law. This \n\n\nincludes many American precedents- such as Schmidt v. Pierce, 344 S.W.2d \n\n\n120,   133   (Mo.   1961)   (&quot;Black&#x27;s   Law   Dictionary,   4th   Ed.,   defines   death   as \n\n\n`the cessation of life; the ceasing to exist ....&quot;&#x27;); and  Sanger v. Butler, 101 \n\n\nS.W.   459,   462   (Tex.   Civ.   App.   1907)  (&quot;The   Encyclopaedic   Dictionary, \n\n\namong others, gives the following definitions of [death]: `The state of being \n\n\ndead;   the   act   or   state   of   dying;   the   state   or   condition   of   the   dead.&#x27;   The \n\n\nCentury Dictionary defines death as `cessation of life; that state of a being, \n\n\nanimal or vegetable, in which there is a total and permanent cessation of all \n\n\nthe vital functions.&quot;&#x27;).2\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_300\">110.     This   understanding   of   death   emerged   from   a   cardiopulmonary \n\n\nperspective.   In   such   cases,   the   brain   was   usually   irrelevant   --   being \n\n\nunderstood that the cessation of circulation would automatically lead to the \n\n\ndeath of brain cells, which require a great deal of blood to survive. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_301\">111.     The   invention   of   the   ventilator   and   the   defibrillator   in   the   1920s \n\n\naltered   this   understanding,   it   being   now   possible   that   the   cessation   of \n\n\n\n1 Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary 488 (4th ed., rev. 1968).\n\n\n2 Goldsmith, Jason, Wanted!

The question of the length of time that may determine \n\n\nsuch   death   is   significant,   especially   considering   a   significant   increase   in \n\n\norgan donations across jurisdictions over the last few years. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_303\">112.    Brain death, may thus, be defined as &quot;the irreversible cessation of all \n\n\nfunctions of the entire brain, including the brain stem&quot;.4   It is important to \n\n\nunderstand that this definition goes beyond acknowledging consciousness -- \n\n\na   person   who   is   incapable   of   ever   regaining   consciousness   will   not   be \n\n\nconsidered to be brain dead as long as parts of the brain e.g. brain stem that \n\n\nregulate involuntary activity (such as response to light, respiration, heartbeat \n\n\netc.)  still continue to function.    Likewise,  if  consciousness,  albeit  severely \n\n\nlimited, is present, then a person will be considered to be alive even if he has \n\n\nsuffered brain stem death, wherein breathing and heartbeat can no longer be \n\n\nregulated   and   must   be   mechanically   determined.   Hence,   the   international \n\n\nstandard   for   brain   death   is   usually   considered   to   include   &quot;whole-brain \n\n\ndeath&quot;, i.e., a situation where the higher brain (i.e. the part of the brain that \n\n\n\n3 Samantha Weyrauch, Acceptance of Whole Brain Death Criteria for Determination of Death: A  \n\nComparative Analysis of the United States and Japan, 17 UCLA Pac.

To say, in most cases, that only the death of \n\n\nthe   higher   brain   would   be   a   criteria   for   `brain   death&#x27;   may   have   certain \n\n\nserious   consequences  --  for   example,   a   foetus,   technically   under   this \n\n\ndefinition, would not be considered to be alive at all. Similarly, as per this, \n\n\ndifferent   definitions   of   death   would   apply   to   human   and   non-human \n\n\norganisms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_304\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_305\">113.      Brain death, thus, is different from a persistent vegetative state, where \n\n\nthe   brain   stem   continues   to   work,   and   so   some   degree   of   reactions   may \n\n\noccur, though the possibility of regaining consciousness is relatively remote. \n\n\nEven   when   a   person   is   incapable   of   any   response,   but   is   able   to   sustain \n\n\nrespiration   and   circulation,   he   cannot   be   said   to   be   dead.

This \n\n\ncriticism led to the Presidents&#x27; Committee, set up for the purpose, in 1981, \n\n\ndefining death more vaguely as the point  &quot;where the body&#x27;s physiological  \n\n\nsystem ceases to contribute a uniform whole&quot;. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_308\">\nThis   definition   of   whole   brain   death,   however,   is   not   without   its   critics. \n\n\nSome   argue   that   the   brain   is   not   always   responsible   for   all   bodily \n\n\nfunctioning- digestion, growth, and some degree of movement (regulated by \n\n\nthe spinal cord) may not require any electrical activity in the brain.

When this situation is reached, it is possible to assume that the person \n\n\nis dead, even though he or she, through mechanical stimulation, may be able \n\n\nto breathe, his or her heart might be able to beat, and he or she may be able \n\n\nto take some form of nourishment.

She smiles if she receives her favourite food, fish and chicken \n\n\nsoup.   She breathes normally and does not require a heart lung machine or \n\n\nintravenous tube for feeding.

Whatever   the   condition   of   her   cortex,   her \n\n\nbrain stem is certainly alive.  She does not need a heart--lung machine.  She \n\n\nbreathes on her own without the help of a respirator.

From the \n\n\nCD (which we had screened in the courtroom on 2.3.2011 in the presence of \n\n\ncounsels and others) it appears that she can certainly not be called dead.  She \n\n\nwas making some sounds, blinking, eating food put in her mouth, and even \n\n\nlicking with her tongue morsels on her mouth. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_326\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_327\">125.

The   commercialization   of   our   society   has   crossed   all   limits. \n\n\nHence we have to guard against the potential of misuse (see Robin Cook&#x27;s \n\n\nnovel `Coma&#x27;).   In our opinion, while giving great weight to the wishes of \n\n\nthe parents, spouse, or other close relatives or next friend of the incompetent \n\n\npatient and also giving due weight to the opinion of the attending doctors, \n\n\nwe cannot leave it entirely to their discretion whether to discontinue the life \n\n\nsupport or not.

The   idea   behind   Parens \n\n\nPatriae is that if a citizen is in need of someone who can act as a parent who \n\n\ncan make decisions and take some other action, sometimes the State is best \n\n\nqualified to take on this role.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_343\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_344\">129.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"299215\" id=\"span_119\">In the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/299215/\" id=\"a_51\">Charan Lal Sahu \n\n\nvs.  Union of India</a>  (1990) 1 SCC 613 (vide paras 35 and 36), the doctrine \n\n\nhas been explained in some details as follows :</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_345\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">                         &quot;In   the   &quot;Words   and   Phrases&quot;   Permanent   Edition, \n\n                Vol. 33 at page 99, it is stated that parens patriae is the \n\n                inherent  power and authority  of a legislature  to provide \n\n                protection to the person and property of persons  non sui  \n\n                juris,   such   as   minor,   insane,   and   incompetent   persons, \n\n                but the words parens patriae meaning thereby `the father \n\n                of the country&#x27;, were applied originally to the King and \n\n                are used to designate the State referring to its sovereign \n\n                power   of   guardianship   over   persons   under   disability. \n\n                Parens   patriae   jurisdiction,   it   has   been   explained,   is   the \n\n                right   of   the   sovereign   and   imposes   a   duty   on   the \n\n                sovereign,   in   public   interest,   to   protect   persons   under \n\n                disability   who   have   no   rightful   protector.
