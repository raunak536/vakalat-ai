It is alleged that, by taking shelter under a clause\n\nin the bye-laws of the association that prohibits the residents from\n\nkeeping pets of their choice in their individual apartments, the office\n\nbearers of the association have issued notices to him asking him to\n\nremove his pet from the premises. During the pendency of the writ\n\npetition, other persons impleaded themselves as the additional fourth\n\nto sixth respondents in the writ petition, faced with similar directives\n\nfrom the office bearers of their respective resident associations. The\n\nshort issue that arises for consideration in this writ petition is\n\nwhether such stipulations in the bye-laws of resident associations or\n W.P.(C).No.13603/2021            :: 4 ::\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">other agreements entered into by occupiers of residential apartments\n\ncan withstand legal scrutiny under our laws ?\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39696860\" id=\"span_1\">2. The State Government has filed a statement indicating that\n\nit does not consider such stipulations justified and that denying\n\npermission to occupiers of residential apartments, to keep pets of\n\ntheir choice, while infringing their fundamental rights would also\n\ninfringe the fundamental freedoms recognised in animals by the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/39696860/\" id=\"a_1\">Animal Welfare Board of India\n\nv.

He\n\nsuggests the imposition of conditions on the pet owners that would\n\nsafeguard the interests of their neighbours and further points out\n\nthat the legislative lacuna in the <a href=\"/doc/374796/\" id=\"a_4\">PCA Act</a> &amp; Rules in that regard can\n\nbe addressed by the Central Government by framing Rules in terms\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/114520156/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 38</a> of the PCA Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">         4. The trajectory of animal rights jurisprudence in India has\n\nsadly been a retrograde one.

Vol.25,\n\nNo.11 (Nov.2012) pp.1499-1506, observe that the religions of the\n\neast such as Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism have always believed\n\nin non-injury to living beings and a repeated, cyclical embodiment of\n\nall living beings. Since according to the said religions, ancestors\n\nreturn in animal form, animals have to be treated with the respect\n\nthat is due to humans. The vedas set out the code of &#x27;sarva-bhuta-\n\nhita&#x27; that exhorts people to see the same life in all creatures\n\nregardless of their external manifestation. Those who cannot\n\nunderstand this principle of life in lesser beings miss the meaning of\n\nlife altogether and risk losing their sense of humanity. Islam too\n\nteaches that the almighty has given people power over animals, yet\n\nto treat them badly is to disobey his will. The words of the prophet\n\nstate that animals should be killed only out of necessity and that\n\ndoing otherwise is a sin. Ancient Indian jurisprudence in the area of\n\nanimal welfare was therefore truly eco-centric for it recognised the\n\nmoral worth of life forms other than humans. The anthropocentric\n\nshift was probably the result of over two centuries of British rule, and\n W.P.(C).No.13603/2021                   :: 7 ::\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">the Judeo-Christian concept of human dominion over animals that it\n\nbrought with it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39696860\" id=\"span_2\">5. The above aspects have been noticed by our Supreme Court\n\nwhile deciding the legality of the practice of &#x27;Jallikattu&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/39696860/\" id=\"a_6\">Animal\n\nWelfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja and Ors</a> - [(2014) 7 SCC\n\n547].

Since it is trite that welfare\n\nlegislations have to be construed liberally in favour of the intended\n\nbeneficiaries, it was found that any regulations or guidelines,\n\nwhether statutory or otherwise, that purported to dilute or defeat the\n\nwelfare legislation and the constitutional principles would need to be\n\nstruck down by the courts so as to achieve the ultimate object and\n\npurpose of the welfare legislation.

We must point out, however, that the <a href=\"/doc/374796/\" id=\"a_11\">PCA Act</a> carves out\n\nexceptions to the freedoms recognised in animals based on the\n\ndoctrine of necessity, the necessity being the sub-serving of the\n\nneeds of human beings. To this extent, the statute is essentially\n\nwelfarist in its approach and not abolitionist. It promotes an\n\nanthropocentric view of animal welfare and does not advocate the\n\nextremist point of view canvassed by abolitionists for whom\n\nexploitation of animals in any form is taboo as it deprives animals of\n W.P.(C).No.13603/2021           :: 9 ::\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">their individual autonomy and inherent dignity. While the latter view,\n\nwithout doubt, provides an ideal that we must strive to attain as\n\ncompassionate and accommodative human beings, sharing our space\n\non this planet with other living species, it is the legislature that must\n\nenact the law regulating human-animal relations in any society,\n\nbased on the policy adopted after ascertaining the views of the\n\ncitizenry.

Even within the limits of animal welfare recognised under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/374796/\" id=\"a_12\">PCA Act</a>, we are of the view that the duty cast on the citizenry to\n\nrespect the five freedoms recognised in animals is of sufficiently wide\n\nambit as to require them to refrain from interfering with another\n\npersons right to keep a pet of his choice. In interpreting the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/374796/\" id=\"a_13\">PCA Act</a>, we have also to bear in mind the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/871328/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 48A</a> of our Constitution that obliges the State to\n\nprotect and make all endeavours to safeguard the forests and\n\nwildlife, as also <a href=\"/doc/1644544/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 51A (g)</a> of our Constitution that imposes a\n\nduty on every citizen of our country to protect and improve the\n\nnatural environment and to have compassion for living creatures.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\"> W.P.(C).No.13603/2021                    :: 10 ::\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"186010010\" id=\"span_3\">Further, in <a href=\"/doc/186010010/\" id=\"a_16\">Prakash v.

It follows therefore that clauses in the\n\nbye-laws of resident associations, such as the one impugned in this\n\nwrit petition, that seek to prevent owners/occupiers of residential\n\napartments from keeping pet animals of their choice in the\n\nresidential apartments owned/occupied by them, or accessing the\n\nelevators and common facilities in the apartment buildings, cannot\n\nwithstand legal and constitutional scrutiny.

The said proposition applies with added vigour\n\nwhen the particular fundamental right is seen as complementing or\n\naugmenting the fundamental freedoms recognised in animals owned\n\nor kept by that citizen.
