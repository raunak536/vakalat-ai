The written submissions\nare taken on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.     The appellant submitted that Mr. Rahul Gandhi is a &#x27;public servant&#x27; as per\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/519055/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2(c)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the\ninformation which cannot be denied to the parliament or a State Legislature shall\nnot be denied to any person. He further submitted as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          &quot;Mr. Rahul Gandhi is already on bail in a criminal case, so he\n          should declare details of all passports issued to him by any country\n          in the world in his name or alias bearing photograph of Mr. Rahul\n          Gandhi, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, India. There are all\n          possibilities to jump his bail by using other passports, if, he\n          possesses more than one passport i.e. passport issued by\n          authorities of various countries. The third party information which\n          is exempted from disclosure u/<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act, 2005 is\n          not applicable in this case, as Mr. Rahul Gandhi is a public\n          representative/figure/public servant and meets any head of the\n          state out of India in the same capacity and not as an individual\n          person. Being a public servant, he is in public life and should\n          disclose all his identity, if such revelation does not harm him in\n          any manner, whatsoever. <a href=\"/doc/1994403/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 9(1)</a> of the Citizenship Act, 1955\n          provides that any citizen of India who by naturalization or\n          registration acquires the citizenship of another country shall cease\n          to be a citizen of India. Persons who acquire another citizenship\n          lose their Indian citizenship from the date on which they acquire\n          that citizenship or another country&#x27;s passport.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.     The appellant also emphasized that he has a right to know the religion of Mr.\nRahul Gandhi who is a public figure. Therefore, considering the public interest in\nthe matter, the information pertaining to his passport details and religion should be\ndisclosed to him, as no exemption is applicable in this case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"68081013\" id=\"span_2\">6.     The learned counsel, Mr. P. Roychaudhury, Advocate appearing on behalf of\nthe respondent submitted that the information pertaining to the passport details and\nreligion of Mr. Rahul Gandhi is personal in nature which attracts the exemption\navailable u/<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005. Further, he submitted that\ndisclosure of the information sought would cause unwarranted invasion of the third\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                          Page 2 of 17</span>\n party&#x27;s privacy and no any larger public interest is involved in the matter. On this\naspect, he relied on the decision dated 19-02-2014 rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble High\nCourt of Delhi in <a href=\"/doc/68081013/\" id=\"a_9\">Union of India v. R. Jayachandran, W.P.

At the outset, this Commission deems it fit to reproduce the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 which is being accordingly extracted\nhereunder:-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">        &quot;8.

Cumulative reading of plethora of decisions of this Court as\n       referred to, it is clear that if the field meant for legislature and\n       executive is left unoccupied detrimental to the public interest, this\n       Court would have ample jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 32</a> read with\n       <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 141</a> and <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_18\">142</a> of the Constitution to issue necessary directions\n       to the Executive to subserve public interest.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">       Clearly, the larger public interest in having an informed electorate, fair\nelections and creating a dialectical democracy had outweighed and compelled this\nCourt to issue the directions notwithstanding disclosure of information relating to\nthe personal assets, educational qualifications and antecedents including previous\ninvolvement in a criminal case of the contesting candidate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">72. Public interest, sometimes criticised as inherently amorphous and incapable of\na precise definition, is a time tested and historical conflict of rights test which is\noften applied in the right to information legislation to balance right to access and\nprotection of the conflicting right to deny access. In Mosley v. News Group\nPapers Ltd., 2008 EWHC 1777 (QB), it has been observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           &quot;130... It is not simply a matter of personal privacy versus the\n           public interest. The modern perception is that there is a public\n           interest in respecting personal privacy. It is thus a question of\n           taking account of conflicting public interest considerations and\n           evaluating them according to increasingly well recognized\n           criteria.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\"><a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">The RTI Act</a> is no exception. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act prescribes the\nrequirement of satisfaction of &#x27;larger public interest&#x27; for access to information\nwhen the information relates to personal information having no relationship with\nany public activity or interest, or would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of\nthe individual. Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11(1)</a> states that except in case of trade or\ncommercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public\ninterest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the\ninterest of the third party. The words &#x27;possible harm or injury&#x27; to the interest of the\nthird party is preceded by the word &#x27;importance&#x27; for the purpose of comparison.\n&#x27;Possible&#x27; in the context of the proviso does not mean something remote, far-\nfetched or hypothetical, but a calculable, foreseeable and substantial possibility of\nharm and injury to the third party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">73. Comparison or balancing exercise of competing public interests has to be\nundertaken in both sections, albeit under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> the comparison is between\npublic interest behind the exemption, that is personal information or invasion of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                            Page 4 of 17</span>\n privacy of the individual and public interest behind access to information, whereas\nthe test prescribed by the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11(1)</a> is somewhat broader and wider\nas it requires comparison between disclosure of information relating to a third\nperson or information supplied and treated as confidential by the third party and\npossible harm or injury to the third party on disclosure, which would include all\nkinds of &#x27;possible&#x27; harm and injury to the third party on disclosure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_8\">74. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_24\">Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed Hussain Abbas\nRizwi and Another</a>, (2012) 13 SCC 61, has held that the phrase &#x27;public interest&#x27;\nin <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> has to be understood in its true connotation to give complete\nmeaning to the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_26\">RTI Act</a>. However, the RTI Act does not\nspecifically identify factors to be taken into account in determining where the\npublic interest lies. Therefore, it is important to understand the meaning of the\nexpression &#x27;public interest&#x27; in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_27\">RTI Act</a>. This Court held &#x27;public\ninterest&#x27; to mean the general welfare of the public warranting the disclosure and\nthe protection applicable, in which the public as a whole has a stake, and observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">          &quot;23. The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities\n          objectively and the consequences of such disclosure have to be\n          weighed with regard to the circumstances of a given case. The\n          decision has to be based on objective satisfaction recorded for\n          ensuring that larger public interest outweighs unwarranted invasion\n          of privacy or other factors stated in the provision. Certain matters,\n          particularly in relation to appointment, are required to be dealt with\n          great confidentiality. The information may come to knowledge of\n          the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give that\n          information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and\n          fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus,\n          bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity. Similarly, there\n          may be cases where the disclosure has no relationship to any public\n          activity or interest or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of\n          privacy of the individual. All these protections have to be given\n          their due implementation as they spring from statutory exemptions.\n          It is not a decision simpliciter between private interest and public\n          interest. It is a matter where a constitutional protection is available\n          to a person with regard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public\n          interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the balance\n          factor between right to privacy and right to information with the\n          purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served\n          in the larger public interest, particularly when both these rights\n          emerge from the constitutional values under the Constitution of\n          India.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">75. Public interest in access to information refers to something that is in the interest\nof the public welfare to know. Public welfare is widely different from what is of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                             Page 5 of 17</span>\n interest to the public. &quot;Something which is of interest to the public&quot; and\n&quot;something which is in the public interest&quot; are two separate and different\nparameters. For example, the public may be interested in private matters with\nwhich the public may have no concern and pressing need to know. However, such\ninterest of the public in private matters would repudiate and directly traverse the\nprotection of privacy. The object and purpose behind the specific exemption vide\nclause (j) to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8(1)</a> is to protect and shield oneself from unwarranted access\nto personal information and to protect facets like reputation, honour, etc. associated\nwith the right to privacy. Similarly, there is a public interest in the maintenance of\nconfidentiality in the case of private individuals and even government, an aspect\nwe have already discussed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">76. The public interest test in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_29\">RTI Act</a> would mean reflecting\nupon the object and purpose behind the right to information, the right to privacy\nand consequences of invasion, and breach of confidentiality and possible harm and\ninjury that would be caused to the third party, with reference to a particular\ninformation and the person. In an article &#x27;Freedom of Information and the Public\nInterest: the Commonwealth experience&#x27; published in the Oxford University\nCommonwealth Law Journal, Published online on 28th August, 2017, the factors\nidentified as favouring disclosure, those against disclosure and lastly those\nirrelevant for consideration of public interest have been elucidated as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">        &quot;it is generally accepted that the public interest is not synonymous\n        with what is of interest to the public, in the sense of satisfying public\n        curiosity about some matter. For example, the UK Information\n        Tribunal has drawn a distinction between &#x27;matters which were in the\n        interests of the public to know and matters which were merely\n        interesting to the public (i.e. which the public would like to know\n        about, and which sell newspapers, but... are not relevant).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">             Factors identified as favouring disclosure include the public\n        interest in: contributing to a debate on a matter of public importance;\n        accountability of officials; openness in the expenditure of public\n        funds, the performance by a public authority of its regulatory\n        functions, the handling of complaints by public authorities; exposure\n        of wrongdoing, inefficiency or unfairness; individuals being able to\n        refute allegations made against them; enhancement of scrutiny of\n        decision-making; and protecting against danger to public health or\n        safety.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">             Factors that have been found to weigh against disclosure include:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        the likelihood of damage to security or international relations; the\n        likelihood of damage to the integrity or viability of decision-making\n        processes: the public interest in public bodies being able to perform\n        their functions effectively; the public interest in preserving the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                           Page 6 of 17</span>\n          privacy of individuals and the public interest in the preservation of\n         confidences.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">              Factors irrelevant to the consideration of the public interest have\n         also been identified. These include: that the information might be\n         misunderstood; that the requested information in overly technical in\n         nature; and that disclosure would result in embarrassment to the\n         government or to officials.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">77. In Campbell (supra), reference was made to the Press Complaints Commission\nCode of Practice to further elucidate on the test of public interest which stands at\nthe intersection of freedom of expression and the privacy rights of an individual to\nhold that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">         &quot;1. Public interest includes:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          (i)Detecting or exposing crime or a serious misdemeanour.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">         (ii) Protecting public health and safety.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">         (iii) Preventing the public from being misled by some statement or\n         action of an individual or organisation....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">78. Public interest has no relationship and is not connected with the number of\nindividuals adversely affected by the disclosure which may be small and\ninsignificant in comparison to the substantial number of individuals wanting\ndisclosure. It will vary according to the information sought and all circumstances\nof the case that bear upon the public interest in maintaining the exemptions and\nthose in disclosing the information must be accounted for to judge the right\nbalance. Public interest is not immutable and even time-gap may make a\nsignificant difference. The type and likelihood of harm to the public interest behind\nthe exemption and public interest in disclosure would matter. The delicate balance\nrequires identification of public interest behind each exemption and then\ncumulatively weighing the public interest in accepting or maintaining the\nexemption(s) to deny information in a particular case against the public interest in\ndisclosure in that particular case. Further, under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 11(1)</a>, reference is made to\nthe &#x27;possible&#x27; harm and injury to the third party which will also have to be factored\nin when determining disclosure of confidential information relating to the third\nparties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">79. The last aspect in the context of public interest test would be in the form of\nclarification as to the effect of sub-section (2) to <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 6</a> of the RTI Act which\ndoes not require the information seeker to give any reason for making a request for\nthe information.

This observation highlights the\n  status and importance of the right to privacy as a constitutional right. The\n  ratio as recorded in the two concurring judgments of the learned judges (R.F.\n  Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul, JJ.) are similar. It is observed that privacy\n  involves a person&#x27;s right to his physical body; right to informational privacy\n  which deals with a person&#x27;s mind; and the right to privacy of choice which\n  protects an individual&#x27;s autonomy over personal choices. While physical\n  privacy enjoys constitutional recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with\n  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a>, personal informational privacy is relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> and right\n  to privacy of choice is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_43\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25\n  of the Constitution. In the concurring opinion, there is a reference to &#x27;The\n  Right to Privacy&#x27; by Samuel Warren and Louis D. Brandeis on an individual&#x27;s\n  right to control the dissemination of personal information and that an\n  individual has a right to limit access to such information/shield such\n  information from unwarranted access. Knowledge about a person gives\n  another power over that person, as personal data collected is capable of\n  effecting representations in his decision making process and shaping\n  behaviour which can have a stultifying effect on the expression of dissent\n  which is the cornerstone of democracy. In the said concurring judgment, it has\n  been further held that the right to protection of reputation from being unfairly\n  harmed needs to be zealously guarded not only against falsehood but also\n  against certain truths by observing:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">         &quot;623.

A\n           request by a police officer that an ISP voluntarily disclose\n           such information amounts to a search.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">  Privacy and confidentiality, therefore, include information about one&#x27;s identity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">  44. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_50\">K. S.

Yet the Court has observed that there has to\n  be a careful balancing of the requirements of privacy with legitimate concerns of\n  the State after referring to an article, Richard A. Posner, &quot;Privacy, Surveillance,\n  and Law&quot;, The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), Vol. 75, 251,\n  wherein it was observed that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">  &quot;Privacy is the terrorist&#x27;s best friend, and the terrorist&#x27;s privacy has been\n  enhanced by the same technological developments that have both made data\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                          Page 10 of 17</span>\n mining feasible and elicited vast quantities of personal information from\ninnocents ...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">45.

Skopek, it is observed that distinction has been drawn between anonymity\non one hand and privacy on the other as privacy involves hiding information\nwhereas anonymity involves hiding what makes it personal by giving an\nexample that furnishing of medical records of a patient would amount to an\ninvasion of privacy, whereas a State may have legitimate interest in analysing\ndata borne from hospital records to understand and deal with a public health\nepidemic and to obviate serious impact on the population. If the anonymity of\nthe individual/patient is preserved, it would legitimately assert a valid State\ninterest in the preservation of public health.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">46. For the purpose of the present case, we are not concerned with the specific\nconnotations of the right to anonymity and the restrictions/limitations\nappended to it. In the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_51\">RTI Act</a>, suffice would be to say that the\nright to protect identity and anonymity would be identically subjected to the\npublic interest test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">47. Clause (j) to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 8</a> of the RTI Act specifically refers\nto invasion of the right to privacy of an individual and excludes from\ndisclosure information that would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of\nsuch individual, unless the disclosure would satisfy the larger public interest\ntest. This clause also draws a distinction in its treatment of personal\ninformation, whereby disclosure of such information is exempted if such\ninformation has no relation to public activity or interest. We would like to,\nhowever, clarify that in their treatment of this exemption, this Court has\ntreated the word &#x27;information&#x27; which if disclosed would lead to invasion of\nprivacy to mean personal information, as distinct from public information.\nThis aspect has been dealt with in the succeeding paragraphs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">48.

United Kingdom, (2003) EMLR 15, the European Court of\n  Human Rights had held that private life is a broad term not susceptible to\n  exhaustive definition but includes the right to establish and develop\n  relationships with other human beings such that there is a zone of interaction\n  of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the\n  scope of private life. Recognised facets of an individual&#x27;s private life include\n  a person&#x27;s health, ethnicity, personal relationships, sexual conduct; religious\n  or philosophical convictions and personal image. These facets resemble what\n  has been categorised as sensitive personal data within the meaning of the Data\n  Protection Act, 2018 as applicable in the United Kingdom.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">11. With respect to what is public and private information, the relevant\nportion is quoted as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">  &quot;50. Gleeson CJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v. Lenah Game\n  Meats Pty Ltd, (2001) 185 ALR 1, had distinguished between what is public\n  and private information in the following manner:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      &quot;An activity is not private simply because it is not done in public. It\n      does not suffice to make an act private that, because it occurs on\n      private proper property, it has such measure of protection from the\n      public gaze as the characteristics of the property, the property owner\n      combine to afford. Certain kinds of information about a person, such\n      as information relating to health, personal relationships, or finances,\n      may be easy to identify as private, as may certain kinds of activity\n      which a reasonable person, applying contemporary standards of\n      morals and behaviour, would understand to be meant to be\n      unobserved. The requirement that disclosure or observation of\n      information or conduct would be highly offensive to a reasonable\n      person of ordinary sensibilities is in many circumstances a useful\n      practical test of what is private.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">  51. This test had been adopted in several English decisions including decision\n  of the House of Lords in Campbell v. Mirror Group Newspapers Limited,\n  (2004) UKHL 22, wherein Lord Hope of Craighead had further elucidated that\n  the definition is taken from the definition of &#x27;privacy&#x27; in the United States,\n  where the right to privacy is invaded if the matter which is publicised is of a\n  kind that - (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and (b) not of\n  legitimate concern to the public. Law of privacy in Campbell (supra), it was\n  observed, was not intended for the protection of the unduly sensitive and would\n  cover matters which are offensive and objectionable to a reasonable man of\n  ordinary sensibilities who must expect some reporting of his daily activities.\n  The mind that has to be examined is not that of a reader in general, but that of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                       Page 12 of 17</span>\n the person who is affected by the publicising/dissemination of his information.\nThe question is what a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities would feel if\nhe/she is subjected to such publicity. Only when publicity is such that a\nreasonable person would feel justified in feeling seriously aggrieved that there\nwould be an invasion in the right to privacy which gives rise to a cause of\naction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">52. In Douglas (supra), it was also held that there are different degrees of\nprivacy which would be equally true for information given in confidentiality,\nand the potential for disclosure of the information to cause harm is an\nimportant factor to be taken into account in the assessment of the extent of the\nrestriction to protect the right to privacy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">53. While clause (j) exempts disclosure of two kinds of information, as noted\nin paragraph 47 above, that is &quot;personal information&quot; with no relation to public\nactivity or interest and &quot;information&quot; that is exempt from disclosure to prevent\nunwarranted invasion of privacy, this Court has not underscored, as will be\nseen below, such distinctiveness and treated personal information to be exempt\nfrom disclosure if such disclosure invades on balance the privacy rights,\nthereby linking the former kind of information with the latter kind. This means\nthat information, which if disclosed could lead to an unwarranted invasion of\nprivacy rights, would mean personal information, that is, which is not having\nco-relation with public information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">54. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_22\">In <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_53\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.

It was observed that the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act\nin such cases has to be followed. The matter was remitted to examine the\naspect of larger public interest and to follow the procedure prescribed under\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act which, it was held, was mandatory.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">58. Reference can also be made to Aditya Bandopadhyay (supra), as\ndiscussed earlier in paragraph 32, where this Court has held that while a\nfiduciary could not withhold information from the beneficiary in whose\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                     Page 14 of 17</span>\n        benefit he holds such information, he/she owed a duty to the beneficiary to\n       not disclose the same to anyone else. This exposition of the Court equally\n       reconciles the right to know with the rights to privacy under clause (j) to\n       <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">       59. Reading of the aforesaid judicial precedents, in our opinion, would\n       indicate that personal records, including name, address, physical, mental and\n       psychological status, marks obtained, grades and answer sheets, are all treated\n       as personal information. Similarly, professional records, including\n       qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary\n       proceedings, etc. are all personal information. Medical records, treatment,\n       choice of medicine, list of hospitals and doctors visited, findings recorded,\n       including that of the family members, information relating to assets,\n       liabilities, income tax returns, details of investments, lending and borrowing,\n       etc. are personal information. Such personal information is entitled to\n       protection from unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional access is\n       available when stipulation of larger public interest is satisfied. This list is\n       indicative and not exhaustive.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68081013\" id=\"span_28\">12. This Commission also takes note of the legal principle enunciated by the Hon&#x27;ble\n    Delhi High Court regarding non-disclosure of third party passport details in\n    <a href=\"/doc/68081013/\" id=\"a_64\">Union of India v. R. Jayachandran, WP (C</a>) 3406/2012 dated 19-02-2014 as\n    follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">         &quot;10. This Court also finds that the observations given by learned Single\n         Judge in the batch of writ petitions being W.P.(C) 2232/2012 are without\n         taking into account the binding provisions of <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_65\">Sections 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/153929/\" id=\"a_66\">19(4)</a> of the\n         RTI Act. In particular the learned Single Judge erred in observing in\n         W.P.(C) 1677/2012 that passport number is not a personal information. This\n         Court is in agreement with Mr. Tiku&#x27;s submission that as to who generates a\n         third party information, is totally irrelevant. After all passport number is not\n         only personal information but also an identification proof, specifically when\n         one travels abroad.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">         11. This Court is also of the view that if passport number of a third party is\n         furnished to an applicant, it can be misused. For instance, if the applicant\n         were to lodge a report with the police that a passport bearing a particular\n         number is lost, the Passport Authority would automatically revoke the same\n         without knowledge and to the prejudice of the third party.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">    13. From the foregoing, this Commission observes that the contentions put forth\n    by the appellant with regards to &#x27;public interest&#x27; element on the premise of Mr.\n    Rahul Gandhi being a public figure does not stand a chance for disclosure of his\n    personal information such as religion and passport details. Furthermore, the\n    appellant has also failed to substantiate that the information sought is in line with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                              Page 15 of 17</span>\n the proviso appended to <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005. Hence, in the\nabsence of any larger public interest in the matter, this Commission comes to a\nconclusion that the information sought by the appellant qualifies to be the\n&#x27;personal information&#x27; of third party which is exempted under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of\nthe RTI Act, 2005 and therefore, it cannot be provided to the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">14.
