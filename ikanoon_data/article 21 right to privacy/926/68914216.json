It is the human concept of the Lord of\n         the Lords - it is the human vision of the Lord of the\n         Lords: How one sees the deity: how one feels the deity\n         and recognises the deity and then establishes the same in\n         the   temple     upon         however   performance   of   the\n         consecration ceremony. Shastras do provide as to how to\n         consecrate and the usual ceremonies of Sankalpa and\n         Utsarga shall have to be performed for proper and\n         effective dedication of the property to a deity and in\n         order to be termed as a juristic person. In the conception\n         of Debutter, two essential ideas are required to be\n         performed: In the first place, the property which is\n         dedicated to the deity vests in an ideal sense in the deity\n         itself as a juristic person and in the second place, the\n         personality of the idol being linked up with natural\n         personality of the shebait, being the manager or being\n         the Dharam karta and who is entrusted with the custody\n         of the idol and who is responsible otherwise for\n         preservation of the property of the idol.

A simple piece\n            of wood or stone may become the image or idol and\n            divinity is attributed to the same. As noticed above, it is\n            formless, shapeless but it is the human concept of a\n            particular divine existence which gives it the shape, the\n            size and the colour.

Essentially, every human person\n         is a person. If we trace the history of a &quot;Person&quot; in the\n         various countries we find surprisingly it has projected\n         differently at different times. In some countries even\n         human beings were not treated to be as persons in law.\n         Under the Roman Law a &quot;Slave&quot; was not a person. He\n         had no right to a family. He was treated like an animal\n         or chattel. In French Colonies also, before slavery was\n         abolished, the slaves were not treated to be legal\n         persons. They were later given recognition as legal\n         persons only through a statute. Similarly, in the U.S. the\n         African-Americans had no legal rights though they were\n         not treated as chattel.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                       xxx               xxx      xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">         13.

Legal persons, being the arbitrary\n         creations of the law, may be of as many kinds as the law\n         pleases. Those which are actually recognised by our own\n         system, however, are of comparatively few types.\n         Corporations are undoubtedly legal persons, and the\n         better view is that registered trade unions and friendly\n         societies are also legal persons though not verbally\n         regarded as corporations. ... If, however, we take\n         account of other systems than our own, we find that the\n         conception of legal personality is not so limited in its\n         application, and that there are several distinct varieties,\n         of which three may be selected for special mention...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">         1. The first class of legal persons consists of\n         corporations, as already defined, namely, those which\n         are constituted by the personification of groups or series\n         of individuals.

The law may, if it pleases,\n         regard a church or a hospital, or a university, or a\n         library, as a person.

Legal persons are all\n         entities capable of being right-and-duty-bearing units -\n         all entities recognised by the law as capable of being\n         parties to legal relationship. Salmond said: &#x27;So far as\n         legal theory is concerned, a person is any being whom\n         the law regards as capable of rights and duties...\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">         ...Legal personality may be granted to entities other than\n         individual human beings, e.g. a group of human beings,\n         a fund, an idol. Twenty men may form a corporation\n         which may sue and be sued in the corporate name. An\n         idol may be regarded as a legal persona in itself, or a\n         particular fund may be incorporated. It is clear that\n         neither the idol nor the fund can carry out the activities\n         incidental to litigation or other activities incidental to\n         the carrying on of legal relationships, e.g., the signing of\n         a contract: and, of necessity, the law recognises certain\n         human agents as representatives of the idol or of the\n         fund. The acts of such agents, however (within limits set\n         by the law and when they are acting as such), are\n         imputed to the legal persona of the idol and are not the\n                           27 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                28</span>\n\n         juristic acts of the human agents themselves. This is no\n         mere academic distinction, for it is the legal persona of\n         the idol that is bound to the legal relationships created,\n         not that of the agent. Legal personality then refers to the\n         particular device by which the law creates or recognizes\n         units to which it ascribes certain powers and\n         capacities.&quot; Analytical and Historical Jurisprudence,\n         3rd Edn. At page 357 describes &quot;person&quot;;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">         We may, therefore, define a person for the purpose of\n         jurisprudence as any entity (not necessarily a human\n         being) to which rights or duties may be attributed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">         14. Thus, it is well settled and confirmed by the\n         authorities on jurisprudence and Courts of various\n         countries that for a bigger thrust of socio-political-\n         scientific   development      evolution       of   a   fictional\n         personality to be a juristic person became inevitable.\n         This may be any entity, living inanimate, objects or\n         things. It may be a religious institution or any such\n         useful unit which may impel the Courts to recognise it.\n         This recognition is for subserving the needs and faith of\n         the society. A juristic person, like any other natural\n         person is in law also conferred with rights and\n         obligations and is dealt with in accordance with law. In\n         other words, the entity acts like a natural person but\n         only through a designated person, whose acts are\n         processed within the ambit of law. When an idol, was\n         recognised as a juristic person, it was known it could not\n         act by itself. As in the case of minor a guardian is\n         appointed, so in the case of idol, a Shebait or manager is\n         appointed to act on its behalf. In that sense, relation\n         between an idol and Shebait is akin to that of a minor\n         and a guardian. As a minor cannot express himself, so\n         the idol, but like a guardian, the Shebait and manager\n                           28 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             29</span>\n\n            have limitations under which they have to act. Similarly,\n            where there is any endowment for charitable purpose it\n            can create institutions like a church hospital, gurudwara\n            etc. The entrustment of an endowed fund for a purpose\n            can only be used by the person so entrusted for that\n            purpose in as much as he receives it for that purpose\n            alone in trust. When the donor endows for an Idol or for\n            a mosque or for any institution, it necessitates the\n            creation of a juristic person. The law also circumscribes\n            the rights of any person receiving such entrustment to\n            use it only for the purpose of such a juristic person. The\n            endowment may be given for various purposes, may be\n            for a church, idol, gurdwara or such other things that\n            the human faculty may conceive of, out of faith and\n            conscience but it gains the status of juristic person when\n            it is recognised by the society as such.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"608365\" id=\"span_64\">68.

Considerations, which are\n         relevant to determine whether the suffering is unnecessary,\n         include whether the suffering could have reasonably been\n         avoided or reduced, whether the conduct which caused the\n         suffering was in compliance with any relevant enactment.\n         Another aspect to be examined is whether the conduct causing\n         the suffering was for a legitimate purpose, such as, the purpose\n         for benefiting the animals or the purpose of protecting a person,\n                           32 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\"> CRR-533-2013                                                               33</span>\n\n         property or another animal, etc. Duty is to prevent the infliction\n         of unnecessary pain or suffering, meaning thereby, no right is\n         conferred to inflict necessary/unnecessary pain or suffering on\n         the animals. By organising Jallikattu and bullock cart race, the\n         organisers are not preventing the infliction of unnecessary pain\n         or suffering, but they are inflicting pain and suffering on the\n         bulls, which they are legally obliged to prevent. <a href=\"/doc/14744790/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 3</a> is a\n         preventive provision casting no right on the organisers, but\n         only duties and obligations. <a href=\"/doc/14744790/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 3</a>, as already indicated,\n         confers corresponding rights on the animals as against the\n         persons in charge or care, as well as AWBI, to ensure their\n         well-being and be not inflicted with any unnecessary pain or\n         suffering. Jallikattu or bullock cart race, from the point of the\n         animals, is not an event ensuring their well-being or an event\n         meant to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering,\n         on the contrary, it is an event against their well-being and\n         causes unnecessary pain and suffering on them. Hence, the two\n         limbs of <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 3</a> of the PCA Act have been violated while\n         conducting Jallikattu and bullock cart race.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">         40. Pain and suffering are biological traits. Pain, in particular,\n         informs an animal which specific stimuli, it needs to avoid and\n         an animal has pain receptors and a memory that allows it to\n         remember what caused the pain. Professor of Animal Welfare,\n         D.M. Broom of the University of Cambridge in his articles\n         appearing in chapter fourteen of the book Animal Welfare and\n         the Law, Cambridge University Press (1989) says:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">          &quot;Behavioural responses to pain vary greatly from one species\n         to another, but it is reasonable to suppose that the pain felt by\n         all of these animals is similar to that felt by man.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">         Suffering has the same function, but instead of informing the\n         animal about stimuli to avoid, it informs it about a situation to\n         avoid. An animal might be regarded as suffering, if it is in pain,\n         distress,   or    acute       or   unduly     prolonged   discomfort.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_133\">                           33 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                34</span>\n\n         Consequently, to experience the suffering, the animal needs an\n         awareness of its environment, the ability to develop moods that\n         coordinate a behavioural response, and the capacity to change\n         adverse situation or avoid them. Reports submitted by AWBI\n         clearly indicate that bulls are being treated with extreme cruelty\n         and suffering, violating the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/101749505/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 11(1)</a> of the\n         PCA Act.

We may, at the outset, indicate unfortunately, there is no\n         international agreement that ensures the welfare and protection\n         of animals. The United Nations, all these years, safeguarded\n         only the rights of human beings, not the rights of other species\n\n                             34 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\"> CRR-533-2013                                                          35</span>\n\n         like animals, ignoring the fact that many of them, including\n         bulls, are sacrificing their lives to alleviate human suffering,\n         combating diseases and as food for human consumption.\n         International community should hang their head in shame, for\n         not recognising their rights all these ages, a species which\n         served the humanity from the time of Adam and Eve. Of\n         course, there has been a slow but observable shift from the\n         anthropocentric approach to a more nature&#x27;s rights centric\n         approach in international environmental law, animal welfare\n         laws, etc. Environmentalist noticed three stages in the\n         development of international environmental law instrument,\n         which are as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">         (a) The First Stage: Human self-interest reason for\n         environmental protection\n         57.1. The instruments in this stage were fuelled by the\n         recognition that the conservation of nature was in the common\n         interest of all mankind.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_139\">         57.2. Some of the instruments executed during this time\n         included the Declaration of the Protection of Birds Useful to\n         Agriculture (1875), Convention Designed to Ensure the\n         Protection of Various Species of Wild Animals which are\n         Useful to Man or Inoffensive (1900), Convention for the\n         Regulation of Whaling (1931) which had the objective of\n         ensuring the health of the whaling industry rather than\n         conserving or protecting the whale species.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">         57.3. The attitude behind these treaties was the assertion of an\n         unlimited right to exploit natural resources--which derived\n         from their right as sovereign nations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">         (b) The Second Stage: International Equity\n\n         57.4.

This shift signalled a\n\n                           35 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             36</span>\n\n         departure from the pure tenets of anthropocentrism.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">         57.5. For example, the 1946 Whaling Convention which built\n         upon the 1931 treaty mentioned in the Preamble that &quot;it is in\n         the interest of the nations of the world to safeguard for future\n         generations the great natural resource represented by the whale\n         stocks&quot;. Similarly, the Stockholm Declaration of the UN\n         embodied this shift in thinking, stating that &quot;man ... bears a\n         solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment\n         for present and future generations&quot; and subsequently asserts\n         that &quot;the natural resources of the earth ... must be safeguarded\n         for the benefit of present and future generations through careful\n         planning and management&quot;.

Based on ecocentric principles, rights of animals have been\n         recognised in various countries. Protection of animals has been\n         guaranteed by the Constitution of Germany by way of an\n         amendment in 2002 when the words &quot;and the animals&quot; were\n         added to the constitutional clauses that obliges &quot;State&quot; to\n         respect &quot;animal dignity&quot;. Therefore, the dignity of the animals\n         is constitutionally recognised in that country. German Animal\n         Welfare Law, especially <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 3</a> provides far-reaching\n         protections to animals including inter alia from animals fight\n         and other activities which may result in the pain, suffering and\n         harm for the animals. Countries like Switzerland, Austria,\n         Slovenia have enacted legislations to include animal welfare in\n         their national Constitutions so as to balance the animal owners&#x27;\n         fundamental rights to property and the animals&#x27; interest in\n         freedom from unnecessary suffering or pain, damage and fear.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">         60. The Animals Welfare Act of 2006 (UK) also confers\n         considerable protection to the animals from pain and suffering.\n         The Austrian Federal Animal Protection Act also recognises\n         man&#x27;s responsibilities towards his fellow creatures and the\n         subject &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1726510/\" id=\"a_57\">Federal Act</a>&quot; aims at the protection of life and well-\n         being of the animals.

Natural\n            persons are those animate beings which possess a capacity to\n            own legal rights and to owe legal duties; artificial persons are\n            those inanimate entities which possess such a capacity.\n            Artificial persons are sometimes also described as &#x27;legal&#x27; or\n            &#x27;juristic&#x27; persons, but this usage can be confusing, as the latter\n            terms are also used of both animate beings and inanimate\n            entities, to denote the fact that they have an existence as legal\n            actors, rather than the fact that they exist only in the legal, and\n            not in the biologicial sphere.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">            (b) Natural persons\n            3.19 The only animate beings currently recognized by English\n            law as natural persons are human beings. Other animals have\n            not been thought capable of bearing legal responsibility for\n            their actions since the thirteenth century, although the idea\n            that a non-human animal or indeed an inanimate object should\n            itself be punished for causing the death of a human being\n            underlay the old rule, which was not abolished until 1846, that\n                             49 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">           ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\"> CRR-533-2013                                                               50</span>\n\n         in such circumstances the animal or object should be forfeit as\n         &#x27;deodand&#x27; to the Crown or other franchise-holder. English law\n         has never regarded non-human animals as possessing the\n         capacity to enjoy legal rights, although the argument has been\n         made by some theorists that in principle they should be\n         regarded as possessing this capacity. In the case of human\n         beings, English law assigns them &#x27;status&#x27;, or standing in law,\n         according to their individual attributes and characteristics,\n         and a human being&#x27;s legal rights and duties are then\n         determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to relevant\n         aspects of his status. Thus, for example, a human being&#x27;s\n         capacity to enter a contract can be affected by whether he is a\n         minor or full age, bankrupt or solvent, mentally capable or\n         incapable.     Questions      going    to     the   attributes   and\n         characteristics of a human being which may or may not have\n         legal significance in different circumstances include: (i) has he\n         been born? (ii) has he acquired full age? (iii) has he died? (iv)\n         what is his gender? (v) is he legitimate, illegitimate, or\n         adopted? (vi) is he single, married, divorced, or in an\n         unmarried cohabiting relation (heterosexual or homosexual)?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">         (vii) is he a British citizen, a foreign national, a foreign\n         diplomat, or a refugee?

However, the theory\n         that the ship is the real defendant in an Admiralty action in\n         rem fell into decline after 1873, and the only bodies now\n         recognized by English law as artificial persons are &#x27;groups or\n                           50 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             51</span>\n\n         series of [human] individuals&#x27;, conceptualized as abstract\n         entities, but possessing &#x27;an essentially animate content&#x27;. Thus,\n         English law currently ascribes artificial personality to certain\n         private groups of associates, as discussed in the following\n         parts of this chapter, to various public bodies, religious bodies,\n         and their officers, and also to various foreign states and\n         international organizations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">         However, &#x27;formidable conceptual difficulties&#x27; would lie in the\n         English courts&#x27; way if they wished to recognize a tangible\n         inanimate object as an artificial person, &#x27;something [like a\n         Hindu temple] which on one view is little more than a pile of\n         stones&#x27;. They would also find it difficult to permit an action by\n         or against an abstraction such as a fund of money, for as a\n         general rule this is &#x27;a form of proceeding unknown to English\n         law&#x27;. Thus, for example, English law does not consider a trust\n         estate to possess the capacity to sue or be sued, and requires\n         trust funds to be vested in trustees with the personal capacity\n         to sue (and to be sued) in their own names in the course of\n         administering the trust business, executors and administrators\n         (collectively termed personal representatives) perform a\n         similar function with respect to a deceased person&#x27;s estate, as\n         do receivers and liquidators when a company goes into\n         receivership or liquidation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">         (d) The nature of personality\n         3.22 Many legal theorists have written on the nature of\n         personality, and have addressed themselves to such questions\n         as whether personality entails anything more than the\n         possession of a set of duty-owing, right-owning capacities, and\n         whether the possession of such capacities is necessarily a legal\n         construct or can derive from some extra-legal source.\n         Questions of this sort do not often strike the English courts as\n         having a practical bearing on the cases which they must\n         decide, and even when they declare themselves to be\n         &#x27;concerned with abstract jurisprudential concepts [so far as\n         these] assist towards clarity of thought&#x27;, they generally recoil\n                           51 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\"> CRR-533-2013                                                               52</span>\n\n         from discussing them in any detail. In consequence, they have\n         not often expressly considered, still less committed themselves\n         to, any particular jurisprudential theory of personality.\n         However, it has rightly been observed that &#x27;realist theories of\n         the company in which the company is viewed as a real person\n         have had a limited influence on the development of [English\n         company law, by comparison with]... Continental Europe,\n         where that theory has been much more significant&#x27;, and some\n         recent judicial statements confirm that the English courts have\n         no liking for realist theories of artificial personality in general.\n         3.23 In Bumper Development Corp Ltd. v Metropolitan Police\n         Commissioner, Purchas LJ approved the statement in Salmond\n         on Jurisprudence, that [artificial] persons, being the arbitrary\n         creations of the law, may be of as many kinds as the law\n         pleases&#x27;, and went on to hold that a Hindu temple recognized\n         as an artificial person by the law of Tamil Nadu could\n         therefore be a party to proceedings in the English courts, even\n         though it would not be recognized as a person by English Law.\n         In Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities\n         Commission, Lord Hoffmann stated that &#x27;a company exists\n         because there is [legal] rule... which says that a persona ficta\n         shall be deeded to exist,&#x27; and that although &#x27;a reference to\n         company...[there] is in fact no such thing as the company as\n         such, no Ding an sich, only the applicable rules&#x27; which enable\n         the shareholders of the company to conduct their collective\n         activities through the medium of the corporate form.

First, the\n         question whether a human being or abstract entity should be\n         regarded as possessing the capacity to enforce a particular\n         right, or to owe a particular duty, is one that lawmakers can\n         rationally answer by considering the nature of the right or duty\n         in question, by looking at the character of the fruitfully, have\n         approached the question by considering instead whether it lies\n         in the public interest to fix a company with criminal liability\n         for, say, personal injuries or deaths caused by particular types\n         of corporate actions or omissions; on a positive answer being\n         given, they could then have formulated a new set of rules to\n         govern the determination of corporate liability in terms\n         reflecting the reality that human being or entity in question,\n         and by assessing in the light of these matters, whether it would\n         be consistent with the goals of society at large, and of the legal\n         system in particular, to give a positive answer. But the need to\n         approach the question in this way can be overlooked if the\n         terms &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;personality&#x27; are used carelessly. A human\n         being or entity which has been said by Parliament or the courts\n         to be capable of enforcing a particular right, or of owing a\n         particular duty, can properly be described as a person with\n         that particular capacity. But it can be easy to forget the\n         qualifier, and to assume when the question later arises,\n         whether the individual or entity has the further capacity to\n         enforce some other right, or to owe some other duty, that this\n         must be so because he or it has previously been said to be a\n         person with an unlimited set of capacities, or to be a person\n\n                           53 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\"> CRR-533-2013                                                               54</span>\n\n            who possesses the &#x27;powers normally attendant on legal\n            personality&#x27;. In other words, the careless use of the terms\n            &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;personality&#x27; can create the false impression that\n            a particular human being or entity has been said to possess a\n            larger set of right-owning, duty-owning capacities than is in\n            fact the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">            3.25 Thus, for example, English registered companies are\n            frequently said to possess &#x27;personality&#x27;, but it would be wrong\n            to infer from this that they necessarily possess the capacity to\n            enjoy a privilege against self-incrimination, or the capacity to\n            perjure themselves, or the capacity to be the subject of\n            defamatory statements, or the capacity to enjoy a right to\n            privacy under <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 8</a> of the European Convention on Human\n            Rights. Whether they possess these or any other capacities\n            must be considered from first principles when the question\n            arises. To say that a human being or entity possesses the\n            &#x27;powers normally attendant on legal personality&#x27; is to suggest\n            that the ascription of personality entails the ascription of a\n            generally agreed and particularized set of capacities,\n            possession of which can be safely assumed of every natural\n            and artificial person. But this is not so. Different human beings\n            and entities may properly be characterized as natural or\n            artificial persons for different purposes even though they\n            possess different capacities from one another.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">75.

According to Jeffrey Kluger, writing\n         in Time magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s well established that elephants appear\n         to mourn their dead. They will linger over a family member&#x27;s\n         body with what looks like sorrow, and African elephants have a\n         burial ritual, covering dead relatives&#x27; bodies with leaves and\n         dirt. Elephants show great interest-some scientists suggest it\n         may even be respect-when they come across the bones of dead\n         elephants, examining them closely, with particular attention to\n         the skull and tusks.&quot; Similarly, great apes will remain close to a\n         dead troop mate for days. There are stories from Africa and\n         Asia of elephant herds and tigers taking revenge on targeted\n         human settlements or hunters for having slaughtered members\n         of their families, stolen their food, or attempted to kill them.\n         Baby elephants sometimes throw what can only be described as\n         temper tantrums if their mothers deny them milk. In addition to\n         observation, scientists can now use physiological data to track\n         changes in the emotional state of animals.

Humans were supposed to have the biggest\n         brains, and thus the gold medal, in animal intelligence. Not so\n         fast. The brains of Homo sapiens are outweighed by those of\n         dolphins, elephants and whales. In our defence, we cunningly\n         deemed brain weight to be an unfair comparison, so we\n         calculated brainto-body-weight ratios. Then the tree shrew\n         bests us, so that can&#x27;t be right.

Dolphins not only have big\n         brains, but possess extraordinary abilities such as sonar or\n         echolocation, with which they send out sound waves that\n         bounce back as echoes, providing extensive information about\n         their surroundings. Echolocation enables dolphins to &quot;see&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_190\">         through solid objects, like a superhero&#x27;s Xray vision. For\n         example, dolphins can tell if another dolphin, or a human, is\n         pregnant, using their sonar to detect two separate heartbeats. A\n         few years ago, scientists discovered that dolphin brains contain\n         large numbers of specialized spindle neurons, previously\n         thought to be unique to great apes. These neurons are believed\n         to rapidly transmit important social/emotional information. In\n         fact, dolphins&#x27; brains have more spindle neurons than humans&#x27;.\n         Dale Peterson writes in The Moral Lives of Animals that\n         dolphins &quot;have excellent memories and high levels of social\n         and self-awareness, are excellent at mimicking the behavior of\n         others and can respond to symbolic presentations, form\n         complex and creatively adaptive social systems, and show a\n         broad capacity for the cultural transmission of learned\n         behaviours.&quot; In short, dolphins are really smart.\n         The phrase &quot;bird brain&quot; has long been employed as a put-down,\n         but may now be seen as a compliment. In 2004, scientists\n         completely renamed the parts of avian brains based on new\n         knowledge about their evolution. The brains of birds, contrary\n         to previous understanding, are structurally similar to mammal\n         brains. Despite having relatively small brains, crows, ravens,\n         and jays--members of the corvid family--have proven to be\n         talented problem solvers and tool users. In one experiment, a\n         New Caledonian crow overcame a series of eight obstacles\n         before acquiring a piece of aluminum and bending it with\n         uncanny accuracy into a hook that it used to retrieve a morsel\n         of food. The crow accomplished this feat on its first attempt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_191\">                           56 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\"> CRR-533-2013                                                           57</span>\n\n         Intelligence is not limited to primates, cetaceans, and birds.\n         Archerfish can instantly calculate complicated mathematics of\n         distance, speed, and time when blasting their prey with jets of\n         water.

In his best- 32 seller The Parrot&#x27;s\n         Lament, Eugene Linden chronicles acts of deception by parrots,\n         elephants, orangutans, dolphins, and hawks. Some birds feign\n         injury to lead predators away from their nests. Jays will not\n         cache food when other animals are watching, or will\n         subsequently re-cache the food in a different location.\n         Chimpanzees and gorillas will pretend not to notice desired\n         food items when accompanied by more dominant members of\n         their family. The less dominant primates will return later,\n         unaccompanied, to collect the food. The zone-tailed hawk\n         imitates the flying style of a vulture, a scavenger that poses no\n         threat to other birds, then dives to attack unsuspecting birds.\n         These uses of deception suggest that some species may have\n         the ability to understand what other animals are thinking.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">         Self-Awareness\n         Self-awareness refers to the ability to recognize oneself as an\n         individual distinct from the environment and other individuals.\n         In 1838, Charles Darwin watched an orangutan at the London\n         Zoo looking at herself in a mirror. He naturally wondered what\n         she was thinking. More than a century later, scientists inspired\n         by Darwin began placing animals in front of mirrors to explore\n         the question of self-awareness. Animals are marked on their\n         head or body (with paint or a sticker, for example) and then\n         exposed to a mirror.

Experiments indicate that dolphins, orcas, Eurasian\n         magpies, elephants, and some primates recognize themselves in\n         mirrors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">         Other scientists bristle at the notion that animals responding to\n         seeking themselves in a mirror should be an indicator that they\n         possess self-awareness. For example, in Beyond Words,\n         conservationist Carl Safina argues that the day-to-day behavior\n         of many different species provides clear evidence of self-\n         awareness. He concludes that &quot;maybe a mirror is mainly a test\n         for which species is the greatest marcissist.&quot;\n         Altruism\n         Altruism involves behavior benefitting someone who is not a\n         close relative, despite some personal cost or risk. Field\n         researchers in Africa have observed chimpanzees assisting\n         unrelated chimps without expecting favours in return. Lab tests\n         done decades ago demonstrated that rhesus monkeys will\n         consistently choose to go hungry if their decision to secure\n         food would result in another unrelated rhesus monkey being\n         subjected to an electrical shock. Dolphins have saved humans\n         and seals from sharks and helped rescue whales stranded on\n         rocks or beaches. In The Moral Lives of Animals, Dale\n         Peterson recounts stories of a wild elephant in Kenya that\n         defended an injured man from a herd of wild buffalo, a bonobo\n         in an English zoo that saved a starling that had crashed into a\n         window, and a gorilla at Chicago&#x27;s Brookfield Zoo that rescued\n         a three-year old who fell into her exhibit, landing on a concrete\n         floor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">         In 2016, the journal Marine Mammal Research published a\n         remarkable article about the seemingly altruistic behavior of\n         humpback whales.

They are scientist creatures, not\n         machines. As humans, we may never fully understand the\n         intelligence, emotions, or morality of other species. We can\n         study other types of animals, observe their behavior, analyze\n         their DNA, carry out sophisticated experiments, and attempt to\n         imagine what goes on inside their minds, but knowing is\n         probably an impossible task.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_196\">         In 2012, a multi-disciplinary group of scientists who study how\n         brains   work     produced     the   Cambridge      Declaration   on\n         Consciousness, stating, &quot;The weight of evidence indicates that\n         humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates\n         that generate consciousness.

Scientist Philip Low,\n         one of the authors of the declaration, said that numerous\n         colleagues approached him afterwards and said, &quot;We were all\n         thinking this, but were afraid to say it.&quot; Reviewing the\n         evidence, the New York Times concluded, &quot;The overwhelming\n         tendency of all this scientific work, of its results, has been\n         toward more consciousness.

With the development of the society where the interaction of\n\nindividuals fell short to upsurge the social development, the concept of\n\njuristic person was devised and created by human laws for the purposes of\n\nthe society. A juristic person, like any other natural person is in law also\n\nconferred with rights and obligations and is dealt with in accordance with\n\nlaw. In other words, the entity acts like a natural person but only through a\n\ndesignated person, as their Lordships have held in the judgments cited\n\nhereinabove, that for a bigger thrust of socio-political- scientific\n\ndevelopment, evolution of a fictional personality to be a juristic person\n\nbecomes inevitable. This may be any entity, living inanimate, objects or\n\nthings. It may be a religious institution or any such useful unit which may\n\nimpel the Courts to recognise it. This recognition is for subserving the needs\n\nand faith of the society.

The Jataka tales\n         hold up the noble qualities of various animals as examples to\n         emulate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">         The Dhyani Buddhas and their vehicles are\n         •   Amitabha- peacock\n         •   Akshobhya-Elephant\n         •   Raktayamari-Buffalo\n         •   Vairochana- Lion or Dragon\n         •   Marichi Ashokakanta- Pig\n         •   Arya Marichi-Pig\n         •   Marichi Pichuva- Chariot of Seven Pigs\n                           67 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             68</span>\n\n         •   Dashabhujasita Marichi- Chariot of Seven Pigs\n         •   Amoghasiddhi- Eagle\n         •   Ratnasambhava- Lion\n         The aspects of Boddhisattava Manjushri with animal vehicles\n         include\n         •   Manjughosha- Lion\n         •   Vagishvara-Lion\n         •   Manjuvara- Lion\n         •   Vadirata- Tiger\n         The aspects of Boddhisatta Avalokiteshvara with animal\n         vehicles include\n         •   Simhanada- Lion\n         •   Harihariharivahana- Lion and eagle\n         •   Vajradharma- Peacock.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">         Following animals are sacred to Hindus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">         •   Blackbuck and Blue bull are considered as sacred.\n         •     The antelope is also the vehicle of Soma.

Korsgaard has discussed the concept of\n\nconferring status of personhood on the animals as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">            &quot;But it may be argued that those who make this proposal are\n            ignoring something important about the concept of a person. It\n            has generally been assumed that &quot;personhood,&quot; whatever it is,\n            is, or is based on, an attribute that is characteristic of human\n            beings, and not of the other animals. In the philosophical\n            tradition, the most common candidate for the 39 attribute that\n            establishes &quot;personhood&quot; is rationality, but understood in a\n            specific sense. Rationality is sometimes loosely identified with\n            the ability to choose intelligently between options or to solve\n            problems by taking thought, but those are attributes that human\n            beings arguably share with many other animals. The more\n            specific sense of &quot;rationality&quot; refers to a normative capacity, a\n            capacity to assess the grounds of our beliefs and actions, and to\n            adjust them accordingly. On the side of action, for instance, it is\n            the capacity to ask whether something that would potentially\n            motivate you to perform a certain action is really a reason for\n            doing that action - and then to be motivated to act in\n            accordance with the answer that you get. Rationality, in this\n            sense, is normative self-government, the capacity to be\n            governed by thoughts about what you ought to do or to believe.\n            In fact, even some thinkers who would deny that rationality is\n            the distinctive characteristic of humanity would still agree that\n            normative selfgovernment is both definitive of personhood and\n            distinctive of humanity. In the empiricist tradition, the tradition\n            of Locke, Hume, and Hutcheson, it has been common to\n            attribute to human beings, and human beings alone, a capacity\n            to form so-called &quot;second-order&quot; attitudes - for instance,\n            attitudes towards our own desires - that make them liable to\n            normative assessment. Though I may desire to do something, I\n            may also disapprove of that desire, and reject its influence over\n            me. According to empiricists, second order attitudes are what\n            make human beings subject to an &quot;ought.&quot; So many\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_228\">                              70 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">            ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             71</span>\n\n         philosophers have agreed that it is in virtue of normative self-\n         government that human beings count as persons in the legal and\n         moral sense.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">         Certainly, if something along these lines is correct, it is natural\n         to think that only human beings can have obligations. In order\n         to have obligations, you need to be able to think about whether\n         what you are doing is right, and to adjust your conduct\n         accordingly. This requires a highly developed &quot;theory of mind,&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">         as ethologists call it. An animal has a theory of mind when the\n         animal knows that animals (herself included) have mental\n         attitudes, such as beliefs and desires. But in order to be rational\n         in the sense I just described, an animal must not only know that\n         she and other animals have mental attitudes. She must also\n         know that her attitudes are connected in certain ways - for\n         instance, that she is inclined to perform a certain action because\n         she has a certain desire. To ask whether you have a good reason\n         for doing what you propose to do, or whether it is right, is to\n         think about and evaluate that connection, and it seems likely\n         that only human beings can do that.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">         But it is a much harder question whether being rational in this\n         sense is necessary for having rights, and that is the question\n         most pressing from the point of view of those who seek legal\n         protections for animals. The traditional distinction between\n         persons and things groups the ability to have rights and the\n         liability to having obligations together. One common view\n         about why that should be so is that rights are grounded in some\n         sort of agreement that is reciprocal: I agree to respect certain\n         claims of yours, provided that you respect certain similar claims\n         of mine. The view of society as based on a kind of social\n         contract supports such a conception of rights. But in fact our\n         laws do not merely protect those who as citizens are involved in\n         making its laws: rather, they protect anyone who shares the\n         interests that the laws were made to protect. So for instance,\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">                           71 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             72</span>\n\n         foreigners on our soil have rights not to be robbed or murdered,\n         regardless of the fact that they are not parties to our own social\n         contract. The laws that we make against murder and robbery are\n         intended to protect certain human interests that foreigners share\n         with citizens, and that is sufficient to give them the relevant\n         rights. Of course, foreigners on our soil can also be made to\n         conform to our laws - reciprocity can be required of them. But\n         when we speak of universal human rights, we speak of interests\n         that are shared by every human being and that we think ought\n         to be protected, not merely of the interests protected under\n         some actual social contract. So it makes sense to raise the\n         question whether the other animals share the kinds of interests\n         that our laws - either legal or moral - are meant to protect.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_231\">         What is distinctive of animal life is the way that it functions,\n         which is by means of perception and action. Through\n         perception, an animal forms some sort of representation of her\n         environment. As a result of instinct, learning, and in the case of\n         some animals, intelligent thought, objects in the animal&#x27;s\n         environment are represented as desirable or aversive in specific\n         ways: as something to eat, or to flee from, or to mate with, or to\n         take care of. Or some sort of practical representation may arise\n         from within, as when you get hungry and find yourself\n         irresistibly thinking about a sandwich. The animal then acts in\n         accordance with these practical representations. The practical\n         representations serve, though very imperfectly of course, to\n         enable an animal to get what is good for her and avoid what is\n         bad for her. In other words, when animals evolved, a kind of\n         entity came into existence which actually experiences the\n         goodness or badness of its own condition, or at least of some\n         aspects of its own condition, in a positive or negative way - as\n         something desirable or aversive. An animal experiences its own\n         good or ill.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">         So the way in which things are good or bad for animals is\n                           72 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             73</span>\n\n         distinctive in that it is both non-derivative and capable of being\n         experienced. We can describe these things by saying that\n         animals have interests, or that there are facts about their\n         welfare. Although our own welfare is more complex than that\n         of the other animals, it is because we are animals, not because\n         we are human beings or persons, that we ourselves have\n         interests or a welfare. Animal rights advocates argue that\n         having a welfare or interests is sufficient to ground rights. We\n         should ask on what basis we claim rights for ourselves, and\n         demand respect for them from each other, if it is not that we\n         ourselves are beings with interests or a welfare?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_233\">         Well, here is one possible answer. Immanuel Kant, who made\n         the concept of a person central to his ethics, argued that a\n         person is an end in himself, to be valued and respected for his\n         own sake, and never to be used merely as a means. Kant\n         claimed that the basis of that value is the capacity for rational\n         choice, or autonomy. He also claimed that it is because of our\n         autonomy that human beings have rights. Because human\n         beings are rational beings, Kant argued, human beings, unlike\n         the other animals, are able to choose our own way of life. We\n         reflect about what counts as a good life, decide the question for\n         ourselves, and live accordingly. In the liberal tradition, with its\n         strong emphasis on toleration, and its antagonism to\n         paternalism, this kind of autonomy has often been regarded as\n         the basis of rights. We have the basic rights of personal liberty,\n         liberty of conscience, and freedom of speech and association,\n         because each of us has the right to determine for himself or\n         herself what counts as a worthwhile life, and to live that life, so\n         long as the way we act is consistent with a like right for\n         everyone else. Because the other animals do not choose their\n         own way of life, they do not have rights grounded in this kind\n         of autonomy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">         But this response is not wholly satisfactory. I think we do have\n                           73 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             74</span>\n\n         specifically human rights grounded in our autonomy. But the\n         trouble with leaving it at that, is that what makes it important to\n         us that our rights should be respected is not just that we value\n         our autonomy. It is also that we value, to speak almost\n         circularly, our welfare, our interests, or our good. Rights\n         grounded in autonomy may often give us an indirect way to\n         protect what we regard as our good. If someone cannot interfere\n         with your freedom of speech, for example, he cannot interfere\n         with your saying your prayers. It is in part because you care\n         about saying your prayers, and not just because you care about\n         your autonomy, that you care about your right to say them. This\n         is where it becomes clear that there is a problem with dividing\n         the world into persons and things. The other animals, who do\n         not have autonomy, are left with no legal means of protecting\n         their interests or their welfare. If they have no rights, they are\n         not persons, and that leaves them to be things. But animals are\n         not mere things, since they are beings with interests and lives of\n         their own. Insofar as they come within the purview of human\n         laws at all, it is because they are a subject population, and the\n         only way to afford any effective protection for their welfare is\n         through human laws.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_235\">         It is worth emphasizing that last thought. The idea of animal\n         rights sounds silly to some people, because it seems to suggest\n         an insane desire to moralize nature: to imply that we should\n         declare predation to be murder and to make it illegal, or\n         perhaps to turn battles over territory into property disputes that\n         get settled in court. But an advocate of animal rights need not\n         be in favor of our trying to protect nonhuman animals from\n         each other. Rather, the point is to protect them from us, from\n         human beings. The reason only the law can do that effectively\n         is because in a sense, the law is the reason why many of the\n         other animals are so completely at our mercy. What I mean is\n         this: it is not just because we are individually smarter than the\n         other animals that human beings are able to do as we will with\n                           74 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                75</span>\n\n            them. It is because human beings are so cooperative and\n            therefore so organized. And the way that we organize ourselves\n            is by making laws, which set the terms of our interactions and\n            so unite us into an effective whole. If the law says it is\n            permissible for a person to inflict torments on an animal in\n            order to test a product, for instance, then there is nothing\n            anyone can do to protect that animal.

This paper\n         explores some issues related to the extension of personhood to\n         include nonhuman animals like Koko. In particular, it focuses\n         on the question of whether there is anything inherent in the\n         concept of legal personality which prevents its extension to\n         animals. Consideration of this question requires examining\n         what it means to be a &#x27;person&#x27;, and to possess legal personality.\n         This paper considers the current legal status of nonhuman\n         animals and whether their status as legal &#x27;nonpersons&#x27; can be\n         altered - and, if it can, whether it is desirable to confer the\n         status of &#x27;person&#x27; upon nonhuman animals. The central\n         contention of this paper is that such change is possible and\n         would be beneficial.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">         Who - or what - is a person?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_241\">         At the outset, it is necessary to consider what we mean by our\n         use of the term &#x27;person&#x27;. In particular, we must examine the\n         meaning of the term in legal parlance in order to understand\n         what it means to say that something &#x27;is a legal person&#x27; or &#x27;has\n         legal personality&#x27;. The dictionary definition of &#x27;person&#x27; exposes\n         the variety of meanings which the word potentially may bear.\n         Both the Macquarie Dictionary and the Concise Oxford\n         Dictionary begin with a descriptive definition of &#x27;person&#x27; as an\n         individual human being. In common usage we assume, unless\n         told otherwise, that &#x27;person&#x27; is employed as a synonym for\n         &#x27;human being&#x27;. The corollary of our instinctive identification of\n         &#x27;person&#x27; with &#x27;human&#x27; is that we tend to view the terms\n         &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;animal&#x27; as representing mutually exclusive\n                           76 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\"> CRR-533-2013                                                               77</span>\n\n         categories. This aspect of human thought is highlighted by the\n         Macquarie Dictionary&#x27;s further definition of &#x27;person&#x27; as &quot;a\n         human being as distinguished from an animal or thing&quot;. We see\n         ourselves primarily as human beings, rather than as human\n         animals. Thus, although we may be aware that, strictly\n         speaking, it is inaccurate to define &#x27;person&#x27; (in the sense of\n         &#x27;human&#x27;)      in      contradistinction       to   &#x27;animal&#x27;,   innate\n         anthropocentricism probably has a good deal more to do with\n         our thinking in this regard than does scientific accuracy. On the\n         whole, we are untroubled by our assumption that &#x27;person* is\n         the equivalent of &#x27;human&#x27;, and the opposite of &#x27;animal&#x27;. Indeed,\n         we may well be unaware that we hold this assumption until we\n         are challenged by the suggestion that an &#x27;animal&#x27; might also be\n         a &#x27;person&#x27;. Since our thinking is predicated on the perception\n         that those terms are mutually exclusive, our immediate reaction\n         to this suggestion is likely to be negative. Yet if we consider\n         some of the other potential meanings of &#x27;person&#x27;, we find that\n         the term has meanings beyond mere synonymy with &#x27;human\n         being*. We are offered a &#x27;philosophical&#x27; definition of &#x27;person&#x27;\n         as &quot;a self-conscious or rational being&quot;. Additionally, the\n         etymology of the word is reflected in definitions of &#x27;person&#x27; as\n         a character, role or guise assumed either in a play or story, or in\n         real life. &#x27;Person&#x27; derives from the Latin persona, which\n         originally described the mask worn by an actor, appropriate to\n         the role played by that actor on stage in the ancient theatre. This\n         was the aspect of the term &#x27;person&#x27; which was carried over into\n         the legal world and its concept of the &#x27;legal person&#x27;. In the\n         words of Ernest Barker, &quot;just as the parts in a play are created\n         and assigned by the dramatists, so ... personae in law are\n         created and assigned by similar agencies&quot; in the state. It is\n         important to establish what is meant by the use of the term\n         &#x27;legal person&#x27;. Although it has no fixed definition, it is\n         commonly described in terms of an entity possessing certain\n         legal rights and freedoms, and bearing certain legal duties and\n         obligations. In this vein, the CCH Macquarie Dictionary of Law\n                            77 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\"> CRR-533-2013                                                              78</span>\n\n         defines the legal person as &quot;a body with individual legal\n         powers, privileges, rights, duties or liabilities, whether a natural\n         person (a human being) or an artificial person (eg a corporation\n         or an accounting entity)&quot;. Similarly, J. A. C. Thomas posits that\n         &quot;[i]n modem legal systems, the term &#x27;person&#x27; denotes an entity\n         capable     of    bearing     rights   and    duties&quot;.   Alexander\n         Nekamsuggests that &#x27;legal person* is a classificatory term used\n         to designate &quot;anything to which rights are attributed in a legal\n         system.&quot; Thus personality, in a legal sense, may be described as\n         &quot;the quality of being a possible subject of rights and duties&quot;. It\n         is evident that jurists generally view the possession of legal\n         rights as a key constitutive element of legal personality.\n         Although some would argue that &quot;there is no generally\n         accepted conception of what it is to have a &#x27;legal right&#x27;&quot;,\n         Professor Christopher Stone has attempted to delineate what it\n         means to be the holder of legal rights, and hence to possess\n         legal personality. Stone suggests that &quot;an entity cannot be said\n         to hold a legal right unless and until some public authoritative\n         body is prepared to give some amount of review to actions that\n         are colorably inconsistent with that &#x27;right&#x27;.&quot; Were this the sole\n         threshold criterion, however, we might say that &quot;all public\n         buildings ... have legal rights&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">         Thus Stone argues that three additional criteria must be\n         satisfied in order for something to be said to be a &#x27;holder of\n         legal rights&#x27;. It is necessary that &quot;the thing can institute legal\n         actions at its behest; that &quot;in determining the granting of legal\n         relief, the court must take injury to it into account&quot;; and that\n         &quot;relief must run to the benefit of it. Stone&#x27;s &#x27;additional criteria&#x27;\n         may be seen as the procedural requirements of legal\n         personality. They do not provide us with any insight into which\n         particular rights and duties are possessed by a particular legal\n         person, nor do they expose the substance of those rights and\n         duties. Those matters are determined by the nature of the\n         particular legal person and its concomitant capacities. Rather,\n                           78 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                79</span>\n\n         satisfaction of the criteria offers an entity basic legal existence,\n         thus enabling it to enter into legal relations with other legal\n         persons and providing it with a measure of visibility in the eyes\n         of the law. In this way, legal personality &quot;[goes] towards\n         making a thing count jurally - to have a legally recognised\n         worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a\n         means to benefit [the contemporary group of rights-holders]&quot;.\n         To Stone, this is the fundamental benefit of conferring legal\n         personality upon an entity. We will return to this powerful\n         argument in due course.]\n\n\n         &quot;Sentimental      Property&quot;      :   The      current   position   of\n         nonhuman animals in law\n         We might ponder for a moment whether Orwell&#x27;s enigmatic\n         statement that &quot;all animals are equal, but some animals are\n         more equal than others&quot; is not more or less apt to describe the\n         differential treatment accorded to human and nonhuman\n         animals in our legal system. Human and nonhuman animals are\n         clearly not equal. While all human animals are legal persons,\n         nonhuman animals fall into the category of property. Since our\n         system regards legal persons as the only entities capable of\n         possessing rights, nonhuman animals can never possess rights\n         in the manner envisaged by Professor Stone. Instead, they have\n         an extremely limited legal existence as the objects of rights\n         held by legal persons. Nonetheless, animals appear to fall into\n         an unusual category of property. An American judge, for\n         example, commented that a pet animal &quot;is not just a thing but\n         occupies a special place somewhere in between a person and a\n         piece of personal property.&quot; Another judge described pet\n         animals as a form of &quot;sentimental property&quot;. Such comments\n         reflect our understandable discomfort with treating living\n         animals, especially those whom we observe exhibiting\n         &#x27;humanlike* qualities or to whom we have an emotional\n         attachment, in the same way as we would treat other forms of\n         property.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_243\">                           79 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\"> CRR-533-2013                                                            80</span>\n\n\n\n         We are reminded of the indirectness of this protection by Dr\n         Philip Jamieson&#x27;s analysis of Australian animal welfare\n         legislation in terms of Professor Stone&#x27;s criteria for the\n         possession of legal rights. In regard to standing, Jamieson notes\n         that animal welfare legislation does not enable animals to\n         institute legal proceedings at their own behest. Since the\n         legislation creates offences of a criminal nature, it is concerned\n         predominantly with the punishment of the offending legal\n         person and with &quot;protecting the community from similar\n         transgressions by the wrongdoer in the future&quot;. The court is\n         unlikely to consider the animal&#x27;s injury as an important issue in\n         itself, except in the context of determining the gravity of\n         punishment to be imposed on the wrongdoer. Finally, the\n         legislation does not provide for relief running to the animal&#x27;s\n         benefit. The statutory &#x27;remedies&#x27; relate only to the potential\n         imposition of fines and imprisonment upon the legal persons\n         convicted of an offence under the statute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_244\">         According to Esther Cohen, the mediaeval jurists did not\n         purport to try animals on the basis that they possessed reason,\n         understanding or malicious intent. In this sense, animals were\n         equated with &quot;perpetual minors&quot;. Yet it appears that in passing\n         judgment on animal culprits, the mediaeval courts frequently\n         resorted to anthropomorphic language imputing malicious\n         intent to the convicted animal, as though the punishment\n         required some sort of justification. Thus a sow was said, for\n         example, to have been &quot;taken en fragrant delit, having\n         committed and perpetrated ... murder and homicide&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">         Mediaeval jurists believed that the right of humans to try\n         animals stemmed from the superiority and &#x27;legal lordship&#x27; of\n         humankind over nature. Since animals were subject to\n         humankind, the jurists reasoned that they must also be subject\n         to the human judicial system. Further, mediaeval jurists appear\n                           80 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\"> CRR-533-2013                                                           81</span>\n\n         to have felt that if animals were subject to human justice, they\n         were as deserving as humans of the full measure of justice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_246\">         The apparent logic of this belief had some odd, and sometimes\n         brutal, ramifications. Evans reports that animals were\n         sometimes &quot;put to the rack to extort confession&quot; much like a\n         human criminal, not because the judges expected that a\n         confession would be forthcoming, but because they wished to\n         observe the forms prescribed by the law, and &quot;to set in motion\n         the whole machinery of justice before pronouncing judgment&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_247\">         However, mediaeval jurists&#x27; desire to accord justice to accused\n         animals also meant that the secular trials &quot;followed the\n         inquisitorial procedure strictly according to human rules&quot;. In a\n         case of homicide, for example, &quot;the crown or town authorities\n         prosecuted the case, presenting the complaint and summoning\n         the witnesses.&quot; Accused animals, though rarely (if ever)\n         brought into court, were even confined in the same prisons as\n         human defendants and subjected to similar forms of capital\n         punishment, including hanging, burning or burial of the\n         &#x27;culprit&#x27; alive.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">         Modem eyes are quick to criticise such mediaeval practices and\n         to attribute them to &quot;the common superstition of the age&quot;. Our\n         abhorrence of the brutality of mediaeval criminal law and\n         procedure is understandable. Nonetheless, it is arguable that\n         there is a sense of fairness in trying an animal for a so-called\n         crime, such as the infliction of injury upon a human being,\n         which our modem methods of dealing with &#x27;dangerous&#x27; animals\n         appear to lack. Although animals were still put to death\n         summarily on occasion in mediaeval times, such behaviour was\n         generally disapproved of by mediaeval jurists.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_249\">         The concept of trying an animal that injures humans or other\n         animals before &#x27;putting it down&#x27; in order to protect the\n                            81 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\"> CRR-533-2013                                                            82</span>\n\n         community is foreign to our apparently enlightened society.\n         This is not to suggest that mediaeval law provided the epitome\n         of animal justice, for there is an obvious inequity in its\n         treatment of animals as duty-bearing, &quot;sentient, punishable\n         beings&quot; for the purposes of the criminal law, and as rightless\n         chattels in every other respect.48 Rather, the mediaeval\n         example forces us to question the justice of our modem\n         system&#x27;s treatment of animals, and also serves to highlight the\n         possibility of regarding animals as more than mere property.\n         For if the mediaeval jurists could treat animals essentially as\n         persons with a very limited capacity (limited to the ability to\n         perform legally punishable acts), is there any reason why we\n         cannot treat them as legal persons?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_250\">         Is there a legal barrier to the extension of legal personality to\n         animals?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">         It has taken centuries to reach the point where the law considers\n         all human beings to be legal persons. As Professor Stone points\n         out, &quot;persons we presently regard as the natural holders of at\n         least some rights&quot; previously had none. In colourful style,\n         Stone also comments that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">         &quot;We have been making persons of children although they were\n         not, in law, always so.

In\n         ancient times, the family or a similar social group was the usual\n         centre of rights. As recognition of the individual as a subject of\n         rights grew, legal personality was restricted for a long time to\n         individuals occupying a particular social position (for example,\n         the paterfamilias as head of the family in Roman times), or\n                           82 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                83</span>\n\n         individuals possessing other particular attributes. The history of\n         the gradual extension of the concept of legal personality to\n         include all human beings, as well as a variety of nonhuman\n         entities like corporations, reminds us that the concept of legal\n         personality is a legal fiction, in the sense that it is an artificial\n         construct of the law. The law can &quot;choose which persons to\n         create or recognise&quot; just as it can choose &quot;which rights or other\n         relations to create or at least recognise&quot;. Thus, Nekam asserts\n         that anything &quot;can become a subject - a potential center - of\n         rights, whether a plant or an animal, a human being or an\n         imagined spirit&quot;. What is required for an entity to become the\n         subject of rights is for the community, and hence the\n         community&#x27;s lawmakers, to choose to regard it as such. The\n         corollary of this is that if the community does not choose to\n         regard an entity as a subject of rights, it will not become a\n         subject of rights, &quot;whether human being or anything else.&quot;\n         Legal persons are created as part of the &quot;artificial world&quot; of\n         legal concepts, to serve certain purposes. It has been said, for\n         example, that legal persons are &quot;mathematical creations&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">         devised to simplify legal processes. Much as mathematicians\n         employ     algebraic          symbols   to    simplify   mathematical\n         calculations, the concept of the legal person provides the jurist\n         with a basic unit or entity for use in the creation of legal\n         relationships. Beyond this, however, it is suggested that beings\n         or objects are endowed with legal personality as a form of\n         community recognition that the entity in question is &quot;a unit\n         [with] interests which need and deserve social protection&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">         Thus, the key to the concept of legal personality may, as Nekam\n         argues, be seen to lie in the question of whether the community\n         values a particular being or object enough to make of it a\n         subject of rights - that is, a legal person.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">         It is clear that Nekam does not predicate the conferral of legal\n         personality upon a being or object on the possession of human\n         personality by that being or object. The legal person is &quot;for the\n                           83 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             84</span>\n\n         logic of the system ... just as much a pure &#x27;concept&#x27; as &#x27;one&#x27; in\n         arithmetic&quot; and &quot;just as independent from a human being as one\n         is from an &#x27;apple&#x27;&quot;. Legal personality &quot;is not the same as\n         human personality&quot;. Nekam reports that in modem legal\n         systems, legal rights have been accorded to the dead, and even\n         to &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;gods&quot;, &quot;devils&quot; and &quot;idols&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_255\">         In the modem context, corporations are the prime example of a\n         nonhuman legal person. Although the legal treatment of\n         corporations frequently is coloured by anthropomorphic\n         overtones, it is easier to conceptualise the artificial nature of\n         legal personality in the case of a corporation, than in the case of\n         a human legal person. The routine use of the term &quot;artificial\n         person&quot; to describe a corporation is a constant reminder that the\n         corporation is the offspring of legal creativity. However, our\n         use of the term &quot;natural person&quot; in relation to human legal\n         persons tends to serve as a constant, erroneous suggestion that\n         legal personality is &quot;a characteristic inherent in the nature of\n         [human beings]&quot;. It should be remembered that even the\n         application of the word &#x27;person* to human beings &quot;was at first\n         metaphorical&quot;, for &#x27;person&#x27; derives from persona - a word\n         which did not originally mean &#x27;human&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\">         Bearing in mind that we have established there is no necessary\n         requirement that a legal person possess human personality, we\n         should note that there is one sense in which there is a always a\n         &quot;necessary connection between every right established [which,\n         in order to exist, must be attached to a legal person] and some\n         human being&quot;. As Nekam points out, every right needs\n         &quot;somebody to dispose of it&quot; and &quot;every interest to be protected&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">         requires &quot;somebody to look after it&quot;. These functions are\n         performed by the &quot;administrator&quot; of the rights and interests,\n         who must have &quot;will&quot; in order to carry out these functions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">         Nekam concludes that since only humans have &quot;will&quot;, an\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">                           84 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\"> CRR-533-2013                                                              85</span>\n\n         administrator must always be a human being. Thus, since the\n         rights and interests of every legal person require an\n         administrator to exercise and protect them, and since, according\n         to Nekam, only a human can become an administrator, there is\n         always a certain connection between legal persons and human\n         beings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_258\">         However, it is only coincidental that the concepts of the\n         beneficiaiy of rights and the administrator of those rights\n         &quot;overlap&quot; in the case of the &quot;normal adult person&quot; (presumably\n         by this Nekam means the legal person with full capacity, who is\n         typically an adult human being). If the distinction between the\n         beneficiary of rights and the administrator of that beneficiary&#x27;s\n         rights is not carefully maintained, we will find ourselves\n         confusing the two, and thus assuming that because the\n         administrator of rights must be a human being, able to interact\n         with the courts and the legal system, then the beneficiary of the\n         rights must automatically be human also.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_259\">         The question of whether or not new legal persons can be\n         created thus appears a moot point. It seems, as Lawson argues,\n         that there is probably no &quot;limit in logic ... to the number of legal\n         persons that may be interpolated at any point in human\n         relations&quot;. In other words, there is nothing inherent in the\n         concept of legal personality which prevents its extension to\n         animals.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_260\">         The real question relates to whether an entity will be considered\n         by the community and its lawmakers to be of such social\n         importance that it deserves or needs legal protection in the form\n         of the conferral of legal personality. Nekam suggests that this\n         decision is based upon the community&#x27;s &quot;emotional valuation&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">         of the entity&#x27;s need for legal protection. This is essentially what\n         Lawson refers to as the policy factor inherent in the question of\n         whether new legal persons should be created.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">                           85 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                   86</span>\n\n\n\n         The importance of the policy factor in relation to the extension\n         of legal personality to animals must not be underestimated.\n         Lawson suggests that the legislature probably needs to be\n         involved in the extension of legal personality to new entities.\n         This seems likely to be the case in regard to animals. Although\n         on the whole judges appear more willing than ever before to\n         engage in creative interpretation of the law, they are unlikely to\n         be keen to forge too far ahead of the legislature in regard to the\n         extension of rights to animals, which would no doubt be seen as\n         a contentious social issue best dealt with by the legislature.\n         Unfortunately, seeking legislative conferral of personality on\n         animals is effectively a Herculean challenge, as legislative\n         measures frequently lag behind societal changes. Gary\n         Francione makes the cynical, yet pragmatic, point that when\n         &quot;an economic system finds it advantageous&quot;, as with the\n         extension of legal personality to corporations, &quot;its notion of\n         &#x27;personhood&#x27; can become quite elastic&quot;. Conversely, legislative\n         change can become &quot;enmired indefinitely&quot; if opposed by\n         powerful vested interests. Those with direct vested interests in\n         maintaining animals&#x27; current legal status as property might\n         range from multi-national pharmaceutical companies who rely\n         on a supply of animals to use as subjects in drug development\n         and testing, to farmers who sell eggs produced by &#x27;battery\n         hens&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\">         Yet      the   failure    of    an   attempt   to   legislate   for   the\n         &quot;enfranchisement of animals&quot; might not be solely attributable\n         to the opposition of such vested interests. In spite of the efforts\n         of animal rights&#x27; activists to raise public awareness of animal\n         rights&#x27; issues, it is conceivable that public interest in the issue\n         of the extension of legal personality to animals would be\n         minimal. It is equally conceivable that the community might\n         actively oppose legislative action to make animals &#x27;persons&#x27;.\n         Such opposition would probably be fatal to the animal cause,\n                             86 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\"> CRR-533-2013                                                              87</span>\n\n         for as Bernard Rollin notes, legislative change in favour of\n         animal rights has little chance of success unless &quot;public opinion\n         can be galvanised on its behalf&#x27;. For this reason, it seems that\n         we must play upon human emotions in order to obtain the\n         community&#x27;s support for the legislative conferral of legal\n         personality    on       animals.   The   general   disapproval   of\n         anthropomorphism expressed by many of those engaged in\n         philosophical discussion of animal rights may need to be\n         tempered by pragmatism in order to maximise community\n         support for the extension of personality to animals. Human\n         weakness for animals who exhibit &#x27;human-like&#x27; behaviour,\n         such as the use of language by apes, can be used to animal\n         advantage by arousing empathy in human observers.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">         Peter Singer appears to be attempting to exploit this facet of\n         human nature by employing John Locke&#x27;s definition of a\n         person in his argument in favour of the extension of\n         personhood to include nonhuman animals. Locke defined a\n         &#x27;person&#x27; as a &quot;thinking intelligent being that has reason and\n         reflection and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking\n         thing, in different times and places&quot;. The intelligent, self-aware,\n         rational being embodied in Locke&#x27;s definition bears a striking\n         resemblance to the legal person of full capacity in our legal\n         system. This person is typically a &#x27;normal&#x27; human adult, whom\n         the law characterises as an &quot;intellectually sophisticated,\n         autonomous [agent]&quot;. Singer argues that the scientific study of\n         animals provides plenty of evidence to suggest that animals like\n         Koko fit Locke&#x27;s definition of a &#x27;person&#x27;. He claims that the\n         &quot;evidence for personhood&quot; is currently most conclusive for the\n         great apes- gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans. These\n         animals&#x27; (potential) use of language appears to form an integral\n         part of the &quot;evidence for personhood&quot;, for their ability to\n         communicate using sign language enables researchers to\n         attempt to discern, for example, the degree to which they may\n         be said to be self aware. Our present inability to communicate\n                             87 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\"> CRR-533-2013                                                            88</span>\n\n         effectively beyond the level of intuition with other animals\n         seems to prevent the conclusive formulation of &quot;evidence for\n         personhood&quot; in relation to them. Nonetheless, Singer argues\n         that &quot;whales, dolphins, elephants, monkeys, dogs, pigs and\n         other animals may eventually also be shown to be aware of\n         their own existence over time and capable of reasoning&quot;. In a\n         sense, this assertion begs the question of whether a being must\n         demonstrate self-awareness, or self-consciousness, and the\n         capacity to reason in order to be eligible for the attribution of\n         legal personality. As noted above, the typical bearer of the full\n         complement of legal rights and duties in our system is a human\n         adult endowed with rationality, sanity and autonomy. Clearly,\n         however, there are far more legal persons in existence than\n         there are so-called &#x27;normal human adults* in the community.\n         Apart from nonhuman legal entities like corporations, we must\n         fit into the personality equation, among others, foetuses,\n         children, insane adults, adults suffering from other forms of\n         mental illness, intellectually disabled humans and humans in\n         comas. The fact that none of these &#x27;persons&#x27; possess the same\n         degree of rationality and autonomy as the characteristic (some\n         would say caricatured) legal person discussed above might be\n         an overwhelming problem, were it not for the variability of\n         legal capacity. It is not a precondition of legal personality that\n         every legal entity possess a &#x27;complete set&#x27; of legal rights and\n         obligations. Within the human community of legal individuals,\n         different individuals possess different rights and bear different\n         obligations - yet all remain legal persons. Children, for\n         example, have limited rights and obligations because they are\n         not thought capable of exercising the same level of reasoning\n         and understanding assumed of normal adults. Thus the concept\n         of the legal entity is a relative one. Legal personality does not\n         require that an entity &quot;have certain minimum rights attributed to\n         it&quot;. It is not an &#x27;all or nothing&#x27; approach. We can attribute to a\n         legal entity as little as a single right or obligation, or a wide\n         variety of rights and obligations. Arguing that animals should\n                           88 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                 89</span>\n\n         become legal persons, and thus have legal rights, does not\n         equate to a demand that animals should possess every\n         conceivable legal right, or even that animals should have the\n         same rights as human beings. Nor is it necessary that all\n         animals possess identical rights. Clearly, the conferral of legal\n         personality    on     animals    would        necessitate   a   careful\n         consideration of which rights and/or obligations would be\n         appropriate to extend to particular animals. It is equally clear,\n         however, that although there is an advantage inherent in being\n         the legal person of full capacity, because this person&#x27;s interests\n         are those best served by our modem legal system, that\n         advantage does not translate into a requirement that all legal\n         persons possess, or be capable of possessing, the full\n         complement of legal rights and duties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_264\">         Therefore, it seems that Singer&#x27;s use of the Lockeian model of\n         the person, with its focus on reason, intelligence and\n         selfawareness, is in fact a double-edged sword. It helps make\n         his argument as palatable as possible for his human audience by\n         emphasising the fact that animals may possess, though to a\n         lesser degree than humans, qualities such as intelligence,\n         rationality and self-awareness - qualities which we commonly\n         view as &#x27;human&#x27; qualities. The inherent danger in Singer&#x27;s\n         focus on such attributes is that he sets an unnecessarily high\n         standard for admission to the community of persons, which\n         could impede the inclusion of animals other than the great apes.\n         In response to this potential criticism, Singer has argued that\n         reformers &quot;can only start from a given situation, and work from\n         there&quot;, as the alteration of the status quo can only be brought\n         about in stages, with each small progression functioning as a\n         point of transition to the next stage. Yet without denying the\n         pragmatism of this argument, it is disturbing to note that a\n         consistent application of Singer&#x27;s standard could require the\n         withdrawal of legal personality from a number of human\n         persons, such as anencephalic babies, or those who are severely\n                           89 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\"> CRR-533-2013                                                             90</span>\n\n         intellectually disabled, or in an irreversible coma. Singer rightly\n         points to the illogicality of including such humans in the\n         community of legal persons, while excluding animals &quot;with\n         equal or superior characteristics and capacities&quot;. However,\n         attempting to resolve this logical inconsistency by adopting\n         criteria for personhood based on Locke&#x27;s definition of the\n         person would constitute a serious assault on the progress made\n         in relation to the human rights of humans like those mentioned\n         above. It is suggested that this is an unacceptable price to pay,\n         in both moral and political terms, for the extension of legal\n         personality to animals. Arguably it would amount to the\n         replacement of the bias inherent in the concept of legal\n         personality which favours members of the species Homo\n         sapiens, with an intellectual bias in favour of beings possessing\n         qualities such as intelligence, rationality and self-awareness.\n         Yet it may not be necessary to pay this price, for, strictly\n         speaking, the law does not impose Singer&#x27;s standard upon those\n         to whom it extends legal personality. The concept of legal\n         personality makes allowances for persons possessing varying\n         degrees of intelligence, rationality and self-awareness through\n         the gradation of capacity. It may be appropriate for animal legal\n         persons to have similar capacity to that of young children,\n         including limitations on criminal liability and contractual\n         capacity. It is important that they are able to initiate legal\n         proceedings to restrain or to seek compensation for the\n         infringement of their rights. No doubt the substantive content\n         of animals&#x27; new legal rights would be the subject of extensive\n         debate. It suffices to note here that those rights are likely to be\n         limited to basic rights such as the right to freedom from cruel\n         treatment and the infliction of torture or unnecessary suffering,\n         and potentially, though not necessarily, the right to life.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_265\">         Arguments for the extension of legal personality to animals\n         We have established that there is nothing inherent in the\n         concept of legal personality preventing its extension to animals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_266\">                           90 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\"> CRR-533-2013                                                              91</span>\n\n         We will see that there are also good reasons why we should\n         extend legal personality to animals.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_267\">         Central to this argument is Stone&#x27;s assertion that legal\n         personality plays an important part in &quot;making a thing count in\n         the eyes of the law. The conferral of legal personality upon\n         rightless objects or beings carries with it legal recognition that\n         those objects or beings have &quot;worth and dignity&quot; in their own\n         right&quot;. Until we attribute personality to a rightless entity, we are\n         likely to be unable to conceive of it as &quot;anything but a thing for\n         the use of &#x27;us&#x27; - those who are holding rights at the time.&quot; Thus\n         it is suggested that the inclusion of animals in the community of\n         legal persons will dignify them by forcing humans to see and\n         value animals for themselves, rather than seeing them simply as\n         the object of property rights, or as something for humans to\n         &#x27;use and abuse&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_268\">         The paradox is that we may be loathe to extend legal\n         personality to animals because we find it difficult to value\n         animals for what they are - but we may continue to have\n         difficulty seeing animals&#x27; intrinsic worth and dignity &quot;until we\n         can bring ourselves to give [them] &#x27;rights&#x27;&quot;. As Stone observes,\n         extending rights to new entities always appears &quot;unthinkable&quot;\n         until the change is actually effected, as we tend to suppose &quot;the\n         rightlessness of rightless &#x27;things&#x27; to be a decree of Nature, not a\n         legal convention acting in support of some status quo.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_269\">         Attempting to alter the status quo is never easy. Yet persistence\n         is of the essence, for as Singer highlights, the term &#x27;person&#x27; is\n         far from being a &quot;mere descriptive label&quot;. In fact, it &quot;carries\n         with it a certain moral standing&quot; which is needed to force us to\n         think of animals as deserving of the basic rights we take for\n         granted. The law&#x27;s attitude towards animals could be said to\n         amount to a policy statement about human society&#x27;s regard, or\n         disregard, for animals. Thus were the law to bring animals in\n                            91 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\"> CRR-533-2013                                                           92</span>\n\n         &#x27;out of the cold*, where they languish as rightless beings, the\n         objects of rights held by legal persons, and draw them under the\n         umbrella of legal personality, it would ideally encourage the\n         development of more respectful and less exploitative social\n         attitudes towards animals.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_270\">         The shelter of the legal umbrella would also provide more\n         effective protection of animal interests than is available under\n         current animal welfare law. As legal persons, animals could be\n         recognised as parties to legal actions, because they would have\n         the independent standing that they currently lack. There is no\n         conceptual problem with the fact that animals&#x27; inability to\n         speak means that they would require human legal persons to act\n         as their representatives and to interact with the courts and the\n         legal system on their behalf. As I noted above, it is quite\n         acceptable for a legal person&#x27;s rights and interests to be\n         exercised and protected by another legal person acting as the\n         &quot;administrator&quot; of those rights. Infants are a prime example of\n         legal persons whose rights and interests must be administered\n         by another legal person, usually a parent or an appointed\n         guardian.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">         In practical terms, a human legal person of full capacity,\n         concerned with the wellbeing of the animal and willing to\n         represent the animal on a legal level, could be appointed by the\n         court as the guardian and legal representative of that animal.\n         Appropriate guardians might include animal welfare bodies,\n         like the RSPCA, or individuals with a particular interest in, or\n         familiarity with, the animal concerned. The guardian could\n         represent the interests of an individual animal or a group of\n         animals. For example, guardians might represent the rights of\n         grain-destroying cockatoos to a humane death, rather than cruel\n         clubbing, the rights of circus animals to freedom from suffering\n         caused by unnatural captivity, or the rights of marine animals\n         and birds to prevent the indiscriminate killing caused by the use\n                           92 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\"> CRR-533-2013                                                               93</span>\n\n         of nets in long-line trawling.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_272\">         The advantage of this approach is that it would require a court\n         to take the animals&#x27; interests directly into account as parties to\n         the legal action, rather than as the object of rights. This is not to\n         intimate that the animals&#x27; interests must prevail over those of\n         other legal persons. Rather, this approach would require the\n         court explicitly to acknowledge the animals&#x27; interests, as it\n         must acknowledge those of other legal persons party to the\n         proceedings, and weigh their interest against those of the other\n         parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_273\">         This scenario is not far-fetched. The community is already\n         vocal in its disapproval of practices such as long-line trawling,\n         which results in the unnecessary deaths of large numbers of\n         marine animals in the trawler&#x27;s nets. The prospect that society\n         will demand that the next step be taken may not be far away.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_274\">         On balance, we must consider whether making animals &#x27;legal\n         entities&#x27;, and hence offering them legal rights, really will\n         procure better protection for animal interests. Steve Sapontzis\n         argues that although &quot;rights&quot; constitute our &quot;most powerful\n         moral and legal concept&quot;, they are best suited to &quot;the capacities\n         and conditions of intellectually sophisticated agents&quot; - that is,\n         to the legal person of full capacity. He suggests that we should\n         employ &quot;concepts suited to the capacities and conditions&quot; of\n         animals, rather than &quot;automatically demanding legal rights for\n         nonhuman animals to (or against) those things which (can, will,\n         would) have an impact on their basic interests&quot;. This appears to\n         include strengthening the position of interests which do not\n         amount to legal rights when those interests come into conflict\n         with legal rights, for example, by not allowing the legal rights\n         automatically to override the protected interests. The argument\n         appears promising, but the fact that Sapontzis offers no\n         concrete examples of what he calls, in tantalising fashion,\n                           93 of 104\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">         ::: Downloaded on - 23-06-2019 23:38:49 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\"> CRR-533-2013                                                                  94</span>\n\n            &quot;concepts suited to the capacities and conditions&quot; of animals,\n            suggests that they are difficult to formulate. For now, at least,\n            the extension of legal personality to animals remains the best\n            option for greater protection of animal interests.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_275\">            Some final thoughts\n\n\n            The concept of legal personality, as we have seen, is a construct\n            of the law. As such, it can be extended to animals, or to other\n            objects or beings, if the law so chooses. Ultimately, the\n            question of whether legal personality will be bestowed on\n            animals depends on whether human beings are prepared to\n            acknowledge that animals need and deserve full legal\n            protection for their rights and interests.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_276\">            The multiplicity of animal beings with whom we share our\n            world deserve to be treated not as means to human ends, but as\n            ends in themselves. Having arrogated to ourselves complete\n            power over our animal kin, their liberation rests in our hands.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_277\">88.
