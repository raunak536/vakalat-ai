Thus, in sub-clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 25 (2)</a>, the\nConstitution has segregated matters of religious practice\nfrom secular activities, including those of an economic,\nfinancial or political nature. The expression &quot;other secular\nactivity&quot; which follows upon the expression &quot;economic,\nfinancial, political&quot; indicates that matters of a secular\nnature may be regulated or restricted by law. The fact\nthat these secular activities are associated with or, in\nother words, carried out in conjunction with religious\npractice, would not put them beyond the pale of\nlegislative regulation. The second category consists of\nlaws providing for (i) social welfare and reform; or (ii)\nthrowing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public\ncharacter to all classes and sections of Hindus. The\nexpression &quot;social welfare and reform&quot; is not confined to\nmatters only of the Hindu religion. However, in matters of\ntemple entry, the Constitution recognised the disabilities\nwhich Hindu religion had imposed over the centuries\nwhich restricted the rights of access to dalits and to\nvarious groups within Hindu society. The effect of clause\n(2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 25</a> is to protect the ability of the state to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                  53</span>\n\n\n       enact laws, and to save existing laws on matters\n       governed by sub-clauses (a) and (b). Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_132\">Article\n       25</a> is clarificatory of the regulatory power of the state over\n       matters of public order, morality and health which\n       already stand recognised in clause (1). Clause 1 makes\n       the right conferred subject to public order, morality and\n       health. Clause 2 does not circumscribe the ambit of the\n       &#x27;subject to public order, morality or health&#x27; stipulation in\n       clause 1. What clause 2 indicates is that the authority of\n       the state to enact laws on the categories is not\n       trammelled by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 25...&quot;</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">\nVII. AS TO PROTECTION OF ESSENTIAL RELIGIOUS\nPRACTICE AND THE TEST FOR ITS ASCERTAINMENT:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">     (i) Since the question of hijab being a part of essential\n\nreligious practice is the bone of contention, it becomes\n\nnecessary to briefly state as to what is an essential religious\n\npractice in Indian context and how it is to be ascertained. This\n\ndoctrine can plausibly be traced to the Chief Architect of our\n\nConstitution, Dr. B.R.Ambedkar and to his famous statement\n\nin    the   Constituent   Assembly     during    debates    on   the\n\nCodification of Hindu Law: &quot;the religious conception in this\n\ncountry are so vast that they cover every aspect of life from\n\nbirth to death...there is nothing extraordinary in saying that we\n\nought to strive hereafter to limit the definition of religion in such\n\na manner that we shall not extend it beyond beliefs and such\n\nrituals as may be connected with ceremonials which are\n\nessentially religious...&quot; [Constituent Assembly Debates VII:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                54</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">781].    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1723440\" id=\"span_95\">In   <a href=\"/doc/1723440/\" id=\"a_134\">ACHARYA   JAGADISHWARANANDA            AVADHUTA</a>,\n\nsupra, it has been observed at paragraph 9 as under:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">  &quot;The protection guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_135\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_136\">26</a> of the\n  Constitution is not confined to matters of doctrine or belief\n  but extends to acts done in pursuance of religion and,\n  therefore, contains a guarantee for rituals, observances,\n  ceremonies and modes of worship which are essential or\n  integral part of religion. What constitutes an integral or\n  essential part of religion has to be determined with reference\n  to its doctrines, practices, tenets, historical background, etc.\n  of the given religion... What is meant by &quot;an essential part or\n  practices of a religion&quot; is now the matter for elucidation.\n  Essential part of a religion means the core beliefs upon\n  which a religion is founded. Essential practice means those\n  practices that are fundamental to follow a religious belief. It\n  is upon the cornerstone of essential parts or practices that\n  the superstructure of a religion is built, without which a\n  religion will be no religion. Test to determine whether a part\n  or practice is essential to a religion is to find out whether the\n  nature of the religion will be changed without that part or\n  practice. If the taking away of that part or practice could\n  result in a fundamental change in the character of that\n  religion or in its belief, then such part could be treated as an\n  essential or integral part. There cannot be additions or\n  subtractions to such part because it is the very essence of\n  that religion and alterations will change its fundamental\n  character. It is such permanent essential parts which are\n  protected by the Constitution. Nobody can say that an\n  essential part or practice of one&#x27;s religion has changed from\n  a particular date or by an event. Such alterable parts or\n  practices are definitely not the &quot;core&quot; of religion whereupon\n  the belief is based and religion is founded upon. They could\n  only be treated as mere embellishments to the non-essential\n  (sic essential) part or practices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">  (ii)    INDIAN YOUNG LAWYERS ASSOCIATION surveyed\n\nthe development of law relating to essential religious practice\n\nand the extent of its constitutional patronage consistent with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                  55</span>\n\n\nthe long standing view. Ordinarily, a religious practice in\n\norder to be called an &#x27;essential religious practice&#x27; should have\n\nthe following indicia: (i) Not every activity associated with the\n\nreligion is essential to such religion. Practice should be\n\nfundamental to religion and it should be from the time\n\nimmemorial. (ii) Foundation of the practice must precede the\n\nreligion itself or should be co-founded at the origin of the\n\nreligion. (iii) Such practice must form the cornerstone of religion\n\nitself. If that practice is not observed or followed, it would result\n\nin the change of religion itself and, (iv) Such practice must be\n\nbinding nature of the religion itself and it must be compelling.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">That a practice claimed to be essential to the religion has\n\nbeen carried on since time immemorial or is grounded in\n\nreligious texts per se does not lend to it the constitutional\n\nprotection unless it passes the test of essentiality as is\n\nadjudged by the Courts in their role as the guardians of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\nESSENTIAL RELIGIOUS PRACTICE SHOULD ASSOCIATE\nWITH CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">   (i) March of law regarding essential religious practice: Law\n\nis an organic social institution and not just a black letter\n\nsection.

In INDIAN\n\nYOUNG LAWYERS ASSOCIATION, this branch of law marched\n\nfurther when the Apex Court added another dimension to the\n\nconcept of essential religious practice, by observing at\n\nparagraphs 289 &amp; 291 as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     &quot;For decades, this Court has witnessed claims resting on\n     the essentiality of a practice that militate against the\n     constitutional protection of dignity and individual freedom\n     under the Constitution. It is the duty of the courts to\n     ensure that what is protected is in conformity with\n     fundamental constitutional values and guarantees and\n     accords with constitutional morality. While the\n     Constitution is solicitous in its protection of religious\n     freedom as well as denominational rights, it must be\n     understood that dignity, liberty and equality constitute\n     the trinity which defines the faith of the Constitution.\n     Together, these three values combine to define a\n     constitutional order of priorities. Practices or beliefs which\n     detract from these foundational values cannot claim\n     legitimacy...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">     Our Constitution places the individual at the heart of the\n     discourse on rights.

There are a multiplicity of intersecting\n      constitutional values and interests involved in\n      determining the essentiality of religious practices.

AS TO WHICH AUTHORITATIVE COMMENTARY\nON HOLY QURAN, WE ARE PRINCIPALLY RELYING UPON\nAND REASONS FOR THAT:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     (i)   At the outset we make it clear that, in these cases,\n\nour inquiry concerns the nature and practice of wearing of\n\nhijab amongst Muslim women and therefore, references to the\n\nHoly Quran and other sources of Islamic law shall be confined\n\nto the same. During the course of hearing, the versions of\n\ndifferent authors on this scripture were cited, viz., Abdullah\n\nYusuf Ali, Abdul Haleem, Pickthall, Muhammad Hijab, Dr.\n\nMustafa    Khattab,    Muhammad        Taqi-ud-Din     al-Hilali,\n\nMuhammad Muhsin Khan, Dr. Ghali. However, this Court\n\nprefers to bank upon the &#x27;The Holy Quran: Text, Translation\n\nand Commentary&#x27; by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, (published by\n\nGoodword Books; 2019 reprint), there being a broad unanimity\n\nat the Bar as to its authenticity &amp; reliability. The speculative\n\nand generalizing mind of this author views the verses of the\n\nscriptures in their proper perspective. He provides the\n\nunifying principles that underlie. His monumental work has a\n\nsystematic completeness and perfection of form. It is pertinent\n\nto reproduce Abdullah Yusuf Ali&#x27;s &#x27;Preface to First Edition&#x27; of\n\nhis book, which is as under:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                               61</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">     &quot;...In translating the Text I have aired no views of my\n     own, but followed the received commentators. Where they\n     differed among themselves, I have had to choose what\n     appeared to me to be the most reasonable opinion from all\n     points of view. Where it is a question merely of words, I\n     have not considered the question important enough to\n     discuss in the Notes, but where it is a question of\n     substance, I hope adequate explanations will be found in\n     the notes. Where I have departed from the literal\n     translation in order to express the spirit of the original\n     better in English, I have explained the literal meaning in\n     the Notes... Let me explain the scope of the Notes. I have\n     made them as short as possible consistently with the\n     object I have in view, viz., to give to the English reader,\n     scholar as well as general reader, a fairly complete but\n     concise view of what I understand to be the meaning of\n     the Text...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">     (ii)   There is yet another reason as to why we place our\n\nreliance on the commentary of Mr. Abdullah Yusuf Ali. The\n\nApex court itself in a catena of cases has treated the same as\n\nthe authoritative work. In SHAYARA BANO, we find the\n\nfollowing observations at paragraphs 17 &amp; 18:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">     &quot;17. Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed by God\n     to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of about 23\n     years, beginning from 22.12.609, when Muhammad was\n     40 years old. The revelation continued upto the year 632\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">     - the year of his death. Shortly after Muhammad&#x27;s death,\n     the Quran was completed by his companions, who had\n     either written it down, or had memorized parts of it.\n     These compilations had differences of perception.\n     Therefore, Caliph Usman - the third, in the line of caliphs\n     recorded a standard version of the Quran, now known as\n     Usman&#x27;s codex. This codex is generally treated, as the\n     original rendering of the Quran.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">     18. During the course of hearing, references to the Quran\n     were made from &#x27;The Holy Quran: Text Translation and\n     Commentary&#x27; by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, (published by Kitab\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                    62</span>\n\n\n      Bhawan, New Delhi, 14th edition, 2016). Learned counsel\n      representing the rival parties commended, that the text\n      and translation in this book, being the most reliable,\n      could safely be relied upon. The text and the inferences\n      are therefore drawn from the above publication...The\n      Quran is divided into &#x27;suras&#x27; (chapters).

This way, the hijab hides, marks the difference,\n\nprotects, and arguably affirms the religious identity of the\n\nMuslim women. This word as such is not employed in Quran,\n\ncannot be disputed, although commentators may have\n\nemployed it. Indian jurist Abdullah Yusuf Ali referring to sūra\n\n(xxxiii), verse 59, at footnote 3765 in his book states: &quot;Jilbāb,\n\nplural Jalābib: an outer garment; a long gown covering the\n\nwhole body, or a cloak covering the neck as bosom.&quot;. In the\n\nfootnote 3760 to Verse 53, he states: &quot;...In the wording, note\n\nthat for Muslim women generally, no screen or hijab\n\n(Purdah) is mentioned, but only a veil to cover the bosom,\n\nand modesty in dress. The screen was a special feature\n\nof honor for the Prophet&#x27;s household, introduced about\n\nfive or six years before his death...&quot; Added, in footnote\n\n3767 to verse 59 of the same sura, he opines: &quot;This rule was\n\nnot absolute: if for any reason it could not be observed,\n\n&#x27;God is Oft. Returning, Most Merciful.&#x27;...&quot; Thus, there is\n\nsufficient intrinsic material within the scripture itself to\n\nsupport       the   view   that   wearing   hijab   has   been   only\n\nrecommendatory, if at all it is.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      (iii)    The Holy Quran does not mandate wearing of hijab\n\nor headgear for Muslim women.

This contention is\n\nbit difficult to countenance. It is relevant to refer to the\n\nhistorical aspects of this particular verse as vividly explained\n\nby Abdullah Yusuf Ali himself at footnote 3766:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                 69</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">     &quot;The object was not to restrict the liberty of women, but to\n     protect them from harm and molestation under the\n     conditions then existing in Medina. In the East and in the\n     West a distinctive public dress of some sort or another\n     has always been a badge of honour or distinction, both\n     among men and women. This can be traced back to the\n     earliest civilizations. Assyrian Law in its palmist days\n     (say, 7th century B.C.), enjoined the veiling of married\n     women and forbade the veiling of slaves and women of ill\n     fame: see Cambridge Ancient History, III.107&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">It needs to be stated that wearing hijab is not religion-specific,\n\nas explained by Sara Slininger from Centralia, Illinois in her\n\nresearch paper &quot;VEILED WOMEN: HIJAB, RELIGION, AND\n\nCULTURAL PRACTICE&quot;.

Veiling practices started long before the Islamic\n     prophet Muhammad was born. Societies like the\n     Byzantines, Sassanids, and other cultures in Near and\n     Middle East practiced veiling. There is even some\n     evidence that indicates that two clans in southwestern\n     Arabia practiced veiling in pre-Islamic times, the Banū\n     Ismāʿīl and Banū Qaḥṭān. Veiling was a sign of a\n     women&#x27;s social status within those societies. In\n     Mesopotamia, the veil was a sign of a woman&#x27;s high\n     status and respectability. Women wore the veil to\n     distinguish Slininger themselves from slaves and\n     unchaste women. In some ancient legal traditions, such\n     as in Assyrian law, unchaste or unclean women, such as\n     harlots and slaves, were prohibited from veiling\n     themselves. If they were caught illegally veiling, they\n     were liable to severe penalties. The practice of veiling\n     spread throughout the ancient world the same way that\n     many other ideas traveled from place to place during this\n     time: invasion.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                70</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">     (vi)   Regard being had to the kind of life conditions\n\nthen obtaining in the region concerned, wearing hijab was\n\nrecommended as a measure of social security for women and\n\nto facilitate their safe access to public domain. At the most\n\nthe practice of wearing this apparel may have something to do\n\nwith culture but certainly not with religion. This gains\n\ncredence from Yusuf Ali&#x27;s Note 3764 to verse 59 which runs\n\nas under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">     &quot;...The times were those of insecurity (see next verse) and\n     they were asked to cover themselves with outer garments\n     when walking abroad. It was never contemplated that\n     they should be confined to their houses like prisoners.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">History of mankind is replete with instances of abuse and\n\noppression of women. The region and the times from which\n\nIslam originated were not an exception. The era before the\n\nintroduction of Islam is known as Jahiliya-a time of barbarism\n\nand ignorance. The Quran shows concern for the cases of\n\n&#x27;molestation   of   innocent   women&#x27;    and    therefore,   it\n\nrecommended wearing of this and other apparel as a measure\n\nof social security. May be in the course of time, some\n\nelements of religion permeated into this practice as ordinarily\n\nhappens in any religion. However, that per se does not render\n\nthe practice predominantly religious and much less essential\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                71</span>\n\n\nto the Islamic faith. This becomes evident from Ali&#x27;s footnote\n\n3768 to verse 60 which concludes with the following profound\n\nline &quot;Alas! We must ask ourselves the question: &#x27;Are these\n\nconditions present among us today?&#x27;&quot; Thus, it can be\n\nreasonably assumed that the practice of wearing hijab had a\n\nthick nexus to the socio-cultural conditions then prevalent in\n\nthe region. The veil was a safe means for the women to leave\n\nthe confines of their homes. Ali&#x27;s short but leading question is\n\npremised on this analysis. What is not religiously made\n\nobligatory therefore cannot be made a quintessential aspect of\n\nthe religion through public agitations or by the passionate\n\narguments in courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">     (vii)   Petitioners also relied upon verses 4758 &amp; 4759\n\n(Chapter     12) from   Dr.Muhammad     Muhsin Khan&#x27;s      &#x27;The\n\nTranslation of the Meanings of Sahih Al-Bukhari, Arabic-\n\nEnglish&#x27;, Volume 6, Darussalam publication, Riyadh, Saudi\n\nArabia.

By this, credentials\n\nrequired for a commentator cannot be assumed. He has held\n\na prominent position in the field of medicine, is beside the\n\npoint.

Even here, no credentials are\n\ndiscussed nor is anything stated about the authenticity and\n\nreliability of his version of Ahadith. Secondly, the text &amp;\n\ncontext of the verse do not show its obligatory nature.

We have\n     elaborately referred to the role of teachers in the earlier\n     portion of the order.

Such imposition\n     of dress code for following uniform discipline cannot be\n     the subject matter of litigation that too, at the instance of\n     the teachers, who are vested with the responsibility of\n     inculcating discipline amongst the students.

Even the\n\nState could not have banked upon this in structuring the\n\nimpugned Govt. Order dated 5.2.2022. The challenge to the\n\ndress code was by the teacher and not by the students. The\n\nfreedom of conscience or right to religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 25</a> was\n\nnot discussed. This decision is absolutely irrelevant.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                   79</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"435722\" id=\"span_128\">(v)   In    re   <a href=\"/doc/435722/\" id=\"a_154\">PRAYAG        DAS   vs.   CIVIL   JUDGE\n\nBULANDSHAHR72</a>: This decision is cited by the petitioner in\n\nW.P.No.4338/2022 (PIL) who supports the case of the State.\n\nThis decision related to a challenge to the prescription of\n\ndress code for the lawyers.

They literally reinforce the\n        Shakespearian aphorism that the apparel oft proclaims\n        the man. When a lawyer is in prescribed dress his\n        identity can never be mistaken. In the second place, a\n        uniform prescribed dress worn by the members of the Bar\n        induces a seriousness of purpose and a sense of decorum\n        which are highly conducive to the dispensation of\n        justice...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">This decision is not much relevant although it gives some idea\n\nas to the justification for prescribing uniform, be it in a\n\nprofession or in an educational institution.

AS TO WEARING HIJAB BEING A MATTER OF\nFREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">     (1)   Some of the petitioners vehemently argued that,\n\nregardless of right to religion, the girl students have the\n\nfreedom of conscience guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 25</a> itself and\n\nthat they have been wearing hijab as a matter of conscience\n\nand therefore, interdicting this overt act is offensive to their\n\nconscience and thus, is violative of their fundamental right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1508089\" id=\"span_130\">In\n\nsupport, they heavily rely upon <a href=\"/doc/1508089/\" id=\"a_156\">BIJOE EMMANUEL</a> supra,\n\nwherein at paragraph 25, it is observed as under:</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">     &quot;We are satisfied, in the present case, that the expulsion\n     of the three children from the school for the reason that\n     because of their conscientiously held religious faith, they\n     do not join the singing of the national anthem in the\n     morning assembly though they do stand up respectfully\n     when the anthem is sung, is a violation of their\n     fundamental right to freedom of conscience and freely to\n     profess, practice and propagate religion.&quot; .\nConscience is by its very nature subjective. Whether the\n\npetitioners had the conscience of the kind and how they\n\ndeveloped it are not averred in the petition with material\n\nparticulars. Merely stating that wearing hijab is an overt act of\n\nconscience and therefore, asking them to remove hijab would\n\noffend conscience, would not be sufficient for treating it as a\n\nground for granting relief. Freedom of conscience as already\n\nmentioned above, is in distinction to right to religion as was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                81</span>\n\n\nclarified by Dr. B.R.Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly\n\nDebates.

No material is placed before us for\n\nevaluation and determination of pleaded conscience of the\n\npetitioners. They have not averred anything as to how they\n\nassociate wearing hijab with their conscience, as an overt act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">There is no evidence that the petitioners chose to wear their\n\nheadscarf as a means of conveying any thought or belief on\n\ntheir part or as a means of symbolic expression.

He\n\nhad craftily articulated that a decision is an authority for the\n\nproposition that is laid down in a given fact matrix, and not\n\nfor all that which logically follows from what has been so laid\n\ndown.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\">         (ii)   With the above in mind, let us examine the\n\nmaterial facts of BIJOE EMMANUEL: Three &#x27;law abiding\n\nchildren&#x27;       being   the   faithful        of   Jehovah   witnesses,    did\n\n73   (1901) A.C. 495\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                                83</span>\n\n\nrespectfully stand up but refused to sing the National Anthem\n\nin the school prayer. This refusal was founded on the dicta of\n\ntheir religion. They were expelled under the instructions of\n\nDeputy Inspector of School. These instructions were proven to\n\nhave no force of law. They did not prevent the singing of\n\nNational Anthem nor did they cause any disturbance while\n\nothers were singing. Only these facts tailored the skirt, rest\n\nbeing the frills. The decision turned out to be more on the\n\nright to religion than freedom of conscience, although there is\n\nsome reference to the conscience. The court recognized the\n\nnegative of a fundamental right i.e., the freedom of speech &amp;\n\nexpression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 19</a> as including right to\n\nremain silent. What weighed with the court was the fact &#x27;the\n\nchildren were well behaved, they respectfully stood up when\n\nthe National Anthem was sung and would continue to do so\n\nrespectfully in the future&#x27; (paragraph 23). Besides, Court found\n\nthat their refusal to sing was not confined to Indian National\n\nAnthem but extended to the Songs of every other country.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                     84</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1961036\" id=\"span_136\">(iii)   True it is that the BIJOE EMMANUEL reproduces\n\nthe following observation of Davar J. made in <a href=\"/doc/1961036/\" id=\"a_159\">JAMSHEDJI\n\nCURSETJEE TARACHAND vs. SOONABAI74</a>:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">        &quot;...If this is the belief of the community--and it is proved\n        undoubtedly to be the belief of the Zoroastrian\n        community--a secular judge is bound to accept that belief-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">        -it is not for him to sit in judgment on that belief--he has\n        no right to interfere with the conscience of a donor who\n        makes a gift in favour of what he believes to be in\n        advancement of his religion and for the welfare of his\n        community or of mankind...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_145\">These observations essentially relate to &#x27;the belief of the\n\nZoroastrian community&#x27;.

The        expression\n\n&#x27;conscience of a donor&#x27; is in the light of religious belief much\n\naway from &#x27;freedom of conscience&#x27;. After all the meaning of a\n\nword takes its colour with the companion words i.e., noscitur\n\na sociis. After all, a word in a judgment cannot be construed\n\nas a word employed in a Statute. In the absence of\n\ndemonstrable conformity to the essentials of a decision, the\n\ndenomination        emerging   as    a   ratio   would   not   be   an\n\noperationable entity in every case comprising neighbourly fact\n\nmatrix. What is noticeable is that BIJOE EMMANUEL did not\n\ndemarcate the boundaries between &#x27;freedom of conscience&#x27;\n\n74   (1909) 33 BOM. 122\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                 85</span>\n\n\nand &#x27;right to practise religion&#x27; presumably because the overt\n\nact of the students in respectfully standing up while National\n\nAnthem was being sung transcended the realm of their\n\nconscience and took their case to the domain of religious\n\nbelief.

This is not a matter of primary or secondary\n      legislation or of local governmental regulation but rather\n      reflects a widespread and long-standing social practice. It\n      is exceptional for a school not to have a policy on uniform\n      for its pupils. The uniform (traditionally black or grey\n      trousers, jumpers and jackets in the coloured livery of the\n      school and ties for boys serves to identify individuals as\n      members of a specific institution and to encourage and\n      promote the corporate, collective ethos of the school. More\n      subtly, by insisting upon identical clothing (often from a\n      designated manufacturer) it ensures that all school\n      children dress the same and appear equal: thus,\n      differences of social and economic background that would\n      be evident from the nature and extent of personal\n      wardrobes are eliminated. It is an effective leveling\n      feature-particularly in comprehensive secondary schools\n      whose catchment areas may include a range of school\n      children drawn from differing parental income brackets\n      and social classes...&#x27;\n&#x27;AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE&#x27;, 2nd Edition.

In accord with the general principle that school\n      authorities may make reasonable rules and regulations\n      governing the conduct of pupils under their control, it may\n      be stated generally that school authorities may prescribe\n      the kind of dress to be worn by students or make\n      reasonable     regulations   as    to    their    personal\n      appearance...It has been held that so long as students\n      are under the control of school authorities, they may be\n      required to wear a designated uniform, or may be\n      forbidden to use face powder or cosmetics, or to wear\n      transparent hosiery low-necked dresses, or any style of\n      clothing tending toward immodesty in dress...\n      §251.

Thus, it has been held that a public high\n     school regulation which bars a student from attending\n     classes because of the length or appearance of his hair is\n     not invalid as being unreasonable, and arbitrary as\n     having no reasonable connection with the successful\n     operation of the school, since a student&#x27;s unusual\n     hairstyle could result in the distraction of other pupils,\n     and could disrupt and impede the maintenance of a\n     proper classroom atmosphere or decorum...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">     (ii)   The   argument of petitioners that prescribing\n\nschool uniforms pertains to the domain of &#x27;police power&#x27; and\n\ntherefore, unless the law in so many words confers such\n\npower, there cannot be any prescription, is too farfetched. In\n\ncivilized societies, preachers of the education are treated next\n\nto the parents. Pupils are under the supervisory control of the\n\nteachers.

It can, for instance, indicate the quality of the\n     teachers by prescribing the minimum qualifications that\n     they must possess, and the courses of study and\n     curricula. It can, for the same reasons, also stipulate the\n     existence of infrastructure sufficient for its growth, as a\n     pre-requisite. But the essence of a private educational\n     institution is the autonomy that the institution must have\n     in its management and administration. There,\n     necessarily, has to be a difference in the administration\n     of private unaided institutions and the government-aided\n     institutions. Whereas in the latter case, the Government\n     will have greater say in the administration, including\n     admissions and fixing of fees, in the case of private\n     unaided institutions, maximum autonomy in the day-to-\n     day administration has to be with the private unaided\n     institutions.

As already\n\nmentioned above, the Fundamental Rights have relative\n\ncontent     and   their   efficacy    levels   depend   upon   the\n\ncircumstances in which they are sought to be exercised. To\n\nevaluate the content and effect of restrictions and to adjudge\n\ntheir reasonableness, the aforesaid tests become handy.\n\nHowever, the petitions we are treating do not involve the right\n\nto freedom of speech &amp; expression or right to privacy, to such\n\nan extent as to warrant the employment of these tests for\n\nevaluation of argued restrictions, in the form of school dress\n\ncode. The complaint of the petitioners is against the violation\n\nof essentially &#x27;derivative rights&#x27; of the kind. Their grievances\n\ndo not go to the core of substantive rights as such but lie in\n\nthe penumbra thereof. So, by a sheer constitutional logic, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                  100</span>\n\n\nprotection that otherwise avails to the substantive rights as\n\nsuch cannot be stretched too far even to cover the derivative\n\nrights of this nature, regardless of the &#x27;qualified public places&#x27;\n\nin which they are sought to be exercised. It hardly needs to be\n\nstated that schools are &#x27;qualified public places&#x27; that are\n\nstructured     predominantly       for    imparting    educational\n\ninstructions to the students. Such &#x27;qualified spaces&#x27; by their\n\nvery nature repel the assertion of individual rights to the\n\ndetriment of their general discipline &amp; decorum. Even the\n\nsubstantive rights themselves metamorphise into a kind of\n\nderivative rights in such places. These illustrate this: the\n\nrights   of   an   under   -   trial   detenue   qualitatively   and\n\nquantitatively are inferior to those of a free citizen.

In\n\nsupport of this, they bank upon the &#x27;principle of reasonable\n\naccommodation&#x27;. They drew our attention to the prevalent\n\npractice of dress codes/uniforms in Kendriya Vidyalayas. We\n\nare not impressed by this argument. Reasons are not far to\n\nseek: firstly, such a proposal if accepted, the school uniform\n\nceases to be uniform. There shall be two categories of girl\n\nstudents viz., those who wear the uniform with hijab and\n\nthose who do it without. That would establish a sense of\n\n&#x27;social-separateness&#x27;, which is not desirable. It also offends\n\nthe feel of uniformity which the dress-code is designed to\n\nbring about amongst all the students regardless of their\n\nreligion &amp; faiths. As already mentioned above, the statutory\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                                  107</span>\n\n\nscheme     militates   against   sectarianism        of   every   kind.\n\nTherefore, the accommodation which the petitioners seek\n\ncannot be said to be reasonable.          The object of prescribing\n\nuniform will be defeated if there is non-uniformity in the\n\nmatter of uniforms. Youth is an impressionable period when\n\nidentity and opinion begin to crystallize. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"128534619\" id=\"span_176\">Young students are\n\nable to readily grasp from their immediate environment,\n\ndifferentiating lines of race, region, religion, language, caste,\n\nplace of birth, etc. The aim of the regulation is to create a\n\n&#x27;safe space&#x27; where such divisive lines should have no place\n\nand the ideals of egalitarianism should be readily apparent to\n\nall students alike.

Constitutional\n\nschemes and socio-political ideologies vary from one country\n\nto another, regardless of textual similarities. A Constitution of\n\na country being the Fundamental Law, is shaped by several\n\nstreams of forces such as history, religion, culture, way of life,\n\nvalues and a host of such other factors. In a given fact matrix,\n\nhow a foreign jurisdiction treats the case cannot be the sole\n\nmodel readily availing for adoption in our system which\n\nordinarily treats foreign law &amp; foreign judgments as matters of\n\nfacts. Secondly, the said case involved a nose stud, which is\n\nocularly insignificantly, apparently being as small as can be.\n\nBy no stretch of imagination, that would not in any way affect\n\nthe uniformity which the dress code intends to bring in the\n\nclass room. That was an inarticulate factor of the said\n\njudgment. By and large, the first reason supra answers the\n\nMalaysian court decision too85. Malaysia being a theistic\n\nNation has Islam as the State religion and the court in its\n\nwisdom treated wearing hijab as being a part of religious\n\npractice.

The near\n\nEnglish version of the above as submitted by both the sides is\n\nalready stated in the beginning part of the judgment.\n\nHowever, the same is reiterated for the ease of reference:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">Students should compulsorily adhere to the dress code/uniform\n\nas follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">     a. in government          schools,    as   prescribed    by     the\n        government;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">     b. in private schools, as prescribed by the school\n        management;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">     c. in Pre-University colleges that come within the\n        jurisdiction of the Department of the Pre-University\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                      114</span>\n\n\n             Education, as prescribed by the College Development\n             Committee or College Supervision Committee; and\n      d. wherever no dress code is prescribed, such attire that\n         would accord with &#x27;equality &amp; integrity&#x27; and would not\n         disrupt the &#x27;public order&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">      (ii)     Petitioners firstly argued that this Order suffers\n\nfrom material irregularity apparent on its face inasmuch as\n\nthe rulings cited therein do not lay down the ratio which the\n\ngovernment wrongly states that they do. This Order refers to\n\ntwo decisions of the Kerala High Court and one decision of\n\nBombay and Madras High Courts each. We have already\n\ndiscussed all these decisions supra at paragraph (X) and\n\ntherefore, much need not be discussed here. Regardless of the\n\nratio of these decisions, if the Government Order is otherwise\n\nsustainable in law, which we believe it does, the challenge\n\nthereto has to fail for more than one reason: The subject\n\nmatter of the Government Order is the prescription of school\n\nuniform. Power to prescribe, we have already held, avails in\n\nthe   scheme       of   1983   Act    and   the   Rules   promulgated\n\nthereunder. <a href=\"/doc/101438362/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 133(2)</a> of the Act which is broadly worded\n\nempowers the government to issue any directions to give effect\n\nto the purposes of the Act or to any provision of the Act or to\n\nany Rule made thereunder. This is a wide conferment of\n\npower which obviously includes the authority to prescribe\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">                                   115</span>\n\n\nschool dress code. It is more so because Rule 11 of 1995\n\nCurricula Rules itself provides for the prescription of school\n\nuniform and its modalities. The Government Order can be\n\nconstrued as the one issued to give effect to this rule itself.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_191\">Such an order needs to be construed in the light of the said\n\nrule and the 2014 Circular, since there exists a kinship inter\n\nse.   Therefore,     the   question     as   to   competence   of   the\n\ngovernment to issue order of the kind is answered in the\n\naffirmative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_193\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1008845\" id=\"span_186\">(iii)    Petitioners&#x27; second contention relates to exercise of\n\nstatutory power by the government that culminated into\n\nissuance of the impugned order. There is difference between\n\nexistence of power and the exercise of power; existence of\n\npower per se does not justify its exercise. The public power\n\nthat is coupled with duty needs to be wielded for effectuating\n\nthe purpose of its conferment. Learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe students argued that the Government Order has to be\n\nvoided since the reasons on which it is structured are ex facie\n\nbad and that new grounds cannot be imported to the body of\n\nthe Order for infusing validity thereto vide <a href=\"/doc/1008845/\" id=\"a_213\">COMMISSIONER OF\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                                   116</span>\n\n\nPOLICE          vs.   GORDHANDAS        BHANJE87</a>.

However, we are not sure of its invocation in a\n\ncase wherein validity of the impugned order can otherwise be\n\nsustained on the basis of other intrinsic material. As we have\n\nalready mentioned, the Government Order is issued to give\n\neffect to the purposes of the 1983 Act and to Rule 11 of the\n\n1995 Curricula Rules. That being the position the question of\n\nun-sustainability of some of the reasons on which the said\n\nOrder is constructed, pales into insignificance.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_194\">         (iv)    Petitioners next argued that the Government Order\n\ncites &#x27;sārvajanika suvyavasthe&#x27; i.e., &#x27;public order&#x27; as one of the\n\nreasons for prescribing uniform to the exclusion of hijab;\n\ndisruption of public order is not by those who wear this\n\napparel but by those who oppose it; most of these opposers\n\nwear bhagwa or such other cloth symbolic of religious\n\novertones. The government should take action against the\n\nhooligans disrupting peace, instead of asking the Muslim girl\n\n87   AIR 1952 SC 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                117</span>\n\n\nstudents to remove their hijab. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"301795\" id=\"span_190\">In support of this contention,\n\nthey drew attention of the court to the concept of &#x27;hecklers\n\nveto&#x27; as discussed in <a href=\"/doc/301795/\" id=\"a_215\">K.M.SHANKARAPPA</a>, supra.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"479666\" id=\"span_191\">They further\n\nargued that ours being a &#x27;positive secularism&#x27;, the State\n\nshould endeavor to create congenial atmosphere for the\n\nexercise of citizens rights, by taking stern action against those\n\nwho obstruct vide <a href=\"/doc/479666/\" id=\"a_216\">PRAVEEN BHAI THOGADIA</a>, supra. Again\n\nwe do not have any quarrel with the proposition of law.\n\nHowever, we are not convinced that the same is invocable for\n\ninvalidating the Government Order, which per se does not\n\nprescribe any uniform but only provides for prescription in a\n\nstructured way, which we have already upheld in the light of\n\nour specific finding that wearing hijab is not an essential\n\nreligious practice and school uniform to its exclusion can be\n\nprescribed. It hardly needs to be stated that the uniform can\n\nexclude any other apparel like bhagwa or blue shawl that may\n\nhave the visible religious overtones. The object of prescribing\n\nuniform cannot be better stated than by quoting from\n\n&#x27;MANUAL     ON   SCHOOL     UNIFORMS&#x27;      published   by   U.S.\n\nDepartment of Education:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_195\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">     &#x27;A safe and disciplined learning environment is the first\n     requirement of a good school.

In\n     response to growing levels of violence in our schools,\n     many parents, teachers, and school officials have come to\n     see school uniforms as one positive and creative way to\n     reduce discipline problems and increase school safety.&#x27;\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">     (v)   We hasten to add that certain terms used in a\n\nGovernment Order such as &#x27;public order&#x27;, etc., cannot be\n\nconstrued as the ones employed in the Constitution or\n\nStatutes. There is a sea of difference in the textual structuring\n\nof legislation and in promulgating a statutory order as the one\n\nat hands. The draftsmen of the former are ascribed of due\n\ndiligence &amp; seriousness in the employment of terminology\n\nwhich the government officers at times lack whilst textually\n\nframing the statutory policies. Nowadays, courts do often\n\ncome across several Government Orders and Circulars which\n\nhave lavish terminologies, at times lending weight to the\n\nchallenge. The words used in Government Orders have to be\n\nconstrued in the generality of their text and with common\n\nsense and with a measure of grace to their linguistic pitfalls.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">The text &amp; context of the Act under which such orders are\n\nissued also figure in the mind. The impugned order could\n\nhave been well drafted, is true. &#x27;There is scope for improvement\n\neven in heaven&#x27; said Oscar Wilde. We cannot resist ourselves\n\nfrom quoting what Justice Holmes had said in TOWNE vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                    119</span>\n\n\nEISNER88,       &quot;a   word   is   not   a   crystal,   transparent   and\n\nunchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary\n\ngreatly in color and content according to the circumstances and\n\nthe time in which it is used.&quot; <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"791725\" id=\"span_194\">Thus, there is no much scope for\n\ninvoking the concept of &#x27;law and order&#x27; as discussed in <a href=\"/doc/791725/\" id=\"a_217\">ANITA\n\nand GULAB ABBAS</a>, supra, although the Government Order\n\ngives a loose impression that there is some nexus between\n\nwearing of hijab and the &#x27;law &amp; order&#x27; situation.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">         (vi)   Petitioners had also produced some &#x27;loose papers&#x27;\n\nwithout head and tail, which purported to be of a brochure\n\nissued by the Education Department to the effect that there\n\nwas no requirement of any school uniform and that the\n\nprescription of one by any institution shall be illegal. There is\n\nnothing on record for authenticating this version. Those\n\nproducing the same have not stated as to who their author is\n\nand what legal authority he possessed to issue the same.\n\nEven otherwise, this purported brochure cannot stand in the\n\nface of Government Order dated 05.02.2022 whose validity we\n\nhave already considered. Similarly, petitioners had banked\n\nupon the so called research papers allegedly published by\n\n&#x27;Pew Research Centre&#x27; about religious clothing and personal\n\n88   245 U.S.418 (1918)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                     <a href=\"/doc/135256845/\" id=\"a_218\">120</a></span>\n\n\nappearance. They contend that this paper is generated from\n\nthe   research    that    studied     various   religious   groups   &amp;\n\ncommunities and that a finding has been recorded: &#x27;Most\n\nHindu, Muslim and Sikh women cover their heads outside the\n\nhome&#x27; and therefore, the Government Order which militates\n\nagainst this social reality, is arbitrary. We are not inclined to\n\nsubscribe to this view. No credentials of the researchers are\n\nstated nor the representative character of the statistics\n\nmentioned in the papers are demonstrated. The authenticity\n\nof the contents is apparently lacking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">      (vii)   Petitioners contended that the said Government\n\nOrder has been hastily issued even when the contemplated\n\nHigh Powered Committee was yet to look into the issue as to\n\nthe desirability of prescription and modules of dress codes in\n\nthe educational institutions. The contents of Government\n\nOrder give this impression, is true. However, that is too feeble\n\na ground for faltering a policy decision like this. At times,\n\nregard being had to special conditions like social unrest and\n\npublic   agitations,     governments      do    take   certain   urgent\n\ndecisions which may appear to be knee-jerk reactions.\n\nHowever, these are matters of perceptions. May be, such\n\ndecisions are at times in variance with their earlier stand.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                               121</span>\n\n\nEven that cannot be faltered when they are dictated by\n\ncircumstances. After all, in matters of this kind, the doctrine\n\nof &#x27;estoppel&#x27; does not readily apply. Whether a particular\n\ndecision should be taken at a particular time, is a matter left\n\nto the executive wisdom, and courts cannot run a race of\n\nopinions with the Executive, more particularly when policy\n\ncontent &amp; considerations that shaped the decision are not\n\njudicially assessable. The doctrine of &#x27;separation of powers&#x27;\n\nwhich figures in our constitution as a &#x27;basic feature&#x27; expects\n\nthe organs of the State to show due deference to each other&#x27;s\n\nopinions. The last contention that the Government Order is a\n\nproduct of &#x27;acting under dictation&#x27; and therefore, is bad in law\n\nis bit difficult to countenance. Who acted under whose\n\ndictation cannot be adjudged merely on the basis of some\n\nconcessional arguments submitted on behalf of the State\n\nGovernment. Such a proposition cannot be readily invoked\n\ninasmuch as invocation would affect the institutional dignity\n\n&amp; efficacy of the government. A strong case has to be made to\n\ninvoke such a ground, in terms of pleadings &amp; proof.\n\nIn view of the above, we are of the considered opinion\nthat the government has power to issue the impugned\nOrder dated 05.2.2022 and that no case is made out for\nits invalidation.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                122</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_200\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_7\">XVII.

Strangely, petitioners\n\nhave also sought for a Writ of Quo Warranto against\n\nrespondent Nos. 15 &amp; 16 for their alleged interference in the\n\nadministration of 5th respondent school and for promoting\n\npolitical agenda. The petition is apparently ill-drafted and\n\npleadings lack cogency and coherence that are required for\n\nconsidering the serious prayers of this kind. We have already\n\ncommented upon the Departmental Guidelines as having no\n\nforce of law. Therefore, the question of the said respondents\n\nviolating the same even remotely does not arise. We have also\n\nrecorded a finding that the college can prescribe uniform to\n\nthe exclusion of hijab or bhagwa or such other religious\n\nsymbols, and therefore, the alleged act of the respondents in\n\nseeking adherence to the school discipline &amp; dress code\n\ncannot be faltered. Absolutely no case is made out for\n\ngranting the prayers or any other reliefs on the basis of these\n\npleadings. The law of Quo Warranto is no longer in a fluid\n\nstate in our country; the principles governing issuance of this\n\nwrit having been well defined vide <a href=\"/doc/295084/\" id=\"a_221\">UNIVERSITY OF MYSORE\n\nvs. C.D.

The petition\n\nmentions about BIJOE EMMANUEL, INDIAN YOUNG LAWYERS\n\nASSOCIATION,              JAGADISHWARANANDA                AVADHUTA,\n\nCHANDANMAL vs. STATE OF WEST BENGAL90 and such other\n\ncases. Petition is unsatisfactorily structured on the basis of\n\nsome print &amp; electronic media reports that are not made part\n\nof the paper book. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165779159\" id=\"span_205\">There is another PIL in <a href=\"/doc/165779159/\" id=\"a_222\">GHANSHYAM\n\nUPADHYAY VS.

There\n\nare other incoherent prayers. This petitioner opposes the case\n\nof students who desire to wear hijab. Most of the contentions\n\ntaken up in these petitions are broadly treated in the\n\ncompanion Writ Petitions. We are not inclined to entertain\n\nthese two Writ Petitions filed in PIL jurisdiction, both on the\n\nground of their maintainability &amp; merits. The second petition,\n\nit needs to be stated, seeks to expand the parameters of the\n\nessential lis involved in all these cases much beyond the\n\nwarranted frame of consideration. In W.P.No.3942/2022 (GM-\n\nRES-PIL) between ABDUL MANSOOR MURTUZA SAYED AND\n\nSTATE OF KARNATAKA decided on 25.02.2022, we have\n\nalready held that when the aggrieved parties are effectively\n\nprosecuting their personal causes, others cannot interfere by\n\ninvoking PIL jurisdiction. A battery of eminent lawyers are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                                    129</span>\n\n\nrepresenting the parties on both the sides. Even otherwise, no\n\nexceptional case is made out for our indulgence.\n\n In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion\n that both the above Writ Petitions filed as Public\n Interest Litigations are liable to be rejected, absolutely\n no case having been made out for indulgence.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_211\">         In the above circumstances, all these petitions being\n\ndevoid of merits, are liable to be and accordingly are\n\ndismissed. In view of dismissal of these Writ Petitions, all\n\npending      applications   pale    into   insignificance   and   are\n\naccordingly, disposed off.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_212\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">         Costs made easy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">                                             Sd/-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">                                         CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n\n\n                                             Sd/-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_217\">                                            JUDGE\n\n\n\n                                             Sd/-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">                                            JUDGE\n\n\n\n\nSJ/CBC\n </p>","numcites":103,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Karnataka High Court","citetid":140390250,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"essential religious practices","formInput":"essential%20religious%20practices"},{"value":"freedom of religion","formInput":"freedom%20of%20religion"},{"value":"Hijab","formInput":"Hijab"},{"value":"wearing hijab","formInput":"wearing%20hijab"},{"value":"article 25","formInput":"article%2025"},{"value":"article 25 of constitution","formInput":"article%2025%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"right to freedom of religion","formInput":"right%20to%20freedom%20of%20religion"},{"value":"essential part of religion","formInput":"essential%20part%20of%20religion"},{"value":"freedom of conscience","formInput":"freedom%20of%20conscience"},{"value":"public order, morality and health","formInput":"public%20order%2C%20morality%20and%20health"},{"value":"dress code ","formInput":"dress%20code%20"},{"value":"article 15","formInput":"article%2015"},{"value":"quo warranto","formInput":"quo%20warranto"},{"value":"the karnataka education act 1983","formInput":"the%20karnataka%20education%20act%201983"},{"value":"religious practices","formInput":"religious%20practices"},{"value":"sushal tiwari","formInput":"sushal%20tiwari"},{"value":"secularism","formInput":"secularism"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"the karnataka education act","formInput":"the%20karnataka%20education%20act"},{"value":"molestation","formInput":"molestation"}],"cats":[{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"free-speech","formInput":"tag:free-speech"},{"value":"prohibition-of-discrimination","formInput":"tag:prohibition-of-discrimination"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
