The specific and exclusive information has\n       been sought by the appellant in respect of retired public servants\n       only. Such separate data is not available in the database and\n       cannot be provided by this public authority.

As per information gathered under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act</a> reveals, only\n      halfhearted attempts are made to curb corruption and serious\n      cases are closed on the ground that its efforts are being\n      stonewalled. Officers involved in criminal/ vigilance cases are\n      being allowed to work as DDG Vigilance and hold other important\n      posts. For example, in defence estates department those who are\n      blowing whistle on corruption are being issued charge sheets and\n      those involved in corruption cases are being protected and\n      promoted.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">File no.

Gupta, Under Secretary informing him as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      &quot;Para (1)\n      Generally the commission advises imposition of major/ minor\n      penalties without specifying the exact nature of penalty to be\n      imposed on charged officials. Final decision to impose penalty is\n      taken by the concerned disciplinary authority, therefore, information\n      requested by you is not maintained in the Commission.\n      Para (2) &amp; (4)\n      The information is not available with the Commission. The\n      Commissi8on is concerned only with the appointment of the CVO.\n      In one case, however, it has been reported to the Commission that\n      FIR has been lodged by the CBI against a Vigilance Officer of\n      NIACL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      Para (3)\n      The Commission is concerned (and its concurrence is required)\n      only in the matter of selection/ appointment of CVOs. The CVO of\n      the organization generally ensures that officers who are clear from\n      vigilance angle only are appointed as well as CVO of the company\n      have decided to continue utilising the services of the said officer.\n      Para (5)\n      After examining the report received from the Ministry of Defence,\n      regarding the complaints received against DDG (Vigilance), DGDE,\n      relating to his alleged involvement in a criminal case, the\n      Commission decided not to pursue this issue further.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      Not satisfied, Shri Sudhir Chopra has moved an appeal before Shri V. K.\nGupta, Addl. Secretary on 6.5.08, pleading as below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      &quot;2.     CPIO instead of giving the required information declined the\n              same     vide    his    undated      letter   bearing    no.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        4</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">              CVC/RTI/07/790/3308 on the ground that the Commission\n             simply advises imposition of penalty and final decision to\n             impose penalty is to be taken by the concerned disciplinary\n             authority and information requested is not maintained by the\n             Commission.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">       3.    It is unbelievable that the Commission does not maintain\n             such information. In case this indeed is the case, it is quite\n             shocking. Under these circumstances CPIO should have\n             forwarded my application to concerned administrative\n             authorities in Govt. of India who had been advised imposition\n             of major penalty of removal/ dismissal from service during\n             last five years to know how many public servants were still\n             continuing on their jobs who were imposed penalty of\n             removal/ dismissal of service and how many had been\n             actually removed/ dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       4.    In Defence Estates, Department, one official who was\n             caught accepting bribe red handed by CBI and convicted by\n             Court was compulsorily retried with full pensioner benefits.\n             Therefore, there may be many cases where public servants\n             who were imposed penalty of removal/dismissal from service\n             may still be continuing on their jobs or retired with full\n             pensionary benefits. As per <a href=\"/doc/1591547/\" id=\"a_6\">section 6 (3) (i)</a> &amp; (ii) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">RTI\n             Act</a> if information requested is held by another public\n             authority, the public authority to whom such an application is\n             made, shall transfer the application or part thereof to that\n             other public authority and inform the applicant immediately\n             about such transfer. This was not done by the CPIO.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       5.    Similarly no information was provided on remaining four\n             points and CPIO gave irrelevant reply.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       6.    CPIO also did not intimate the particulars of appellate\n             authority to whom appeal could be made. He treated the\n             application in a totally non serious manner and acted\n             malafidely.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">       In his order of 3.6.08 appellate authority Shri V. K. Gupta AS has held as\nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       &quot;On examining the appeal, I find that the same has been received\n       after considerable lapse of time i.e. almost 90 days of the reply of\n       the CPIO concerned. I also find that no reason or cause has been\n       stated by the appellant for the delay in preferring this appeal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       In view of above, I find that there is no merit or cause to reconsider\n       the appeal and, therefore, the same is rejected.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         5</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">       In this case, appellant&#x27;s prayer before us in second appeal is as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      &quot;(i)     Direction to CPIO to provide request information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      (ii)     Penalty on CPIO and appellate authority for malafidely\n               declining information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      (iii)    Cost and damages (Rs. 100000+10000).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">File no.

Such specific information is\n              not readily available in the vigilance complaints/ case\n              database of the Commission. Further, many of the cases\n              referred by CVOs for advice during the said period are still at\n              various stages of finalization and information of pending\n              disciplinary cases cannot be provided to the appellant.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">              However, department/ organization wise information details\n              on number of cases, advice of Commission and nature of\n              penalty imposed with date in respect of finalized cases\n              initiated on references received in the Commission from\n              CVOs may be provided to the appellant for five years that is\n              for the years 2002 to 2006 in so far as points at 1 to 5 of the\n              application is concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      (ii)    In so far as points 5 to 8 raised by the appellant, which relate\n              to whistle blower complaints (PIDPIR), as the scheme of\n              PIDPR came into effect in April 2004, data on number of\n              complaints received up to December 2007, department/\n              organization wise of such complaints and reports called for\n              by Commission on such complaints can be provided to the\n              appellant.

As\n              such cases have not been finalized by the departments\n              concerned, information and related details are denied as\n              disclosure of information would impede the process of\n              investigation/ inquiry proceedings as well as it would cause\n              unwarranted invasion of the privacy of individuals or reveal\n              the identity/ source of information.

(Complete records and\n                correspondence is required).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">         2.     Details of those cases where CVC recommended imposition\n                of penalty, during last three years but charge sheet has still\n                not been issued (nature of irregularity, place etc require)\n                Names of officers not required.&#x27;\n\n         To this Shri Chopra has received a response dated 3.6.08 from CPIO Ms.\nShalini Darbari, Director, as below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">         &quot;Para 1\n         It is informed that the Commission does not maintain such data.\n         Para 2\n         The question asked is not clear, however, it is intimated that there\n         are 06 cases in which CVC has recommended initiation of\n         disciplinary proceedings in respect of Defence Estates Department\n         during last three years and charge sheet still not been issued.\n         Details of these cases cannot be provided as these cases are still\n         pending for logical end.&#x27;\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                          9</span>\n       Shri Chopra has then moved an appeal on 10.6.08, which was received in\nthe CVC on 12.6.08 in which he has submitted, as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">      &quot;As per <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">RTI Act</a>, CPIO&#x27;s role is not limited to provide data already\n      maintained. He or she has together the requisite information from\n      whosoever may be having it. Moreover CVC is not a statistical\n      organization whose job is limited to compiling data only.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      Therefore, it is requested to instruct CPIO together and provide the\n      required information. One case I have myself pointed out above.\n      Since PIO is not giving details of complaints under investigation, it\n      is difficult to know which complaints have been filed and which\n      complaint is still under investigation and why it is taking so much\n      time.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">      Upon this Shri Chopra received the following order from Shri Vineet K\nGupta AS allowing the appeal in part, as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      &quot;On examining the documents and connected papers pertaining to\n      this appeal, I find that the information sought by the appellant under\n      point no. 1 is not available in ready form and to cull it out large\n      number of files will have to be shifted which is beyond the scope of\n      <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">RTI Act</a> and would amount to creation of information. As such, I\n      hold that the CPIO has rightly denied this information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      Regarding point no. 2 of the request, appellant states that the\n      reasons given for denying details of six cases by the CPIO stating\n      that the cases are pending for logical end is not correct. However, I\n      find that the CPIO has not sought specific exemptions under any of\n      the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_20\">section 8</a> while denying information. CIC has in\n      various decisions clearly stated that information/ details on such\n      pending issues are exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_21\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> of the RTI Act,\n      as disclosure of information at this stage would impede the process\n      of investigation/ inquiry. CPIO may however, provide to the\n      appellant such readily available detail of these six cases, which\n      would not affect or impede the inquiries. Further, details like\n      investigation report including evidentiary part, noting etc., of the six\n      cases sought by the appellant cannot be provided at this stage. In\n      addition, CPIO is also directed to ensure that specific reasons are\n      given while denying information invoking relevant provisions of\n      <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_22\">section 8</a> of RTI Act, while reply to RTI applications in future.&#x27;\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                        10</span>\n However, appellant&#x27;s prayer in second appeal is again as below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      &quot;(i)     Direction to CPIO to provide request information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      (ii)     Penalty on CPIO and appellate authority for malafidely\n               declining requested information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      (iii)    Cost and damages (Rs. 10000+1000).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      In response to our appeal notice in each of these cases, we have received\nthe   following    response     with   regard    to   the   appeal    in   File   No.\nCIC/WB/A/2008/01538 from CPIO Shri P. S. Gupta, Advisor, CVC:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      &quot;(iii)   The appellant has submitted three grounds in his appeal. As\n               regards the first ground, it is submitted that the inspection of\n               the file has been denied under the relevant section of the\n               <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_23\">RTI Act, 2005</a>, not malafidely, as contended by the\n               appellant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">      (iv)     As regards the second ground, it is submitted that no\n               fundamental right has been violated.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">      (v)      As regards the third ground of appeal, it is submitted that the\n               judgment cited by the appellant is case specific and as such\n               is not be applicable to all cases.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">      Further in the case of Ms. Rukshana Shaheen Khan vs. Central\n      Vigilance Commission in appeal No. CIC/WB/A/2007/00092 CIC in\n      its decision dated 30.11.2007 had held that if CVC, under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_24\">section 8\n      (1) (h)</a> has come to conclusion that disclosure of information will\n      impede the process of investigation and prosecution of an offender,\n      CIC normally does not substitute its judgment for that of the\n      authorized investigating agency. Similar view has been taken by\n      the CIC cases of Shri V. R. Gokhale (Appeal No.\n      CIC/WB/A/2006/00853) and Shri S. K. Nagarwala vs. CVC (Case\n      No. 92 IC (A)/2006, dated 7.7.2006). Therefore, the present appeal\n      before the CIC does not sustain and deserves to be dismissed.\n      This public authority, therefore requests the Hon&#x27;ble CIC to order\n      accordingly.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      These four appeals were scheduled for hearing on 3.12.2009. The\nfollowing are present:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">      Respondents\n           Sh. Prem Sagar Gupta, Advisor CVC\n           Sh. Rajeev Sharma, US / CPIO\n           Sh. A. K.

He, however, requested for an\nadjournment since he wished to be heard. Respondent Shri Prem Sagar Gupta,\nAdvisor, CVC submitted that there are a number of cases which appellant Shri\nSudhir Chopra has brought before the CVC. However, he had no objection to an\nadjournment to allow appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra full opportunity to be heard.\nIn light of this the hearing was adjourned to 23.12.2009 at 4.00 p.m. by\nvideoconference with Pune. The appeal was then heard on 23.12.2009. The\nfollowing are present:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">       Appellant (at NIC Studio, Pune)\n             Shri Sudhir Chopra\n       Respondents (at CIC chambers, New Delhi)\n             Shri Rajiv Verma, Under Secretary\n             Shri A. K. Gupta, Under Secretary\n\n       Shri Sudhir Chopra submitted that in addition to these four appeals, there\nare two other appeals regarding which notice of hearing has also been issued but\nhave not been included in the present hearing. Upon this Shri Rajiv Verma,\nUnder Secretary, CVC submitted that the above two cases stand disposed of in\nour Decision also of 3.12.09, when the four appeals, which are part of the\npresent hearing, were adjourned. Each of the remaining cases was then heard.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">       In the case of appeal in File No. CIC/WB/A/2008/01395, respondents Shri\nRajiv Verma submitted that the information sought is not held by the\nCommission, as explained to appellant in response to his initial application. In\nthis case, appellant&#x27;s only plea is that such information should be held.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">       In File No. CIC/WB/A/2008/01536 again the issue with regard to\ninformation sought is that it is not maintained in the Commission. In this case,\nCPIO Shri A. K. Gupta submitted that what appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra has\nasked for in his the application is information on a specific major penalty which is\nremoval / dismissal from service.       He explained that although a record is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                        12</span>\n maintained in accordance with the Commission&#x27;s advice of the cases where a\nmajor or a minor penalty has been recommended, there is no break-up of the\ntype of penalty, since the recommendations of the Central Vigilance Commission\nmake no such categorization. Appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra, however, submitted\nthat even though the CVC itself may not recommend dismissal or removal it\nshould maintain a record of the manner of compliance in implementation of its\norders.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">       In the case of File No. CIC/WB/A/2008/01537, the only issue is the\ndisclosure of information with regard to cases that are under investigation. In this\ncontext, Shri Rajiv Verma, Under Secretary submitted that the details of the\ncases referred to the CVC with regard to questions 1 to 4 are provided in the\nAnnual Reports of the Commission which are uploaded on their website, the\naddress of which has been provided to appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra. Appellant\nShri Chopra, on the other hand, submitted that with regard to questions 5 to 8, he\nhad asked for details that are not part of the Annual Report. On this matter,\nalthough respondent Shri Rajiv Verma submitted that this would violate\nexemption provided<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_25\"> u/s 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act by intruding on the privacy of the\naccused, appellant submitted that he was not interested in learning of the identity\nof the persons against whom the cases have been initiated, but only the nature of\nsuch cases in terms of detail sought.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">       Finally in case in File No. CIC/WB/A/2008/01538, the plea of appellant\nShri Sudhir Chopra is that although appellate authority has directed that the\nCPIO supply to the appellant &quot;such readily available details of the six cases\nwhich should not affect or impede the enquiry&quot;, no such information has been\nprovided. Shri Rajiv Verma, Under Secretary, on the other hand, submitted that\nin fact there has been compliance with this order through the letter of 287.8.&#x27;08\naddressed to appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra by CPIO Shri P. S. Gupta, Advisor,\nCVC in which he has provided the details of six cases of DGDE pending for\n&quot;logical end&quot; to appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra, as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                        13</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">     S.

Mohapatra of the Directorate\nGeneral of Defence Estates, in which the Director General has accused\nappellant, in these cases Shri Sudhir Chopra, of &quot;highly undesirable activities of\none of the officers of Indian Defence Estates Service who has been indulging in\nserial complaints deliberately and motivatedly against his superior officers for the\nlast several years. He often takes credit and licence from the fact that he has\nbeen conferred the status of a &#x27;whistle blower&#x27; by the CVC, a status he does not\ndeserve in the least, considering his various acts of indiscipline, continuous\ndefiance of authority for no rhyme or reason and his not so clean record of\nService&quot;. Shri Mohapatra has concluded his letter with the following comments:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                         14</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">       &quot;If the intent and objective of a whistle blower whose own record is\n      not straight, is to serve his personal interests, to shun and scorn his\n      official duties and obligations and above all to indulge in\n      mischievous, partisan propaganda and rumor-mongering, he\n      should be taken to task and stripped of his badge of whistle blower.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">      You may like to give your serious consideration to this matter and\n      take suitable measures to curb such tendentious propaganda and\n      mud slinging by Shri Sudhir Chopra.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">      With regard to the remaining two appeals to which reference was made by\nappellant Shri Sudhir Chopra in the hearing, we find that these have been\ndismissed by our order of 3.12.&#x27;09.

Access to information under <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3</a> of the Act is the\n            rule and exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 8</a>, the exception. <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\n            8</a> being a restriction on this fundamental right, is to be strictly\n            construed. It should not be interpreted in a manner as to\n            shadow the very right self. Under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8</a>, exemption from\n            releasing information is granted if it would impede the\n            process of investigation process cannot be a ground for\n            refusal of the information, the authority withholding\n            information must show satisfactory reasons as to why the\n            release of such information would hamper the investigation\n            process. Such reasons should be germane, and the opinion\n            of the process being hampered should be reasonable and\n            based on some material, sans this consideration, <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n            8(1) (h)</a> and other such provisions would become the haven\n            for dodging demands for information.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">      The ruling, therefore, requires that in refusing information the\n      reasons for doing so have to be provided, not simply citing a\n      particular clause in the Act. In both these cases, however, the\n      reasons have clearly been given and these are that both cases are\n      under investigation and opening the file itself to disclosure without\n      any specification of requirement, could compromise the entire\n      investigation process. In both these cases, &quot;satisfactory reasons&quot;\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                        15</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">        having clearly been given, it cannot be said that the CPIO in these\n       cases has sought exemption from disclosure<a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_31\"> u/s 8(1) (h)</a> without\n       disclosing the reasons for seeking such exemption. For this reason,\n       both these appeals of Shri Sudhir Chopra are unsustainable and\n       are hereby dismissed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">       With regard to the letter of Director General Shri C. R. Mohapatra,\nreceived by CVC, this concerns a decision to be taken by the CVC, which is the\nadministrative Department since 2007 with regard to implementation of the\n&quot;Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Informer&quot; Resolution, 2004.\nHowever, the use of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_32\">RTI Act</a> for the purpose of ensuring transparency and\naccountability can in no case be treated as a transgression of the liberty that the\nlaw grants to every citizen of India, since full compliance with the letter of the law\nitself is the best protection for such public authorities that wish to avoid the\ninconvenience of being repeatedly answerable on matters of routine procedure.\nSuch matters should normally be the subject of suo moto public disclosure as\nmandated under sub sections (b), (c) &amp; (d) of <a href=\"/doc/266825/\" id=\"a_33\">Sec. 4(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">       Coming to the specific appeals before us, we find that in File No.\nCIC/WB/A/2008/01395, CPIO has already informed appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra\nthat the CVC does not hold the information that he seeks. It is a moot point\nwhether the public authority should held such information. At any rate the CVC\nmay treat this application as a suggestion and take further action on its merits as\nsuch. However, this is not sustainable in appeal and this appeal is hereby\ndismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">       In the case of the appeal in File No.CIC/WB/A/2008/01536, on the other\nhand, it is quite clear that the information sought is with regard to compliance\nwith the directions of the CVC. The CVC being a public authority working to\nconserve public confidence in the incorruptibility of governance in itself makes\nclear that this kind of information falls clearly within the description of the kind of\ninformation that will be expected to be maintained and disclosed<a href=\"/doc/223525/\" id=\"a_34\"> u/s 4(1)(d)</a>\nwhich requires that every public authority shall &quot;provide reasons for its\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                          16</span>\n administrative or quasi-judicial decisions to affected persons.&quot; For this reason\nand as agreed by respondents in the hearing, such information with regard to six\nquestion, as the CVC holds will be provided to appellant Shri Sudhir Chopra\nwithin ten working days of the date of receipt of this Decision Notice. This appeal\nis thus allowed in part. There will be no costs\n\n\n       With regard to File No. CIC/WB/A/2008/01537, it has been argued, both\nat the level of CPIO and of First Appellate Authority Shri Vineet K Gupta, AS, that\nproviding of details sought at questions 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8 could, in addition to impeding\nthe process of investigation, also amount to invasion of privacy. It is correct that\nwe have held in many decisions that we have no clear definition of what is meant\nby invasion of privacy within the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_35\">RTI Act</a> . We have no equivalent of UK&#x27;s Date\nProtection Act, 1998, Sec 2 of which, titled &#x27;Sensitive Personal Data&#x27;, reads as\nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">       &quot;In this Act &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; means personal data\n       consisting of information as to:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">       a)     The racial or ethnic origin of the data subject.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_3\">       b)     His political opinions.\n       c)     His religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature.\n       d)     Whether he is a member of a Trade Union.\n       e)     His physical or mental health or condition.\n       f)     His sexual life.\n       g)     The commission or alleged commission by him of any\n              offence.\n       h)     Any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">              have been committed by him, the disposal of such\n              proceedings or the sentence of any court in such\n              proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">       To construe privacy to mean protection of personal data, we have found\nthis a suitable starting point to help define the concept. Clearly the information\nsought will fall squarely under Sec 2 (g) and (h) of that Act The US Restatement\nof the Law, Second, Torts, 652 on the other hand, defines the invasion of Privacy\nin the following manner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       One, who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the\n       solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                         17</span>\n       subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the\n      intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_20\">Moreover, the decision of the Supreme Court in 2004-(<a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_36\">008)-SUPREME-\n0547-SC District Registrar Collector, Hyderabad &amp; Anr.

History takes us back to Semayne&#x27;s case decided in 1603 (5\n      Coke&#x27;s Rep 91a) (77 Eng Rep 194) (KB) where it was laid down\n      that &#x27;Every man&#x27;s house is his castle. One of the most forceful\n      expressions of the above maxim was that William Pit in the British\n      Parliament in 1763. He said &quot;The poorest man may in his cottage\n      bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail its proof\n      may shake the wind may below through it the storm may enter, the\n      rain may enter but the Kind of England cannot enter his entire force\n      dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">      20. <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)\n      refers to privacy and it states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">      No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with the privacy,\n      family, home or correspondence nor to attacks upon his honour and\n      reputation.
