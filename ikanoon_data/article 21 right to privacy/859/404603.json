I regret I \ncannot persuade myself  to agree with the conclusions  recorded  in the said \njudgment, hence this separate opinion.  The Judgment of Sinha, J. has \nelaborately dealt with the facts, relevant rules and bye-laws of the Board of \nControl for Cricket in India (the Board). Hence, I consider it not necessary \nfor me to reproduce the same including the lengthy arguments advanced on \nbehalf of the parties except to make reference to the same to the extent \nnecessary  in the course of this judgment. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for the Board \nhas raised the preliminary issue in regard to the maintainability of this \npetition on the ground that under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 32</a>, a petition is not maintainable \nagainst the Board since the same is not &quot;State&quot; within the meaning of \n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.  It is this issue which is being \nconsidered  in this judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"471272\" id=\"span_1\">In support  of his argument Mr. K.K. Venugopal has contended  the \nBoard is not created by any statute and is only registered  under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_3\">Societies \nRegistration Act</a> 1860 and that it is an autonomous  body, administration of \nwhich is not controlled by any other authority including  Union of India, \n(U.O.I.) the first respondent  herein. He further submitted that it also does \nnot take any financial assistance from the Government nor is it subjected to \nany financial control by the Government or its accounts  are subject to the \nscrutiny of the Government. It is his submission that  though in the field of \nCricket  it enjoys  a monopoly  status  the same is not conferred on the Board \nby any statute  or by any order of the Government. It enjoys that monopoly \nstatus  only by virtue  of  its first mover advantage and its continuance  as \nthe solitary  player  in the field of cricket control.  He also submitted  that \nthere is no law which prohibits the coming into existence  of any other \nparallel organisation. The learned counsel further submitted that as per the \nparameters  laid down  by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/471272/\" id=\"a_4\">Pradeep Kumar  Biswas  vs. Indian \nInstitute of Chemical Biology &amp; Ors.</a> (2002 5 SCC 111), the Board cannot \nbe construed  as a State for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/471272/\" id=\"a_6\">the said judgment</a> \nbeing a judgment  of Seven Judge Bench  of this Court  is binding  on this \nBench. The argument  of Mr. K.K. Venugopal  is supplemented  and \nsupported  by the arguments of Dr. A.M. Singhvi and Soli J. Sorabjee \nappearing for the other contesting respondents.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">\tMr. Harish N. Salve, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \npetitioners  opposing the preliminary  objections  submitted that the  perusal \nof the Memorandum  and Articles of the Association  of the Board as also \nthe rules and regulations framed by the Board indicate that the Board has \nextensive powers  in selecting  players for the Indian National team \nrepresenting  India in test matches domestically  and internationally. He also \npointed out that the Board has the authority  of inviting foreign teams to play \nin India. He also further contended that the Board is the sole authority for \norganising   major cricketing  events in India and has the disciplinary power \nover the players/umpires and other officials  involved in the game and sports \nbeing a subject under the control of the States, in substance the Board \nexercises  governmental functions in the area of Cricket.  He submitted that \nthis absolute authority of the Board  is because  of the recognition  granted \nby the Government of India, hence in effect even though it is as an \nautonomous  body the same comes under &quot;other authorities&quot; for the \npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 12.</a> He also contended that the Board has the authority to \ndetermine whether a player would represent the country or not. Further, \nsince playing cricket  is a profession the Board controls the fundamental \nright of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_8\">Article  19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution.   It is his \nfurther  contention that many of the vital activities of the Board like sending \na team outside India or inviting foreign teams to India is subject to the prior \napproval  of the Government of India. Hence, the first respondent Union of \nIndia has pervasive  control  over the activities  of the Board.  For all these \nreasons, he submitted that the Board is &quot;other authorities&quot; within the \nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 12.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\tRespondent No. 1-Union of India has filed a counter affidavit  which \nis subsequently supplemented  by an additional affidavit  in which it is stated \nthat the Board was always subjected to de-facto control of the Ministry of \nYouth Affairs and Sports  in regard to international matches played \ndomestically and internationally.  In the said affidavit, it is also stated that \nthe Government of India  has granted de-facto  recognition to the Board and \ncontinues   to so recognise the Board as the Apex National Body for \nregulating  the game of Cricket in India. In the said affidavit it is also stated  \nthat it is because  of such recognition  granted by the Government of India \nthat the team selected by the Board is able to represent itself as the Indian \ncricket team  and if there had not been such recognition the team could not \nhave represented the country as the Indian cricket team in the international \ncricket arena. It is also stated that Board has to seek prior permission and \napproval from the Government of India whenever it has to travel outside the \ncountry to represent  the country.  Even in regard to Board&#x27;s invitation  to \nthe foreign  teams to visit India the Board has to take prior permission  of the \nGovernment of India and the Board is bound by any decision taken by the \nGovernment of India in this regard.  It is further stated that in the year 2002 \nthe Government had refused permission to the Board to play cricket in \nPakistan. It is also submitted that the  Government of India accepts the \nrecommendation of the Board in regard to awarding  &quot;Arjuna Awards&quot; as \nthe National Sports Federation representing  cricket.  In the said affidavit the \nGovernment of India has stated before this Court  that the activities of the \nBoard  are like that of a public body and not that of a private club.  It also \nasserted that it had once granted an amount of Rs. 1,35,000/-  to the Board \nfor the payment of air fares  for nine members of the Indian cricket team \nwhich went to   Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)  to participate  in the 16th \nCommonwealth Games in September 1998.  It is further stated that some of \nthe State Cricket Associations  which are members of the Board have also \ntaken financial assistance  of land lease from the respective  State \nGovernments.  It is also stated that though the Government  does not  \ninterfere with the day to day autonomous functioning of the Board, if it is \nrequired  the Board  has to answer  all clarifications  sought by the \nGovernment and the Board is responsible  and accountable  to the people of \nIndia and the Government of India which in turn is accountable  to \nParliament  in regard to team&#x27;s performance. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">\tMr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel has taken serious \nobjections to the stand taken by the Government of India in its additional \naffidavit  before this Court on the ground that the Government of India has \nbeen taking contrary positions in regard to the status of the Board in \ndifferent writ petitions pending before the different High Courts and now \neven in the Supreme Court, depending  upon the writ petitioners involved.  \nHe pointed out that in the stand taken by the Government of India  in a writ \npetition filed before the Delhi High Court and before the Bombay High \nCourt as also in the first affidavit  filed before this Court it had categorically \nstated that Government of India does not control the Board and that it is not \na State under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.  He pointed out from \nthe said affidavits that the  first respondent  had taken a stand in those \npetitions that the Government plays no role in the affairs of any member \nassociation and it does not provide  any financial  assistance to the Board for \nany purpose. It had also taken the stand before the  Delhi High Court that the \nBoard is an autonomous body and that the government had no control over \nthe Board. The learned counsel has also relied upon an affidavit filed by the \nBoard in this Court wherein the Board has specifically denied that the first \nrespondent has ever granted any recognition to the Board. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\tHence the question for consideration  in this petition is whether  the \nBoard falls within the definition of &quot;the State&quot; as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_11\">Article \n12</a> of the Constitution.  <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_12\">Article  12</a> reads thus :- \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;12. Definition\u0017In this part, unless the context  otherwise \nrequires, &quot;the State&quot; includes the Government and \nParliament of India and the Government and the Legislature  \nof each of the States and all local or other authorities within \nthe territory of India or under the control of the Government \nof India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">A perusal  of the above Article  shows that the definition  of State in \nthe said Article includes the Government of India, Parliament of India, \nGovernment of the State,  Legislatures of the States, local authorities as also \n&quot;other authorities&quot;.  It is the argument of the Board that it does not come \nunder the term &quot;other authorities&quot;, hence is not a State for the purpose of \n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 12.</a>  While the petitioner contends to the contrary on the ground that \nthe various activities of the Board  are in the nature of public duties.  A \nliteral reading of the definition of State under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 12</a> would not  bring the \nBoard under the term &quot;other authorities&quot;  for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 12.</a>  \nHowever, the process of judicial interpretation has expanded  the scope of  \nthe term &quot;other authorities&quot; in its various judgments.  It is on this basis that \nthe petitioners contend that the Board would come under  the expanded  \nmeaning of the term &quot;other authorities&quot;   in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 12</a> because of its \nactivities which is that of a public body discharging public function.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">Therefore, to understand the expanded meaning of the term &quot;other \nauthorities&quot;  in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 12</a>, it is necessary to trace the origin and scope  of \n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_18\">Article  12</a> in the Indian Constitution.   Present <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 12</a> was introduced in \nthe Draft Constitution  as <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 7.</a> While initiating a debate on this Article \nin the Draft Constitution in the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar \ndescribed  the scope  of this Article and the reasons why this Article was \nplaced in the Chapter  on fundamental rights as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;The object of the fundamental rights is \ntwofold. First, that every citizen must be in a \nposition to claim those rights. Secondly, they \nmust be binding upon every authority \u0016 I shall \npresently explain what the word &#x27;authority&#x27; \nmeans \u0016 upon every authority which has got \neither the power to make laws or the power to \nhave discretion vested in it. Therefore, it is \nquite clear that if the fundamental rights are to \nbe clear, then they must be binding not only \nupon the Central Government, they must not \nonly be binding upon the Provincial \nGovernment, they must not only be binding \nupon the Governments established in the Indian \nStates, they must also be binding upon District \nLocal Boards, Municipalities, even village \npanchayats and taluk boards, in fact, every \nauthority which has been created by law and \nwhich has got certain power to make laws, to \nmake rules, or make bye-laws.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">If that proposition is accepted \u0016 and I do not \nsee anyone who cares for Fundamental Rights \ncan object to such a universal obligation being \nimposed upon every authority created by law \u0016 \nthen, what are we to do to make our intention \nclear ? There are two ways of doing it. One way \nis to use a composite phrase such as &#x27;the State&#x27;, \nas we have done in <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 7;</a> or, to keep on \nrepeating every time, &#x27;the Central Government, \nthe Provincial Government, the State \nGovernment, the Municipality, the Local \nBoard, the Port Trust, or any other authority&#x27;. It \nseems to me not only most cumbersome but \nstupid to keep on repeating this phraseology \nevery time we have to make a reference to \nsome authority. The wisest course is to have \nthis comprehensive phrase and to economise in \nwords.&quot; (1948 (Vol. VII) CAD 610]\n                                       (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nFrom the above, it is seen that the intention of the Constitution \nframers  in incorporating  this Article was to treat such authority which has \nbeen created by law and which has got certain powers to make laws to make \nrules and regulations to be included in the term &quot;other authorities&quot;  as \nfound presently in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 12.</a> \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1084632\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"233848\" id=\"span_3\">Till about the year 1967 the courts in India had taken the view that \neven statutory bodies like Universities, Selection Committee for admission \nto Government Colleges  were not &quot;other authorities&quot;  for the purpose of \nArticle 12 (See <a href=\"/doc/233848/\" id=\"a_23\">The University of Madras   vs. Shantha Bai &amp; Anr.</a>  (<a href=\"/doc/1084632/\" id=\"a_24\">AIR \n1954 Madras, 67), B.W.

He also observed further that it is only those authorities which are \ninvested with sovereign powers, that is, power to make rules or regulations \nand to administer or enforce them to the detriment of citizens and others that \nfall within the definition of &quot;State&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 12 :</a> but constitutional or \nstatutory bodies invested with power but not sharing the sovereign power of \nthe State are not &quot;State&quot;  within the meaning of that Article.

Vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi &amp; Anr.</a>  \n(1975 3 SCR 619), in this case the Court held  the bodies like Oil and \nNatural Gas Commission, Industrial Finance Corporation and Life Insurance \nCorporation  which were created by statutes because of the nature of their \nactivities do come within the term &quot;other authorities&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 12.</a> Even \nthough in reality they were really constituted for commercial purposes while \nso holding  Mathew J. gave the following reasons for necessitating  to \nexpand the definition of the term &quot;other authorities&quot; in the following words:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;The concept of State has undergone drastic \nchanges in recent years. Today State cannot \nbe conceived of simply as a coercive \nmachinery wielding the thunderbolt of \nauthority. It has to be viewed mainly as a \nservice Corporation. A State is an abstract \nentity. It can only act through the \ninstrumentality or agency or natural or \njuridical persons. There is nothing strange in \nthe notion of the State acting through a \nCorporation and making it an agency or \ninstrumentality of the State. With the advent \nof a welfare State the framework of civil \nservice administration became increasingly \ninsufficient for handling the new tasks which \nwere often of a specialised and highly \ntechnical character. The distrust of \nGovernment by civil service was a powerful \nfactor in the development of a policy of public \nadministration through separate Corporations \nwhich would operate largely according to \nbusiness principles and be separately \naccountable. The Public Corporation, \ntherefore, became a third arm of the \nGovernment. The employees of public \nCorporation are not civil servants. In so far as \npublic corporations fulfil public tasks on \nbehalf of government they are public \nauthorities and as such subject to control by \nGovernment. The public Corporation being a \ncreation of the State is subject to the \nconstitutional limitation as the State itself. \nThe governing power wherever located must \nbe subject to the fundamental constitutional \nlimitations. The ultimate question which is \nrelevant for our purpose is whether the \nCorporation is an agency of instrumentality of \nthe Government for carrying on a business for \nthe benefit of the public.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">From the above, it is to be noticed that because of the change in the \nsocio-economic policies of the Government this Court considered it \nnecessary by judicial interpretation to give a wider meaning to the term \n&quot;other authorities&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 12</a> so as to include such bodies which were \ncreated by Act of Legislature to be included in the said term &quot;other \nauthorities&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">This judicial expansion of the term &quot;other authorities&quot; came about \nprimarily with a view to prevent  the Government from by-passing  its \nconstitutional  obligations by creating companies, corporations etc. to \nperform its duties. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"435970\" id=\"span_6\">At this stage it is necessary to refer to the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/435970/\" id=\"a_30\">Sabhajit \nTewary vs U.O.I. &amp; Ors.</a> [(1975) 3 SCR 616] which was delivered by the \nvery same Constitution Bench which delivered the judgment in Sukhdev \nSingh &amp; Ors. on the very same day.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"974148\" id=\"span_7\">In this judgment this court noticing its \njudgment in <a href=\"/doc/974148/\" id=\"a_31\">Sukhdev Singh &amp; Ors</a> (supra), rejected the contention of the \npetitioner therein that council for Scientific  and Industrial Research  the \nrespondent  body in the said writ petition which was only registered under \nthe <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_32\">Societies Registration Act</a> would come under the term &quot;other \nauthorities&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 12.</a></span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"974148\" id=\"span_8\">The distinction to be noticed between the two judgments referred to \nhereinabove namely <a href=\"/doc/974148/\" id=\"a_34\">Sukhdev Singh &amp; Ors  and Sabhajit Tewary</a> (supra), is \nthat in the former the Court held that bodies  which were creatures of the \nstatues having important State functions and where State had pervasive  \ncontrol of activities of those bodies would be State for the purpose of Article</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"435970\" id=\"span_9\">12.

With the \nincreasing magnitude and range of governmental \nfunctions as we move closer to a welfare  State, more and \nmore of our wealth consists of these  new forms.

In support of this argument, he contended \nthat in the present day context cricket has become a profession and that \nthe cricketers have a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> to pursue \ntheir professional career  as cricketers.  It was also submitted that the \nBoard controls the said rights of a citizen  by its rules and regulations and \nsince such a regulation can be done only by the State the Board of  \nnecessity must be regarded as an instrumentality  of the State.  It was also \npointed out that under its Memorandum of Association and the rules and \nregulations and due to its monopolistic  control over the game of Cricket  \nthe Board has all pervasive powers to control a person&#x27;s cricketing career  \nas it has  the sole authority  to decide on his membership and  affiliation \nto any particular Cricketing Association,  which in turn would affect his \nright to play cricket  at any level in India as well as abroad.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">Assuming that these facts are correct the question then is, would it \nbe sufficient to hold the Board to be a State for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 12?</a> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">There is no doubt that <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> guarantees to all citizens the \nfundamental right to practise any profession or to carry on any trade \noccupation or business and that such a right can only be regulated by the \nState by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 19(6).</a> Hence, it follows as a logical corollary \nthat any violation of this right will have to be claimed only against the \nState and unlike the rights under <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_88\">Articles 17</a> or 21 which can be claimed \nagainst non state actors including individuals the right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_89\">Article \n19(1)(g)</a> cannot be claimed against an individual or a non State entity. \nThus, to argue that every entity, which validly or invalidly arrogates to \nitself the right to regulate or for that matter even starts regulating the \nfundamental right of the citizen under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>, is a State within \nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 12</a> is to put the cart before the horse. If such logic \nwere to be applied every employer who regulates the manner in which his \nemployee works would also have to be treated as State. The pre-requisite \nfor invoking  the enforcement of a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 32</a> is \nthat the violator  of that right should be a State first.  Therefore, if the \nargument of the learned counsel  for the petitioner is to be accepted then \nthe petitioner will have to first establish that the Board is a State under \n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 12</a> and it is violating  the fundamental rights of the petitioner. \nUnless this is done  the petitioner cannot allege that the Board violates \nfundamental rights and is therefore State within <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 12.</a>  In this \npetition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 32</a> we have already held  that the petitioner has \nfailed to establish that the Board is State within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 12.</a> \nTherefore assuming there is violation of any fundamental right by the \nBoard that will not make the Board a &quot;State&quot; for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 12.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">It was then argued that the Board discharges public duties which are \nin the nature of State functions. Elaborating on this argument it was \npointed out that the Board selects a team to represent India in international \nmatches. The Board makes rules that govern the activities of the cricket \nplayers, umpires and other persons involved in the activities of cricket. \nThese, according to the petitioner, are all in the nature of State functions \nand an entity which discharges such functions can only be an \ninstrumentality of State, therefore, the Board falls within the definition of \nState for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 12.</a> Assuming that the abovementioned \nfunctions of the Board do amount to public duties or State functions, the \nquestion for our consideration is: would this be sufficient to hold the \nBoard to be a State for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 12.</a> While considering this \naspect of the argument of the petitioner, it should be borne in mind that \nthe State/Union has not chosen the Board to perform these duties nor has \nit legally authorised the Board to carry out these functions under any law \nor agreement. It has chosen to leave the activities of cricket to be \ncontrolled by private bodies out of such bodies&#x27; own volition (self-\narrogated). In such circumstances when the actions of the Board are not \nactions as an authorised representative of the State, can it be said that the \nBoard is discharging State functions?  The answer should be no.  In the \nabsence of any authorisation, if a private body chooses to discharge any \nsuch function which is not prohibited by law then it would be incorrect to \nhold that such action of the body would make it an instrumentality of the \nState. The Union of India has tried to make out a case that the Board \ndischarges these functions because of the de facto recognition granted by \nit to the Board under the guidelines framed by it but the Board has denied \nthe same.  In this regard we must hold that the Union of India has failed to \nprove that there is any recognition by the Union of India under the \nguidelines framed by it and that the Board is discharging these functions \non its own as an autonomous body. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"471272\" id=\"span_35\">However, it is true that the Union of India has been exercising \ncertain control over the activities of the Board in regard to organising \ncricket matches and travel of the Indian team abroad as also granting of \npermission to allow the foreign teams to come to India. But this control \nover the activities of the Board cannot be construed as an administrative \ncontrol.  At best this is purely regulatory in nature and the same according \nto this Court in <a href=\"/doc/471272/\" id=\"a_100\">Pradeep Kumar Biswas</a>&#x27;s case (supra) is not a factor \nindicating a pervasive State control of the Board.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">Be that as it may, it cannot be denied that the Board does discharge \nsome duties like the selection of an Indian cricket team, controlling the \nactivities of the players and others involved in the game of cricket. These \nactivities can be said to be akin to public duties or State functions and if \nthere is any violation of any constitutional or statutory obligation or rights \nof other citizens, the aggrieved party may not have a relief by way of a \npetition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 32.</a> But that does not mean that the violator of such \nright would go scot-free merely because it or he is not a State. Under the \nIndian jurisprudence there is always a just remedy for violation of a right \nof a citizen. Though the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 32</a> is not available, an \naggrieved party can always seek a remedy under the ordinary course of \nlaw or by way of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution \nwhich is much wider than <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 32.</a> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1728255\" id=\"span_36\">This Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1728255/\" id=\"a_105\">Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee \nVandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust &amp; Ors. vs. \nV.R.

The term &quot;authority&quot; \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">used in the context, must receive a liberal \nmeaning unlike the term in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 12</a> which \nis relevant only for the purpose of \nenforcement of fundamental rights under \n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 32.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 226</a> confers powers on \nthe High Courts to issue writs for \nenforcement of the fundamental rights as \nwell as non-fundamental rights. The words \n&quot;any person or authority&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_111\">Article \n226</a> are, therefore, not to be confined only to \nstatutory authorities and instrumentalities of \nthe State. They may cover any other person \nor body performing public duty. The form of \nthe body concerned is not very much \nrelevant. What is relevant is the nature of the \nduty imposed on the body. The duty must be \njudged in the light of positive obligation \nowned by the person or authority to the \naffected party, no matter by what means the \nduty is imposed. If a positive obligation \nexists mandamus cannot be denied.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">Thus, it is clear that when a private body exercises its public \nfunctions  even if it is not a State, the aggrieved person has a remedy not \nonly under the ordinary law but also under the Constitution, by way of a \nwrit petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 226.</a>  Therefore, merely because a non-\ngovernmental body exercises some public duty that by itself would not \nsuffice to make such body a State for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 12.</a> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"471272\" id=\"span_37\">In the \ninstant case the activities of the Board do not come under the guidelines \n<a href=\"/doc/1728255/\" id=\"a_114\">laid down by</a> this Court in <a href=\"/doc/471272/\" id=\"a_115\">Pradeep Kumar Biswas</a> case (supra), hence \nthere is force in the contention of Mr. Venugopal that this petition under \n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution is not maintainable.\nAt this stage, it is relevant to note another contention of               \nMr. Venugopal that the effect of treating the Board as State will have far \nreaching consequences in as much as nearly 64 other national sports \nfederations as well as some other bodies which represent India in the \ninternational forum in the field of art, culture, beauty pageants, cultural \nactivities, music and dance, science and technology or other such \ncompetitions will also have to be treated as a &quot;State&quot; within the meaning \nof <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 12</a>, opening the flood gates of litigation under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 32.</a>   We \ndo find sufficient force in this argument. Many of the above mentioned \nfederations or bodies do discharge functions and/ or exercise powers \nwhich if not identical are at least similar to the functions discharged by \nthe Board.  Many of the sport persons and others who represent their \nrespective bodies make a livelihood out of it (for e.g. football, tennis, \ngolf, beauty pageants etc.). Therefore, if the Board which controls the \ngame of Cricket is to be held to be a State for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 12</a>, \nthere is absolutely no reason why other similarly placed bodies should \nnot be treated as State.

The Board, the second Respondent herein,   \nis a Society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/18460769/\" id=\"a_134\">Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act</a> \nwhich is said to be recognized by the Union of India, Ministry of Youth \nAffairs and Sports.  The Third and Fourth Respondents are President and  \nSecretary respectively of the Second Respondent.  The Fifth Respondent, \n&quot;ESPN Star Sports&quot;, known as &quot;ESS&quot; is a partnership firm of the United \nStates of America having a branch office in Singapore.  The Sixth \nRespondent is a firm of Chartered Accountants which was engaged by Board \nin relation to the tender floated on 07.08.2004.  Pursuant to or in furtherance \nof a notice inviting tender for grant of exclusive television rights for a period \nof four years, several entertainment groups including the Petitioners and the \nFifth Respondent herein gave their offers.   For the purpose of this matter, \nwe would presume that both the Petitioners and the said Respondent were \nfound eligible therefor.  The   First    Petitioner     gave    an    offer    for    \nan    amount  of \tUS $ 260,756,756.76 (INR equivalent to \nRs.12,060,000,000/- (Rupees twelve thousand sixty million only - @ INR \n46.25/US $) Or US $ 281,189,189.19 (INR equivalent to \nRs.13,005,000,000/- (Rupees thirteen thousand five million only - @ INR \n46.25/US $).   \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">Upon holding negotiations with the First Petitioner as also the Fifth \nRespondent, the Board decided to accept the offer of the former;  pursuant to \nand in furtherance  whereof a sum of Rs. 92.50 crores equivalent to US $ 20 \nmillions was deposited in the State Bank of  Travancore.  In response to a \ndraft letter of intent   sent by  the Board,  the First Petitioner agreed to abide \nby the terms and conditions of offer subject to the conditions mentioned \ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">\tThe Fifth Respondent in the meanwhile filed a writ petition before the \nBombay High Court which was marked as Writ Petition (L) No. 2462 of \n2004.  The parties thereto filed their affidavits in the said proceeding.  In its \naffidavit, the  Board justified its action in granting the contract in favour of \nthe First Petitioner.  The matter was taken up for hearing on day to day basis. \nArguments of the Fifth Respondent as also the First Petitioner had been \nadvanced. On 21.9.2004, however, the Board before commencing its \nargument stated that it purported to have  cancelled the entire tender process \non the premise that no concluded contract was reached between the parties \nas no letter of intent had therefor been issued.  The First Petitioner, however, \nraised a contention that such  a concluded contract in fact had been arrived \nat.  The Fifth Respondent, in view of the statements made by the counsel for \nthe Board, prayed for withdrawal of  the writ petition,  which  was permitted.  \nOn the same day i.e. on 21.9.2004 itself, the  Board terminated the contract \nof the First Petitioner stating :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">&quot;In the larger interest of the game of cricket and due to \nthe stalemate that has been created in the grant of \nTelevision Rights for the ensuing Test Series owing to \nlitigation and as informed before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court \nat Bombay this day, the Board of Control for Cricket in \nIndia (BCCI) hereby cancels the entire process of tender \nby invoking Clause 5.3, 5.4 (c) and 5.4 (d) of the \ninvitation to tender (ITT) dated 7 August, 2004, the terms \nof which were accepted and acknowledged by you.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">The Security in the form of Bank Guarantee and/or \nmoney deposited by you is being returned immediately.&quot; \t\n</blockquote>\t\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">WRIT PETITION:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"> \tThe order of the Board dated 21.9.2004 terminating the contract  is in \nquestion in this writ petition contending that the action on the part of the \nBoard in  terminating the contract is arbitrary and, thus, violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_135\">Article \n14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\tIn the writ petition, the Petitioners have, inter alia, prayed for setting \naside the said communication as also for issuance of a writ of or in the \nnature of mandamus commanding upon the Board to act in tems of the \ndecision arrived on 5.9.2004.   \t\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\">REFERENCE:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\tBy an order dated 27.9.2004, a three-Judge Bench of this Court \nreferred the matter to a Constitution Bench stating : \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">&quot;These petitions involve a question related to the \ninterpretation of the Constitution of India which will \nhave to  be heard by a Bench not less than 5 Judges as \ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution.  \nPlace this matter before Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice for \nfurther orders.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\tSince the matter involved requires urgent \nconsideration, we request the Chief Justice to place this \nmatter before the Constitution Bench for further orders \non 28.9.2004.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\tWe direct the Attorney General to take notice on \nbehalf of first  respondent.

They wear uniform that carries the \nnational flag, and are treated as sports ambassadors of \nIndia.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">c.\tThe sportsmen of  today are professionals who \ndevote their life to playing the game.  They are paid a \nhandsome remuneration by the BCCI for their \nparticipation in the team.  Thus, they are not amateurs \nwho participate on an honorary basis.  Consequently they \nhave a right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> to be considered for \nparticipation in the game.  The BCCI claims the power to \ndebar players from playing cricket in exercise of its \ndisciplinary powers.  Obviously, it is submitted, a body \nthat purports to exercise powers that impinge on the \nfundamental rights of citizens would constitute at least an \n&quot;authority&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_139\">Art. 12</a> of the \nConstitution \u0016 it can hardly contend that it has the power \nto arbitrarily deny players all rights to even be considered \nfor participation in a  tournament which they are included \nas a team from &quot;India&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">d.\tThis Hon&#x27;ble Court has already, by its interim \norders., directed a free to air telecast of the matches that \nwere played in Pakistan in which a team selected by the \nRespondent BCCI participated.  This was done, it is \nrespectfully submitted, keeping in view the larger public \ninterest involved in telecasting of such a sport.  Surely, \nthe regulatory body that controls solely and to the \nexclusion of all others, the power to organize such \ngames, and to select a team that would participate in such \ngames is performing a public function that must be \ndischarged in a manner that complies with the \nconstitutional discipline of  Part III of the Constitution.  \nIf the events organized are public events, then it is \nsubmitted that the body that is the controlling authority of \nsuch public events would surely be subject to the \ndiscipline of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_140\">Art. 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_141\">19</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">e.\tIt is also submitted that even domestically, all \nrepresentative cricket can only be under its aegis.

It was contended that the Board is an \nautonomous body and the Central Government does not have any control \nthereover either financially or administratively or functionally.  It was urged \nthat neither the Central Government gives any monetary  grant nor \nnominates any member in the Governing Body of the Board nor has \nanything to do with its internal affairs.  It was pointed out by the learned \ncounsel that even the Union of India had agreed before the Bombay High \nCourt that the Board had the exclusive telecasting rights as owner of the \nevents.  The Board furthermore does not exercise any sovereign  or \ngovernmental functions; Mr. Venugopal would argue that furthermore  the \nBoard has not even been recognized by the Union of India nor has it any role \nto play as regard framing of its rules and regulations. \nDr. A.M.

The Board, also exercises stringent \ndisciplinary powers over players, umpires, members of the team and other \nofficers.  It is the contention of Mr. Salve that the activities of the Board in \neffect and substance are governmental functions in the area of sports.  An \nexclusive right has been granted to it to regulate the sport in the name of the \ncountry resulting in exercise of functions of larger dimension of public \nentertainment.  When a body like the Board has received recognition from \nthe Union of India to allow it to represent India as a country, its character \nmust be held to have changed from private body to a public authority.  It was \nsubmitted that the players put on colours of National Flag on their attire.  \nBecause of the nature of its actions the International Cricket Council has \nrecognized the Board not in its capacity as a cricket playing club but as a \nrepresentative of India, a cricket playing country.  By its disciplinary action, \nMr. Salve would argue, the Board may debar a player from representing the \ncountry as a result whereof his fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of \nthe Constitution of India would be affected.

The degree of \nthe element will depend upon the character of the \ntelecaster who claims the right.

A  \n`State&#x27; has different meanings in different context.  In a traditional sense, it \ncan be a body politic but in modern international practice, a State is an \norganization which receives the general recognition accorded to it by the \nexisting group of other States.

The concept of State under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 12</a> is in relation to the fundamental \nrights guaranteed by Part-III of the Constitution and Directive Principles of \nthe State Policy contained in Part-IV thereof.</span>  The contents of these two \nparts manifest that Article 12 is not confined to its ordinary or constitutional  \nsense of an independent or sovereign meaning so as to include within its fold \nwhatever comes within the purview thereof so as to instill the public \nconfidence in it.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"974148\" id=\"span_56\">The feature  that the Board has been allowed to exercise the powers \nenabling it to trespass across the fundamental rights of a citizen is of great \nsignificance.

For the said purpose, we must notice that this Court in \nexpanding the definition of State did not advisedly confine itself  to the \ndebates of Constitutional Assembly.

While \ndoing so  the courts did not lose sight of the difference between the State \nactivity and the individual activity.  This Court took  into consideration the \nfact that new rights in the citizens have been created and if any such right is \nviolated, they must have access  to justice  which is a human right. No \ndoubt, there is an ongoing debate as regard the effect  of the  globalization \nand/or opening up of market by reason of  liberalization policy of the \nGovernment as to whether that the notion of sovereignty of the State is being \nthereby eroded or not but we are not concerned with the said question in this \ncase.   &quot;Other authorities&quot;, inter-alia, would be there which inter alia \nfunction within the territory of India and the same  need not necessarily  be \nthe Government of India, the Parliament of India, the Government of each of \nthe States which constitute the Union of India or the legislation of the States.  \n\t<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 12</a> must receive a purposive interpretation as by reason of Part \nIII of the Constitution a charter of liberties against oppression and \narbitrariness of all kinds of repositories of power have been conferred \u0016 the \nobject being to limit and control power wherever it is found.  A body \nexercising significant functions of public importance would be an authority \nin respect of these functions.  In those respects it would be same as is \nexecutive government established under the Constitution and the \nestablishments of organizations funded or controlled by the Government.

It is an \nargument which intellectually has little to commend it, \nand pragmatically is usually shown to be ill-founded.  \nFor it is often the case that, once the courts have shown \nthe willingness to intervene, the standards of the bodies \nat risk of their intervention tend to improve.

The line drawn by the cases \nconsidered within this section has, not surprisingly, been \ncontested.  Pannick has argued that the exercise of \nmonopolistic power should serve to bring bodies within \nthe ambit of judicial review.  To speak of a consensual \nfoundation for a body&#x27;s power is largely beside the point \nwhere those who wish to partake in the activity will have \nno realistic choice but to accept that power.  Black has \nargued that the emphasis given to the contractual \nfoundations for a body&#x27;s power as the reason for \nwithholding review are misplaced.  She contends that the \ncourts are confusing contract as an instrument of \neconomic exchange, with contract as a regulatory \ninstrument.  She argues further that the reliance placed on \nprivate law controls, such as restraint of trade and \ncompetition law, may also be misplaced here.  Such \ncontrols are designed for the regulation of economic \nactivity in the market place, and they may not be best \nsuited to control potential abuse of regulatory power \nitself.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Emphasis added)\nSCOTLAND :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">In St. Johnstone Football Club Limited Vs.

If they attempt to exercise \nupon a member a power or authority which he by becoming a member did \nnot give them, i.e., acting ultra vires or if by so acting they have done him \ninjury, he will not be precluded from seeking redress, nor the Court of law \nhold themselves precluded from giving him redress.

In truth the case has some \nanalogy with public law issues.  This is not to be pressed \ntoo far.  We are not holding that, nor even discussing \nwhether, the decision is the exercise of a statutory power \n\u0016 although that was argued.

It had \nalso the responsibility for the commercial aspects of wheat marketing \nthrough operating wheat pools.  The Appellant therein who was a competitor \nof AWBI applied for grant of permit for the bulk export of wheat but the \nsame was declined whereupon it was contended that the AWBI was \ncontravening the Trade Practices Act, 1974.  The decision of AWBI was \nquestioned contending that it involved an improper exercise of discretionary \npower in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merit of the \ncase.  The following interesting observation was made therein:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">&quot;67.This appeal presents an opportunity for this Court to \nreaffirm that principle in circumstances, now increasingly \ncommon, where the exercise of public power, \ncontemplated by legislation, is &quot;outsourced&quot; to a body \nhaving the features of a private sector corporation.  The \nquestion of principle presented is whether, in the \nperformance of a function provided to it by federal \nlegislation, a private corporation is accountable according \nto the norms and values of public law or is cut adrift from \nsuch mechanisms of accountability and is answerable \nonly to its shareholders and to the requirements of \ncorporations law or like rules.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">\t\t\t\t\t\t[Emphasis supplied]\n\n\tAs regards monopoly, it was opined:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">&quot;134. It may be that the statutory conferral of monopoly \nstatus on AWBI as a private corporation, in itself \n(particularly when viewed with the added fact that it was \nformed from what was once a public body) could impose \nobligations to observe the norms and values of public \nlaw, adapted by analogy, in particular instances of its \ndecision-making.

It was held that \nthe pervasive entwinement of state school officials in the structure of the \nassociation would make it a state actor.  The Court acknowledged that the \nanalysis of whether state action existed was a &quot;necessarily fact-bound \ninquiry&quot; and noted that state action may be found only where there is &quot;such \na close nexus between the State and the challenged action that seemingly \nprivate behavior may be fairly treated as that of the State itself&quot;.  \n \tIn Brentwood Academy (supra), it was held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\"> \t&quot;Our cases have identified a host of fact that can \nbear on the fairness of such an attribution.

He opined at pages 567-568:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">&quot;It is not fortuitous that the public bodies have stood \nshoulder to shoulder with the private contractors in \nresisting the application of the HRA, and ordinary \njudicial review, to the contractors.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\"> \tIt will under the existing law, be difficult to \nmaintain an action against the public body itself, either \nunder the HRA, or via ordinary judicial review, where \nthere has been contracting out.  The public body will still \nbe subject to the HRA and to judicial review.  This \nshould not mask the reality that contracting out will serve \nto preclude any meaningful action against the public \nbody.  Claims that could have been made against the \npublic body if it had performed the service in house will \nno longer be possible where it has contracted this out.\n \tIt has been argued in this article that the judicial \nconclusions as to the applicability of the HRA and \njudicial review in cases of contracting out were neither \nlegally inevitable, nor desirable in normative terms.  The \ncontractualisation of government is not a transient \nphenomenon.  It is here to stay for the foreseeable future.  \nThe courts have in the past developed doctrinal tools to \nmeet challenges posed by changing pattern of \ngovernment.  They should not forget this heritage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">\tCraig in his treatise &#x27;Administrative Law&#x27; at page 821 also made an \ninteresting observation as regards future prospects, stating :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">&quot;If the scope of review is extended thus far then careful \nattention will have to be given to whether the procedural \nand substantive norms applied against traditional public \nbodies should also be applied against private bodies.  \nMany of the cases within this section are concerned with \nthe application of procedural norms.  If we were to \nfollow Lord Woolf&#x27;s suggestion then we would also have \nto consider whether substantive public law should be \napplied to such bodies.  Would we insist that sporting \nbodies with monopoly power, or large companies with \nsimilar power, take account of all relevant considerations \nbefore deciding upon a course of action?  Would we \ndemand that their actions be subject to a principle of \nproportionality, assuming that it becomes an accepted \npart of our substantive control?  If there is an affirmative \nanswer, then the change would be significant to say the \nvery least.  It would have ramifications for other subjects, \nsuch as company law, commercial law and contract.  It \nwould increase the courts&#x27; judicial review case load.  It \nwould involve difficult questions as to how such \nsubstantive public law principles fit with previously \naccepted doctrines of private law.  This is not to deny \nthat similar broad principles can operate within the public \nand private spheres.  It is to argue that the broader the \nreach of &quot;public law&quot;, the more nuanced we would have \nto be about the application of public law principles to \nthose bodies brought within the ambit of judicial review.&quot;      \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\"> \tIn an interesting article &#x27;Sports, Policy and Liability of Sporting \nAdministrators&#x27; by Jeremy Kirk and Anton Trichardt published in 75 ALJ \n504, the learned authors while analyzing a recent decision of the High Court \nof Australia in Agar Vs.

Even so, there is still \nroom for argument that sporting administrators will be \nliable in negligence in relation to the nature and conduct \nof their sports.  It is conceivable that there could be \nliability for employers in relation to the rules of \nprofessional sports.  Any type of administrator could be \nliable for misrepresentations.  And liability could \npotentially arise for failing to fulfil a duty to warn in \nsituations where controllers become aware of new \ninformation pointing to a higher level of risk than was \ngenerally appreciated.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">It may be that the judgments in Agar, to use the words of \nGowans J in Carlton Cricket and Football Social Club v \nJoseph, &quot;are not going to be very interesting to those who \nhave more familiarity with the rules of [rugby] football \nthan they have with the rules of law&quot;.  Nevertheless, the \ndecision is an important one for sporting administrators.  \nWhat is more, the potential for legal liability to be \nimposed on sporting administrators has been but partially \nresolved by the High Court&#x27;s decision.

The presence or absence of a particular element \nwould not be determinative of the issue, if on an overall consideration it \nbecomes apparent that functionally it is an authority within the meaning of \n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">\tSimilarly significant funding by the Government may not by itself \nmake a body a State, if its functions are entirely private in character.  \nConversely absence of funding for the functioning of the body or the \norganization would not deny it from its status of a State;  if its functions are \npublic functions and if it otherwise answers the description of &quot;Other \nAuthorities&quot;.  The Government aid may not be confined only by way of \nmonetary grant.  It may take various forms, e.g., tax exemptions, minimal \nrent for a stadia and  recognition by the State, etc.  \tAn over emphasis of the \nabsence of the funding by the State is not called for.\n\tIt is true that regulatory measures applicable to all the persons \nsimilarly situated, in terms of the provisions of a statute would by itself not \nmake an organization a State in all circumstances.  Conversely, in a case of \nthis nature non-interference in the functioning of an autonomous body by the \nGovernment by itself may also not be a determinative factor as the \nGovernment may not consider any need therefor despite the fact that the \nbody or organization had been discharging essentially a public function.  \nSuch non-interference would not make the public body a private body.\nWHAT CRICKET MEANS TO INDIA:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">\tWe have laid down the tests aforesaid and the approach which needs \nto be adopted in determining the issue as to whether the Board is a State or \nnot.

Probably \nin that view of the matter, the Board did not think it necessary to apply for \ngrant of such recognition of the Union of India asking it for passing a formal \norder.  However, the Board had all along been obtaining the requisite \npermission for sending an Indian team abroad or for inviting a foreign team \nin India in the prescribed form.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_188\">EXPRESS RECOGNITION \u0016 ESSENTIAL?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">\tUnion of India has issued certain guidelines evidently in exercise of \nits power conferred on it under <a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_294\">Article 73</a> of the Constitution of India for \nregulating sports in India.  The said guidelines have been issued having \nregard to objects it sought to achieve including the poor performance of \nIndian Team abroad.  The said guidelines have been moreover issued in \nexercise of its control over the National Sports  Federations.  The sport of \nCricket was not included within the said guidelines.  Both mens&#x27; and \nwomens&#x27; cricket had been brought within the purview of the said guidelines \nin the year 2001.  They provide for grant of recognition.  The Board \ncontends that it had never applied for recognition nor had it asked for \nfinancial aid or grant of any other benefit.   Factually the Union of India has \nnot been able to controvert this position although in its affidavit affirmed by \na Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs \nand Sports, it  has stated that Board is a recognized National Federation.  It \nis true that no document has been produced establishing grant of such \nrecognition; but in its additional affidavit affirmed by Mrs. Devpreet A. \nSingh, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth \nAffairs and Sports, a number of documents have been annexed which clearly \ngo to show that from the very beginning the Board had been asking for \npermission of the Ministry of Human Resource Development either to go \nabroad or to play or participate in  other countries or for inviting the others \nto play in India.  Such permission had been sought for in the form prescribed \nin terms of the said regulations.  The said documents leave no manner of \ndoubt that the Board had asked for and the Union of India had granted de \nfacto recognition.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">\tIn the affidavit dated 8th October, 2004 affirmed by a Deputy \nSecretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, \nit is stated:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">&quot;1.

In response to the issue raised before this Hon&#x27;ble \nCourt, it is respectfully submitted that only the \nrecognized National Sports Federations are required to \napply in the prescribed format for seeking permission to \ngo abroad to play as a Team representing India.  There \nhave been instances where club teams, organizations \nengaged in sports activities etc. have applied for such \npermission but the Ministry has considered their request \nonly when they were received through the National \nSports Federation \u0016 BCCI in this case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"730954\" id=\"span_114\">It is not disputed that the Union of India has not recognized any other \nnational sports body  for regulating the game of cricket in India.  It is the \ncategorical stand of the Union of India that only by such recognition granted \nby the Union of India, the team selected by the Board is the Indian cricket \nteam which it could not do in absence thereof.  We cannot accept the \nsubmission of  Mr. Venugopal to the effect that even while playing abroad, \nthe Board sends its own team.  It is evident from the records which fact has \nalso been noticed by the Delhi High Court in its judgment in <a href=\"/doc/730954/\" id=\"a_295\">Rahul Mehra</a> \n(supra) that the Board fields its team as Indian Team and not as Board \nEleven, which without having any authority from the Union of India, it will \nnot be able to do. The stand that the cricket team selected by the Board only \nrepresents it and not the country is incorrect.  Having regard to the rules of  \nthe ICC, its own rules as also various documents placed before this Court by \nthe Union of India, the conduct of both the Board and the Union of India \nclearly go to show that sub silentio both the parties had been acting on the \npremise that the Board is recognized as the only recognized National \nFederation for the purpose of regulating the game of cricket in India.\nBOARD A STATE?</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_192\">The Board is a society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act.  \nIt is not created under a Statute but it is an acknowledged fact that in terms \nof its Memorandum of Association and rules framed by it, it has not only the \nmonopoly status as regard the regulation of the game of cricket but also can \nlay down the criteria for its membership and furthermore make the law of \nsport of cricket.  The Board for all intent and purport is a recognized national \nfederation recognized by the Union of India.  By reason of said recognition \nonly, an enormous power is exercised by the second Respondent which from \nselection and preparation of players at the grass root level to organize \nDaleep Trophy, Ranji Trophy etc. select teams and umpires for international \nevents.  The players selected by the second Respondent represent India as \ntheir citizen.  They use the national colour in their attire.  The team is known \nas Indian team.  It is recognized as such by the ICC.  For all intent and \npurport it exercises the monopoly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\">\tThe Board is in a position to expend crores of rupees from its own \nearnings.  The tender in question would show that what sort of amount is \ninvolved in distributing its telecasting right for a period of four years, \ninasmuch as both the First Petitioner and the Fifth Respondent offered US $ \n308 millions therefor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_194\">A monopoly status need not always be created by a law within the \nmeaning of clauses 2 to 6 of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\tA body which carries on the monopolistic function of selecting team \nto represent the nation and whose core function is to promote a sport that has \nbecome a symbol of national identity and a medium of expression of \nnational pride, must be held to be carrying out governmental functions.  A \nhighly arbitrary or capricious action on the part of such a powerful body \nwould attract the wrath of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_297\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.  The Board \nitself acted as a representative of the Government of India before the \ninternational community.  It makes representations to the effect that  it was \nentitled to select a team which represents the nation as a cricket playing \ncountry, and, thus, the same would, without anything more, make its action a \nState action.  For the said purpose, actual control of the Board or issuing any \ndirection in that behalf by the Government of India is not of much \nsignificance but the question as to whether the Government, considering the \nfacts and circumstances, should control the actions of the Board as long as it \npurports to select a team to represent India would be a matter of great \nsignificance.  The guidelines issued by the Union of India clearly \ndemonstrate its concern with the fall in standard of Indian Team in sports in \nimportant international sports events.  It would not be correct to draw a \ncomparison between an event of international sport as significant as cricket \nwith beauty pageants and other such events as the test necessary to be \nevolved in this behalf is the qualitative test and not the quantitative test.  The \nquality and character of a sport recognized as a measure of education and \nnation building (as a facet of human resources development) cannot be \nconfused with an event that may be a form of entertainment.  Cricket, as \nnoticed hereinbefore, has a special place in the hearts of citizens of India.\n\tThe monopoly status of the Board is undisputed. The monopoly \nenjoyed by the Board need not be  a  statutory one so as to conform to the \ntests contained in Clause  (6) of  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution.  It can be a \nde facto monopoly which has overtly or covertly received the blessings of \nUnion of India.  The de facto  monopoly of the Board is manifest as it, as a \nmember of ICC (even if it is technically possible to float any other \nassociation), can send an Indian Team abroad or invite a foreign team onto \nIndia. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1662742\" id=\"span_115\">In absence of recognition from the ICC, it would not be possible for \nany other body including the Union of India to represent India in the \ninternational Cricket events featuring competitive cricket.   \nSo would be the position in domestic cricket.  The Board in view of \nenormity of powers is bound to follow &quot;the doctrine of fairness and good \nfaith in all its activities&quot;.  [See Board of Control for <a href=\"/doc/1662742/\" id=\"a_299\">Cricket, India &amp; Anr. \nVs. Netaji Cricket Club and Ors., JT</a> 2005 (1) SC 235]. \n \tThe object of Part III of our Constitution is to curtail abuse of power \nand if by reason of the Board&#x27;s activities, fairness in action is expected, it \nwould answer the description of &quot;Other Authorities&quot;.\n\tThe decisions rendered in different jurisdictions including those of \nthis Court clearly suggest that a body like the Board would come within the \npurview of the expression &quot;Other Authorities&quot; contained in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_300\">Article 12</a> of the \nConstitution of India.  For the said purpose, a complete new look must be \nbestowed on the functions and structures of the Board.  A public authority, \nin my opinion, would be an authority which not only can regulate and \ncontrol the entire sports activities in relation to cricket but also the decisive \ncharacter it plays in formulating the game in all aspects. Even the \nFederations controlled by the State and other public bodies as also the State \nthemselves, in view of the Board&#x27;s Memorandum of Association and the \nRules and Regulations framed by it,  are under its complete control. Thus, it \nwould be subject to a judicial review.</span>     \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">The history of ICC has been noticed by the Court of Appeal in Greig \n(supra) and, thus, it may not be necessary to retrace it over again.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">It is not disputed that the Government in terms of its guidelines \nrecognizes only the Board.  Its recognition whether formal or informal is \nevident as both the Union of India and the Board proceeded on that basis.  In \ninternational arena the regulated cricket is also known as official cricket.  \nThe rules of the ICC suggest that a domicile of one country can play in \ncounty clubs but only citizens or other persons who come within the purview \nof the said rules must play for their country in test or other official matches \nin terms of the ICC Rules.  The tournaments are held between the countries \nand at the domestic level between States/regions and the other clubs over \nwhich the Board has an exclusive and complete control.  In the international \nlevel, the ICC recognizes the national federations only who are its members \nhaving regard to the fact that these federations either represent a country or a \ngeographical area.  The very fact that recognition of ICC has been extended \nto a geographical area (as for example, the West Indies comprising of so \nmany countries), goes to show that for the said purpose the consensus \namongst various bodies and several nations is necessary.  \n\tIt is true that a country as such is not a member of ICC and in some \nplaces of the Rules for the purpose of election of the President, the country is \nrepresented through its national federation which is its full time member.  It \nis furthermore true that the ICC Rules refer as a nation not only a &#x27;country&#x27; \nbut also a geographical area covering several countries but a bare perusal of \nthe rules in its entirety would clearly go to show that only those national \nfederations which represent the country can become its whole time or \nassociate members.  The expression &quot;country&quot; has been used at numerous \nplaces.  It is one thing to say that legally it is permissible to make a Club a \nmember but unless it has the national patronage, it is inconceivable that it \ncan obtain membership of ICC in any capacity.  Theoretically in the ICC, the \nBoard is a member but it without State patronage directly or indirectly \nwould reduce its activities.  In case any other body is recognized by the \nUnion of India, it would not be entitled to regulate the sport of cricket in \nIndia.  Perforce it has to abandon its functions outside the country.\n \tIn the Rules framed by the ICC, the principles of natural justice \ncontaining elements (a) the right to a fair hearing; and (b) the rule against \nbias has been specifically provided for.  These are in keeping with the \nfunction of public body and not private body.  But, so far as the rules framed \nby the Board are concerned, the principles of natural justice are required to \nbe followed only in the event a disciplinary action is contemplated and not \notherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"730954\" id=\"span_116\">The submission of Mr. Venugopal that Union of India having made a \ncategorical statement before the Parliament as also in its affidavit in the case \nof <a href=\"/doc/730954/\" id=\"a_301\">Rahul Mehra</a> (supra) before the High Court of Delhi wherein it is \naccepted that the Board is not under the control of the Union of India nor \nthere exist any statutory rules to regulate its functioning and further the \nissues raised in the said writ petition relate to the internal functioning of the \nBoard, which is autonomous in its function, having regard to the materials \non record may not be of much significance.  We must moreover notice that \nthe Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports in an answer to the Parliament also \nstated:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">&quot;The promotion of the game of cricket in the country is \nthe responsibility of the Board of Control for Cricket in \nIndia (BCCI) which is an autonomous organization.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\"> \tSuch responsibility on its part makes it a State actor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">\tWhen a query was made from the Board to give reply to a starred \nquestion dated 11.12.2001, the Board in its letter dated 13.05.2003 replied as \nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\">&quot;\u0005We would like to reiterate that the Annual Reports of \nBCCI are already available with your Ministry.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\"> \tThe tenor of the letter, thus, runs contrary to the assertion of the Board \nthat it has never sent its accounts to the Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_201\">\tIt is accepted by the Union of India that the Board is an autonomous \norganization and the Government of India does not hold any cricket match \nseries as it is the function of the Board, but that is all the more reason as to \nwhy it has its own responsibilities towards officials, players, umpires, \ncoaches, administrators and above all the cricket loving public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\"> \tHowever, we may place on record that there are a number of \ndocuments filed by the Union of India which clearly go to show that either \nfor sending Indian Team abroad or inviting a foreign team on the soil of \nIndia, the Board has invariably been taking permission from the Ministry of \nYouth Affairs and Sports.  In the counter affidavit filed before the Bombay \nHigh Court, the Board raised a contention that it seeks permission of the \nUnion of India for obtaining visas, foreign exchange and matters connected \ntherewith; but the said contention cannot be accepted in view of the fact that \nhad the same been the position, the Ministry of Human Resource \nDevelopment (which has nothing to do in these matters), would not have \nbeen approached therefor and that too in the form prescribed in the \nguidelines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\"> \tThe Board&#x27;s activities representing the country is not confined to \ninternational forums only.  The Board within the country organizes and \nconducts the Ranji Trophy, the Irani Trophy, the Duleep Singh Trophy, the \nDeodar Trophy and the NKP Salve Challenge Trophy.  Although, there are  \ndomestic events, indisputably only those who are members of the Board \nand/or recognized by it can take part therein and none else.  This also goes to \nshow that the Board regulates the domestic competitive cricket to the fullest \nmeasure and exercises control over its members which represents the five \nzones in India. All the States Federations besides a few other clubs which \nare its members, two of which it will bear repetition to state, are \ngovernmental organizations.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\"> \tIndisputably the Board is a regulator of cricket played at the country \nlevel both off and on the fields including selection of players and umpires.  \nICC possesses and exercises all the powers to regulate international \ncompetitive cricket. It  exercises disciplinary power also as in case of \nviolation of the rules, a country member or the player may be derecognized.  \nThe ICC exercises a monopoly over the sports at the international level \nwhereas Board does so at the country level.  It is the Board only, to the \nexclusion of all others, that can recognize bodies who are entitled to \nparticipate in the nominated tournaments.  Players and umpires also must be \nregistered with it.  In the event of violation of its rules and regulations, \nwhich may include participation in an unauthorized tournaments without its \npermission, a player or umpire would forfeit his right to participate in all \nofficial cricket matches which for all intent and purport shall be the end of \ncareer of a professional cricketer or umpire.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\"> \t  In our constitutional scheme rule of law would, by all means, prevail \nover rule of cricket.  A body regulating the game of cricket would be \ncompelled by the court to abide by rule of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">The hallowness of the claim of the Board that its players play for it \nand not for India is belied by the claim of the former players who \ncategorically stated that they have played for India and not for the Board.  \nWhenever players play for the Board, the Team is named as Board-Eleven. \n[See  &#x27;The Times of India&#x27; \u0016 October24, 2004 and &#x27;Hindustan Times&#x27; \u0016 \nOctober 24, 2004].  It undertakes activities of entering into contracts for \ntelecasting and broadcasting rights as also advertisements in the stadia.    \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">\tWhile considering the status of the Board vis-`-vis Article 12 of the \nConstitution of India,  the Central Government&#x27;s  reluctance to interfere with \nits day to day affairs or allowing it to work as an autonomous body, non-\nassistance in terms of money or the administrative control thereover may not \nbe of much relevance as it was not only given de facto  recognition  but also \nit is aided, facilitated or supported in all other respects by it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">It would not be correct to contend that a monopoly status upon a body \nmust be conferred either by way of statute or by the State by  issuing an \nappropriate order in that behalf.   The question as regard exercise of \nmonopoly power by the Board of  must be determined having regard to the \nground realities i.e. it not only represents the country but also controls and \nregulates the entire field of competitive cricket.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_209\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"486040\" id=\"span_117\">Despite the fact that the relationship between the Board and the \nplayers is not that of an employer and employee, but  the players are within \nits complete control.  Sports activities of the countries being not a \ncommercial activity, as has been held in <a href=\"/doc/486040/\" id=\"a_302\">Cricket Association of Bengal</a> \n(supra), the same must be considered from a larger spectrum of the Indian \ncitizenary as a whole.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\"> \tIt is not disputed that as of now except the Board there is no other \nauthority in the field.  The rules framed by the Board  do not spell out as to \nhow without virtual recognition of the Union of India as also the patronage \nof States whether de facto or de jure it could become a national federation \nand how it could become a member of the ICC.  It does not furthermore \ndisclose as to how it could having regard to its professed function as a \nprivate club, could grant to itself enormous powers as are replete in its rules \nand regulations.  Rules and regulations framed by the Board speak out for \nthemselves as to how  it represents Indian cricket team and regulates almost \nall the activities pertaining thereto.  It also legislates law of sports in India in \nthe field of competitive cricket.  There is no area which is beyond of the \ncontrol and regulation of the Board.  Every young person who thinks of \nplaying cricket either for a State or a Zone or India must as of necessity be a \nmember of the Board or its members and if he intends to play with another \norganization, it must obtain its permission so as to enable him or continue to \nparticipate in the official matches.  The professionals devote their life for \nplaying cricket.  The Board&#x27;s activities may impinge on the fundamental \nrights of citizens.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">There is no gainsaying that there is no organization in the world other \nthan the ICC at the international level and the Board at the national level that \ncontrol the game of first class cricket.  It has, thus, enormous power and \nwields great influence over the entire field of cricket.  Cricket when it comes \nto competitive matches no longer remains a mere entertainment \u0016 it \ncommands such a wide public interest.  It is now recognized that game of \ncricket as an activity gives a sense of identity and pride to a nation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"471272\" id=\"span_118\">Legal meaning attributed to the wordings of the <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_303\">Article 12</a> would lead \nto the conclusion that the Board is a State.  It is true that while developing \nthe law operating in the field a strict meaning was not adhered to by this \nCourt but it may not now be possible to put the clock back.  We must remind \nourselves that if <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_304\">Article 12</a> is subjected to strict constructions as was sought \nto be canvassed by Lahoti, J. in his minority opinion in <a href=\"/doc/471272/\" id=\"a_305\">Pradeep Kumar \nBiswas</a> (supra), the same would give way to the majority opinion.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">In sum, the control of the Board over the sport of competitive cricket \nis deep and pervasive, nay complete.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_214\">The word &#x27;control&#x27; has been defined in Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary in the \nfollowing terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">&quot;Control-power or authority to manage, direct, \nsuperintend, restrict, regulate, govern, administer, \noversee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\"> \tIn Bank of New South Wales v.

Having regard \nto the purport and object of activities of the Board, its control over &#x27;cricket&#x27; \nmust be held to be of wide amplitude.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\"> \tIt is  not correct that the Board represents itself in international area.  \nIf it represents the country, indisputably it must have the implied sanction of \nthe Government of India to do so.  Its activities, thus, have so far-reaching \neffect .\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_217\">\tThe Union of India has since filed affidavits categorically stating that \nthe Board is a &#x27;State&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_306\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of \nIndia.  It has further been stated that not only the Board is recognized de \nfacto but it had all along been seeking permission for going abroad from the \nMinistry of Human Resource Development (Ministry of Youth Affairs and \nSports).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">\tThe players who participate in the competitive cricket whether \ndomestic or international are not amateurs; but professionals.  They play on \nreceipt of remuneration therefor and furthermore make a lot of earnings by \nway of advertisements.  They participate in the game for a purpose.\n\tThe Board&#x27;s commands bind all who are connected with cricket.  The \nrules and regulations framed by it for all intent and purport are &quot;the code&quot; \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"40605\" id=\"span_119\">which regulate an important aspect of national life.  Such codes on the \npremise whereof the Board has been permitted by all concerned including \nthe Union of India and the States to operate so as to regulate and control not \nonly the sport of cricket as such but also all other intimately connected \ntherewith and in particular the professionals.\n\tIt is not in dispute that the players wear national colours in their attires \nand it also appears from the correspondences that the Board drew the \nattention to the Government of India that the players to show their pride of \nbeing Indian also exhibit Ashok Chakra on their helmets.\n\tWe may notice that in <a href=\"/doc/40605/\" id=\"a_307\">Union of India Vs.

Thus it is veritably common to all \nnations that a national flag has a great amount of \nsignificance\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">\tThe State had been taking on more and more sports related activities \nand thus courts have examined the purport and ambit of activities of such \nbodies keeping in view wider and wider range of measures the executive \nand the Central Government adopt.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\"> \tThe Board, having regard to its functions and object, had also been \ngranted exemption from payment of Income-tax.  Such exemption has been \ngranted with a view to fulfill its objectives to promote sports of cricket.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\"> \tThe Board, thus, in terms of ICC Rules, is representative of India.  \nThe membership although is in the name of the Board; it is the country \nwhich matters.  It may be that when the Board and the ICC were constituted \nthe concept was that the game of cricket would be played by clubs but with \nthe passage of time, the concept has undergone a sea change.  In any event, \nthe ICC does not say that it does not recognize the country and merely \nrecognizes the clubs.  \n</p> \t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_222\">\tThe Board (although such a contention has not been raised in any \naffidavit but in the written submissions only) allegedly spends crores of \nrupees in providing funds to construction of stadia, running zonal cricket \nacademies under national cricket academy, providing the State Associations \nwith modern gymnasium equipments, medical expenses of the players, \npension scheme and expenditure on coaches, physiotherapists, trainers, etc., \nbut it is not disputed that it earns a lot of revenue through sale of tickets, \nadvertisements in the stadia, selling of advertisement in the electronic media, \ngiving out contracts by way of food stalls and installation of other stalls, \nselling of broadcasting and telecast rights, highlight programmes.  The \nBoard is admittedly not a charitable trust.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_223\">The State legislature  as also the Parliament have the legislative \ncompetence to make legislation in respect of sports, but no such legislation \nhas yet seen the light of the day.  We have noticed hereinbefore that the \nBoard in terms of its Memorandum of Association as also rules and \nregulations framed by it is entitled to make laws for Cricket in India.  The \nStates and the Union of India despite knowledge did not object thereto.  \nThey, thus, made themselves bound by the said Rules and Regulations. In \nthat sense, exercise of  law making power contemplated by legislation has \nbeen outsourced to the Board. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">The Board which represents a nation with or without a statutory \nflavour has duties to perform towards the players, coaches, umpires, \nadministrators and other team officials.  They have a duty to create safe rules \nfor the sport,  if by reason thereof a physical injury to the player is to be \navoided and to keep safety aspect under ongoing review.  A body may be \nautonomous but with autonomy comes responsibility.  Sport is a &quot;good \nthing&quot; wherefor a societal end is to be provided.  Sport must receive \nencouragement from the State and the general public or at least not \ndiscouraged.  Health, sociability and play are considered to be important \nvalues to be recognized in a human.    \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_225\">Encouragement of games and sports in terms of Entry 33 of the State \nList and Entries 45 and 97 of the Union List is a State function.  We have \nnoticed the main objects of the Board which are to promote, control, \nregulate, make laws for the country and encourage the game of cricket.  The \nUnion of India or the respective Governments of the States in stead and \nplace of making a legislation have thought it fit to allow the sports bodies to \ngrow from its grass-root level by applying the reverse pyramid rules and by \nencouraging all associations and federations from village level to national \nlevel.  We have seen that whereas in each State there is a State federation, \nthey must as of practice or precedent become a member of the Board.  State \nFederations and some other organizations essentially having regard to their \nrespective nature of functions only are members of the Board.  They include \nAssociation of Indian Universities, Railway Sports Control Board and \nServices Sports Control Board.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">\tFurthermore, having regard to the nature of activities, viz., the Board \nrepresents a sovereign country while selecting and fielding a team for the \ncountry with another sovereign country promoting and aiming at good \nrelations with the said country as also peace and prosperity for the people, \neven at the domestic level the citizens of the said country may be held to be \nentitled to the right to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court even if \nthereby no personal fundamental right is directly infringed.  \nWith the opening up of economy and globalization, more and more \ngovernmental functions are being performed and allowed to be performed \nby private bodies.  When the functions of a body are identifiable with the \nState functions, they would be State actors only in relation thereto.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">\tAn authority necessarily need not be a creature of the statute.  The \npowers enjoyed and duties attached to the Board need not directly flow from \na statute.  The Board may not be subjected to a statutory control or enjoy any \nstatutory power but the source of power exercised by them may be traced to \nthe legislative entries and if the rules and regulations evolved by it are akin \nthereto, its actions would be State actions.  For the said purpose, what is \nnecessary is to find out as to whether by reason of its nature of activities, the \nfunctions of the Board are public functions.  It regulates and controls the \nfield of cricket to the exclusion of others.  Its activities impinge upon the \nfundamental rights of the players and other persons as also the rights, hopes \nand aspirations of the cricket loving public.  The right to see the game of \ncricket live or on television also forms an important facet of the Board.  A \nbody which makes a law for the sports in India (which otherwise is the \nfunction of the State),  conferring upon itself not only  enormous powers but \nalso final say in the disciplinary matter and, thus, being responsible for \nmaking or marring a citizen&#x27;s sports career, it  would be an authority which \nanswers the description of  &quot;other authorities&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\"> \tThe Board, it appears, even nominates cricketers for the Arjuna \nAwards.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_229\"> \tThe game of cricket both in the domestic fora as also the international \nfora cannot reach the desired results unless the Board acts in terms of the \ngovernmental policies or the government is entwined in its management or \ncontrol of the Board or any of its agencies \u0016 statutory or otherwise.  Apart \nfrom the above, the other tests <a href=\"/doc/40605/\" id=\"a_308\">laid down in</a> Brentwood Academy (supra), \nviz., &quot;willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents&quot;, in our \nopinion, would make the Board as a State actor. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"486040\" id=\"span_120\">The activities undertaken by the Board were taken note of in the case \nof <a href=\"/doc/486040/\" id=\"a_309\">Cricket Association of Bengal</a> (supra).

In \nthe circumstances, it has the right to choose the best \nmethod to earn the maximum revenue possible.

It discharges a \npublic function.  It has its duties towards the public.  The public at large will \nlook forward to the Board for selection of the best team to represent the \ncountry.  It must manage its housekeeping in such a manner so as to fulfill \nthe hopes and aspirations of  millions.  It has, thus, a duty to act fairly.  It \ncannot act arbitrarily, whimsically or capriciously.  Public interest is, thus, \ninvolved in the activities of the Board.  It is, thus, a State actor.\nWe, therefore, are of the opinion that law requires to be expanded in \nthis field and it must be held that the Board answers the description of \n&quot;Other Authorities&quot; as contained in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_313\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India \nand satisfies the requisite legal tests, as noticed hereinbefore.

For a public law remedy enforceable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_336\">Article \n226</a> of the Constitution, the actions of the authority need \nto fall in the realm of public law \u0016be it a legislative act or \nthe State, an executive act of the State or an \ninstrumentality or a person or authority imbued with \npublic law element.  The question is required to be \ndetermined in each case having regard to the nature of \nand extent of authority vested in the State.  However, it \nmay not be possible to generalize the nature of the action \nwhich would come either under public law remedy or \nprivate law field nor is it desirable to give exhaustive list \nof such actions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Emphasis supplied)\n \tThe submission of the learned counsel for the Board that once it is \ndeclared to be a &#x27;State&#x27;;  the consequences would be devastating inasmuch \nas all its activities would be subject to government control, with respect, \ncannot be accepted as in absence of any statute or statutory rules no such \ncontrol can ordinarily be exercised by Union of India or State.\n \tIt is not necessary for us to consider as to whether for entering into a \ncontract with the players or for their induction in a team, the provisions of \n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_337\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_338\">16</a> are required to be complied with as no occasion threrefor \nhas yet arisen.  It is, however, necessary to mention that a question as to \nwhether a function of the Board would be a public function or a private \nfunction would depend upon the nature and character thereof.  This Court \ncannot be asked to give a hypothetical answer to a hypothetical question.  \n\tThe contention of Mr. Venugopal to the effect that the consequences \nof treating the Board as State will be disastrous inasmuch as all the  national \nsports federations as well as those bodies which represent India in the \ninternational fora in the field of art, culture, beauty competitions, cultural \nevents, music and dance, science and other conferences or competitions \nrelating to any subject would become a &#x27;State&#x27; is  one of the desperation.\n \tWe clarify that this judgment is rendered on the facts of this case.  It \ndoes not lay down a law that all national sports federations would be State.  \nAmongst other federations, one of the important factors which has been \ntaken note of in rendering the decision is the fact that the game of cricket has \na special place in India.  No other game attracts so much attention or favour.  \nFurther, no other sport, in India, affords an opportunity to make a livelihood \nout of it.  Of course, each case may have to be considered on its own merit \nnot only having regard to its public functions but also the memorandum of \nassociation and the rules and regulations framed by it.\nOnly because it is a State within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_339\">Article 12</a>, the same \nby itself would not mean that it is bound by rule of reservation as contained \nin Clause 4 of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 15</a> and Clause 4 of the <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_341\">Article 16</a> of the Constitution \nof India.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\"> \tIn Ajit Singh and Others (II) Vs.

We do not agree.\n \tRecently in <a href=\"/doc/1762739/\" id=\"a_346\">Virendra Kumar Srivastava</a> (supra), this Court held:\n&quot;Before parting with the case, it is necessary for us to \nclarify that even though a body, entity or Corporation is \nheld to be a &#x27;State&#x27; within the definition of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_347\">Article 12</a> of \nthe Constitution what relief to the aggrieved person or \nemployee of such a body or entity is to be granted is a \nsubject matter in each case for the court to determine on \nthe basis of the structure of that society and also its \nfinancial capability and viability.  The subject of denial \nor grant of relief partially or fully has to be decided in \neach particular case by the court dealing with the \ngrievances brought by an aggrieved person against the \nbodies covered by the definition of &#x27;State&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_348\">Article \n12</a> of the Constitution.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1142205\" id=\"span_144\">The &quot;in terrorem&quot; submission of Mr. Venugopal that a floodgate of \nlitigation would open up if the Board is held to be a State within the meaning \nof <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_349\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution cannot also be accepted.  Floodgate \narguments about the claimed devastating effect of being declared a State \nmust be taken with a grain of salt.  The courts, firstly, while determining a \nconstitutional question considers such a question to be more or less \nirrelevant.  [See <a href=\"/doc/1142205/\" id=\"a_350\">Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee and Another \nAnr. Vs.    C.. K. Rajan and Others</a> [(2003) 7 SCC 546 \u0016 para 69]. Secondly, \nas would be noticed hereinafter that this Court has evolved principles of \njudicial restraint as regards interfering with the activities of a body in policy \nmatters.  It would further appear from the discussions made hereinbefore \nthat as all actions of the Board would not be subject to judicial review.  A \nwrit would not lie where the lis involves only private law character.\n \tWe are not oblivious of the fact that one of the grounds why the \nEnglish Courts refused to broaden the judicial review concept so far as the \nsporting associations are concerned, that the same would open floodgate.  \n(See P.P. Craig&#x27;s Administrative Law)\n \tUnlike England, India has a written Constitution, and, thus, this Court \ncannot refuse to answer a question only because there may be some \nrepercussions thereto.  As indicated hereinbefore, even the decisions of this \nCourt would take care of such apprehension.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">It is interesting to note that Lord Denning M.R. in Bradbury and \nothers   vs. London Borough of Enfield (1967) 3 All ER 434] held :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">\t&quot;It has been suggested by the Chief Education \nOfficer that, if an injunction is granted, chaos will \nsupervene.  All the arrangements have been made for the \nnext term, the teachers appointed to the new \ncomprehensive schools, the pupils allotted their places, \nand so forth.  It would be next to impossible, he says, to \nreverse all these arrangements without complete chaos \nand damage to teachers, pupils and public.  I must say \nthis: if a local authority does not fulfil the requirements \nof the law, this court will see that it does fulfil them.  It \nwill not listen readily to suggestions of &quot;chaos&quot;.  The \ndepartment of education and the council are subject to the \nrule of law and must comply with it just like everyone \nelse.  Even if chaos should result still the law must be \nobeyed but I do not think that chaos will result.  The \nevidence convinces me that the &quot;chaos&quot; is much over-\nstated\u0005..I see no reason why the position should not be \nrestored, so that the eight school retain their previous \ncharacter until the statutory requirements are fulfilled. I \ncan well see that there may be a considerable upset for a \nnumber of people, but I think it far more important to \nuphold the rule of law.  Parliament has laid down these \nrequirements so as to ensure that the electors can make \ntheir objections and have them properly considered.
