From a bare reading of\n\nthe Section we observe that the Section mandates the appropriate\n\nGovernment or the local authority to establish a school in every\n\nneighbourhood where such a school is not established by the\n\nappropriate Government or the local authority. Even the Notes on\n\nClauses with reference to the above <a href=\"/doc/148834358/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 6</a> of the RTE Act,\n\nprovides for establishment of a school in every neighbourhood.

The objective of this legislation is to implement the\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy enshrined in the Constitution,\n\nwhich lays down that the State shall provide free and compulsory\n\neducation to all children up to the age of 14 years.                   <a href=\"/doc/154644006/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21-A</a>\n\nwhich has been inserted by the Constitution (86 th amendment) Act,\n\n2002, provides for free and compulsory education to all children in\n\nthe age group of 6 to 14 years as a fundamental right. It is to\n\nachieve this object that the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_9\">RTE            Act</a> has been enacted and with\n\nthat in mind, <a href=\"/doc/148834358/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 6</a> of the RTE Act has to be read.                     The said\n\nsection mandates the appropriate Government and the local\n\nauthority, i.e. the Zilla Parishad in this case, to establish a school\n\nwithin the area or limits of neighbourhood where it is not so\n\nestablished within a period of 3 years from the commencement of\n\nthe Act.       It is not that, as the learned counsel for petitioner has\n\nsubmitted that only where a school is not established that the\n\nappropriate government is duty bound to do, suggesting that, when\n\nthe petitioner has its school in the local area, the Government or\n\nlocal authority is not so mandated.           That, in our view, would be a\n\nvery fallacious interpretation of the section, which would completely\n\ndefeat the very objective of the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_11\">RTE Act</a>, to provide free and\n\ncompulsory education to students from disadvantaged groups and\n\nweaker sections. <a href=\"/doc/148834358/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 6</a> mandates the appropriate government\n\nand the local authority to establish school where such a school is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">::: Uploaded on - 21/01/2021                     ::: Downloaded on - 07/02/2021 22:34:40 :::</span>\n                                                5                                wp 9949.19 f.odt\n\n\n\nnot established by the appropriate government or local authority.

Apart from the provisions of the Code, the State Government has\n                 issued Government Resolutions dated 27th July 1992 and 3rd June,\n                 1998 governing the grant of permissions for starting new schools or for\n                 the renewal of existing permissions. Copies of those Resolutions have\n                 been placed on the record in a compilation tendered by the learned\n                 Advocate General. The Government Resolution dated 27th July, 1992\n                 provides that Government has in December, 1991 prepared a master\n                 plan for secondary schools and, places in the State where secondary\n                 schools were necessary have been included in the plan. The G.R,\n                 provides that in the case of villages having a pre-secondary school (a\n                 primary school upto the VIIth standard) the population should be at\n                 least 1000. In a pre-secondary school, the muster roll strength of\n                 students of the VIIth standard should be 25 (15 in the case of hilly or\n                 adivasi areas or for a linguistic minority). The case for establishing a\n                 secondary school could be considered only where pre-secondary\n                 school exists in the village and where there is no secondary school\n                 within a radius of 5 kilometres. In urban areas there should be one\n                 secondary school for a population of 10,000. Some of the provisions of\n                 these Government Resolutions have been adverted to by us for the\n                 purpose of considering the broad policy frame work already in place\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">::: Uploaded on - 21/01/2021                            ::: Downloaded on - 07/02/2021 22:34:40 :::</span>\n                                               7                               wp 9949.19 f.odt\n\n\n\n                 governing the establishment and opening of new schools.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                 8. In formulating appropriate norms and standards for the\n                 establishment of new primary and secondary schools in the State,\n                 certain basic considerations have to be borne in mind. These\n                 considerations include the following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                 1. The first and foremost is the need for ensuring the spread of primary\n                 and secondary education to all parts of the socio economic strata and in\n                 all geographical areas of the state. Areas of under development; areas\n                 which are geographically inaccessible such as the hilly areas; areas of\n                 adivasi habitation and other socially and educationally backward areas\n                 need special priority and emphasis. These areas have to be identified\n                 by the State Government in terms of a master plan which will be valid\n                 for a period of ten years. Once formulated, the master plan should be\n                 scrupulously adhered to unless new problems require a change in a\n                 master plan that was originally formulated.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                 2. In granting permissions for setting up new primary, secondary and\n                 higher secondary schools, due and proper emphasis has to be given to\n                 the existence of requisite infrastructure. The spread of education has to\n                 be consistent with the maintenance of basic facilities required in terms\n                 of infrastructure, including a properly qualified and equipped teaching\n                 staff. Unrecognised schools with little or no infrastructure and with a\n                 lack of qualified teaching staff cannot be permitted and the State would\n                 be justified in dealing with such institutions with strictness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                 3. Applications for the establishment of new schools ought to be\n                 processed and decided by a body of experts in a transparent and\n                 objective manner. The policy which has been submitted for our\n                 consideration by the learned Advocate General accepts this principle.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">                 The same which is being formulated by the State Government in the\n                 present case contemplates District and State Level Committees\n                 consisting of experts in the area and nominees of the Vice-Chancellor\n                 or the Chancellors as the case may be. Reasons, brief as they may be,\n                 should be given by the Committees for granting or rejecting\n                 applications for establishment of schools.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">                 4. In determining whether a new school should be permitted care has to\n                 be taken to ensure that unhealthy competition between educational\n                 institutions is avoided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">                 5. In order to discourage the practice of establishing unauthorised\n                 institutions, the policy stipulates that no unauthorised institution shall\n                 be considered by the Government from the year 2000-2001 for the\n                 grant of permission unless the institution concerned undertakes that it\n                 shall not admit any student in the absence of permission by the\n                 Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">                 6. The fundamental principle that has to be borne in mind is that\n                 provision of primary education is a constitutionally protected\n                 fundamental right. The State has a constitutional duty to provide,\n                 within the limits of its economic capacity and development the right to\n                 education. As the Supreme Court held in Unnikrishnan&#x27;s case, the need\n                 for private institutions to impart education has come into being\n                 because of the limitation on the resources of the State to provide\n                 education for the society at large. The Supreme Court held as follows :\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">::: Uploaded on - 21/01/2021                           ::: Downloaded on - 07/02/2021 22:34:40 :::</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                                               8                               wp 9949.19 f.odt\n\n\n\n                 &quot;The private educational institutions merely supplement the effort of\n                 the State in educating the people, as explained above. It is not an\n                 independent activity. It is an activity supplemental to the principal\n                 activity carried on by the State. No private educational institution can\n                 survive or subsist without recognition and/or affiliation. The bodies\n                 which grant recognition and/or affiliation are the authorities of the\n                 State. In such a situation, it is obligatory---in the interest of general\n                 public--upon the authority granting recognition or affiliation to insist\n                 upon such conditions as are appropriate to ensure not only education of\n                 requisite standard but also fairness and equal treatment in the matter of\n                 admission of students. Since the recognising/ affiliating authority is the\n                 State, it is under an obligation to impose such conditions as part of its\n                 duty enjoined upon it by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. It cannot allow\n                 itself or its power and privilege to be used unfairly. The incidents\n                 attaching to the main activity attach to supplemental activity as well.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                 (At. P. 755) Private institutions which enter the arena of providing\n                 education, perform the role of supplementing the function of the State.\n                 The establishment and functioning of those institutions must therefore\n                 be subject to regulation by the State to secure the interest of the\n                 students and teachers, of those who are taught and those who teach.\n                 Recognition is a means of ensuring that the students of the institution\n                 can appear at examinations conducted by the State and be conferred\n                 with qualifications granted by the State and its authorities. The State\n                 also has a vital interest in the proper functioning of schools because a\n                 significant proportion of them do receive grants in aid from the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                 7. These considerations underline the need to ensure that decision of\n                 the Government on whether or not to permit the establishment of new\n                 educational institution must be transparent, objective and fair. The\n                 norms on the basis of which those decisions are arrived at should be\n                 certain and definite. The investigation of whether those norms are\n                 fulfilled must be carried out by academic experts within the\n                 Government, with the assistance of experts outside. In this manner, the\n                 process of establishing new schools in the State must meet the\n                 requirements of fair and non discriminatory treatment. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 14</a> of the\n                 Constitution mandates that Governmental decisions be guided by\n                 reason and informed by public interest, The need for this is all the\n                 greater, where the right in question is the right to receive education, a\n                 part of which the right to primary education until the age of fourteen, is\n                 a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n                 . . . ....\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">                 . . . . . .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                 . . . . . .&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n8]               While we are in respectful agreement with the aforesaid\n\nobservations of this Court, we are unable to fathom as to how the\n\nabove observations would assist the Petitioner&#x27;s case.

While\n\nhighlighting the importance of right to education, this court in\n\nparagraph 5 emphasized how the right to education has received\n\nprimary importance in the constitutional set up after independence.\n\nParagraph 5 of the said decision authored by Honourable Justice Dr.\n\nD.Y. Chandrachud (as His Lordship then was) is worth quoting,\n\nwhich reads thus :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                 &quot;5.     The right to education has received primary importance in the\n        Constitutional set up after independence. The provisions of the Constitution\n        recognise the significance and importance of education. Judicial decisions have\n        elaborated upon the scope and ambit of the right to education. <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 41</a> of the\n        Constitution which is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy enunciates\n        that the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development,\n        make effective provisions for the right to education. <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 45</a> provides that\n        &quot;the State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the\n        commencement of this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all\n        children until they complete the age of fourteen years&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 45</a> recognises\n        that every child shall, upto the age of fourteen have the right to receive\n        education. The right to education is indeed so basic and so fundamental that it\n        has, subject to the qualification to which we shall presently advert, been\n        construed to be a part of the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n        The right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a>, it is well settled, includes all those faculties\n        and means by which life becomes meaningful. Life, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article\n        21</a> lies beyond the realm of a bare physical existence. That right, by the process\n        of a creative judicial interpretation encompassed the right to privacy, to a\n        speedy trial, to public health, to information, to the means of communication to\n        inaccessible areas and to a clean environment; these are a few of the areas to\n        which the right to life has extended. In the contemporary society of today, there\n        can be no doubt about the fact that education is the key to meaningful human\n        existence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88263547\" id=\"span_10\">In one sense, perhaps basic, education is the source of the acquisition\n        of knowledge and the means to secure information about the course of human\n        affairs. In another sense, perhaps even more fundamental, education in its true\n        sense is a means to the development of human personality. In the complex and\n        highly specialised age that modern societies are tending to imbibe, education is\n        a source of opportunity, of work, livelihood and gainful avocation. The Supreme\n        Court recognised the primary importance of education in its landmark\n        judgment in <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_26\">Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, . The Supreme Court\n        held that education until the attainment of the age of fourteen is a fundamental\n        right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Recognising the importance of\n        receiving education in the life of every child in our society, the Supreme Court\n        upheld the fundamental right of every child to receive education until the age of\n        fourteen. The Supreme Court held as follows :</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                &quot;The citizens of this country have a fundamental right to education. The\n        said right flows from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21.</a> This right is, however, into an absolute right.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">::: Uploaded on - 21/01/2021                               ::: Downloaded on - 07/02/2021 22:34:40 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">                                                10                                wp 9949.19 f.odt\n\n\n\n        Its content and parameters have to be determined in the light of Articles 45 and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">        41. In other words every child/citizen of this country has a right to free\n        education, until he completes the age of fourteen years. Thereafter his right to\n        education is subject to the limits of economic capacity and development of the\n        State.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88263547\" id=\"span_12\">Education has thus a position of prime importance in the Constitutional\n        scheme of a just and fair society. The position of importance that education has\n        in the constitutional set up has found acceptance, affirmation and elaboration\n        in judgments of the Supreme Court. There is a significant need to spread\n        education in a society such as ours where poverty, underdevelopment and social\n        disability have to be overcome by making available the benefit of education to\n        the widest strata of society. In the State of Maharashtra, it has been estimated\n        that nearly 11,000 habitations are without a primary education facility. The\n        levels of literacy in States such as Kerala have been substantially improved with\n        the rapid spread of primary education. The importance of the spread of primary\n        education is hence an intrinsic part of State policy designed to ensure the reach\n        of education to the population at large. The primary duty to ensure the spread\n        of education is one that the Constitution requires the State of perform. Yet, there\n        is a constitutional recognition on the limitations of the State - both in terms of\n        resources and capacity - in performing this rule. Consequently, the Supreme\n        Court recognised a fundamental right to receive education until the age of\n        fourteen, in <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_29\">Unnikrishnan</a>&#x27;s case. The Court recognised that the role of private\n        institutions is important in order to supplement the role of the State in achieving\n        the spread of education. The necessary consequence is that private institutions\n        would, when they seek to enter the filed of education, be subject to the same\n        restrictions and regulatory requirements as would apply to the State as\n        dispenser of education. In seeking recognition and in certain cases, financial\n        assistance from the State, private managements of educational institutions are\n        liable to be regulated by the State to ensure that the interests of students, of\n        teachers and the course of education are promoted.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n9]               By <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_30\">the said decision</a>, this Court, while considering the\n\npolicy and scheme formulated by the State Government, made\n\ncertain      suggestions        and     directed       the     State     Government            to\n\nconstitute District Level and State Level Committees for the\n\npurpose of considering applications for establishing schools. In our\n\nview, it is this and other such decisions which would possibly have\n\nnecessitated the <a href=\"/doc/30032725/\" id=\"a_31\">RTE Act</a> which came to be enacted in 2009.</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153710700\" id=\"span_13\">10]              However, in all fairness, Mr. Bhandari has also handed\n\nover to us a copy of the decision of this court in Writ Petition No.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">::: Uploaded on - 21/01/2021                              ::: Downloaded on - 07/02/2021 22:34:40 :::</span>\n                                               11                                wp 9949.19 f.odt\n\n\n\n4200 of 2017             (Antar Bharti Shikshan Sanstha Biloli through its\n\n<a href=\"/doc/153710700/\" id=\"a_32\">President Vs.

Bare reading of the provision would show that pre-requisite\n              for obtaining permission or approval to run a school is for those\n              schools which have been run by private institute because an\n              exception is carved out in the provision itself to these schools\n              being run, being established and controlled by the appropriate\n              Government or local authority. It is not in dispute that the school\n              in which 5 th and 8 th std classes are being run by the local\n              authority Zilla Parishad. On the back drop of this provision\n              petitioner of is the Act making and the factual submissions that\n              aspect if the because of the classes of 5th to 8th std run in the Zilla\n              Parishad school, the petitioner is put to financial losses and as\n              such, the classes being run by the Zilla Parishad be closed down\n              is not only unacceptable submission but is illogical and irrational\n              submission. If the students taking education in 5 th to 8 th std\n              classes are having a choice available to take the education in\n              Zilla Parishad school or a private school, the students may\n              exercise their choice. Merely because the petitioner institute\n              private institute is put to financial loss cannot be a ground to\n              force upon the students to take the education only in class being\n              run by petitioner&#x27;s school.

If\n              such closure is permitted, it would lead to monopoly of the\n              petitioner institute for running 5th to 8th classes.
