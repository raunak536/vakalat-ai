The petitioner is challenging the in-action on part             of   the\n\n\n    respondents in closing the suspect sheet vide proceedings in\n    C.No.83/Suspect/SDO-P/2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\"> 2. The petitioner in was shown as Accused No.1 in CC.No.260 of\n\n    2021 and the sanne was settled before Lok Adalat and                  the\n\n\n    petitioner was acquitted on 11.12.2021 by the learned Judicial\n\n    First Class Magistrate, Palakonda.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\"> 3. The   learned   counsel    for     the   petitioner submit that       the\n\n\n    respondents have not closed the rowdy sheet though there is no\n\n   other case pending against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that\n\n   continuation of rowdy sheet against the petitioner is also a social\n\n   sigma on the petitioner. It is also submitted that continuation of\n\n   the rowdy sheet against the petitioner though there is no case\n\n   pending against the petitioners amounts to interfering with the\n   fundamental rights of the petitioners i.e., right to live with dignity\n\n   and the right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 19(1 )(d).</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">                                    HAH\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                           WP.No.20806 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.   The learned Assistant Government Pleader representing                 the\n\n\n     respondents submits that a counter is filed and that the Police\n\n     Standing Orders 602(2) clearly mentioned that nothing precludes\n\n     the SP/DCP/CP from continuing a rowdy sheet on the                   sole\n\n\n     ground that the history/rowdy sheeter is not figuring           as    an\n\n\n\n     accused in the previous five years. It would depend upon the\n\n     nature of the activities of the history/rowdy sheeter for continuing\n\n     the suspect sheet to enable peace and tranquility in the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6. The learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing for the\n\n     state does not dispute that there are no cases pending against\n\n     the petitioner: however submits that the petitioners        activities\n\n\n     would require continuous surveillance for the police to maintain\n\n     the law and order in the state.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.   Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the\n\n     learned Assistant Government Pleader for the state and perused\n\n     the material on record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">8.   The following questions would fall for consideration of these writ\n\n     petitions ;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">      I.   Whether the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 19(1 )(d)</a> of\n           a Citizen is infringed upon on account of continued\n           surveillance under the guise of opening and continuing\n           history sheet ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">                                   //5//\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                             WP.No.20806 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\n     II.   The scope of judicial review of history sheet / rowdy\n           sheet   on    the   touchstone     of      reasonableness,\n           arbitrariness and non-application of mind ?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">9.   It is not in dispute that the petitioner is not accused and are not\n\n     facing trial in any matters. It is also not in dispute that the\n     petitioner is not convicted of any offence(s).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">10. The stand taken by the respondents, that the Police Standing\n     Orders would empower the respondents to open history\n     sheet/rowdy sheet in order to maintain law and order is not a\n     unfettered right. The Police Standing Orders do not have\n     statutory forde. The standing orders are only administrative\n     instructions. It is also not in dispute that the Police Standing\n     Orders which are issued under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_9\">Police Act</a> would have\n\n     statutory force.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\"> 11. It is pertinent to refer to Chapter 31 of the A.P. Police Code\n     which contains 24 Standing Orders. They deal with the Station\n      Crime history. Standing Orders 733 to 741 and Standing Order\n      749 deal with History sheets. Standing Order 742 deals with\n      rowdy sheets.

A reading of the Standing Crders leads to the following\n\nconclusions:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">    a)   A police station has to open History sheet\n         automatically at the time of conviction of a person.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">         But the conviction is not for all offences.

But in such case the person should\n           have been known or believed to be addicted to or\n           aid or abet the commission of a crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">    c)     The History Sheet opened shall be continued and\n           maintained only for a period of two years and shall\n           be closed only on definite orders of Gazetted Officer.\n           The Police may however order closure of the History\n           Sheet at any time (PSO 735).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">    d)     The History Sheet can be continued and maintained\n           for further period of one year till the end of\n          December, but such continuance can be on specific\n          orders of a Gazetted Officer who after considering\n          the case comes to conclusion that it is necessary to\n          continue the History Sheet and extend retention of\n          the    History   Sheet.    Annual    extensions    for\n          continuation of History Sheet can also be given from\n       January to December, (PSOs. 735 and 737).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">    e) The police may also open history sheets for\n          suspects. Suspects are those persons who are\n          convicted under any section of the Bharatiya Nyaya\n          Sanhita, 2023 and who are considered likely to\n          commit crime again. Persons who are not convicted\n          but are believed to be addicted to crime are also\n          treated as suspects. In case a History Sheet is\n          opened on the ground that a person is a suspect\n          care should be taken that History Sheets are opened\n          only for persons who are likely to become habitual\n          criminals (PSO 736).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">12. The police after\n                       opening history sheets would constantly keep\n    the history sheeter under their radar of surveillance.
