Tripathy says that non-\n\nrecognition of the identity of Hijras, a TG community, as a third\n\ngender, denies them the right of equality before the law and equal\n\nprotection of law guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\n\nand violates the rights guaranteed to them under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.

Learned senior counsel has submitted\n\nthat since the TGs are neither treated as male or female, nor given\n\nthe status of a third gender, they are being deprived of many of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                 4</span>\n\n\nrights and privileges which other persons enjoy as citizens of this\n\ncountry. TGs are deprived of social and cultural participation and\n\nhence restricted access to education, health care and public\n\nplaces which deprives them of the Constitutional guarantee of\n\fequality before law and equal protection of laws. Further, it was\n\nalso pointed out that the community also faces discrimination to\n\ncontest election, right to vote, employment, to get licences etc.\n\nand, in effect, treated as an outcast and untouchable.      Learned\n\nsenior counsel also submitted that the State cannot discriminate\n\nthem on the ground of gender, violating <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 14</a> to 16 and 21 of\n\nthe Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">6.

We also heard learned counsel appearing for various States\n\nand Union Territories who have explained the steps they have\n\ntaken to improve the conditions and status of the members of TG\n\ncommunity in their respective States and Union Territories. Laxmi\n\nNarayan Tripathy, a Hijra, through a petition supported by an\n\naffidavit, highlighted the trauma undergone by Tripathy from\n\nTripathy’s birth.    Rather than explaining the same by us, it would\n\nbe appropriate to quote in Tripathy’s own words:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;That the Applicant has born as a male. Growing up as\n       a child, she felt different from the boys of her age and\n\f      was feminine in her ways. On account of her femininity,\n      from an early age, she faced repeated sexual\n      harassment, molestation and sexual abuse, both within\n      and outside the family. Due to her being different, she\n      was isolated and had no one to talk to or express her\n      feelings while she was coming to terms with her identity.\n      She was constantly abused by everyone as a ‘chakka’\n      and ‘hijra’. Though she felt that there was no place for\n      her in society, she did not succumb to the prejudice.\n      She started to dress and appear in public in women’s\n      clothing in her late teens but she did not identify as a\n      woman.        Later, she joined the Hijra community in\n      Mumbai as she identified with the other hijras and for\n      the first time in her life, she felt at home.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      That being a hijra, the Applicant has faced serious\n      discrimination throughout her life because of her gender\n      identity. It has been clear to the Applicant that the\n      complete     non-recognition     of   the   identity     of\n      hijras/transgender persons by the State has resulted in\n      the violation of most of the fundamental rights\n      guaranteed to them under the Constitution of India....&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                        8</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">      Siddarth Narrain, eunuch, highlights Narrain’s feeling, as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      &quot;Ever since I can remember, I have always identified\n      myself as a woman. I lived in Namakkal, a small town in\n      Tamil Nadu. When I was in the 10th standard I realized\n      that the only way for me to be comfortable was to join\n      the hijra community. It was then that my family found\n      out that I frequently met hijras who lived in the city. One\n      day, when my father was away, my brother, encouraged\n      by my mother, started beating me with a cricket bat. I\n      locked myself in a room to escape from the beatings.\n      My mother and brother then tried to break into the room\n      to beat me up further. Some of my relatives intervened\n      and brought me out of the room. I related my ordeal to\n      an uncle of mine who gave me Rs.50 and asked me to\n      go home. Instead, I took the money and went to live\n      with a group of hijras in Erode.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">      Sachin, a TG, expressed his experiences as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      &quot;My name is Sachin and I am 23 years old. As a child I\n      always enjoyed putting make-up like ‘vibhuti’ or ‘kum\n      kum’ and my parents always saw me as a girl. I am\n      male but I only have female feelings. I used to help my\n      mother in all the housework like cooking, washing and\n      cleaning. Over the years, I started assuming more of\n      the domestic responsibilities at home. The neighbours\n      starting teasing me. They would call out to me and ask:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      ‘Why don’t you go out and work like a man?’ or ‘Why\n      are you staying at home like a girl?’ But I liked being a\n      girl. I felt shy about going out and working. Relatives\n      would also mock and scold me on this score. Every day\n      I would go out of the house to bring water. And as I\n      walked back with the water I would always be teased. I\n      felt very ashamed. I even felt suicidal. How could I live\n      like that? But my parents never protested. They were\n      helpless.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                    9</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      We have been told and informed of similar life experiences\n\ffaced by various others who belong to the TG community.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">11.   Transgender is generally described as an umbrella term for\n\npersons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior\n\ndoes not conform to their biological sex. TG may also takes in\n\npersons who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth, which\n\ninclude Hijras/Eunuchs who, in this writ petition, describe\n\nthemselves as &quot;third gender&quot; and they do not identify as either male\n\nor female. Hijras are not men by virtue of anatomy appearance\n\nand psychologically, they are also not women, though they are like\n\nwomen with no female reproduction organ and no menstruation.\n\nSince Hijras do not have reproduction capacities as either men or\n\nwomen, they are neither men nor women and claim to be an\n\ninstitutional &quot;third gender&quot;. Among Hijras, there are emasculated\n\n(castrated,   nirvana)    men,    non-emasculated         men     (not\n\ncastrated/akva/akka) and inter-sexed persons (hermaphrodites).\n\nTG also includes persons who intend to undergo Sex Re-\n\nAssignment Surgery (SRS) or have undergone SRS to align their\n\nbiological sex with their gender identity in order to become male or\n\nfemale. They are generally called transsexual persons. Further,\n\nthere are persons who like to cross-dress in clothing of opposite\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                   10</span>\n\n\ngender, i.e transvestites. Resultantly, the term &quot;transgender&quot;, in\n\ncontemporary usage, has become an umbrella term that is used to\n\ndescribe a wide range of identities and experiences, including but\n\nnot limited to pre-operative, post-operative and non-operative\n\ntranssexual people, who strongly identify with the gender opposite\n\nto their biological sex; male and female.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF TRANSGENDERS IN INDIA:\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">12.   TG Community comprises of Hijras, eunuchs, Kothis,\n\nAravanis, Jogappas, Shiv-Shakthis etc. and they, as a group, have\n\ngot a strong historical presence in our country in the Hindu\n\nmythology and other religious texts.   The Concept of tritiya prakrti\n\nor napunsaka has also been an integral part of vedic and puranic\n\fliteratures.   The word ‘napunsaka’      has been used to denote\n\nabsence of procreative capability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">13.   Lord Rama, in the epic Ramayana, was leaving for the forest\n\nupon being banished from the kingdom for 14 years, turns around\n\nto his followers and asks all the ‘men and women’ to return to the\n\ncity. Among his followers, the hijras alone do not feel bound by this\n\ndirection and decide to stay with him.         Impressed with their\n\ndevotion, Rama sanctions them the power to confer blessings on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                      11</span>\n\n\npeople on auspicious occasions like childbirth and marriage, and\n\nalso at inaugural functions which, it is believed set the stage for the\n\ncustom of badhai in which hijras sing, dance and confer blessings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">14.   Aravan, the son of Arjuna and Nagakanya in Mahabharata,\n\noffers to be sacrificed to Goddess Kali to ensure the victory of the\n\nPandavas in the Kurukshetra war, the only condition that he made\n\nwas to spend the last night of his life in matrimony.         Since no\n\nwoman was willing to marry one who was doomed to be killed,\n\nKrishna assumes the form of a beautiful woman called Mohini and\n\nmarries him.     The Hijras of Tamil Nadu consider Aravan their\n\nprogenitor and call themselves Aravanis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">15.   Jain Texts also make a detailed reference to TG which\n\nmentions the concept of ‘psychological sex’. Hijras also played a\n\nprominent role in the royal courts of the Islamic world, especially in\n\nthe Ottaman empires and the Mughal rule in the Medieval India. A\n\ndetailed analysis of the historical background of the same finds a\n\nplace in the book of Gayatri Reddy, &quot;With Respect to Sex:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India&quot; - Yoda Press (2006).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">16.   We notice that even though historically, Hijras/transgender\n\npersons had played a prominent role, with the onset of colonial rule\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                 12</span>\n\n\nfrom the 18th century onwards, the situation had changed\n\ndrastically.   During the British rule, a legislation was enacted to\n\nsupervise the deeds of Hijras/TG community, called the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_9\">Criminal\n\fTribes Act, 1871</a>, which deemed the entire community of Hijras\n\npersons as innately ‘criminal’ and ‘addicted to the systematic\n\ncommission of non-bailable offences’.      <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_10\">The Act</a> provided for the\n\nregistration, surveillance and control of certain criminal tribes and\n\neunuchs and had penalized eunuchs, who were registered, and\n\nappeared to be dressed or ornamented like a woman, in a public\n\nstreet or place, as well as those who danced or played music in a\n\npublic place. Such persons also could be arrested without warrant\n\nand sentenced to imprisonment up to two years or fine or both.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_11\">Under the Act</a>, the local government had to register the names and\n\nresidence of all eunuchs residing in that area as well as of their\n\nproperties, who were reasonably suspected of kidnapping or\n\ncastrating children, or of committing offences under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 377</a> of\n\nthe IPC, or of abetting the commission of any of the said offences.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_13\">Under the Act</a>, the act of keeping a boy under 16 years in the\n\ncharge of a registered eunuch was made an offence punishable\n\nwith imprisonment up to two years or fine and the Act also denuded\n\nthe registered eunuchs of their civil rights by prohibiting them from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                        13</span>\n\n\nacting as guardians to minors, from making a gift deed or a will, or\n\nfrom adopting a son.

Reference may be made to the judgment of the\n\nAllahabad High Court in Queen Empress v.

In that case,\n\nwhile acquitting him, the Sessions Judge stated as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        &quot;This case relates to a person named Khairati, over\n\f         whom the police seem to have exercised some sort of\n         supervision, whether strictly regular or not, as a eunuch.\n         The man is not a eunuch in the literal sense, but he was\n         called for by the police when on a visit to his village, and\n         was found singing dressed as a woman among the\n         women of a certain family.

Gender identity is one of the most-fundamental aspects of life\n\nwhich refers to a person’s intrinsic sense of being male, female or\n\ntransgender or transsexual person.         A person’s sex is usually\n\nassigned at birth, but a relatively small group of persons may born\n\nwith bodies which incorporate both or certain aspects of both male\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                    15</span>\n\n\nand female physiology. At times, genital anatomy problems may\n\narise in certain persons, their innate perception of themselves, is\n\nnot in conformity with the sex assigned to them at birth and may\n\ninclude pre and post-operative transsexual persons and also\n\npersons who do not choose to undergo or do not have access to\n\noperation and also include persons who cannot undergo successful\n\foperation.   Countries, all over the world, including India, are\n\ngrappled with the question of attribution of gender to persons who\n\nbelieve that they belong to the opposite sex.          Few persons\n\nundertake surgical and other procedures to alter their bodies and\n\nphysical appearance to acquire gender characteristics of the sex\n\nwhich conform to their perception of gender, leading to legal and\n\nsocial complications since official record of their gender at birth is\n\nfound to be at variance with the assumed gender identity. Gender\n\nidentity refers to each person’s deeply felt internal and individual\n\nexperience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the\n\nsex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body\n\nwhich may involve a freely chosen, modification of bodily\n\nappearance or functions by medical, surgical or other means and\n\nother expressions of gender, including dress, speech and\n\nmannerisms.

Various countries have given recognition to the gender\n\nidentity of such persons, mostly, in cases where transsexual\n\fpersons started asserting their rights after undergoing SRS of their\n\nre-assigned sex.    In Corbett v. Corbett (1970) 2 All ER 33, the\n\nCourt in England was concerned with the gender of a male to\n\nfemale transsexual in the context of the validity of a marriage.\n\nOrmrod, J. in that case took the view that the law should adopt the\n\nchromosomal, gonadal and genital tests and if all three are\n\ncongruent, that should determine a person’s sex for the purpose of\n\nmarriage. Learned Judge expressed the view that any operative\n\nintervention   should   be   ignored   and   the     biological   sexual\n\nconstitution of an individual is fixed at birth, at the latest, and\n\ncannot be changed either by the natural development of organs of\n\nthe opposite sex or by medical or surgical means. Later, in R v.\n\nTan (1983) QB 1053, 1063-1064, the Court of Appeal applied\n\nCorbett approach in the context of criminal law. The Court upheld\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                       30</span>\n\n\nconvictions which were imposed on Gloria Greaves, a post-\n\noperative male to female transsexual, still being in law, a man.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">26.   Corbett principle was not found favour by various other\n\ncountries, like New Zealand, Australia etc. and also attracted much\n\ncriticism, from the medical profession.        It was felt that the\n\napplication of the Corbett approach would lead to a substantial\n\ndifferent outcome in cases of a post operative inter-sexual person\n\nand a post operative transsexual person.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1495454\" id=\"span_31\">In New Zealand in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1495454/\" id=\"a_23\">Attorney-General v.

It was held that there is no social advantage in the law for not\n\nrecognizing the validity of the marriage of a transsexual in the sex\n\nof reassignment. The Court held that an adequate test is whether\n\nthe person in question has undergone surgical and medical\n\nprocedures that have effectively given the person the physical\n\nconformation of a person of a specified sex. In Re Kevin (Validity\n\nof Marriage of Transsexual) (2001) Fam CA 1074, in an\n\nAustralian case, Chisholm J., held that there is no ‘formulaic\n\fsolution’ to determine the sex of an individual for the purpose of the\n\nlaw of marriage.

Full Court of the Federal Family Court in the year\n\n2003 approved the above-mentioned judgment holding that in the\n\nrelevant Commonwealth marriage statute the words ‘man’ and\n\n‘woman’ should be given their ordinary, everyday contemporary\n\nmeaning and that the word ‘man’ includes a post operative female\n\nto male transsexual person. The Full Court also held that there\n\nwas a biological basis for transsexualism and that there was no\n\nreason to exclude the psyche as one of the relevant factors in\n\ndetermining sex and gender.

At birth, she was\n\ncorrectly classified and registered as male.    However, she felt\n\nmore inclined to be a female. Despite her inclinations, and under\n\nsome pressure, in 1967 she married a woman and at that time she\n\nwas 21 years old. Marriage broke down and parties separated in\n\n1971 and got divorce in the year 1975.

Mr. and Mrs. Bellinger since marriage lived happily as\n\nhusband and wife and presented themselves in that fashion to the\n\noutside world.

The Malaysian Court\n\nbasically applied the principle laid down in Corbett (supra),\n\nhowever, both the prayers sought for were granted, after noticing\n\nthat the medical men have spoken that the plaintiff is a female and\n\nthey have considered the sex change of the plaintiff as well as her\n\n&quot;psychological aspect&quot;.

Act 2013 defines gender identity as\n\nthe      appearance          or   mannerisms       or   other    gender-related\n\ncharacteristics of a person (whether by way of medical intervention\n\nor not) with or without regard to the person’s designated sex at\n\nbirth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">         <a href=\"/doc/161714697/\" id=\"a_38\">Sections 5(A)</a>, (B) and (C) of the 2013 Act have some\n\nrelevance and the same are extracted hereinbelow:-\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">         &quot;5A Discrimination           on   the      ground      of    sexual\n         orientation\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">         (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person (the\n         discriminator) discriminates against another person\n         (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the aggrieved\n         person’s sexual orientation if, by reason of:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">\f         (a)    the aggrieved person’s sexual orientation;

There are regional\nvariations in the use of terms referred to Hijras. For\nexample, Kinnars (Delhi) and Aravanis (Tamil Nadu).\nHijras may earn through their traditional work: ‘Badhai’\n(clapping their hands and asking for alms), blessing new-\nborn babies, or dancing in ceremonies.

One can\n      become a ‘Jogta’ (or Jogti) if it is part of their family\n      tradition or if one finds a ‘Guru’ (or ‘Pujari’) who accepts\n      him/her as a ‘Chela’ or ‘Shishya’ (disciple).

This term is used to differentiate them from\n      ‘Jogtas’ who are heterosexuals and who may or may not\n      dress in woman’s attire when they worship the Goddess.\n      Also, that term differentiates them from ‘Jogtis’ who are\n      biological females dedicated to the Goddess.

In a ceremony, Shiv-\n      Shakthis are married to a sword that represents male\n      power or Shiva (deity). Shiv-Shakthis thus become the\n      bride of the sword. Occasionally, Shiv-Shakthis cross-\n      dress and use accessories and ornaments that are\n      generally/socially meant for women.

Self-identified gender can be either male or female or a third\n\ngender. Hijras are identified as persons of third gender and are\n\nnot identified either as male or female. Gender identity, as already\n\nindicated, refers to a person’s internal sense of being male, female\n\nor a transgender, for example Hijras do not identify as female\n\nbecause of their lack of female genitalia or lack of reproductive\n\ncapability.    This distinction makes them separate from both male\n\nand female genders and they consider themselves neither man\n\nnor woman, but a &quot;third gender&quot;. Hijras, therefore, belong to a\n\ndistinct socio-religious and cultural group and have, therefore, to\n\nbe considered as a &quot;third gender&quot;, apart from male and female.\n\nState of Punjab has treated all TGs as male which is not legally\n\nsustainable.     State of Tamil Nadu has taken lot of welfare\n\nmeasures to safeguard the rights of TGs, which we have to\n\nacknowledge. Few States like Kerala, Tripura, Bihar have referred\n\nTGs as &quot;third gender or sex&quot;. Certain States recognize them as\n\n&quot;third category&quot;. Few benefits have also been extended by certain\n\nother States.

The homosexuals and third gender\n      people are also human beings as other men and\n      women are, and they are the citizens of this country as\n      well....   Thus, the people other than ‘men’ and\n      ‘women’, including the people of ‘third gender’ cannot\n      be discriminated. The State should recognize the\n      existence of all natural persons including the people of\n      third gender other than the men and women.

Many rights which flow from this choice also come\n\ninto play, inasmuch not giving them the status of a third gender\n\nresults in depriving the community of TGs of many of their valuable\n\nrights and privileges which other persons enjoy as citizens of this\n\nCountry. There is also deprivation of social and cultural\n\nparticipation which results into eclipsing their access to education\n\nand health services. Radhakrishnan,J. has exhaustively described\n\nthe term ‘Transgender’ as an umbrella term which embraces within\n\nitself a wide range of identities and experiences including but not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                     76</span>\n\flimited to pre-operative/post-operative trans sexual people who\n\nstrongly identify with the gender opposite to their biological sex i.e.\n\nmale/ female. Therein, the history of transgenders in India is also\n\ntraced and while doing so, there is mention of upon the draconian\n\nlegislation enacted during the British Rule, known as <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_129\">Criminal\n\nTribes Act, 1871</a> which treated, per se, the entire community of\n\nHizra persons as innately ‘criminals’, ‘addicted to the systematic\n\ncommission of non-bailable offences’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_170\">82.   With these introductory remarks, I revert to the two facets of\n\npivotal importance mentioned above. Before embarking on the\n\ndiscussion, I may clarify that my endeavour would be not to repeat\n\nthe discussion contained in the judgment of my Brother\n\nRadhakrishnan, J., as I agree with every word written therein.\n\nHowever, at times, if some of the observations are re-narrated,\n\nthat would be only with a view to bring continuity in the thought\n\nprocess.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">      (1)    Re: Right of a person to have the gender of his/her\n\nchoice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">      When a child is born, at the time of birth itself, sex is\n\nassigned to him/her. A child would be treated with that sex\n\nthereafter, i.e. either a male or a female. However, as explained in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                                                77</span>\n\n\ndetail in the accompanying judgment, some persons, though\n\nrelatively very small in number, may born with bodies which\n\nincorporate both or certain aspects of both male or female\n\nphysiology. It may also happen that though a person is born as a\n\nmale, because of some genital anatomy problems his innate\n\nperception may be that of a female and all his actions would be\n\nfemale oriented. The position may be exactly the opposite wherein\n\na person born as female may behave like a male person.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">83.   In    earlier   times   though    one   could   observe    such\n\ncharacteristics, at the same time the underlying rationale or reason\n\nbehind such a behavior was not known. Over a period of time, with\n\fin depth study and research of such physical and psychological\n\nfactors bevaviour, the causes of this behaviour have become\n\ndiscernable which in turn, has led to some changes in societal\n\nnorms. Society has starting accepting, though slowly, these have\n\naccepted the behavioral norms of such persons without treating it\n\nas abnormal. Further, medical science has leaped forward to such\n\nan extent that even physiology appearance of a person can be\n\nchanged through surgical procedures, from male to female and\n\nvice-versa. In this way, such persons are able to acquire the body\n\nwhich is in conformity with the perception of their gender/gender\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                                       78</span>\n\n\ncharacteristics. In order to ensure that law also keeps pace with\n\nthe aforesaid progress in medical science, various countries have\n\ncome out with Legislation conferring rights on such persons to\n\nrecognize their gender identity based on reassigned sex after\n\nundergoing    Sex   Re-Assignment      Surgery    (SRS).      Law     and\n\njudgments given by the courts in other countries have been\n\nexhaustively and grandiloquently traversed by my learned Brother\n\nin his judgment, discussing amongst others, the Yogyakarta\n\nprinciples, the relevant provisions of the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights 1948 and highlighting the statutory framework\n\noperating in those countries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">84.   The genesis of this recognition lies in the acknowledgment of\n\nanother fundamental and universal principal viz. &quot;right of choice&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">given to an individual which is the inseparable part of human\n\nrights. It is a matter of historical significance that the 20th Century\n\nis often described as &quot;the age of rights&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">85.   The most important lesson which was learnt as a result of\n\nSecond World War was the realization by the Governments of\n\nvarious countries about the human dignity which needed to be\n\ncherished and protected. It is for this reason that in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                 79</span>\n\n\nU.N.Charter, 1945, adopted immediately after the Second World\n\fWar, dignity of the individuals was mentioned as of core value. The\n\nalmost contemporaneous Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n(1948) echoed same sentiments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_177\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">86.   The underlined message in the aforesaid documents is the\n\nacknowledgment that human rights are individual and have a\n\ndefinite linkage of human development, both sharing common\n\nvision and with a common purpose. Respect for human rights is\n\nthe root for human development and realization of full potential of\n\neach individual, which in turn leads to the augmentation of human\n\nresources with progress of the nation. Empowerment of the people\n\nthrough human development is the aim of human rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">87.   There is thus a universal recognition that human rights are\n\nrights that &quot;belong&quot; to every person, and do not depend on the\n\nspecifics of the individual or the relationship between the right-\n\nholder and the right-grantor. Moreover, human rights exist\n\nirrespective of the question whether they are granted or\n\nrecognized by the legal and social system within which we live.\n\nThey are devices to evaluate these existing arrangements: ideally,\n\nthese arrangements should not violate human rights. In other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                                   80</span>\n\n\nwords, human rights are moral, pre-legal rights. They are not\n\ngranted by people nor can they be taken away by them.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">88.   In international human rights law, equality is found upon two\n\ncomplementary principles: non-discrimination and reasonable\n\ndifferentiation. The principle of non-discrimination seeks to ensure\n\nthat all persons can equally enjoy and exercise all their rights and\n\nfreedoms. Discrimination occurs due to arbitrary denial of\n\nopportunities for equal participation. For example, when public\n\nfacilities and services are set on standards out of the reach of the\n\nTGs, it leads to exclusion and denial of rights. Equality not only\n\nimplies preventing discrimination (example, the protection of\n\nindividuals against unfavourable treatment by introducing anti-\n\ndiscrimination laws), but goes beyond in remedying discrimination\n\fagainst groups suffering systematic discrimination in society. In\n\nconcrete terms, it means embracing the notion of positive rights,\n\naffirmative action and reasonable accommodation.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">89.   Nevertheless, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nrecognizes that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity\n\nand rights and, since the Covenant’s provisions apply fully to all\n\nmembers of society, persons with disabilities are clearly entitled to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                 81</span>\n\n\nthe full range of rights recognized in the Covenant. Moreover, the\n\nrequirement contained in <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 2</a> of the Covenant that the rights\n\nenunciated will be exercised without discrimination of any kind\n\nbased on certain specified grounds or other status clearly applies\n\nto cover persons with disabilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">90.   India attained independence within two years of adoption of\n\nthe aforesaid U.N.Charter and it was but natural that such a Bill of\n\nRights would assume prime importance insofar as thinking of the\n\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly goes. It in fact did and we\n\nfound chapter on fundamental rights in Part-III of the Constitution.\n\nIt is not necessary for me, keeping in view the topic of today’s\n\ndiscussion, to embark on detailed discussion on Chapter-III. Some\n\nof the provisions relevant for our purposes would be <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 14</a>,\n\n15,16 and 21 of the Constitution which have already been\n\nadverted to in detail in the accompanying judgment. At this\n\njuncture it also needs to be emphasized simultaneously is that in\n\naddition to the fundamental rights, Constitution makers also\n\ndeemed it proper to impose certain obligations on the State in the\n\nform of &quot;Directive Principles of State Policy&quot; (Part-IV) as a mark of\n\ngood governance. It is this part which provides an ideal and\n\npurpose to our Constitution and delineates certain principles which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                                                82</span>\n\n\nare fundamental in the governance of the country. Dr.Ambedkar\n\nhad explained the purpose of these Directive Principles in the\n\nfollowing manner (See Constituent Assembly debates):\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">                 &quot;The Directive Principles are like the\n\f          Instruments of Instructions which were\n          issued to the Governor-General and the\n          Governors of Colonies, and to those of India\n          by the British Government under the 1935\n          <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_132\">Government of India Act</a>. What is called\n          &quot;Directive Principles&quot; is merely another name\n          for the Instrument of Instructions. The only\n          difference is that they are instructions to the\n          legislature and the executive. Whoever\n          capture power will not be free to do what he\n          likes with it. In the exercise of it he will have\n          to respect these instruments of instructions\n          which are called Directive Principles&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_184\">91. The basic spirit of our Constitution is to provide each and\n\nevery person of the nation equal opportunity to grow as a human\n\nbeing, irrespective of race, caste, religion, community and social\n\nstatus. Granville Austin while analyzing the functioning of Indian\n\nConstitution in first 50 years ha described three distinguished\n\nstrands of Indian Constitution: (i)protecting national unity and\n\nintegrity, (ii)establishing the institution and spirit of democracy;\n\nand (iii) fostering social reforms. The Strands are mutually\n\ndependent, and inextricably intertwined in what he elegantly\n\ndescribes as &quot;a seamless web&quot;. And there cannot be social\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                                   83</span>\n\n\nreforms till it is ensured that each and every citizen of this country\n\nis able to exploit his/her potentials to the maximum. The\n\nConstitution, although drafted by the Constituent Assembly, was\n\nmeant for the people of India and that is why it is given by the\n\npeople to themselves as expressed in the opening words &quot;We the\n\nPeople&quot;. What is the most important gift to the common person\n\ngiven by this Constitution is &quot;fundamental rights&quot; which may be\n\ncalled Human Rights as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_185\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">92.

More than 225 years ago, Immanuel Kant propounded the\n\ndoctrine of free will, namely the free willing individual as a natural\n\nlaw ideal. Without going into the detail analysis of his aforesaid\n\ntheory of justice (as we are not concerned with the analysis of his\n\njurisprudence) what we want to point out is his emphasis on the\n\n&quot;freedom&quot; of human volition. The concepts of volition and freedom\n\nare &quot;pure&quot;, that is not drawn from experience. They are\n\nindependent of any particular body of moral or legal rules. They\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                                                       89</span>\n\n\nare presuppositions of all such rules, valid and necessary for all of\n\nthem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">101.     Over a period of time, two divergent interpretations of the\n\nKantian criterion of justice came to be discussed. One trend was\n\nan increasing stress on the maximum of individual freedom of\n\naction as the end of law. This may not be accepted and was\n\ncriticized by the protagonist of ‘hedonist utilitarianism’, notably\n\nBenthem. This school of thoughts laid emphasis on the welfare of\n\nthe society rather than an individual by propounding the principle\n\nof maximum of happiness to most of the people. Fortunately, in the\n\ninstant case, there is no such dichotomy between the individual\n\nfreedom/liberty we are discussing, as against public good. On the\n\ncontrary, granting the right to choose gender leads to public good.\n\nThe second tendency of Kantian criterion of justice was found in\n\nre-interpreting &quot;freedom&quot; in terms not merely of absence of\n\nrestraint but in terms of attainment of individual perfection. It is this\n\nlatter trend with which we are concerned in the present case and\n\nthis holds good even today. As pointed out above, after the\n\nSecond World War, in the form of U.N.Charter and thereafter there\n\fis more emphasis on the attainment of individual perfection. In that\n\nunited sense at least there is a revival of natural law theory of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                                       90</span>\n\n\njustice. Blackstone, in the opening pages in his              ‘Vattelian\n\nFashion’ said that the principal aim of society &quot;is to protect\n\nindividuals in the enjoyment of those absolute rights which were\n\nvested in them by the immutable laws of nature......&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">102. In fact, the recognition that every individual has fundamental\n\nright to achieve the fullest potential, is founded on the principle that\n\nall round growth of an individual leads to common public good.\n\nAfter all, human beings are also valuable asset of any country who\n\ncontribute to the growth and welfare of their nation and the society.\n\nA person who is born with a particular sex and his forced to grow\n\nup identifying with that sex, and not a sex that his/her\n\npsychological behavior identifies with, faces innumerable obstacles\n\nin growing up. In an article appeared in the magazine &quot;Eye&quot; of the\n\nSunday Indian Express (March 9-15, 2014) a person born as a boy\n\nbut with trappings of female ( who is now a female after SRS) has\n\nnarrated these difficulties in the following manner:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">           &quot;The other children treated me as a boy,\n           but I preferred playing with girls.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">           Unfortunately, grown-ups consider that\n           okay only as long as you are a small child.\n           The constant inner conflict made things\n           difficult for me and, as I grew up, I began to\n           dread social interactions&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                                                  91</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\">103.   Such a person, carrying dual entity simultaneously, would\n\nencounter mental and psychological difficulties which would hinder\n\nhis/her normal mental and even physical growth. It is not even\n\neasy for such a person to take a decision to undergo SRS\n\nprocedure which requires strong mental state of affairs. However,\n\nonce that is decided and the sex is changed in tune with\n\npsychological behavior, it facilitates spending the life smoothly.\n\nEven the process of transition is not smooth.   The transition from\n\na man to a woman is not an overnight process. It is a &quot;painfully&quot;\n\flong procedure that requires a lot of patience. A person must first\n\nundergo hormone therapy and, if possible, live as a member of the\n\ndesired sex for a while. To be eligible for hormone therapy, the\n\nperson needs at least two psychiatrists to certify that he or she is\n\nmentally sound, and schizophrenia, depression and transvestism\n\nhave to be ruled out first. The psychiatric evaluation involved a\n\nserious a questions on how Sunaina felt, when she got to know of\n\nher confusion and need for sex change, whether she is a recluse,\n\nher socio-economic condition, among other things.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">104.

If a person has changed his/her sex in tune with his/her\n\ngender characteristics and perception ,which has become possible\n\nbecause of the advancement in medical science, and when that is\n\npermitted by in medical ethics with no legal embargo, we do not\n\nfind any impediment, legal or otherwise, in giving due recognition\n\nto the gender identity based on the reassign sex after undergoing\n\nSRS.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                    93</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_221\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_222\">\f106.

At the outset, it may be clarified that the term ‘transgender’\n\nis used in a wider sense, in the present age. Even Gay, Lesbian,\n\nbisexual      are   included    by    the   descriptor   ‘transgender’.\n\nEtymologically, the term ‘transgender’ is derived from two words,\n\nnamely ‘trans’ and ‘gender’. Former is a Latin word which means\n\n‘across’ or ‘beyond’. The grammatical meaning of ‘transgender’,\n\ntherefore, is across or beyond gender. This has come to be known\n\nas umbrella term which includes Gay men, Lesbians, bisexuals,\n\nand cross dressers within its scope. However, while dealing with\n\nthe present issue we are not concerned with this aforesaid wider\n\nmeaning of the expression transgender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_226\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_227\">108.       It is to be emphasized that Transgender in India have\n\nassumed distinct and separate class/category which is not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                                   94</span>\n\n\nprevalent in other parts of the World except in some neighbouring\n\ncountries . In this country, TG community comprise of Hijaras,\n\nenunch, Kothis, Aravanis, Jogappas, Shiv-Shakthis etc. In Indian\n\ncommunity transgender are referred as Hizra or the third gendered\n\npeople. There exists wide range of transgender-related identities,\n\ncultures, or experience -including Hijras, Aravanis, Kothis,\n\njogtas/Jogappas, and Shiv-Shakthis (Hijras: They are biological\n\nmales who reject their masculinity identity in due course of time to\n\nidentify either as women, or ‘not men’. Aravanis: Hijras in Tamil\n\nNadu identify as ‘Aravani’. Kothi: Kothis are heterogeneous group.\n\nKothis can be described as biological males who show varying\n\ndegrees of ‘feminity’. Jogtas/Jogappas: They are those who are\n\ndedicated to serve as servant of Goddess Renukha Devi whose\n\ftemples are present in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Sometimes,\n\nJogti Hijras are used to denote such male-to-female transgender\n\npersons who are devotees of Goddess Renukha and are also from\n\nthe Hijra community. Shiv-Shakthis: They are considered as males\n\nwho are possessed by or particularly close to a goddess and who\n\nhave feminine gender expression). The way they behave and acts\n\ndiffers from the normative gender role of a men and women.

This     dogmatism        and\nindoctrination   of   Indian   people       with   aforesaid\npresumption, was totally capricious and nefarious. There\n\fcould not have been more harm caused to this\ncommunity with the passing of the aforesaid brutal\nLegislation during British Regime with the vicious and\nsavage this mind set. To add insult to the irreparable\ninjury caused, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code\nwas misused and abused as there was a tendency, in\nBritish period, to arrest and prosecute TG persons under\nSection 377 merely on suspicion.

We are of the firm opinion that by recognizing such TGs as\n\nthird gender, they would be able to enjoy their human rights, to\n\nwhich they are largely deprived of for want of this recognition. As\n\nmentioned above, the issue of transgender is not merely a social\n\nor medical issue but there is a need to adopt human right\n\napproach towards transgenders which may focus on functioning as\n\nan interaction between a person and their environment highlighting\n\nthe role of society and changing the stigma attached to them. TGs\n\nface many disadvantages due to various reasons, particularly for\n\ngender abnormality which in certain level needs to physical and\n\nmental disability. Up till recently they were subjected to cruelty, pity\n\nor charity. Fortunately, there is a paradigm shift in thinking from the\n\naforesaid approach to a rights based approach. Though, this may\n\nbe the thinking of human rights activist, the society has not kept\n\npace with this shift. There appears to be limited public knowledge\n\nand understanding of same-sex sexual orientation and people\n\nwhose gender identity and expression are incongruent with their\n\nbiological sex. As a result of this approach, such persons are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                 98</span>\n\fsocially excluded from the mainstream of the society and they are\n\ndenied equal access to those fundamental rights and freedoms\n\nthat the other people enjoy freely.(See, Hijras/Transgender\n\nWomen in India: HIV, Human Rights and Social Exclusion, UNDP\n\nreport on India Issue: December, 2010).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_233\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">112.     Some of the common and reported problem that\n\ntransgender most commonly suffer are: harassment by the police\n\nin public places, harassment at home, police entrapment, rape,\n\ndiscriminations, abuse in public places et.al.   The other major\n\nproblems that the transgender people face in their daily life are\n\ndiscrimination, lack of educational facilities, lack of medical\n\nfacilities, homelessness, unemployment, depression, hormone pill\n\nabuse, tobacco and alcohol abuse, and problems related to\n\nmarriage and adoption. In spite of the adoption of Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in the year 1948, the\n\ninherent dignity, equality, respect and rights of all human beings\n\nthroughout the world, the transgender are denied basic human\n\nrights. This denial is premised on a prevalent juridical assumption\n\nthat the law should target discrimination based on sex (i.e.,\n\nwhether a person is    anatomically male or female), rather than\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                    99</span>\n\n\ngender (i.e., whether a person has qualities that society consider\n\nmasculine or feminine (Katherine M.Franke, The Central Mistake\n\nof Sex Discrimination Law: the Disaggregation of Sex from\n\nGender, 144 U.Pa.Rev.1,3 (1995) (arguing that by defining sex in\n\nbiological terms, the law has failed to distinguish sex from gender,\n\nand sexual differentiation from sex discrimination). Transgender\n\npeople are generally excluded from the society and people think\n\ntransgenderism as a medical disease. Much like the disability,\n\nwhich in earlier times was considered as an illness but later on\n\nlooked upon as a right based approach. The question whether\n\ntransgenderism is a disease is hotly debated in both the\n\ntransgender and medical-psychiatric communities. But a prevalent\n\nview regarding this is that transgenderism is not a disease at all,\n\fbut a benign normal variant of the human experience akin to left-\n\nhandedness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_235\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_236\">113.    Therefore, gender identification becomes very essential\n\ncomponent which is required for enjoying civil rights by this\n\ncommunity. It is only with this recognition that many rights attached\n\nto the sexual recognition as ‘third gender’ would be available to\n\nthis community more meaningfully viz. the right to vote, the right to\n\nown property, the right to marry, the right to claim a formal identity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                                   100</span>\n\n\nthrough a passport and a ration card, a driver’s license, the right to\n\neducation, employment, health so on.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_237\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_238\">114.    Further, there seems to be no reason why a transgender\n\nmust be denied of basic human rights which includes Right to life\n\nand liberty with dignity, Right to Privacy and freedom of\n\nexpression, Right to Education and Empowerment, Right against\n\nviolence,     Right    against    Exploitation    and    Right    against\n\nDiscrimination. Constitution has fulfilled its duty of providing rights\n\nto transgenders.      Now it’s time for us to recognize this and to\n\nextend and interpret the Constitution in such a manner to ensure a\n\ndignified life of transgender people. All this can be achieved if the\n\nbeginning is made with the recognition that TG as third gender.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_239\">115.   In order to translate the aforesaid rights of TGs into reality,\n\nit becomes imperative to first assign them their proper ‘sex’. As is\n\nstated earlier, at the time of birth of a child itself, sex is assigned.\n\nHowever, it is either male or female. In the process, the society as\n\nwell as law, has completely ignored the basic human right of TGs\n\nto give them their appropriate sex categorization. Up to now, they\n\nhave either been treated as male or female.

Though there may not be any statutory regime recognizing\n\f‘third gender’ for these TGs. However, we find enough justification\n\nto recognize this right of theirs in natural law sphere. Further, such\n\na justification can be traced to the various provisions contained in\n\nPart III of the Constitution relating to ‘Fundamental Rights’. In\n\naddition to the powerful        justification accomplished in the\n\naccompanying opinion of my esteemed Brother, additional raison\n\nd’etre for this conclusion is stated hereinafter.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">117.    We are in the age of democracy, that too substantive and\n\nliberal democracy. Such a democracy is not based solely on the\n\nrule of people through their representatives’ namely formal\n\ndemocracy. It also has other percepts like Rule of Law, human\n\nrights, independence of judiciary, separation of powers etc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">118.     There is a recognition to the hard realty that without\n\nprotection for human rights there can be no democracy and no\n\njustification for democracy. In this scenario, while working within\n\nthe realm of separation of powers (which is also fundamental to\n\nthe substantive democracy), the judicial role is not only to decide\n\nthe dispute before the Court, but to uphold the rule of law and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                                                    102</span>\n\n\nensure access to justice to the marginalized section of the society.\n\nIt cannot be denied that TGs belong to the unprivileged class\n\nwhich is a marginalized section.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_244\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_245\">119. The role of the Court is to understand the central purpose\n\nand theme of the Constitution for the welfare of the society. Our\n\nConstitution, like the law of the society, is a living organism. It is\n\nbased on a factual and social realty that is constantly changing.\n\nSometimes a change in the law precedes societal change and is\n\neven intended to stimulate it. Sometimes, a change in the law is\n\nthe result in the social realty. When we discuss about the rights of\n\nTGs in the constitutional context, we find that in order to bring\n\nabout complete paradigm shift, law has to play more pre-dominant\n\nrole. As TGs in India, are neither male nor female, treating them as\n\nbelonging to either of the aforesaid categories, is the denial of\n\fthese constitutional rights. It is the denial of social justice which in\n\nturn has the effect of denying political and economic justice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">120. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"417020\" id=\"span_136\">In <a href=\"/doc/417020/\" id=\"a_162\">Dattatraya Govind Mahajan vs. State of Maharashtra</a>\n\n(AIR 1977 SC 915) this Court observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">                  &quot;Our Constitution is a tryst with\n           destiny, preamble with luscent solemnity in\n           the words ‘Justice - social, economic and\n           political.’ The three great branches of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                                    103</span>\n\n\n           Government,        as     creatures    of    the\n           Constitution, must remember this promise in\n           their fundamental role and forget it at their\n           peril, for to do so will be a betrayal of chose\n           high values and goals which this nation set\n           for itself in its objective Resolution and\n           whose elaborate summation appears in Part\n           IV of the Paramount Parchment. The history\n           of our country’s struggle for independence\n           was the story of a battle between the forces\n           of socio-economic exploitation and the\n           masses of deprived people of varying\n           degrees and the Constitution sets the new\n           sights of the nation.....Once we grasp the\n           dharma of the Constitution, the new\n           orientation of the karma of adjudication\n           becomes clear. Our founding fathers, aware\n           of our social realities, forged our fighting\n           faith and integrating justice in its social,\n           economic and political aspects. While\n           contemplating the meaning of the Articles of\n           the Organic Law, the Supreme Court shall\n           not disown Social Justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_247\">121.    Oliver Wendlle Holmes said: &quot;the life of law has been\n\nlogical; it has been experience&quot;. It may be added that ‘the life of\n\nlaw is not just logic or experience. The life of law is renewable\n\nbased on experience and logic, which adapted law to the new\n\nsocial realty’. Recognizing this fact, the aforesaid provisions of the\n\nConstitution are required to be given new and dynamic meaning\n\nwith the inclusion of rights of TGs as well. In this process, the first\n\nand foremost right is to recognize TGs as ‘third gender’ in law as\n\nwell. This is a recognition of their right of equality enshrined in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                                 104</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_163\">Art.14</a> as well as their human right to life with dignity, which is the\n\nmandate of the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_164\">Art.21</a> of the Constitution. This interpretation is in\n\nconsonance with new social needs. By doing so, this Court is only\n\nbridging the gap between the law and life and that is the primary\n\frole of the Court in a democracy. It only amounts to giving\n\npurposive interpretation to the aforesaid provisions of the\n\nConstitution so that it can adapt to the changes in realty. Law\n\nwithout purpose has no raison d’etre. The purpose of law is the\n\nevolution of a happy society. As Justice Iyer has aptly put:\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_248\">            &quot;The     purpose       of   law     is    the\n           establishment of the welfare of society\n           &quot;and a society whose members enjoy\n           welfare and happiness may be\n           described as a just society. It is a\n           negation of justice to say that some\n           members,        some       groups,       some\n           minorities, some individuals do not have\n           welfare: on the other hand they suffer\n           from ill-fare. So it is axiomatic that law, if\n           it is to fulfil itself, must produce a\n           contented, dynamic society which is at\n           once meting out justice to its members.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_249\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_250\">122.

As we have pointed out above, our Constitution inheres\n\nliberal and substantive democracy with rule of law as an important\n\nand fundamental pillar. It has its own internal morality based on\n\ndignity and equality of all human beings. Rule of law demands\n\nprotection of individual human rights.      Such rights are to be\n\nguaranteed to each and every human being. These TGs, even\n\nthough insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and\n\ntherefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">124.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"767216\" id=\"span_140\">In <a href=\"/doc/767216/\" id=\"a_165\">National Human Rights Commission vs. State of\n\nArunachal Pradesh</a> (AIR 1996 SC 1234), This Court observed:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">                 &quot;We are a country governed by the\n           Rule of Law.

Social life, however, is not a goal in itself but a\n\nmeans to allow the individual to life in dignity and development\n\nhimself. The human being and human rights underlie this\n\nsubstantive perception of the rule of law, with a proper balance\n\namong the different rights and between human rights and the\n\nproper needs of society. The substantive rule of law &quot;is the rule of\n\nproper law, which balances the needs of society and the\n\nindividual.&quot; This is the rule of law that strikes a balance between\n\nsociety’s need for political independence, social equality, economic\n\ndevelopment, and internal order, on the one hand, and the needs\n\nof the individual, his personal liberty, and his human dignity on the\n\nother. It is the duty of the Court to protect this rich concept of the\n\nrule of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_255\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_256\">126.    By recognizing TGs as third gender, this Court is not only\n\nupholding the rule of law but also advancing justice to the class, so\n\nfar deprived of their legitimate natural and constitutional rights. It\n\nis, therefore, the only just solution which ensures justice not only to\n\nTGs but also justice to the society as well. Social justice does not\n\nmean equality before law in papers but to translate the spirit of the\n\nConstitution, enshrined in the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights\n\nand the Directive Principles of State Policy into action, whose arms\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                                                   107</span>\n\n\nare long enough to bring within its reach and embrace this right of\n\nrecognition to the TGs which legitimately belongs to them.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_257\">127.    Aristotle opined that treating all equal things equal and all\n\nunequal things unequal amounts to justice. Kant was of the view\n\nthat at the basis of all conceptions of justice, no matter which\n\nculture or religion has inspired them, lies the golden rule that you\n\fshould treat others as you would want everybody to treat\n\neverybody else, including yourself. When Locke conceived of\n\nindividual liberties, the individuals he had in mind were\n\nindependently rich males. Similarly, Kant thought of economically\n\nself-sufficient males as the only possible citizens of a liberal\n\ndemocratic state. These theories may not be relevant in today’s\n\ncontext as it is perceived that the bias of their perspective is all too\n\nobvious to us. In post-traditional liberal democratic theories of\n\njustice, the background assumption is that humans have equal\n\nvalue and should, therefore, be treated as equal, as well as by\n\nequal laws. This can be described as ‘Reflective Equilibrium’. The\n\nmethod of Reflective Equilibrium was first introduced by Nelson\n\nGoodman in ‘Fact, Fiction and Forecast’ (1955). However, it is\n\nJohn Rawls who elaborated this method of Reflective Equilibrium\n\nby introducing the conception of ‘Justice as Fairness’. In his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                                   108</span>\n\n\n‘Theory of Justice’, Rawls has proposed a model of just institutions\n\nfor democratic societies. Herein he draws on certain pre-\n\ntheoretical elementary moral beliefs (‘considered judgments’),\n\nwhich he assumes most members of democratic societies would\n\naccept. &quot;[Justice as fairness [....] tries to draw solely upon basic\n\nintuitive ideas that are embedded in the political institutions of a\n\nconstitutional democratic regime and the public traditions of their\n\ninterpretations. Justice as fairness is a political conception in part\n\nbecause it starts from within a certain political tradition. Based on\n\nthis preliminary understanding of just institutions in a democratic\n\nsociety, Rawls aims at a set of universalistic rules with the help of\n\nwhich the justice of present formal and informal institutions can be\n\nassessed. The ensuing conception of justice is called ‘justice as\n\nfairness’.   When we combine Rawls’s notion of Justice as\n\nFairness with the notions of Distributive Justice, to which Noble\n\nLaureate Prof. Amartya Sen has also subscribed, we get\n\njurisprudential basis for doing justice to the Vulnerable Groups\n\nwhich definitely include TGs. Once it is accepted that the TGs are\n\nalso part of vulnerable groups and marginalized section of the\n\fsociety, we are only bringing them within the fold of aforesaid\n\nrights recognized in respect of other classes falling in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                                                                       109</span>\n\n\nmarginalized group. This is the minimum riposte in an attempt to\n\nassuage the          insult and injury suffered by them so far as to\n\npave way for fast tracking the realization of their human rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_258\">128.
