Muralidhar, J.:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Introduction\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">1. The Petitioner came to this Court on 25th November 2017 with this writ\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of\nhabeas corpus for the release of his 71 year old father, Mr. Ram Kumar @\nRam Kanwar (Respondent No.4), from illegal detention at the Institute of\nHuman Behaviour and Allied Sciences (‗IHBAS&#x27;) (Respondent No.3) at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                         Page 1 of 87</span>\n Shahdara, Delhi.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2. In the course of the hearing of this petition on 25 th November 2017, it\ntranspired that, on 3rd November 2017, pursuant to the order of the Judge of\nthe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) -2, Rohini, an Assistant Sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">inspector (ASI) attached to the Police Post (PP) at the Rohini District Court\ntook Respondent No.4 in custody for medical check up to the nearby Baba\nSaheb Ambedkar (BSA) Hospital. Subsequently pursuant to a ‗reception\norder&#x27; passed by the Duty Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) at Rohini,\nRespondent No.4 was, unbeknownst to his family, taken away to IHBAS for\nobservation for two days. His unlawful detention at IHBAS was continued\nby orders dated 5th November of the Duty MM and 20th November 2017 of\nthe MM at Rohini.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3. On 25th November 2017, after hearing counsel for the parties i.e. the State\n(Respondents 1 and 2) and IHBAS, this Court directed the immediate\nrelease of Respondent No.4 after finding his detention to be illegal and\nunconstitutional. The Court on a prima facie examination of the record of\nIHBAS and the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/185191195/\" id=\"a_2\">Mental Health Act, 1987</a> (MHA) set aside\nthe orders dated 3rd, 5th and 20th November 2017. The writ petition was\nnevertheless retained on board for consideration of the constitutional and\nlegal issues that arose, after the reply of IHBAS to the petition was received.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4. In the judgment that follows the Court first discusses the background facts\nand the circumstances under which Respondent No.4 landed up at IHBAS\nand remained there till 25th November 2017. The second part sets out the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 2 of 87</span>\n defence of IHBAS and its doctors. The affidavit of ASI Krishan Kumar is\nalso discussed. In the third part, the Court then discusses the illegalities that\nhave taken place. The Court concludes that there have been egregious\nviolations of the rights to personal liberty and dignity of Respondent No.4\nparticularly in light of the provisions of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">5. Although in this case, there was no occasion to invoke MHA and order\nthe detention thereunder of Respondent No.4, since IHBAS has pleaded\n‗bonafide confusion&#x27; about the orders passed by the Duty MM and MM, the\nCourt has, in the fourth part, undertaken a detailed analysis of <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 23</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/132616426/\" id=\"a_4\">24</a> and <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_5\">28</a> of the MHA. The Court has traced the development of the mental\nhealth law internationally and domestically. This includes discussion of the\nrelevant provisions of the Convention on the Rights of People with\nDisabilities (CRPD), ratified by India. Decisions in other jurisdictions and\nthe ‗best interest&#x27; principle in treatment and care of mental illness are also\ndiscussed in this part.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">6. The fifth part of the judgment summarises the legal position under the\nMHA. The sixth part traces the numerous instances where there has been an\nabuse of the powers under the mental health law in this country i.e. under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/128750983/\" id=\"a_6\">Indian Lunacy Act</a> 1912 (ILA) and later the MHA. This emphasises the\nneed to view the mental health law as essentially concerning the right to\ntreatment and care of persons with mental illness whilst respecting their\nrights to liberty and dignity and need for autonomy in respect of decisions\nconcerning themselves. It calls for a complete dismantling of the penal\ncustodial model of mental health care. The seventh part of the judgment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                                Page 3 of 87</span>\n recapitulates the illegalities committed in the present case, an afterword, the\nscope of the habeas corpus jurisdiction and the consequential directions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">                                    I\nBackground facts\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">7.    The Petitioner and Respondent No.4 are defending MACP No.\n4277/2016 before the MACT in the Rohini Courts, Delhi. This is a claim\nfiled originally in 2008, arising from road accident that happened in 2007.\nThe accident involved a mini bus owned by Respondent No.4 which at the\nrelevant time was being driven by the Petitioner. Exhausted perhaps of their\nresources in engaging lawyers to represent them, Respondent No.4 has, for\nsome years now, been appearing in person. He is Respondent No.2 and his\nson, the Petitioner herein, is Respondent No.1in the said claim petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">8. The documents show that on 5th July 2017 the above case was listed\nbefore the MACT. When it was called out in the forenoon, Respondent No.4\nwas not present. The MACT gave the claimant before it a last and final\nopportunity to ―conclude his entire evidence on the next date‖ and adjourned\nthe case to 3rd November 2017. It appears that subsequently on the same\nday, when some other case was going on before the MACT, Respondent\nNo.4 appeared at around 3.15 pm. In an order passed at that time the MACT\nnoted that Respondent No.4 entered the court room and ―started creating a\nscene.‖ The order noted that he had ―failed to maintain the decorum of the\ncourt and has used untoward language about my Ld. Predecessor and has\nalso shown disrespect to the Chair‖. Further, despite the Presiding Officer\napprising him of the order passed in the forenoon and asking him to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 4 of 87</span>\n maintain the decorum ―he did not desist from using foul language and\nshouted for quite some time and ultimately he left away from the court\nroom‖. The order further noted ―Considering the age of the aforesaid person\nand his mental state of mind, no adverse order is being passed against him\nthis time in the interest of justice‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">9. On 3rd November 2017 when the case was heard before the MACT an\naltercation took place between Respondent No.4 and the lawyers for the\nopposite parties. Respondent No.4 is alleged to have created a &#x27;ruckus&#x27;. The\norder passed by the Judge, MACT in the case noted that Respondent No.4\nhad ―started shouting in the court room‖ and had used ―unparliamentary\nlanguage.‖ Despite persuasion, he continued in the same vein. The judge\nnoted that he had displayed similar conduct earlier. The judge then noted in\nthe order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       ―Considering the fact that respondent No.2 is not represented by any\n       counsel, it would be appropriate that he is provided counsel from the\n       DSLSA, North in order to represent him in this case. The aforesaid\n       conduct of respondent No.2 is also directed to be brought to the\n       notice of the Incharge PP, Rohini Court through Naib Court\n       attached with the Claims Tribunal. Information be given to the\n       Office Bearers of Rohini Bar Association in this regard.‖ (emphasis\n       supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">10. As a result, the naib Court (the name used for the police officer attached\nto the Court) went to give the information to the PP at the Rohini Court\ncomplex. ASI Krishan Kumar, who was attached to Police Station (PS)\nPrashant Vihar, and was at the time at the PP, states in an affidavit dated 14th\nDecember 2017 filed in this petition, that the naib Court informed him at\n11.15 am that an ‗abusive quarrel&#x27; was going on in the Court. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 5 of 87</span>\n information was noted down as Daily Dairy (DD) No. 18 PP. ASI Krishan\nKumar along with Constable (Ct.) Maya Ram went to the MACT and found\nRespondent No.4 ―using abusive language and creating nuisance in the\ncourt.‖ Respondent No.4 was then taken by ASI Krishan Kumar and Ct.\nMaya Ram to the BSA Hospital, Rohini for medical examination.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">11. The judge MACT again took up the matter ―on the request of counsel for\nthe parties.‖ The judge noted in the further order inter alia that the Secretary\nand other office bearers of the Rohini Bar Association ―have been apprised\nabout the conduct displayed by respondent No.2 as well as the proceedings\nof the present matter.‖ At 3.30 pm on 3 rd November 2017, the Judge,\nMACT-2 passed a further order in which he noted: ―It is informed by Naib\nCourt that police official has taken respondent no. 2 to some government\nhospital for his medical examination.‖ The orders passed on the subsequent\ndates in the claim petition before the MACT, i.e. 12th January 2018 and 6th\nApril 2018 do not show that the Judge, MACT made any effort to find out\nwhat had happened to Respondent No.4 after he was taken for the medical\nexamination to the BSA Hospital on 3rd November 2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">At the BSA Hospital, Rohini\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">12. What transpired at the BSA Hospital is spoken to by ASI Krishan Kumar\nin his affidavit dated 14th December 2017. The medico-legal certificate\n(‗MLC&#x27;) prepared there is in the form of an ―Emergency Registry Card‖\n(‗ERC&#x27;). It shows that Dr. Himanshu Bhatheja, MD, General Medicine,\nSenior Resident (‗SR&#x27;) at the BSA Hospital first saw Respondent No.4 at\n2.25 pm on 3rd November 2017. He noted that the Respondent No.4 was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 6 of 87</span>\n ―complaining irrelevant, sometimes abusive giving H/o stent in coronary\nartery in Apollo hospital but showing no documents‖. The said SR did not\nfind anything abnormal but still referred Respondent No.4 to the Medical\nSR/Psychiatrist for further medical examination and opinion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">13. The ERC further shows that at 2.50 pm, Respondent No.4 was examined\nby Dr. Ashutosh Dash, SR. Under a caption titled ―Mental State\nExamination‖, Dr. Dash noted that ―no psychopathology‖ was detected.\nFurther, he noted that ―no thought or perceptual disturbances‖ were noticed.\nHe further noted that Respondent No.4&#x27;s attention and concentration were\nnot maintained during the interview. It appears that in his own hand,\nRespondent No.4 wrote on the side of the above notes: ―I am under\ntreatment of Dr. K. K. Saxena, Indraprastha Hospital. Refused admission in\nBSAH‖. Respondent No.4 also signed with the date of 3 rd November 2017.\nThe other notes on the ECR read: ―patient repeatedly reluctant to go\nMedicine SR/ECG for further MX‖; ―on the cross sectional examination the\npatient is not showing any problems for memory, thought disturbances‖; ―no\npast history of any psychiatric illness‖. It appears that Respondent No.4 was\nkept at the BSA hospital till 5.45 pm. There is a further noting of Dr. Dash\nwhich reads: ―Referred to IHBAS for 24 hr observation.‖\n\nBefore the Duty MM\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">14. Thereafter, ASI Krishan Kumar and Ct. Maya Ram brought Respondent\nNo.4 back to the Rohini District Courts Complex. However, the Court had\nclosed for the day. As a result, Respondent No.4 had to be taken to a duty\nMM. Since the Duty MM was residing in the Trans-Yamuna area,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                            Page 7 of 87</span>\n Respondent No.4 could be produced there only at around 9 pm on 3rd\nNovember 2017. ASI Krishan Kumar presented an application before the\nDuty MM praying for an order to the effect that Respondent No.4 should be\nsent to IHBAS. No provision of any law was cited in this application. The\norder passed by the learned Duty MM reads as under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       ―DD No.18PP PV Dated 03.11.2017\n       PS Prashant Vihar\n       03/11/2017\n\n       At my home at 09.30 pm\n\n       Pr: Person Ram Kumar with ASI Krishan Kumar\n\n       A person Ram Kumar has been produced before me today at\n       my home by ASI Krishan Kumar.

He is unable to\n       give any coherent answers and seems to be potentially violent.\n       His whereabouts and family is also not ascertainable for (sic\n       from) questioning him. He has a very threatening attitude\n       towards everyone. Hence, I deem it fit to allow this application.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">       I hereby pass reception order WRT patient Ram Kumar. He be\n       kept under observation in IBHAs for 24 hours. Be produced\n       before DMM on 5th November 2017. IBHAS to send their\n       report in this regard.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">15. At this stage, none of the family members of Respondent No.4 had been\ninformed by ASI Krishan Kumar that he had been detained in the manner\ndescribed above and was being produced before the Duty MM. ASI Krishan\nKumar, in his affidavit dated 14th December 2017, states that he came to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 8 of 87</span>\n know the name and address of the person whom he had detained as Mr. Ram\nKumar along with his father&#x27;s name and residential address. However, ASI\nKrishan Kumar does not state when or at what time he came to know these\ndetails. He simply states that he came to know ―later on‖. It has been pointed\nout by counsel for the Petitioner that Respondent No.4 was carrying with\nhim his mobile phone and it would not have been difficult at all to ascertain\nthe contact numbers of his family members. Yet, neither ASI Krishan\nKumar nor even the Duty MM considered it necessary to ensure that the\nfamily members of Respondent No.4 were informed of his detention. There\nwas no lawyer representing Respondent No.4 before the Duty MM. The\nabove ‗reception order&#x27; was passed without referring to any law, much less\nthe MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">16. 4th November 2017, a Saturday, was a Court holiday on account of Guru\nNanak&#x27;s birthday. Therefore, the Duty MM fixed the next returnable date as\n5th November 2017, which was a Sunday.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">First three days at IHBAS\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">17. The notes on the file of IHBAS show that Respondent No.4 arrived there\nat 10.05 pm accompanied by ASI Krishan Kumar. The file noting shows that\nRespondent No.4 was carrying a bag containing case papers which he\nrefused to show to anyone and the ASI refused to take custody of. It was\nnoted that there was no known history or reliable information available. The\nabove notes were prepared by Dr. Prabhleen Singh Jaggi, SR Psychiatry. He\nnoted that the patient was well groomed and wearing a suit. His nails were\nstained and unkempt, and it was noted that he talked about various cases that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 9 of 87</span>\n he is involved in and wants to defend himself. It was specifically mentioned\nthat he said ―I want to root out corruption‖. It was further noted ―Imp-\nPsychosis to be specified‖. The treatment advice was ―Admit in SOF for\nobservation‖. [SOF translates as Short Observation Facility]. The ERC was\nprepared on that day itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">18. At 11 pm on 3rd November 2017, it was noted by Dr. Jaggi that ―the\npatient is refusing to go to bed. However, appears drowsy. Vitals stable‖. At\n8.40 am on 4th November 2017, the noting reads: ―Patient seen and\nexamined. Psychopathology maintained. Vitals stable‖. Dr. Jaggi saw\nRespondent No.4 at 8.30 am on 4th November 2017. He noted: ―Pt seen and\nexamined. Psychopathology maintained. Vitals stable.‖\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">19. Dr. Sartaj Deepak, SR Psychiatry at IHBAS, saw Respondent No.4 next\nat 4 pm on 4th November 2017. His noting reads: ―over intrusiveness;\npressured speech, grandiose ideas‖. He noted ―it has been decided to request\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Court to pass reception order under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 28</a> as the patient\nneeds admission for further observation and management. Not allowing for\nblood sampling and oral medication‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">20. The noting at 7 pm by Dr. Kirti Sharma, SR Psychiatry was to the effect,\n―Ward behaviour: adamant behaviour; intrusiveness; uncooperative with\nhospital staff; patient refuses to sit on bed, says that he will sit and sleep on\nsettee which is for the patient&#x27;s attendant as he is not a patient‖. The other\nobservations are that he was appropriately dressed, had an irritable affect\nand grandiose ideas, impaired judgment and absent insight.

There are two entries made by Dr. Kirti Sharma on the morning of 5th\nNovember 2017. First, in the ERC at 8 am she notes, ―Patient requires\nadmission for detailed admission and evaluation. It is requested to the\nHon&#x27;ble Court that an appropriate reception order under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 28</a> of\nMHA, 1987 may be passed for the same‖. The entry at 8.30 am in the\nfollow-up sheet is: ―patient woke up early, got dressed in his black suit and\ndemanded to be sent home. He is repeatedly asking to call the police\npersonnel who were with him so that he can be taken to Court where he\nwould fight his case. Escaping tendency. Not cooperating for treatment or\nfor investigations or checking of vitals‖. The advice noted was ―Keep in\nSOF until appropriate Court orders obtained; 24 hour security guard to be\nposted on patient; continue ward observation; Serial MSE; inform SOS‖.\nThere is a noting of 4 pm on the same date about ASI Krishan Kumar having\ncome to take the patient Ram Kumar to be produced in Court and about the\npatient having been handed over to ASI Krishan Kumar ―after taking the\nreceiving for the same‖. However, this note appears to have been later\nscored off.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">Again before the Duty MM\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">22. On 5th November 2017, Respondent No.4 was produced before the Duty\nMM since it was a Sunday. The following order was passed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       ―ASI Krishan in person along with patient namely Ram Kumar\n       who is produced form IBHAS referred by Dr. Kirti Sharma,\n       Senior Resident Psychiatry, IHBAS Delhi along with his two\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                            Page 11 of 87</span>\n        sons namely Ravinder and Rajiv and one daughter namely Smt.\n       Renu.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       I perused the report of patient Ram Kumar.

Yet, the MM had no interaction with them. No\nlawyer represented Respondent No.4 even on this date. The order simply\nstated that the patient required admission for detailed assessment and\nevaluation. A direction was given to IHBAS to ‗admit&#x27; Respondent No.4 to\na mental health institution and yet there was no reference by the MM to the\nMHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">24. The returnable date given by learned duty MM was 20th November 2017,\ni.e. detention of Mr. Ram Kumar was extended for a further period of 15\ndays. This was contrary to <a href=\"/doc/189757541/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 28 (2)</a> of the MHA which mandates that\nno detention thereunder can exceed 10 days at a time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">Back at IHBAS: 6th November 2017\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">25. From 6th November 2017 onwards, the family members (‗FMs&#x27;) of\nRespondent No.4 were at IHBAS trying their best to get him released from\nthere. The next noting in the file maintained for Respondent No. 4 at IHBAS\nis at 8 am on 6th November 2017. It reads: ―Patient is sometime authoritative\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                            Page 12 of 87</span>\n and hostile but becomes cooperative with defining boundaries. No\npsychopathology detected. No disruptive behaviour in the ward‖. The\nfurther noting at 8 am on that day was: ―Prepare for discharge as f/m (family\nmembers) are unwilling for any intervention but as Court order was\nreceived, patient was kept in SOF‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">26. At 10.30 am on 6th November 2017, Respondent No.4 was seen by\nanother doctor who noted inter alia ―Pt &amp; f/m are unwilling for admission‖.\nFurther, the patient was uncooperative for any investigation and taking any\nmedicines. It was also noted that the patient refused evaluation for heart\npathology and insisted on continuing his heart treatment from Apollo\nhospital. The noting by the same doctor at 6 pm on that day was that: ―Pt.\n&amp;f/m refusing for admission‖ and that the patient repeated that ―he will only\nlisten to Court‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">At IHBAS: 7th November 2017\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">27. The next noting in the IHBAS file is at 3.30 am on 7th November 2017.\nIt inter alia reads: ―Plan - to continue monitoring his behaviour; FM&#x27;s are\nnot willing to stay at IHBAS and want to get patient&#x27;s treatment from Apollo\nhospital‖. It was further noted, ―As discussed in evening rounds, Court letter\nto be sent by the treating team‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">28. There are detailed notes at 10 am on 7th November 2017 of Dr. Pravesh\nSR. Importantly, it notes that Respondent No.4 had been having cardiac\nproblems and had been taking medicines from Apollo hospital. He insisted\non being produced before the Court. Even at this point, there was no\ndetermination of his mental illness. It did not appear that there were any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 13 of 87</span>\n such symptoms being displayed by him at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">29. There is a noting at 4 pm on the same date, i.e. 7th November 2017 by\nDr. Sartaj Deepak that Respondent No.4 was asking that he should be\nreferred to a cardiac centre. On that day, Respondent No.4 was taken to the\nGuru Teg Bahadur Hospital (‗GTBH&#x27;), Dilshad Garden at 5 pm. There he\nwas seen by Dr. Arvind Kumar, the Casualty Medical Officer (‗CMO&#x27;). He\nwas prescribed some medication. It was noted there, ―Patient wants\ncardiology consultation which is not available in GTB Hospital. Refer to\nRGSSH/GB Pant Cardiology‖. However, for some reason, it appears that\nRespondent No.4 was not taken to the Rajiv Gandhi Super-Speciality\nHospital (‗RGSSH&#x27;) on that day but brought back to IHBAS instead. It is\nsurprising that the notes on the file of IHBAS for 7th November 2017 do not\nrefer to Respondent No.4 having been taken to the GTBH although the\noriginal of the ERC of GTBH giving the aforementioned details which have\nbeen extracted by this Court is available on file.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">30. The noting at 8 pm on 7th November 2017 after he was taken back to\nIHBAS, inter alia, is to the effect: ―Patient reports he is not a psychiatric\npatient and wants to go home‖. The plan recommended by the doctor who\nsaw him then was, ―Admission for diagnostic clarification‖. This was\nrepeated at 10 pm. The DMO&#x27;s notes are, ―Patient admitted to MCW-1,\npatient refused to go there reportedly he says that he is not a psychiatric\npatient, he need not be admitted here‖. This noting is by one Dr. Amandeep.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_38\">At IHBAS: 8th to 23rd November\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">31. It appears that at 8 am on 8th November 2017, Respondent No.4 was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                            Page 14 of 87</span>\n seen again by Dr. Amandeep who noted, ―No fresh complaint‖. The plan\nrecommended simply stated ―Admission‖. On that date, it was again stated\nunder the admission notes, by Dr. Pravesh: ―Not yet diagnosed‖. The notes\nfor 9th November 2017 only note the rating scale prepared by Dr. Rosali\nBhoi, Junior Resident (JR) at IHBAS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">32. There is a note dated 10th November 2017, without mentioning the time,\nby Dr. Pravesh, SR that: ―He keeps moving in ward always with black coat,\nhas authoritative speech and behaviour.‖ Further, ―...repeatedly asking,\n‗how can you keep me here&#x27;.‖ Dr. Pravesh notes the words spoken by\nRespondent No.4 about claiming to know the judges. For the first time it is\nnoted: ―Possibility of affective psychosis.‖ After this noting of 10th\nNovember 2017, Dr. Pravesh SR saw Respondent No.4 next only on 23 rd\nNovember 2017, i.e. after twelve days.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">33. The next date before the MM was 20th November 2017. What was\nproduced before the MM was the report dated 10 th November 2017 prepared\nby IHBAS which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">       ―The aforesaid patient was admitted at IHBAS on 03.11.2017 in\n       compliance to the Hon&#x27;ble Court order for detailed assessment\n       and evaluation. It is submitted to the Hon&#x27;ble Court that patient\n       is under evaluation and after completion of evaluation, he will\n       be examined by Standing Medical Board. This whole process\n       will take around 4-6 weeks and the report will be submitted to\n       the Hon&#x27;ble Court at the earliest.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       This is for your kind information and necessary action, please.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">34. In the meanwhile on 10th, 13th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 20th and 21st November\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 15 of 87</span>\n 2017 the only doctor who appears to have seen him was Dr. Rosali Bhoi JR.\nAlthough Dr. Nimesh Desai claims in his affidavit that he ―personally\nexamined the patient‖ and had discussions with his colleagues on 21st\nNovember 2017 there are no notes of Dr. Desai on the file for the above\ndate. Also there is no noting of any diagnosis that Respondent No.4 was\nhaving ‗manic episodes&#x27; as claimed by Dr. Desai.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">35. In her notes for 13th November 2017, Dr. Rosali Bhoi stated: ―Patient\nusually interacts with family and staff by self but would talk authoritatively\nwith doctors when it is difficult to interrupt him, refuses to take hospital\nmedications‖. The notings on 15th and 16th November 2017 again speak of\nhis refusal to cooperate for investigation. ―Roams around with his list of\ncardiac medications; repeatedly claims to get discharged for getting\nangioplasty done‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">36. The noting by Dr. Pravesh for 23rd November 2017 is that ―currently Pt.\nis reporting breathlessness and he was asked to be taken to RGSSH. He was\nthen taken to RGSSH that day. The Plan noted was ―Court to be intimated\nabout the same.‖\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">37. The Court has examined the notings in the file of Respondent No.4 at\nIHBAS up to 23rd November 2017. It finds that there is not a single noting to\nthe effect that Respondent No.4 is suffering from any kind of mental illness\nor even ―manic episode‖ as claimed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 16 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\"> Back before the MM on 20th November\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">38. On 20th November 2017, the learned MM perused the above report of\nIHBAS which had been prepared on 10th November 2017 itself. The MM\nthereafter passed the following order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        ―ASI Krishan in person with patient namely Ram Kumar.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        Medical report of patient Ram Kumar filed which reflects that\n        patient is under evaluation and after completion of evaluation,\n        patient will be examined by Standing Medical Board and this\n        whole process will taken around 4-6 weeks&#x27; time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">        As per medical report, IO and concerned doctor is directed to\n        file the medical report of patient on 05.01.2018. IO is further\n        directed to admit the patient Ram Kumar in IBHAS.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        Director IBHAS is further directed to take care of mental as\n        well as physical health care of the patient.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        Director IBHAS is also directed to appear in person in the court\n        on next date of hearing.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">        Another application moved by applicant for release of patient\n        Ram Kumar @ Ram Kanwar from IBHAS. In view of the\n        report of doctor, the present application stands dismissed.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">39. Even on the above date the MM failed to refer to the provisions of the\nMHA. The MM failed to note that even till then there was no actual\ndiagnosis of Respondent No.4 being ‗mentally ill&#x27;. Therefore, the\napplicability of the MHA was itself doubtful. Notwithstanding this, the MM\nfailed to note the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/189757541/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 28 (2)</a> of the MHA that the aggregate\nperiod of detention at a mental health facility for the purposes of observation\ncannot exceed 30 days. The MM fixed the next date of hearing as 5th January\n2018.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 17 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\"> 40. What was even more egregious was the report of IHBAS informing the\nlearned MM that the entire process of evaluation would take around ―4-6\nweeks‖. This was again in the teeth of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/189757541/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 28 (2)</a> read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/189757541/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 28 (2)</a> MHA whereby the total period of detention could not\nexceed 30 days in the aggregate. Thus both IHBAS and the MM acted in\nviolation of the MHA. This was one more hearing where Respondent No.4\nwas not represented by an Advocate. This was in the teeth of <a href=\"/doc/69716534/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 91</a>\nMHA which mandates legal aid being provided to those facing proceedings\nunder the MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">41. The learned MM also erroneously dismissed the application of the\nfamily of Respondent No.4 seeking his release from IHBAS. The dismissal\nwas perfunctory. In just one line it was stated: ―In view of report of doctor,\nthe present application stands dismissed‖. This was a non-speaking order. It\ndid not refer to any law. In that application, the present Petitioner had\npointed out, ―The applicant&#x27;s father will suffer irreparable physical as well\nas mental loss due to unnecessary stay at IHBAS‖. The application\nspecifically mentioned that Respondent No.4 was suffering from heart\nailments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">IHBAS&#x27;s report dated 24th November 2017\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">42. For the next hearing on 5th January 2018, a report was already prepared\nby IHBAS on 24th November 2017. It reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       ―The aforesaid patient was admitted at IHBAS on 3rd November\n       2017 in compliance to the Hon&#x27;ble Court order for detailed\n       assessment and evaluation.

Although patient has no high risk\n       behaviour and psychiatrically can be treated on outpatient basis.\n       The final report of mental status will be submitted to the\n       Hon&#x27;ble Court through Standing Medical Board at the earliest.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       It is further submitted to the Hon&#x27;ble Court that patient is\n       known      case   of    Coronary    artery  disease/Ischemic\n       cardiomyopathy (Ejection fraction 30-365%) with Moderate\n       MR with Mild TR. Currently, patient reported breathlessness\n       and he was sent to Cardiology Department, Rajiv Gandhi Super\n       Specialty Hospital. In Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital,\n       he has been admitted on the advice of the concerned doctors\n       (copy enclosed).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       Hence it is requested to the Hon&#x27;ble Court to kindly issue\n       discharge order from IHBAS and issue an order for admission\n       in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       This is for your kind information and necessary action, please.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_53\">43. Up until this point in time, IHBAS did not think it necessary to inform\nthe MM that retaining Respondent No.4 at IHBAS was not only unnecessary\nbut also a risk given his heart condition. When Respondent No.4 again\ncomplained of breathlessness, he was sent to the cardiology department of\nRGSSH. His family was understandably even more concerned. Thus, on\n24th November 2017, the present petition was filed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">This Court&#x27;s Order dated 25th November 2017\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_55\">44. This Court on the next date, 25th November 2017, passed a detailed order\nat a special sitting where, inter alia, after referring to the background facts\nand IHBAS&#x27;s report dated 24th November 2017, the Court set aside the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 19 of 87</span>\n above illegal orders of the Duty MMs and MM. The Court proceeded to\norder as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       ―30. It appears that as a result of the above report. Respondent\n       No. 4 has now been taken to Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty\n       Hospital where he is present hospitalized. Learned counsel for\n       the Petitioner points out that his heart condition has\n       deteriorated.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       31. The Court is left in no doubt that there has been a total\n       violation of the mandatory provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 28 (1)</a> read 24\n       (2) (a) of MHA at every stage in these proceedings. In none of\n       the proceedings did the Duty MM/MM ensure that the\n       Respondent No.4 was represented by counsel. No question was\n       even put to him in that regard. The orders passed, on the reports\n       of IHBAS, have resulted in a violation of the fundamental right\n       of Respondent No.4 to life and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the\n       Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       32.

In his affidavit, Dr. Nimesh Desai, Director of IHBAS, asserted that the\nfamily members of Respondent No.4 were given access to him at all times\nand had not raised any grievance. Dr. Desai stated that it was only on\n21st November 2017 that he personally examined Respondent No.4. He had\ndiscussions with the treating team on 21 st and 22nd November 2017 and\nthereafter found that ―although the patient was found to be suffering from\nmanic episodes and was litigious but he could be treated as an OPD patient\nas he was no longer at high risk behaviour‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">47. Dr. Desai claimed that the said decision was verbally conveyed to the\nfamily members of Respondent No.4 on 22nd November 2017. Given his\ncardiac condition, Respondent No.4 was admitted to RGSSH on\n23rd November 2017. Dr. Desai stated that the formal request for the\ndischarge of Respondent No.4 was prepared on 23rd November 2017 and\nwas filed before the MM on 24th November 2017. Since the learned MM\nwas not holding Court on that date, the matter was adjourned to 25th\nNovember 2017.

Dr. Desai\ndisclosed that the team of doctors treating Respondent No.4 comprised Dr.\nOm Prakash (Associate Professor); Dr. Kirti Sharma (SR); Dr. Prabhleen\nSingh Jaggi (SR); Dr. Pravesh Kumar (SR); Dr. Deepak Kumar (Associate\nProfessor and acting HoD); and Dr. Rosali Bhoi (JR). Each of them, with the\nexception of Dr. Bhoi, has filed an affidavit. Despite explaining in detail the\nsymptoms that they observed, none of these affidavits categorically states\nthat Respondent No.4 was suffering from any kind of mental illness.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">49. Dr. Om Prakash, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at IHBAS, in his\naffidavit dated 12th December 2017 stated that the procedure to be followed\non production of a mentally ill person or a person who is suspected to be\nmentally ill is provided under <a href=\"/doc/64784224/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 24 (1)</a> MHA. The MM is required to\nexamine the person to assess his ―capacity to understand‖. Thereafter, under\n<a href=\"/doc/186271280/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 24 (1) (b)</a> MHA, the MM is required to cause such a person to be\nexamined by a medical officer.

Dr. Om Prakash explained in para 5 of his affidavit that in the present\ncase ―the reception order was passed straightaway without resorting to the\nrequirements of a certificate referred to under <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 24 (2) (a)</a> or the\nprocedure under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 28</a>‖. The ‗bona fide confusion&#x27; allegedly caused is\nsought to be explained as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       ―6. It is submitted in all humility and with great respect that\n       since a reception order was passed by the Ld. MM, the case had\n       progressed beyond the stage of issuance of a certificate under\n       <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 24(2) (a)</a>. It is respectfully submitted that confusion\n       crept in as the Ld. MM was pleased to issue reception order\n       without awaiting compliance with the procedure laid down in\n       <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 28</a> and the issuance of a certificate under <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n       24(2)(a)</a>. It is this confusion which is noted in this Hon&#x27;ble\n       Court&#x27;s order dated 25.11.2017 in Para 17 thereof. However, it\n       is submitted that since detailed assessment and examination of\n       patient was required in view of the initial assessment and\n       observation, further time was sought by IHBAS from the Ld.\n       MM, so that after a detailed examination the treating team may\n       arrive at a conclusion with regard to the nature and degree of\n       the mental illness which the Patient was suffering from.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       7. It is submitted with humility that there was bonafide\n       confusion. This bonafide confusion arose because a certificate\n       contemplated after following the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 28</a>,\n       viz. a certificate under <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 24(2) (a)</a> is a certificate, which is\n       required to be filed prior to the Ld. MM passing a reception\n       order. This is so because after filing of this certificate, the Ld.\n       MM would also exercise his discretion within the meaning of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                                 Page 24 of 87</span>\n        <a href=\"/doc/35873409/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 24(2) (b)</a>. Both the conditions are conjunctive and are\n       connected with the expression ―and‖. I say this on the basis of\n       my understanding of the said provision and the on the basis of\n       the legal advice received. However, in the instant case, the\n       reception order, which normally has to be passed at the stage of\n       <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 24(2) (a)</a> after issuance of the certificate and the\n       application of the mind of the Ld. MM, had already been passed\n       on 03.11.2017. This confusion is deeply regretted.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_64\">52. Separate affidavits, all dated 12th December 2017, have been filed by the\ndoctors at IHBAS, i.e. Dr. Kirti Sharma Duty Medical Officer (DMO) (SR),\nDr. Deepak Kumar Associate Professor and acting HOD (Psychiatry) at\nIHBAS, Dr. Prabhleen Singh Jaggi DMO SR and Dr. Pravesh Kumar SR.\nOn the legal aspects, all the affidavits more or less state the same thing, viz.\nthat the reception order dated 3rd November 2017 was passed by the MM\nwithout following the procedure and the conditions needing to be fulfilled\non a collective reading of <a href=\"/doc/64784224/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections 24 (1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_37\">24 (2) (a)</a> MHA and <a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n28(1)</a> MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">53. The Court at the outset would like to observe that although in the letter\ndated 24th November 2017 addressed to the MM the doctors at IHBAS have\nstated inter alia that Respondent No.4 has been ―diagnosed as suffering\nfrom Manic Episode‖ there is no noting in the file to that effect on any of the\ndates that he was seen by the doctors at IHBAS. Even the letter dated 24 th\nNovember 2017 of IHBAS to the MM does not certify the mental illness of\nRespondent No.4. The fact of the matter is that although IHBAS purports to\nhave acted in terms of the provisions of the MHA, the basic document that\nwould form the basis of a reception order viz., the certificate of medical\nillness was not available even 20 days after Respondent No.4 had been kept\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 25 of 87</span>\n at IHBAS on a continuous basis.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">54. In their affidavits the doctors at IHBAS seek to justify the diagnosis of\n&#x27;manic episode&#x27; by setting out the actual words allegedly spoken by\nRespondent No.4. However, these words do not feature in many of the\nnotings in his file. The affidavits of Dr. Jaggi and Dr. Kirti Sharma fall in\nthis category. Even Dr. Sartaj Deepak, who appears to have seen\nRespondent No.4 only twice i.e. 4 pm on 4th November and 4pm on 7th\nNovember 2017, sets out in his affidavit what Respondent No.4 is purported\nto have said whereas his notes on the file do not reflect those words having\nbeen spoken. The purpose of maintaining notes on file is that it constitutes a\ncontemporaneous record of observations of the visiting doctor. The Court is\nnot inclined to take into account claims in the subsequent affidavits of the\ndoctors about what they observed, when it finds no mention in their\ncontemporaneous notes on the treatment file.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_67\">55. It is stated in the affidavit dated 12th December 2017 of Dr. Jaggi that\nbased on the Mental State Examination performed by him, ―The provisional\ndiagnosis ‗psychosis to be specified&#x27; was made‖. While such medical jargon\nmight obfuscate the true condition of Respondent No.4&#x27;s mental health, the\nfact remains that there is not a single noting in the file or any statements in\nany of these affidavits to the effect that any of the psychiatrists who\nexamined Respondent No.4 came to the conclusion that he was suffering\nfrom any mental illness which required his hospitalisation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">56. It was attempted to be stated in the affidavit dated 12 th December 2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 26 of 87</span>\n of Dr. Pravesh Kumar that on the basis of the behaviour, observations and\nMSEs: ―The diagnosis ‗manic episode&#x27; was confirmed‖. However, this is at\nvariance with what Dr. Nimesh Desai has said in his affidavit that\nRespondent No.4 ―could be treated as an OPD patient as he was no longer at\nhigh-risk behaviour‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">57. The notes of 4th and 5th November 2017 show that two of the doctors\nviz., Dr. Sartaj Deepak and Dr. Kirti Sharma were of the opinion that the\nMM should be asked to pass a reception order under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 28</a> MHA. This\nwas in ignorance of the law. Reception orders are passed under <a href=\"/doc/132616426/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 24</a>\nand not <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 28</a> MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">58. The affidavits of the IHBAS doctors show that despite their knowing\nthat Respondent No.4 did not require treatment as an in-patient, they did not\nattempt to inform the MM of this fact. They ignored the repeated requests\nfor discharge made by Respondent No.4 and his family They allowed the\nillegality to be perpetuated for 20 days. The excuse that they did so because\nthe MM ordered them to do so, and that there was genuine confusion, is not\nacceptable at all. When on 23rd November 2017 IHBAS decided apply to the\nMM for discharge of Respondent No.4, it was only because of his\ndeteriorating heart condition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">Affidavit of ASI Krishan Kumar\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_72\">59. In his affidavit dated 14th December 2017, ASI Krishan Kumar has\nstated that even on 3rd November 2017 he tried unsuccessfully to get the\ncontact number of his family members from Respondent No.4. However, he\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                            Page 27 of 87</span>\n did have the address. He claims that he went to the address but could not\nlocate the house. This part of the affidavit is not believable at all. It is\ncontrary to what <a href=\"/doc/30915532/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 23 (2)</a> MHA requires of a police officer. Even the\nDuty MM stating in the order dated 3rd November 2017 that the whereabouts\nof his family is not ascertainable is not very convincing. The power vested\nin the MM under <a href=\"/doc/172273236/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 24 (1) (c)</a> MHA to make inquiries is precisely for\nsuch contingencies.

The present case presents a dismal failure of our system, which includes\nthe police, the judiciary and the mental health professionals, to protect the\nfundamental rights of an individual. It points to the disastrous consequences\nthat the abuse of the mental health law can have for the right to liberty,\ndignity and privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">64. Before proceeding to discuss the numerous illegalities that have been\nperpetrated in this case, a caveat needs to be entered at this stage. Although\nthe Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA) has been enacted by Parliament\nto replace the MHA, it has been notified by the central government to come\ninto operation only with effect from 8th July 2018. Therefore, the discussion\nin this judgment is in the context of the MHA, which is the law that is\napplicable to the facts at hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">Violation of the right to life, liberty and dignity\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">65. The above narration confirms that the order of the Judge, MACT and the\nDuty MM on 3rd November 2017 had the combined effect of depriving\nRespondent No.4 of his liberty. The first violation of the fundamental right\nof Respondent No.4 took place when pursuant to the order of the Judge\nMACT, a police officer took Respondent No.4 from his Court in police\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 29 of 87</span>\n custody for a medical check up. The creation of a ‗ruckus&#x27; in Court was no\njustification for this. The Court finds it strange that the Judge MACT noted\nin his order at 3.30 pm on 3rd November 2017 that his Naib Court informed\nhim that Respondent No.4 had been taken by the police official ―to some\ngovernment hospital for his medical examination‖ and yet did not enquire\nunder whose orders and under what authority of law he was being so taken.\nTo treat a person causing disorderliness in Court as one requiring to be taken\ninto police custody straightaway and then for such person to be taken in\ncustody for a medical check up, without the authority of law, is in clear\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_83\">66. The second violation of the fundamental and constitutional rights of\nRespondent No.4 took place on the night of 3 rd November 2017 when the\nDuty MM passed a ‗reception order&#x27; directing Respondent No.4 to be kept at\nIHBAS for more than 24 hours. This was on an application by ASI Krishan\nKumar praying for an order that Respondent No.4 should be sent to IHBAS.\nIt will be recalled that this application cited no provision of any law. This\nresulted in a totally illegal ‗reception order&#x27; being passed without reference\nto any law; without informing the family of Respondent No.4; and without\nensuring that Respondent No.4 was represented by a legal aid counsel.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">67. The combined effect of the order of the Judge, MACT and then the Duty\nMM on 3rd November 2017 was to first render Respondent No.4 to the\npolice custody of ASI Krishan Kumar and Ct. Maya Ram and thereafter into\njudicial custody at IHBAS. This illegality was allowed to persist on 5th and\n20th November 2017 when the MM continued the detention of Respondent\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 30 of 87</span>\n No.4 at IHBAS again without any authority of law. In the course of a single\nday, 3rd November 2017, a combination of judicial orders resulted in the\ndeprivation of the rights to liberty and dignity of Respondent No.4\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">68. Liberty forms the bedrock of the Constitution of India. The Preamble\nforegrounds liberty of thought, expression and belief as having been secured\nto all its citizens. The Preamble secures to all citizens ‗fraternity assuring the\ndignity of the individual&#x27;. The right to dignity of the individual is among the\nguaranteed rights enshrined in the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_31\">69. Dignity of the individual is inseparable from human life. Therefore,\nwhen the Constitution guarantees, under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21</a>, the right to life and\nliberty, it guarantees to every person the protection of one&#x27;s dignity. That the\nright to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a> inheres in it the right to dignity was explained\nby the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_47\">Francis Coralie Mullin v.

Of course, the\n       magnitude and content of the components of this right would\n       depend upon the extent of the economic development of the\n       country, but it must, in any view of the matter, include the right\n       to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such\n       functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum\n       expression of the human-self. Every act which offends against\n       or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation protanto\n       of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with\n       reasonable, fair and just procedure established by law which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                                Page 31 of 87</span>\n        stands the test of other fundamental rights.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">70. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"46910974\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/46910974/\" id=\"a_48\">Shabnam v.

However, IHBAS is silent on why in this case, no help was\noffered to respondent No.4 by the said legal aid clinic. There is no noting in\nthe file of IHBAS or any mention in any of the affidavits that Respondent\nNo.4 was ever told of the availability of such legal service. Clearly the\nNALSA 2015 Scheme and the DSLSA failed to provide Respondent No.4\nlegal services both within IHBAS and in the proceedings before the MM.\nThe system failed Respondent No.4.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">Not informed of the grounds of detention\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">80. Neither in the affidavit of ASI Krishan Kumar nor in any of the\naffidavits of the IHBAS doctors is there any reference to the fact that\nRespondent No.4 or his family members were informed of the grounds of\nhis detention.

For, it is only when life\n       can be lived with a true sense of quality that the dignity of\n       human existence is fully realized. Hence, there should be no\n       antagonism between the sanctity of human life on the one hand\n       and the dignity and quality of life on the other hand.

This normative unity is expressed in the\n       three ways: first, the value of human dignity serves as a\n       normative basis for constitutional rights set out in the\n       constitution; second, it serves as an interpretative principle for\n       determining the scope of constitutional rights, including the\n       right to human dignity; third, the value of human dignity has an\n       important role in determining the proportionality of a statute\n       limiting a constitutional right.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">87.

Principle 16 states that a person may be admitted involuntarily\nonly if a medical practitioner is of the view that the mental illness is of such\nnature that is likely to pose immediate or imminent harm to that person or to\nother persons or if he is of the view that failure to so admit that person is\nlikely to lead to serious deterioration in his or her condition and will prevent\nthe giving of treatment.

These principles were to serve as guiding principles for\nmember States to bring about changes in their respective mental healthcare\nlaws. Principle 5 provides that consent of the patient is essential. If for some\nreason a mentally ill person is unable to consent, a surrogate decision maker\nshould be appointed. This could be a friend, relative or authority, authorized\nto decide on behalf of such person. In terms of Principle 6 where a patient is\nable to consent, but is merely experiencing difficulties in appreciating the\nimplications of a decision, such patient should receive assistance from a\nlawyer, social worker, etc. Such person should be made aware of this right\nthe moment he is in need of such assistance. Principle 7 provides for\ninterested persons to seek review of decisions by judges, or representatives\nof a patient and by health care providers.

The CRPD foregrounds the dignity of persons with disabilities both\nphysical and mental. <a href=\"/doc/531335/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 3 (a)</a> highlights the general principle that there\nshall be ―Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including\nthe freedom to make one&#x27;s own choices, and independence of persons‖.\n<a href=\"/doc/1725440/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 3 (d)</a> talks of the ―respect for difference and acceptance of\npersons with disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">93. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 14 (b)</a> of the CRPD mandates that the State is obliged to\nensure that the disabled are ―not deprived of their liberty unlawfully or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 43 of 87</span>\n arbitrarily, and that any deprivation of liberty is in conformity with the law,\nand that the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of\nliberty‖. As regards the responsibility of health care professionals <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 25</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_117\">(d) of the CRPD obliges the States to ―require health professionals to\nprovide care of the same quality to persons with disabilities as to others,\nincluding on the basis of free and informed consent by, inter alia, raising\nawareness of the human rights, dignity, autonomy and needs of persons with\ndisabilities through training and the promulgation of ethical standards for\npublic and private health care‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">94. Thus it is seen that the international law of mental health has moved to\nrecognising the autonomy of the person whose mental illness requires care\nand treatment. The law recognises the right of such person to participate in\nthe process of decisions being arrived at concerning the person&#x27;s care and\ntreatment. Custodial treatment at a mental health facility through involuntary\nadmission process is to be avoided. It is to be exercised only where the other\nless restrictive alternatives are not feasible. The interpretation of the MHA\nand its successor legislation, i.e. the MHCA, must be consistent with India&#x27;s\nobligations under the CRPD.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">Interpretation of the relevant provisions of the MHA\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">95. In the aforementioned backdrop, the Court proceeds to undertake an\nanalysis of the relevant provisions of the MHA. The Statement of the\nObjects and Reasons of the MHA, which replaced the <a href=\"/doc/128750983/\" id=\"a_90\">Indian Lunacy Act</a>\n1912 (ILA), acknowledged that the attitude of society towards persons with\nmental illness has changed considerably and that, ―No stigma should be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 44 of 87</span>\n attached to such illness as it is curable particularly when diagnosed at an\nearly stage‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">96. The MHA envisages admission to a psychiatric hospital or a psychiatric\nnursing home on voluntary or involuntary basis. Part I of Chapter IV of the\nMHA deals with admissions on voluntary basis. Part II of Chapter IV of the\nMHA and <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 19</a> thereunder deals with ‗admission under special\ncircumstances&#x27; which is a form of admission on involuntary basis.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">97. Part III deals with ‗reception orders&#x27; in situations of admissions on\ninvoluntary basis. There are two kinds of reception orders. Para A under Part\nIII deals with ‗reception order on an application&#x27; by either the medical\nofficer in charge of a psychiatric hospital or by the spouse or relative of the\nmentally ill person. <a href=\"/doc/71028694/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 20 (1)</a> deals with such a request. Para B under\nPart III of Chapter IV of the MHA deals with ―reception orders on\nproduction of mentally ill person before Magistrate‖. <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_93\">Sections 23</a> to <a href=\"/doc/75880442/\" id=\"a_94\">25</a> fall\nunder this Para B. <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 28</a> under Para C titled ‗detention of alleged\nmentally ill person pending report by medical officer&#x27; is relevant in this\ncontext.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">98. At the risk of repetition it must be stated that none of the provisions of\nthe MHA apply stricto sensu to the facts of the present case. However, since\nall the actors viz., the police, the magistrates, the doctors at IHBAS have\npurported to proceed as if the MHA applied, it is necessary to examine\nwhich provisions of the MHA, if at all, might have been relevant.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 45 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\"> Section 23 MHA\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">99. <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 23</a> which falls in Para B of Part III of Chapter IV of the MHA\nreads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">       ―23.

First,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 46 of 87</span>\n such officer should find that the person is wandering ‗at large&#x27; i.e. a person\nwho has been abandoned by relatives and friends. Second, the police officer\nmust have ‗reason to believe&#x27; that such person is ―so mentally ill‖ that he is\nnot in a position to take care of himself. Unless both conditions are fulfilled,\na police officer cannot detain a person under <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 23</a> of the MHA.\nFurther, under <a href=\"/doc/30915532/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 23 (2)</a> MHA no person shall be taken into protection\nor detained ―without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for\ntaking him into such protection‖, or where such person is not capable of\nunderstanding those grounds, ―without his relatives or friends, if any, being\ninformed of such grounds‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">101. <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 23</a> MHA is an instance of a power coupled with a duty. If the\npolice officer fails to fulfil the statutory obligations in <a href=\"/doc/46774181/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 23 (1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/30915532/\" id=\"a_102\">23\n(2)</a> MHA as outlined above, the exercise of power by him shall be rendered\nunlawful. Since the consequence would be the deprivation of the liberty of\nthe person taken into ‗protection&#x27; the non-fulfilment by the officer of the\nmandatory requirements of <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 23</a> MHA would also render his actions\nunconstitutional. From the affidavit filed by ASI Krishan Kumar himself, it\nis evident that the above statutory and mandatory requirements were not\nobserved.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">102. When a police officer produces such a person before the MM under\n<a href=\"/doc/132972503/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 23 (3)</a> MHA, the MM has to first ascertain if the above procedure\nhas been duly complied with by the police officer. In the present case,\nhowever, the process began not with the police officer in-charge of a police\nstation taking a person ‗wandering at large&#x27; into protection. It began by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                               Page 47 of 87</span>\n Judge, MACT asking the naib Court attached to his Court (who of course\nwas not an officer in charge of a police station) to inform the police at the\nPP in Rohini Court who in turn took Respondent No.4 in custody to the\nBSA Hospital for a medical examination. It appears that there was no\nwritten order authorising it. What, therefore, happened was in the realm of\n‗no law&#x27; and ‗no procedure&#x27; known to law. The detention of Respondent\nNo.4 by the police officer pursuant to the order of the Judge, MACT was\nwithout the authority of law and not referable to any provision of the MHA.\nIt was not only violative of the MHA, but also violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution which mandates that there can be no deprivation of life and\nliberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">103. It could be argued that the police officer attached to the Court was\nbound to act on the order of the Judge, MACT. But that order was only to\ndirect the naib Court to inform the police, and nothing more. Even if one\nwere to accept for a moment that it was inevitable for ASI Krishan Kumar to\ntake Respondent No.4 into temporary custody, it did not relieve ASI Krishan\nKumar from seeking the authority of law for his actions. In this case, he\ncould not have proceeded to take Respondent No.4 in custody for his\nmedical examination without recourse to <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 23</a> MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">104. The MHA is not a penal statute for punishing a person for disorderly\nbehaviour in a Court. It is not a penal custodial law. It is a law for the care\nand treatment of mentally ill persons. Since this basic understanding of the\nMHA was lost sight of by the judicial officer and the policeman, a cascading\nseries of egregious violations of the rights to liberty and dignity of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                              Page 48 of 87</span>\n Respondent No.4 ensued.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">Section 24 MHA\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_132\">105. Having taken Respondent No.4 to the BSA Hospital and without any\ncertification by the SR there that Respondent No.4 suffered from any mental\nillness, the question of the learned MM passing an order authorizing\ndetention of Respondent No.4 in IHBAS did not arise. The procedure that\nhad to be followed thereafter by the learned MM is set out under <a href=\"/doc/132616426/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 24</a>\nof the MHA which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">       ―24.

In the present case, the Duty MM on 3rd November 2017 straightway\npassed a ‗reception order&#x27;. This was done on an application by ASI Krishan\nKumar, without even looking at the MHA or referring to its provisions. The\ndirection was that Respondent No.4 should be kept ―under observation in\nIHBAS for 24 hours‖. The reasons adduced by the Duty MM were that\nRespondent No.4 was ―unable to give any coherent answers and seems to be\npotentially violent.‖ Further he had ―a very threatening attitude towards\neveryone.‖ Had the Duty MM read <a href=\"/doc/37165342/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 24 (1) (a)</a> MHA, she would have\nrealised that she first required to form an opinion that there are sufficient\ngrounds to proceed further. Next she had to examine the alleged mentally ill\nperson to ―assess his capacity to understand.‖ Thirdly, if she wanted to\nfurther proceed the Duty MM had to cause Respondent No.4 to be examined\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                               Page 50 of 87</span>\n by a medical officer. Fourthly, she had to ―make such enquiries in relation to\nsuch person‖ as she ―may deem necessary.‖\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">107. The exercise to be undertaken by the Duty MM as described above\ncould not have possibly been completed in undue haste. It was not enough,\nas was done in the present case, for the Duty MM to ask questions of the\nperson produced about his family contact details. It was necessary for the\nDuty MM to order an enquiry in that regard by the police officer before\nmaking a reception order. This is because the MHA is not to be treated as a\nstatute to exercise power over and control people. It is essentially a statute\nfor the care and treatment of mentally ill persons in need of such care and\ntreatment. If the person produced before a Magistrate does have family or\nrelatives or friends who can take care of him and prevent him from injuring\nhimself and others, there would be no need to go ahead with such a\n‗reception order&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_142\">108. On the aspect of seeking the opinion of a medical officer in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/186271280/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 24 (1) (b)</a> MHA, on the date and time when the learned MM passed\nthe reception order i.e. on 3rd November 2017 at 9.30 pm, there was no\ncertificate by any medical officer that Respondent No.4 was mentally ill.\nWhat the learned MM had before her were the notes on the MLC prepared\nby the BSA Hospital, where Respondent No.4 was taken on 3 rd November\n2017 at 2.25 pm. The noting on the said MLC is that, ―No psychopathology\ndetected‖. In short, nothing stated in the MLC issued by the BSA Hospital in\nrespect of Respondent No.4 on 3rd November 2017 could qualify as a\ncertification by a medical officer that Respondent No.4 was ‗mentally ill&#x27;.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 51 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\"> Clearly, therefore, there was no question of the learned MM passing a\nreception order at 9.30 pm on 3rd November 2017.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_144\">109. The noting by the BSA doctor: ―Referred to IHBAS for 24 hours\nobservation‖ can at best be said to have enabled the Duty MM to order that\nRespondent No.4 be kept at IHBAS for a day. But the learned MM could not\nhave ordered him to be kept for two days, since the next returnable date was\n5th November 2017 i.e. beyond 24 hours. Then again, the learned MM could\nhave first found out if the family of Respondent No.4 was prepared to take\nhim and bring him back, if at all necessary, for such observation. This could\nhave been done by invoking <a href=\"/doc/172273236/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 24 (1) (c)</a> MHA and deferring the\npassing of the order till a report was received from the police about the\nwhereabouts of the family of Respondent No.4. In the meanwhile the police\nshould have been asked to take Respondent No.4 back to his residence\nsubject to his remaining present on the next date. The idea is for the MM to,\nat all times, explore the possibility of the least restrictive alternative.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_145\">110. Under <a href=\"/doc/48293891/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 24 (2)</a> MHA no reception order can be passed without a\ncertificate of a medical officer that the person concerned is mentally ill. In\nthe present case, as already noticed, there was no such certificate before the\nDuty MM on 3rd November 2017. The second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/48293891/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 24 (2)</a>\nMHA states that if any relative or friend of the mentally ill person\nundertakes that such mentally ill person will be properly taken care of, the\nMagistrate need not make the reception order but hand over the person to the\ncare of such relative or friend. The second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/132616426/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 24</a> MHA\nunderscores the need for the Magistrate to explore the least restrictive\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                                  Page 52 of 87</span>\n alternative. The legislature therefore is conscious that an order of\ncommitment to a mental health facility can have adverse consequences for a\nperson&#x27;s right to liberty and dignity. The conclusion from the above\ndiscussion is that the ‗reception order&#x27; passed by the Duty MM on 3 rd\nNovember 2017 was illegal and contrary to <a href=\"/doc/132616426/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 24</a> of the MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">Analysis of Section 28 MHA\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">111.

Under <a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 28 (1)</a> MHA, the Duty MM had to first be satisfied that\nthe keeping of Respondent No.4 for observation at IHBAS was necessary\nfor enabling a medical officer to determine whether a medical certificate that\nRespondent No.4 suffers from any mental illness, that required treatment as\nan in-patient could be given for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 24 (2) (a)</a> MHA.\n<a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 28 (1)</a> MHA uses the expression ‗may&#x27;. The power vested in the\nMM to pass such an order is discretionary. It had to be for valid reasons and\nbased on relevant material. This is because admission of a person into a\nmental facility even for the purposes of ‗observation&#x27; can have liberty\ndepriving consequences.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">113. For the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 28 (1)</a> MHA, the Duty MM could have\nmade the effort of finding out from the family members whether they would\nbe able to bring Respondent No.4 to IHBAS for observation. If the family\nagreed, as they may have, there would have been no need to keep him under\nobservation at IHBAS only for the purposes of enabling the medical officer\nto determine whether he was suffering from mental illness that required\ntreatment as an in-patient. <a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 28 (1)</a> MHA also talks of ‗other suitable\nplace&#x27; where a person could be kept. This could well be his own home\nwhere the person has a family that is willing to take care of him. These less\nrestrictive alternatives were not explored by the Duty MM.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 54 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\"> 114. It may be possible to argue that where there is a person ‗wandering at\nlarge&#x27; who is allegedly mentally ill; who is unable to look after himself and\nhas absolutely no one to look after him, then, for the limited purpose of a\nenabling a medical officer to certify that his mental illness requires him to be\ntreated as an in-patient, he may have to be kept under observation. But then\nagain, even in such instance, the person need not necessarily be sent to a\nmental health facility but to a half way home that is less restrictive. In such\ninstance, the responsibility on the MM is even greater. The MM passing an\norder under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 28</a> MHA, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/95657126/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 24 (2) (a)</a> has to\nbe conscious that it has the potential of violating the constitutional and\nfundamental rights of the person subject to such ‗observation&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_151\">115. In the present case, the MM was ignorant of the legal position, and so\nwere the doctors at IHBAS. As already noticed, the note written on file on\n4th November 2017 at 4 pm by Dr Sartaj Deepak was: ―It has been decided\nto request the Hon&#x27;ble Court to pass a reception order under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 28</a> as\npatient needs admission for further observation and management‖. Dr.\nDeepak ought to know that reception orders are not passed under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 28</a>\nof the MHA. Then we have the noting of 8 am on 5 th November 2017 by Dr.\nKirti Sharma that: ―It is requested to the Hon&#x27;ble Court that an appropriate\nreception order under <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 28</a> of the MHA, 1987 may be passed for the\nsame‖.

The doctors at IHBAS make it appear as if they were obliged by the\norder dated 3rd November 2017 of the Duty MM to detain Respondent No.4\nat IHBAS. Not every person brought to IHBAS has to necessarily be\nadmitted there. There could be mental illnesses which do not require\ntreatment as an in-patient. Unless the family or the friend or relative of an\nalleged mentally ill person expresses its inability to provide care, an alleged\nmentally ill person should not be admitted to a mental health facility only for\nthe purposes of assessing whether he is so mentally ill that he requires\ntreatment as an in-patient. In the present case, the family of Respondent\nNo.4 was present at IHBAS from 5th November onwards. Throughout, they\nand Respondent No.4 himself were ‗refusing admission&#x27; and were making\nrepeated request for his discharge. The doctors at IHBAS need not have\nwaited till 24t November 2017 to inform the MM that Respondent No.4 was\nnot required to be admitted to IHBAS. They should have done so at the first\navailable opportunity i.e. 5th November 2017. In the circumstances, The\nCourt rejects the submission of IHBAS that its doctors were under some\n‗bonafide confusion&#x27; about the correct legal position.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">Decisions in other jurisdictions\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">117.

This was despite the evidence showing that he was no longer\ndangerous to himself or others and despite undertakings by responsible\npersons offering to care for him if necessary. Agreeing that such\nconfinement was unlawful, the Court asked:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">       &quot;May the State fence in the harmless mentally ill solely to save\n       its citizens from exposure to those whose ways are different?\n       One might as well ask if the State, to avoid public unease, could\n       incarcerate all who are physically unattractive or socially\n       eccentric. Mere public intolerance or animosity cannot\n       constitutionally justify the deprivation of a person&#x27;s physical\n       liberty. In short, a State cannot constitutionally confine, without\n       more, a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving\n       safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and\n       responsible family members or friends.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">118.2 The U.S. Supreme Court further observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">       &quot;The fact that state law may have authorized confinement of the\n       harmless mentally ill does not itself establish a constitutionally\n       adequate purpose for the confinement.... Nor is it enough that\n       Donaldson&#x27;s original confinement was founded upon a\n       constitutionally adequate basis, if in fact it was, because even if\n       his involuntary confinement was initially permissible, it could\n       not constitutionally continue after that basis no longer existed.\n       A finding of &quot;mental illness&quot; alone cannot justify a State&#x27;s\n       locking a person up against his will and keeping him\n       indefinitely in simple custodial confinement. Assuming that that\n       term can be given a reasonably precise content and that the\n       &quot;mentally ill&quot; can be identified with reasonable accuracy, there\n       is still no constitutional basis for confining such persons\n       involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely\n       in freedom.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                               Page 57 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\"> 119.1 In the case of Winterwerp v.

In that context the ECHR was interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 5 (1)</a>\nof the European Convention of Human Rights which read as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">     &quot;Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.

In the written submissions of IHBAS, it is contended that ―ordinarily\nthe court will not interfere with the findings of a doctor or the treatment or\ncourse of action suggested by him as this discretion lies with him\ncompletely.‖ It is added that ―this does not however detract from the court&#x27;s\npower to interfere if the findings or recommendations of the doctor are\nillegal or malafide or shown to be otherwise incorrect.‖ It is submitted that\nthe doctors follow the principle of &quot;best interest treatment&quot;, which means\nthat the primary concern for a doctor is to ascertain what steps he must take\nin the best interest of the health of his patient. It is submitted that the best\ninterest test goes ‗hand in hand&#x27; with the ‗balance test&#x27; which implies that\nthe autonomy of the patient is not taken away ―on extraneous considerations\nbut only in the best interest of the patient.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"145283484\" id=\"span_65\">121.1 The above principle of ‗best interest&#x27; has been explained succinctly by\nthe Court of Appeals in the U.K. in <a href=\"/doc/145283484/\" id=\"a_140\">Regina (n) v.

The challenge was rejected by the Judge of the Queen&#x27;s\nBench Division who inter alia held that he had to be satisfied that the\nproposed treatment was both in the claimant&#x27;s best interests and ―medically\nnecessary‖ for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 3</a> of the Convention.

Austria (1992) EHRR 437 where\nit was held that: ―The established principles of medicine are admittedly in\nprinciple decisive in such cases; as a general rule, a method which is a\ntherapeutic necessity cannot be regarded as inhuman or degrading. The court\nmust nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been\nconvincingly shown to exist.‖\n\n\n121.2 The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment under appeal and\nexplained that ―the fact that there is a responsible body of opinion against\nthe proposed treatment is relevant to the question whether it is in the\npatient&#x27;s best interests or medically necessary, but it is no more than that.\nThe court has to decide in the light of all the evidence in the case whether\nthe treatment should be permitted.‖ The order that the Court will pass in\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/48293891/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 24 (2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 28</a> MHA will have to be on the\nsame basis viz., consider the medical opinion on the principles of both ‗best\ninterests&#x27; and ‗medical necessity&#x27; but ultimately take the final call whether\nthe line of treatment should be permitted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_162\">122.

The\ncurrent jurisprudence in the area of mental health law is that custodial\ntreatment at a mental health facility through involuntary admission process\nis to be avoided. It is to be exercised only where the other less restrictive\nalternatives are not feasible. The interpretation of the MHA and its successor\nlegislation i.e. the MHCA must be consistent with the above legal position\nwhich is encapsulated in the CRPD which India has ratified.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">(ii) The MHA is not a penal statute intended to punish a person for\ndisorderly behaviour in a Court.

Even\nat that stage the MM should first explore the less restrictive alternative of\nascertaining after enquiry under <a href=\"/doc/172273236/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 24 (1) (c)</a> MHA whether the family,\nrelative or friend of such person can take care of such person and bring him\nfor such assessment as and when required.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">(x) For enabling assessment by a medical officer whether an alleged\nmentally ill person requires treatment as an in-patient, it is not necessary for\nthe person to be admitted to a mental health facility. <a href=\"/doc/38020785/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 28 (1)</a> MHA\nuses the expression ‗may&#x27;.

It can be made only in\nexceptional circumstances, viz., where there is no relative or friend of such a\nperson who is willing to take care of such a person and is ready to bring that\nperson for the assessment.

This basic approach\nunfortunately continued under the MHA as well, as we shall presently see.\nThis approach envisaged dealing with such persons in the criminal justice\nsystem. These ‗offenders&#x27; differed from others inasmuch as they did not\nrequire to commit an offence in order to be treated as an offender. They\nwere termed as ‗offenders&#x27; not for what they did but who they were. This\nappellation of a ‗status offender&#x27; attached to the wandering mentally ill\nbecause of who he was and not necessarily what he did.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">125.2 Under the ILA, there were innumerable instances of rampant abuse of\nthe powers to put away ‗inconvenient&#x27; people by labelling them as ‗non-\ncriminal lunatics&#x27; (NCL).

First the Supreme Court by\nan order dated 16th June 1992 appointed two commissioners - Prof. Srinivasa\nMurthy of NIMHANS Bangalore and Prof. Amita Dhanda, a law academic -\nto visit a representative sample of the jails and mental hospitals in West\nBengal and submit a report. The Commissioners were asked to suggest\nguidelines for monitoring the commitment of NCLs and the minimum care\nand treatment facilities that should be made available. The Commissioners&#x27;\nreport titled &quot;Unlock the Padlock&quot;: Mental Health Care in West Bengal,\nfound that 930 persons had been jailed, purportedly under ILA, but on\narbitrary grounds. The process of having a person picked up by the police\nand remanded to the jail under the orders of the Magistrate was done\ncasually, and without any attention to the requirement of the law. There\nwere several instances of misuse of the ILA in connivance with the local\npolice. For instance, one of the inmates was a girl who had been dumped in\nthe jail by her brothers when she insisted on marrying a person of her\nchoice. There were NCLs in every one of the 22 jails in West Bengal. One\nuniform feature was that the inmates were never represented by counsel in\nany of the proceedings under the ILA before the Magistrates.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">125.4 In a landmark judgment dated 17th August 1993 in Sheela Barse v.\nUnion of India (1993) 4 SCC 204 the Supreme Court declared the jailing of\nNCLs to be illegal and unconstitutional.

The Petitioner&#x27;s\nfather was put on observation for ten days and during this time in the\nInstitute of Mental Health, it was found that he did not exhibit any\nabnormality of psychopathology.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">129.4 The Madras High Court then passed orders restoring the Petitioner&#x27;s\nfather to her. Expressing its displeasure over the manner in which 115\npersons were declared mentally ill and taken to the mental health institute\nafter getting reception orders, the Madras High Court observed as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">       ―...It would be better, in fact imperative, that the police, the\n       doctors and the judicial officers put themselves in the shoes of\n       these marginalized groups of persons who are treated as if they\n       are non-persons before they deal with their rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       16. Every person wandering on the street is not mentally ill. The\n       police should not ―round up‖ people as if they were stray cattle\n       and deal with them as such.

This will be possible if the\n       police/NGO or any other person bring up each case individually\n       as and when it arises.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">       17.

It is also apparent that the medical officers have not given\n       the due care and caution before certifying a person as mentally\n       ill. This has several serious legal consequences, depriving them\n       of many rights. For example a mentally unsound person cannot\n       contest an election. There are so many disqualifications that\n       attend a person with mental unsoundness. In this case, the\n       petitioner&#x27;s father has been certified as suffering from bipolar\n       disorder without justification. He is as healthy as the person\n       who first examined him, as the certificate from the Institute of\n       Mental Health, Chennai would show. The doctors cannot\n       mindlessly certify a person as mentally ill. If they need time for\n       examination, they shall insist on that time being given.\n       Importantly, a person does not deserve any less attention than\n       another merely because he/she is found on the street or is poor\n       or is a beggar. The doctors shall also attend immediately to any\n       physical injury that is found on the said person‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">129.5 As far as the Magistrates are concerned, the Madras High Court\nobserved as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">       ―19.

The said Act, provides enormous safeguards\n       prescribing a long procedure to be followed before recognizing\n       or labelling a person as mentally ill. Obviously, such safeguards\n       are due to the fact that labelling a man/woman as a mentally ill\n       person, will, in the prevailing mind set of the society, carry a\n       stigma having adverse impact on his/her life and liberty. It\n       needs no emphasis that labelling a person, either by mistake or\n       due to over zealousness, as a mentally ill person, though in fact,\n       he may not be so, will surely, be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 21</a> of the\n       Constitution of India.

To recapitulate, there have been a series of violations in the present\ncase by the police, the mental health professionals at IHBAS and the MM\nwho ordered Respondent No.4 to be detained at IHBAS. This resulted in the\ninfraction of his fundamental rights to liberty, dignity and privacy under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_206\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and his fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 22</a> of\nthe Constitution. These have been discussed in detail earlier.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">135. In the present case, on every occasion before the Duty MM and MM,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                               Page 80 of 87</span>\n i.e. 3rd, 5th and 20th November 2017, there was no lawyer representing\nRespondent No.4. He was also not informed on any of these dates by the\nMM that he had a right to be represented by a lawyer at state expense. This\nby itself was another violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The orders\npassed against him on those dates were illegal on that ground as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_212\">136. The MMs who dealt with his case did not bother to refer to any law for\nthe source of their power. Their orders on 3rd, 5th and 20th November 2017\nwere without the authority of law. Respondent No.4 ought not to have been\nproceeded against under the MHA at all in the first place. There was no\ndetermination that he had any problem concerning his mental health that\nrequired a reception order to be passed under the MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_213\">137. Even if the MHA were to apply, <a href=\"/doc/148541983/\" id=\"a_209\">Sections 23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/132616426/\" id=\"a_210\">24</a> and <a href=\"/doc/135695155/\" id=\"a_211\">28</a> of the MHA\nwere violated. Neither Respondent No.4 nor his family were informed of the\ngrounds on which he was taken into custody. The family was not informed\nof his being taken before the MM and then to IHBAS. The time limits in\nterms of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/189757541/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 28 (2)</a> MHA for ordering retention of an\nallegedly mentally ill person in a mental health facility for observation were\nbreached. The reception order assed by the MM requiring Respondent No.4\nto be kept at IHBAS was without the certificate of a medical officer that he\nwas mentally ill to such an extent that he required treatment as an in-patient.\n<a href=\"/doc/48293891/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 24 (2)</a> MHA was violated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">138. IHBAS failed to inform the MM, in good time, that the orders dated 3rd,\n5th and 20th November 2017 were without the authority of law. IHBAS\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                             Page 81 of 87</span>\n allowed the illegality of the detention of Respondent No.4 to continue. In\nexamining Respondent No.4 in order to determine whether he was in need of\ncare and treatment for any mentally illness as an in-patient, the ‗best\ninterests&#x27; principle was not followed by the doctors at IHBAS. Despite the\npresence of his family, the least restrictive alternatives were not explored by\nthem. The mere fact that Respondent No.4 may have talked loudly, behaved\nauthoritatively, repeated himself or had ‗grandiose ideas&#x27; did not make him\na ‗mentally ill person&#x27; within the meaning of the MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">139. Apart from the fact that Respondent No.4 was not represented by a\nlawyer at any of the hearings before the MM, he was not offered legal\nservices during his stay at IHBAS. He was not informed by IHBAS that\nsuch services were available. <a href=\"/doc/69716534/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 91</a> MHA was violated. Respondent\nNo.4, a heart patient, was subject to tremendous stress on account of his\nillegal confinement at IHBAS. In short there was a cascade of violations that\nhad a domino effect on Respondent No.4 denuding him of his rights to life,\nliberty, dignity and privacy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">Scope of the habeas corpus jurisdiction\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">140. In its habeas corpus jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution,\nthe task of a High Court does not necessarily end with the termination of the\nillegal detention of a person. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1506852\" id=\"span_102\">In <a href=\"/doc/1506852/\" id=\"a_216\">Arvinder Singh Bagga v.

This was apart from the criminal or\ncivil liability which may be pursued in the ordinary course.

Luithukla (1999) 9 SCC 273, the Supreme Court\nwas in its habeas corpus jurisdiction considering the question of\ncompensation for extra judicial killing. It observed thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">       ―9. As to the plea on behalf of the appellants that the affidavits\n       on their behalf should not have been rejected by the High\n       Court without a factual enquiry, we would comment that the\n       High Court ought to have added that it was open to the first\n       respondent to file a suit against the appellants to claim\n       damages, if so advised. In that event a trial on facts would\n       have been necessary and would have taken place. As it is,\n       Budha Singh was last seen in the company of security forces,\n       now 16 years ago. The security forces must, therefore, be held\n       to be liable to make payment of the aforestated nominal\n       amount of rupees one lakh to the 1st respondent‖.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_219\">142. In view of the above legal position, the Court proposes hereafter to\nissue certain directions by way of consequential reliefs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">Afterword\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">143. The genesis of the problem that Respondent No.4 faced was the case\nbefore the MACT which he was defending as party in person. The ten year\nwait had obviously tested his limits. Litigation fatigue had set in. Every\nday&#x27;s wait for a litigant who has had to spend a decade defending a case is\nbound to aggravate his litigation neurosis.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">W.P.(C) No.3317/2017                                               Page 83 of 87</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_222\"> 144. The annoyance caused to the presiding Judge of the MACT was not\nunexpected. The judicial system is overburdened. Judges too are humans.\nMost of them are overworked. Their patience gets tested often, particularly\nby litigants in person who, in the process of navigating the legal maze on\ntheir own, disrupt the orderly functioning of the Court. However, being part\nof an imperfect judicial system, a judge must be prepared for an outburst,\nevery now and then, from a disgruntled user of the system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">145. Where a person&#x27;s behaviour disrupts the orderly proceedings in a\nCourt, and persuasion fails, the presiding judge can possibly requisition the\nsecurity apparatus for assistance. At all times, the measures adopted will\nhave to proportionate. The absolute minimum coercion ensuring the dignity\nof the person sought to be removed, consistent with the limits set by the law,\nshould be deployed. If the Court considers prima facie that the conduct of\nthe person constitutes contempt of the court, then recourse can be had to the\nprocedure set out in the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_218\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> 1971.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">146. However, to get the police to take such person into custody and take\nhim away for medical examination, without any order to that effect, is not an\noption available in law. Likewise, for the MM to pass a reception order\nsending such person to a mental health facility for observation, without\nreferring to any law or source of judicial power is unacceptable.\nIndiscriminate use of a non-existent judicial power is bound to invite\nopprobrium and invalidation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">147.
