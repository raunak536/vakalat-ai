No doubt it is by a fiction that such an\n                assumption is made. But such a fiction was found\n                necessary for practical purposes. <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 3</a> of the Penal\n                Code was found insufficient for police authorities to\n                investigate into the offence. It was in the aforesaid\n                context that Section 188 has been incorporated in the\n                Procedure Code. That section reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                &quot;188. Offence committed outside India.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                When an offence is committed outside India.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                (a) by a citizen of India, whether on the high seas or\n                elsewhere; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                (b) by a person, not being such citizen on any ship or\n                aircraft registered in India, he may be dealt with in\n                respect of such offence as if it had been committed at any\n                place within India at which he may be found:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                Provided that, notwithstanding anything in any of the\n         preceding sections of this Chapter, no such offence shall be\n         inquired into or tried in India except with the previous sanction\n         of the Central Government.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">         No doubt, Section 188 concerns as to how to deal with a person\n         who has committed an offence outside India. Since the proviso\n         casts an obligation to obtain previous sanction of the Central\n         Government to inquire into and try such person, the section\n         has a message that for the pre-inquiry stage no such sanction\n         is needed. If during pre-inquiry stage any offender can be dealt\n         with (without such sanction) what could be the contours of that\n         stage? I have no doubt that the pre-inquiry stage substantially\n         relates to investigation of the crime. If there is any stage in\n         which an offender can be dealt with before commencement of\n         inquiry, it must be the investigation stage.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1339131\" id=\"span_13\">6.

Supreme\n      Court observed that &quot;extradition is the surrender by one State\n      to another of a person desired to be dealt with for crimes of\n      which he has been accused or convicted and which are\n      justiciable in courts of the other State&quot;. Such extradition\n      proceedings are contemplated to get down the person\n      concerned to this country to be dealt with thereafter.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">      7. The upshot is that Sub-Inspector of Tanur Police Station can\n      conduct investigation into the offence notwithstanding the\n      place of occurrence being Sharjah because the person on whom\n      the focus of suspicion turns is laid to be a citizen of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">33.         Learned Trial Court has misread the entire\nevidence leading to miscarriage of justice.

The police has also\ntried to secure independent witnesses but no independent\nwitness was available.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">34.         Learned Trial Court has perversely held the age\nof the prosecutrix to be major, though admittedly, she was\nminor.

The prosecutrix has categorically stated that the\nrespondent has molested her in the bus while travelling\nfrom Atariya to Mahendra Nagar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_43\">36.         The prosecution has proved that the respondent\nwas standing near the barrage on the Indian side of the\nborder. It was also not necessary for the prosecution to find\nout the persons, who were sitting on the horse cart at the\nrelevant time. There was no necessity of independent\nwitnesses at the time of nabbing the prosecutrix. In case,\nthe police has tried to associate independent witnesses, the\nculprit could escape from the spot.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">37.         It has come in the statement of PW6 Meenakshi\nNautiyal that she moved the application before the CJM for\nrecording the statement of prosecutrix.

The statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 164</a> of\nCr.P.C. though, is not substantive piece of evidence but still\nit has a great corroborative value, more particularly, when\nthere is no contradiction in the statement recorded under\n<a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 164</a> of Cr.P.C. and the deposition before learned\nTrial Court on essential facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">40.

The Vienna Forum set the path for future anti-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">            trafficking   efforts.   The    Chairperson&#x27;s    summary\n            emphasized the need to aggressively address all forms of\n            exploitation, including forced labour, and underscored\n            UN.GIFT&#x27;s critical role in continuing to build and expand\n            alliances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_71\">            73. As stated by the Chairperson, the Vienna Forum met\n            its immediate objectives but action must follow through\n            technical assistance and international cooperation -\n            essential for national capacity building for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                  21</span>\n\n\n         implementation of the UNTOC and the Trafficking\n         Protocol. Every panel and workshop produced a number\n         of recommendations and proposals for future actions,\n         many expressing common themes for action across topic\n         areas.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">         74. Emphasis was placed on the need for adequate\n         national legislation to cover all aspects of trafficking; this\n         included ratifying and implementing the Trafficking\n         Protocol and other relevant international instruments.\n         Within this context, virtually all panels and workshops\n         focused on the need for a victim-centred, human rights\n         approach to preventing and combating trafficking in\n         persons with an understanding that supporting victims\n         can also positively impact criminal justice actions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">         75. Increased research was generally agreed on as the\n         cornerstone of more effective action against trafficking in\n         persons. More knowledge is necessary to fill in the\n         crucial information gaps that will allow the design of\n         adequate anti-trafficking policies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">         76. Participants highlighted the need for increased\n         cooperation between relevant agencies, civil society and\n         the private sector within countries and on an\n         international level. UN.GIFT was seen as an important\n         facilitator for expanding cooperative and innovative\n         alliances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">         77. There was a call for a greater effort to confront all\n         aspects of trafficking, including sexual exploitation and\n         forced labour. Labour market stakeholders employers&#x27;\n         organizations, trade unions, businesses and others -\n         need to become more active partners in ensuring labour\n         rights and labour protections to prevent forced labour\n         and address it where it already exists.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_76\">         78. Awareness-raising was a cross-cutting activity for all\n         aspects of combating trafficking in persons. Participants\n         in virtually every panel and workshop saw value in\n         awareness-raising activities, whether for front-line law\n         enforcement to aid in victim identification, to enlighten\n         private sector businesses or to alert potential victims and\n         the general public.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">         79. Finally, as expressed by many panellists and\n         speakers, several critical issues were identified that\n         remain to be addressed. Research needs to lead to\n         achievement indicators that can be used as a baseline\n         against which appropriate monitoring and evaluation\n         mechanisms can be developed and implemented. Also,\n         the question of the nature of appropriate monitoring\n         mechanisms needs to be more thoroughly addressed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">         80. There was widespread agreement that the root\n         causes of human trafficking must be confronted using a\n         balanced approach, but increased attention needs to be\n         placed on how to reduce demand for trafficked persons in\n         destination countries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">         81. The Chairperson expressed the sentiment of\n         participants in the Chairperson&#x27;s summary by pointing\n         out that to follow up on the momentum generated by the\n         Vienna Forum, there is an obligation to convert dialogue\n         it into action to eradicate human trafficking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">50.

Under President Obama, DOL has\n          intensified its antitrafficking efforts, but as the State\n          Department&#x27;s 2011 Trafficking in Persons report noted,\n          &quot;DOL investigators have not yet been funded, trained, or\n          given the mandate to focus on human trafficking\n          cases.&quot;181 In a March 2012 update, the State\n          Department noted that DOL was still &quot;finalizing plans to\n          provide basic awareness training to key enforcement field\n          staff throughout the country in an effort to enhance the\n          capability to detect and refer cases of trafficking in\n          persons.&quot;182 Subsequent authorizations of the TVPA\n          should expand DOL&#x27;s regulatory and enforcement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                   33</span>\n\n\n            authority, permitting DOL to take advantage of its unique\n            opportunity to counteract the biasing influences of\n            antiprostitution and border control forces on the federal\n            government&#x27;s response to human trafficking.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">53.

Human Trafficking in South Asian Region\n             Human trafficking has emerged as a social dilemma in\n      the South Asian region. The region as a whole has made\n      certain efforts to combat human trafficking but lack of\n      information and statistics on the number of people victimized\n      and pattern of trafficking made it more complex issue.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">      According to the (International Journal of Gynaecology &amp;\n      Obstetrics&#x27; 2006), every year 1 to 2 million women, men and\n      children are trafficked worldwide, around 225,000 of them are\n      from SAARC region (Concept Paper of Research Study on\n      Human Trafficking: 2012). Other estimates show that over the\n      last 30 years, trafficking for sexual exploitation alone has\n      victimized some 30 million Asian women and children. SAARC\n      Convention on &quot;Preventing and Combating the Trafficking in\n      Women and Children for Prostitution&quot; is seen as a milestone on\n      the path to coordinate interventions against trafficking at the\n      sub-regional level (Concept Paper of Research Study on Human\n      Trafficking: 2012). South Asia is witnessing an alarming trend\n      of increasingly younger girls being trafficked into the sex trade.\n      The majority of trafficking in India, both trans-border and in\n      country, happens for the purpose of sex work, and over 60% of\n      those trafficked into sex work are adolescent girls in the age\n      group of 12--16 years (UNDP, 2005). In many Indian cities, girl\n      children as young as eight or nine are sold at auctions. There\n      are an estimated 2,000,000 prostitutes in India and 60% of\n      these women in prostitution in Mumbai are HIV positive (Daily\n      Times Monitor: 2007). One common myth fuelling the demand\n      for young girls in South Asia is that sex with a virgin can cure\n      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. In South\n      Asia, women are now reported to constitute up to 35% of new\n      HIV infections (UNAIDS, 2000). A complex web of socio-cultural\n      and macro-economic factors affect women&#x27;s vulnerability to\n      HIV, including poverty, migration, urbanization, gender\n      inequalities compounded by women&#x27;s lack of autonomy, abuse\n      within and outside families, insufficient access to healthcare\n      services, violence and ethnicity. Human trafficking has\n      substantial social, economic and health impacts for instance\n      deprivations from various assets and basic rights, loss of\n      livelihood, suffering from HIV/AIDS etc. There are both,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                            34</span>\n\n\ndemand and supply side factors contributing to human\ntrafficking. On the demand side poverty, social and cultural\npractices such as gender discrimination, impact of\nglobalisation on livelihood (traditional jobs, caste/tribes,\nvulnerability of women children and men). On the other hand,\nsupply side factors include demand of cheap labour and\nincreased level of migrant workers. The worst of all factors is\nthe lack of implementations of the anti-trafficking laws. Where\nlaws are implemented, the punishments are not enough to put\na positive effect on trafficking sensitization programs for\ngeneral public and specifically for stakeholders. SAARC\nGovernments should provide resources for training, technical\nassistance, and auditing to ensure that trafficking is fully\neradicated from their supply chains. South Asia has shown\nthat with modest amounts of funding and focused advocacy,\ntargeting law enforcement could bring dramatic changes in the\nresponse of &quot;governance structures&quot; to improve the situation.\n5.1. India\n       India is a source, destination, and transit country for\nmen, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex\ntrafficking. The forced labour of millions of its citizens\nconstitutes India&#x27;s largest trafficking problem; men, women,\nand children in debt bondage are forced to work in industries\nsuch as brick kilns, rice mills, agriculture, and embroidery\nfactories. A common characteristic of bonded labour is the use\nof physical and sexual violence as coercive tools. Ninety per\ncent of trafficking in India is internal (Trafficking in Persons\nReport: 2010, Trafficking in Persons Report: 2013), and those\nfrom India&#x27;s most disadvantaged social strata, including the\nlowest castes, are most vulnerable. Children are also subjected\nto forced labour as factory workers, domestic servants, beggars,\nagricultural workers, and to a lesser extent, in some areas of\nrural Uttar Pradesh as carpet weavers. There were new reports\nabout the continued forced labour of children in hybrid cotton\nseed plots in Gujarat, and reports that forced labour may be\npresent in the Sumangali scheme in Tamil Nadu, in which\nemployers pay young women a lump sum to be used for a\ndowry at the end of a three-year term (Samu K.: 2012). An\nincreasing number of job placement agencies lure adults and\nchildren for forced labour or sex trafficking under false\npromises of employment. Indian boys from Bihar were\nincreasingly subjected to forced labour in embroidery factories\nin Nepal (2013 Trafficking in Persons Report - India: 2013).\nWomen and girls are trafficked within the country for the\npurposes of forced prostitution. Religious pilgrimage centres\nand cities popular for tourism continue to be vulnerable to\nchild sex tourism. Women and girls from Nepal and\nBangladesh, and an increasing number of females from\nUzbekistan, Ukraine, and Russia, are also subjected to sex\ntrafficking in India (Trafficking in Persons Report, India:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">2012)There were increasing reports of females from north-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">eastern states and Odisha subjected to servile marriages in\nstates with low female-to-male child sex ratios, including\nHaryana and Punjab, and also reports of girls subjected to\ntransactional sexual exploitation in the Middle East under the\nguise of temporary marriages (Journalism of Courage- Archive:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">2013). Maoist armed groups known as the Naxalites forcibly\nrecruited children into their ranks. Establishments of sex\ntrafficking are moving from more traditional locations - such as\nbrothels - to locations that are harder to find, and are also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                  35</span>\n\n\n      shifting from urban areas to rural areas, where there is less\n      detection. 2.5% of prostitutes in India are Nepalese, and 2.7%\n      are Bangladeshi. In India, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,\n      Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are considered &quot;high supply\n      zones&quot; for women in prostitution (Menon Meena (2011).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">      Bijapur, Belgaum and Kolhapur are common districts from\n      which women migrate to the big cities, as part of an organised\n      trafficking network. The number of women and children in sex\n      work in India is stated to be between 70,000 and 1 million. Of\n      these, 30% are below 20 year of age. Nearly 15% began sex\n      work when they were below 15, and 25 per cent entered\n      between 15 and 18 years (UN.GIFT:2008). News published in\n      the Hindustan Times (11th October, 2012) states that around\n      20 children go missing in Delhi every day. Around eight of\n      them- or 40% are never seen again. According to police\n      statistics, &quot;most children who go missing in Delhi end up in\n      traffickers hands (Hindustan Times: 2012) Children below eight\n      years are forced into begging. The older ones are pushed into\n      child labour. Organized gangs kidnap minors and transport\n      them to other cities. A rough estimate prepared in 2008 by an\n      NGO, End Children&#x27;s Prostitution in South Asian tourism,\n      reveals that there are around 2 million prostitutes in India,\n      20% of them being minors.&quot; There are number of women from\n      neighbouring countries trafficked to India. It has been reported\n      that there are 1000 to 10,000 women found in Kolkata\n      brothels, 70% were from Bangladesh (Daw Bianca: 2008).\n      There is also 1, 00,000 to 1,60,000 Nepali girls in Indian\n      brothels, with about 5,000 to 7,000 girls being sold every\n      year(Coomaraswamy Radhika:1997).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">55.

Initiatives and Actions by South Asian Countries\n             In the recent years, various initiatives and programs in\n      the countries of South Asia have begun addressing the problem\n      of human trafficking, especially in women and children.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">      Governments are becoming active, although most programs are\n      carried out by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with a\n      focus on local communities. Concerted efforts have also been\n      undertaken at the sub-regional level to combat human\n      trafficking in South Asia. During the 11th SAARC (South Asian\n      Association for Regional Co-operation) Summit, which was held\n      in January 2002 in Kathmandu, the seven SAARC member\n      States (Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan\n      and the Maldives) signed the SAARC Convention on Preventing\n      and Combating the Trafficking in Women and Children for\n      Prostitution (Huda S.:2006). The scope of this Convention is to\n      promote cooperation amongst member States to effectively deal\n      with various aspects of prevention, interdiction and\n      suppression of trafficking in women and children; repatriation\n      and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking, and reventing the\n      use of women and children in international prostitution\n      networks, particularly where the SAARC member countries are\n      the countries of origin, transit and destination. In October\n      2004, all the eight governments in South Asia unanimously\n      adopted Five Points for further actions as urgent imperatives.\n      Briefly, these include:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                   36</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       · Conduct better research into the demand that underpins\n      sexual abuse and exploitation of children, including the abuse\n      that results from home grown demand.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      · Reinforce protection measures through the adoption of\n      National Action Plans covering sexual abuse, exploitation and\n      trafficking.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">      · Develop compatible databases of abused, exploited and\n      trafficked children with information on age, gender and\n      nationality that would allow better identification of national\n      trends and indicators.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">      · Work with NGO, UN and multilateral partners to develop\n      indicators of impact and effectiveness and identify successful\n      initiatives and good practices.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">      · Work with children and young people to ensure their insights\n      in policy formation and actions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">      6.1. Nepal&#x27;s Response and Initiatives on Human Trafficking\n             Nepali government increased its efforts to prevent human\n      trafficking. Nepal prohibits most - but not all - forms of\n      trafficking in persons, including the selling of human beings\n      and forced prostitution, through its Human Trafficking and\n      Transportation Control Act (2007) and Regulation (2008)\n      (HTTCA). (Country Narratives: Countries N Through Z) The\n      HTTCA also prohibits other offenses that do not constitute\n      human trafficking, such as people smuggling and purchasing\n      commercial sex. Prescribed penalties range from 10 to 20 years&#x27;\n      imprisonment,       which    are    sufficiently   stringent   and\n      commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes,\n      such as rape. The Bonded Labour (Prohibition) Act (2002)\n      prohibits bonded labour but has no penalties. In August 2011,\n      the National Committee for Controlling Human Trafficking\n      established a secretariat and the government appointed a\n      coordinator under the oversight of a joint (Trafficking in\n      Persons Report: 2012).

NGOs state that the majority of the District\n      Committees for Controlling Human Trafficking do not function\n      well or are not active. The lack of political stability and\n      resources has hampered translating commitments into actions.\n      The prime minister visited a leading anti-trafficking NGO in\n      October 2011. The government endorsed the National Plan of\n      Action on Trafficking in Persons in March 2012. Many Nepali\n      girls are trafficked to India as forced labour. In order to combat\n      this issue, a major step forward was taken to prevent and\n      control human trafficking with both India and Nepal having\n      ratified the United Nations Convention on ransnational\n      Organized Crime (UNTOC), while India also ratified the\n      Trafficking Protocol, supplementing the UNTOC. In this\n      backdrop, the first ever bilateral meeting was organized on 3\n      and 4 May 2012 in Kathmandu, to train law enforcement\n      officials from India and Nepal on countering trafficking for\n      forced labour(South Asia Newsletter:2012). The workshop was\n      organized by UNODC in partnership with the International\n      Labour Organization (ILO), under a project titled &#x27;Reducing\n      trafficking of women and girls for domestic work in Nepal and\n      India,&#x27; supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and\n      International       Development        (DFID)      (South     Asia\n      Newsletter:2012).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\">56.

Section 177 postulates that ordinarily offence\n          shall be inquired into and tried by a court within whose\n          local jurisdiction it was committed. Section 178, inter\n          alia, deals with situations when it is uncertain in which\n          of several local areas, an offence is committed or partly\n          committed in one area and partly in another. The section\n          provides that the offence can be inquired into or tried by\n          a court having jurisdiction over any of the local areas\n          mentioned therein. Under Section 179, offence is triable\n          where act is done or consequences thereof ensued.\n          Section 180 deals with the place of trial where act is an\n          offence by reason of its relation to other offence. It\n          provides that the first-mentioned offence may be inquired\n          into or tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction\n          either act was done. In all these sections, for jurisdiction\n          the emphasis is on the place where the offence has been\n          committed. There is, however, a departure under Section\n          181(1) where additionally place of trial can also be the\n          place where the accused is found, besides the court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                       43</span>\n\n\nwithin whose jurisdiction the offence was committed. But\nthe said section deals with offences committed by those\nwho are likely to be on the move which is evident from\nthe nature of offences mentioned in the section. Section\n181(1) is in respect of the offences where the offenders\nare not normally located at a fixed place and that\nexplains the departure. Section 183 deals with offences\ncommitted during journey or voyage. Section 186 deals\nwith situation where two or more courts take cognizance\nof the same offence and in case of doubt as to which one\nof the courts has jurisdiction to proceed further, the High\nCourt decides the matter. Section 187 deals with a\nsituation where a person within the local jurisdiction of a\nMagistrate has committed an offence outside such\njurisdiction. The Magistrate can compel such a person to\nappear before him and then send him to the Magistrate\nwhich has jurisdiction to inquire into or try such offence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">9. Under the aforesaid circumstances, the expression\nabovenoted in Section 188 is to be construed. The same\nexpression was also there in the old Code. From the\nscheme of Chapter XIII of the Code, it is clear that\nneither the place of business nor place of residence of the\npetitioner and for that matter of even the complainant is\nof any relevance. The relevant factor is the place of\ncommission of offence. By legal fiction, Section 188\nwhich deals with offence committed outside India, makes\nthe place at which the offender may be found, to be a\nplace of commission of offence. Section 188 proceeds on\nthe basis that a fugitive from justice may be found\nanywhere in India. The finding of the accused has to be\nby the court where the accused appears. From the plain\nand clear language of the section, it is evident that the\nfinding of the accused cannot be by the complainant or\nthe police. Further, it is not expected that a victim of an\noffence which was committed outside India should come\nto India and first try to ascertain where the accused is or\nmay be and then approach that court. The convenience\nof such a victim is of importance. That has been kept in\nview by Section 188 of the Code. A victim may come to\nIndia and approach any court convenient to him and file\ncomplaint in respect of offence committed abroad by an\nIndian. The convenience of a person who is hiding after\ncommitting offence abroad and is a fugitive from justice\nis not relevant. It is in this context, the expression in\nquestion has to be interpreted. Section 188 has been the\nsubject-matter of interpretation for about 150 years.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">12. In Empress v. Maganlal2 decided in the year 1882\ninterpreting the word &quot;found&quot;, it was opined that it was\nused to confer the jurisdiction on the court of a place\nwhere the accused is actually found i.e. produced before\nthe court and not where a person is discovered. In other\nwords, it would mean that an accused may be discovered\nby the police at a place not within the jurisdiction of the\ncourt inquiring or trying but that is not the place\ncontemplated by Section 188. For the purpose of\njurisdiction, it would be the court where he is actually\nproduced or appears which can be said to have found\nhim. As earlier stated, the finding of the accused is to be\nby the court inquiring or trying and not by the police.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                 44</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"255357\" id=\"span_48\">13. The aforesaid decisions were referred to and relied\n          upon in <a href=\"/doc/255357/\" id=\"a_84\">Emperor v. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar3</a>. The\n          contention that the accused is charged before a\n          Magistrate with an offence under the Penal Code and was\n          brought there illegally from a foreign country was\n          rejected. An illustration was given in that -- a man\n          commits a crime, say murder, in a country but he\n          escapes to some other country before he is apprehended,\n          the police finding him in some other country, brings him\n          to England and produces him before a Magistrate. It\n          would not be open to the Magistrate to refuse to commit\n          him. The Court held that: (ILR p. 229)\n                        &quot;If he were brought here for trial, it would\n                 not be a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court that\n                 he had escaped from justice, and that by some\n                 illegal means he had been brought back.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">                 14. The last decision on interpretation of Section\n          188 is of Justice Vivian Bose in Sahebrao Bajirao v.\n          Suryabhan Ziblaji4. The question posed was as to who is\n          to do the &quot;finding&quot;. Learned Judge held that the word\n          &quot;found&quot; in Section 188 means found by the court at the\n          time when the matter comes up for trial, that is to say,\n          any court which is otherwise competent to try the offence\n          can take seisin the moment the accused appears in its\n          presence. How the accused gets there is immaterial. It\n          does not matter whether he comes voluntarily or in\n          answer to summons or under illegal arrest. It is enough\n          that the court should find him present when it comes to\n          take up the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">          15. In our opinion, the law has been correctly enunciated\n          in the aforesaid case. The scheme underlying Section 188\n          is to dispel any objection or plea of want of jurisdiction at\n          the behest of a fugitive who has committed an offence in\n          any other country. If such a person is found anywhere in\n          India, the offence can be inquired into and tried by any\n          court that may be approached by the victim. The victim\n          who has suffered at the hands of the accused on a\n          foreign land can complain about the offence to a court,\n          otherwise competent, which he may find convenient. The\n          convenience is of the victim and not that of the accused.\n          It is not the requirement of Section 188 that the victim\n          shall state in the complaint as to which place the\n          accused may be found. It is enough to allege that the\n          accused may be found in India. The court where the\n          complaint may be filed and the accused either appears\n          voluntarily pursuant to issue of process or is brought\n          before it involuntarily in execution of warrants, would be\n          the competent court within the meaning of Section 188 of\n          the Code as that court would find the accused before him\n          when he appears. The finding has to be by the court. It\n          has neither to be by the complainant nor by the police.\n          The section deems the offence to be committed within the\n          jurisdiction of the court where the accused may be\n          found.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">69.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191873\" id=\"span_49\">In 1993 Cr.L.J. 1098, in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/191873/\" id=\"a_85\">Remia &amp;\nanother vs. Sub-Inspector of Police &amp; others</a>&quot;, learned Single\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                  45</span>\n\n\nJudge of Hon.

The said\n           section, no doubt, deals with inquiries and trials and\n           does not deal with investigation. Even otherwise, the\n           provision envisages only the general principle which is\n           subject to exceptions.

They are <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_90\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_91\">4</a> of the\n           Penal Code. <a href=\"/doc/1507082/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 3</a> of the I.P.C. reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">                 &quot;Any person liable, by any Indian law, to be tried\n           for an offence committed beyond India, shall be dealt\n           with according to the provisions of this Code for any act\n           committed beyond India in the same manner as if such\n           act had been committed within India.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_182\">           Section 4 -&quot;The provisions of this Code apply also to any\n           offence committed by-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\">                        (1) any citizen of India in any place without\n                 and beyond India;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">                 (2) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in\n                 India wherever it may be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">                 Explanation.- In this section the word &quot;offence&quot;\n           includes every act committed outside India which, if\n           committed in India, would be punishable under this\n           Code.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">           5. <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 3</a> of the Penal Code helps the (authorities in\n           India to proceed by treating the offence as one committed\n           within India. No doubt it is by a fiction that such an\n           assumption is made. But such a fiction was found\n           necessary for practical purposes. <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 3</a> of the Penal\n           Code was found insufficient for police authorities to\n           investigate into the offence. It was in the aforesaid\n           context that Section 188 has been incorporated in the\n           Procedure Code. That section reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">           &quot;188. Offence committed outside India.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">           When an offence is committed outside India.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">           (a) by a citizen of India, whether on the high seas or\n           elsewhere; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">           (b) by a person, not being such citizen on any ship or\n           aircraft registered in India, he may be dealt with in\n           respect of such offence as if it had been committed at any\n           place within India at which he may be found:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">           Provided that, notwithstanding anything in any of the\n    preceding sections of this Chapter, no such offence shall be\n    inquired into or tried in India except with the previous sanction\n    of the Central Government.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">    No doubt, Section 188 concerns as to how to deal with a person\n    who has committed an offence outside India. Since the proviso\n    casts an obligation to obtain previous sanction of the Central\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                   46</span>\n\n\n      Government to inquire into and try such person, the section\n      has a message that for the pre-inquiry stage no such sanction\n      is needed. If during pre-inquiry stage any offender can be dealt\n      with (without such sanction) what could be the contours of that\n      stage? I have no doubt that the pre-inquiry stage substantially\n      relates to investigation of the crime. If there is any stage in\n      which an offender can be dealt with before commencement of\n      inquiry, it must be the investigation stage.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1339131\" id=\"span_54\">6. During such investigation stage, if the person (known or\n      reasonably suspected to be the offender having committed the\n      offence outside India) is not available in India, extradition\n      proceedings may have to be resorted to (vide <a href=\"/doc/1339131/\" id=\"a_95\">State of W.B. v.\n      Jugal Kishore</a>, AIR 1969 SC 1171: 1969 Cri LJ 1559). Supreme\n      Court observed that &quot;extradition is the surrender by one State\n      to another of a person desired to be dealt with for crimes of\n      which he has been accused or convicted and which are\n      justiciable in courts of the other State&quot;. Such extradition\n      proceedings are contemplated to get down the person\n      concerned to this country to be dealt with thereafter.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_188\">      7. The upshot is that Sub-Inspector of Tanur Police Station can\n      conduct investigation into the offence notwithstanding the\n      place of occurrence being Sharjah because the person on whom\n      the focus of suspicion turns is laid to be a citizen of India.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">70.

The Protocol to the other Covenant i.e., the\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights entered into force on\nMarch 23, 1976. India became a party to the Covenant as\nwell as Protocol to it.

It is evident from the treaty that the movement of\ncitizens across the country is unrestricted but still to check\nthe human trafficking, more particularly of minor girls, the\nCentral Agencies, local agencies should at least insist for\nproper    verification     and    identity    of    children     more\nparticularly, minor girls coming to India. The antecedents\nshould be verified and counter checking be made from the\nauthorities in Nepal. The agency should ensure that the\nchildren who are travelling to India without their legal\nguardian should be properly counseled and telephone\nnumbers of their guardian should be taken along with the\npermanent address to be verified and re-verified from the\ncounterpart agencies of Nepal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">78.         In the news item published under the caption\n&quot;Government sitting on national global trafficking racket in\nUttarkhand&quot;, published in the daily newspaper &quot;Times of\nIndia&quot;, dated 05.12.2017. It is reported that the then\nAdditional Secretary of the State Social Welfare Department\nhas prepared the report regarding &#x27;rampant child trafficking\ngoing on in the state&#x27;. He had highlighted several points\nwhich required investigation including criminal acts against\nthe children at the Shishu Niketan shelter home.                 It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                              50</span>\n\n\nstated in the report that the children brought to the shelter\nhomes were sent to work at different houses in Dehradun\nand Noida as a domestic help. However, till date, no FIR\nhas been registered against the persons employed in the\nShishu Niketan for their criminal acts. There is also\nreference of girls from Nepal and Jharkhand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">79.       According to National Crime Records Bureau\nreport, 208 females and 216 males are missing in the\nprevious years in the State of Uttarakhand, below the age of\n18 years.

All concrete steps are required to be taken\nto trace out the missing children.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_202\">81.       The importation of girls and their kidnapping for\nexploitation is a heinous crime against the Society. It is an\norganized crime. There should be strictness against the\npersons who are indulging in this heinous act. The\nconcerned authorities should invoke provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_109\">Money\nLaundering Act, 2008</a>, since the Immoral Trafficking\nPrevention Act, 1986 has been included as Para 7 of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                      51</span>\n\n\nSchedule   prepared         under     <a href=\"/doc/127722677/\" id=\"a_110\">Section       2(y)</a>    and   also    by\nattachment of their property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">82.

However, before parting with the judgment, we\ndeem it proper to issue the following mandatory directions\nto the State Government/other agencies: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">A.         All the Central agencies, local agencies in the\nState of Uttarakhand should insist for proper verification\nand   identity    of    children,         more   particularly,         minor\ngirls/women coming to India from Nepal.

All public prosecutors, police officers should be\nadequately trained. Legal aid should be provided to the\nvictims of human trafficking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">H.        The State should take preventive measures to\ncheck the     trafficking of children from the State of\nUttarakhand by improving the socio-economic conditions of\nthe areas which are vulnerable to human trafficking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_212\">I.        The State Government is directed to provide safe\nand proper accommodation for the victims of human\ntrafficking. They should be provided basic health care. They\nshould be properly counseled by a psychiatrist. The Court\nshould appoint a legal guardian of an unaccompanied\nminor. His/her identity should be established. Steps\nshould be taken to locate his/her family in the interest of\nthe child. The trial under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_118\">Sections 366(B)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1153041/\" id=\"a_119\">370</a> IPC\nshould be held in camera.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">J.

The Court can take judicial notice of the fact that\nthe minors are kidnapped by the organized gangs to force\nthem into beggary. The Police Department should conduct\nDNAs of the parents as well as of the children of the\nbeggars to ensure that the children found in their company\nare their own children. The Court again recommends that\nthe begging should be banned throughout the State of\nUttarakhand by bringing suitable legislation on the analogy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                     54</span>\n\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/132270442/\" id=\"a_120\">Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Beggary Act, 1975</a>.

The State Government is directed to constitute\nspecial wing to locate/trace and restore the missing boys\nand girls with their lawful guardian. The State Government\nis also directed to setup Photo Bank Data to trace the\nmissing children and to display it on their official website.\nThe Police Department is also directed to have effective\nliaisoning with the adjoining States as well as with the\nCentral agencies. The Police Department should flash the\nphotographs of missing children at the earliest at bus\nstands, railway stations. The FIRs in the cases of missing\nchildren should be registered promptly and investigated in\na time bound manner. The photographs of the missing\nchildren should also be predominantly displayed in the\nregional as well as national newspapers and also on\ntelevision. It is a very sensitive issue. The newspapers and\nnews channels should reasonably charge the police for\ndisplaying the photographs of the missing children under\ncorporate social responsibility. The State should also\ninvolve the Gram Panchayats at the grass-root level to trace\nthe missing children.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">87.
