This petition seeks quashing of seizure memo and for\n\npermitting clearance of goods seized and detained by the Customs\n\nAuthorities under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1\">Customs Act, 1962</a> (&#x27;the Act&#x27;).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">2.            The case set out in the petition is that the petitioner imported\n\n&#x27;Heavy Melting Steel Scrap&#x27; (HMSS)          from South Africa under Open\n\nGeneral Licence Scheme subject to Nil basic customs duty. The petitioner\n\nfiled seven bills of entry for clearing the said goods in 31 containers on\n\ndifferent dates in January 2011 but the custom authorities did not allow\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> CWP No.6732 of 2011                                                       2</span>\n\n\nclearance on the ground that the material so imported was not scrap but re-\n\nrollable metal attracting 5% basic custom duty. The goods were seized\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 110</a> of the Act. The goods were physically examined and\n\nopinion of Chartered Engineers was taken to the effect that a part of\n\nconsignment contained moon cut pieces while the remaining was old rusty\n\nbut not used pipes. The petitioner deposited the amount of duty as per\n\nvaluation assessed by the said Chartered Engineers and sought provisional\n\nrelease of the goods to avoid demurrage charges. The petitioner also\n\nrequested for mutilation of the consignment. The goods having not been\n\nreleased, this petition has been filed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">3.           Main contention raised in the petition is that when a bill of\n\nentry is filed under <a href=\"/doc/1982368/\" id=\"a_3\">section 46</a> of the Act for clearance of goods, the proper\n\nofficer is required to make an assessment of the duty under <a href=\"/doc/354004/\" id=\"a_4\">section 17</a> and\n\non payment of the said duty, the goods have to be allowed to be cleared.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1209720/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 24</a> provides for mutilation of goods at the request of the importer to\n\nrender the goods unfit for any other purpose to claim that lesser rate of duty\n\nwas payable. <a href=\"/doc/1127169/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 18</a> provides for provisional assessment of duty where\n\nany further investigation is required to form a final view about the\n\nvaluation. <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 110</a> provides for seizure of goods if there are reasons to\n\nbelieve that goods are liable to confiscation. <a href=\"/doc/1384041/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 111</a> provides for\n\ngrounds on which the goods may be liable to confiscation. The grounds for\n\nconfiscation include loading/unloading at a place other than customs port,\n\ntaking a route other than the specified route, importing of prohibited goods,\n\nmisdeclaration in the bill of entry about the classification of goods and their\n\nvalue. A circular has been issued by the Central Board of Excise and\n\nCustoms which is contained in Supplementary Manual Chapter 16 issued\n\nby the said Board providing for expeditious assessment/investigation to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> CWP No.6732 of 2011                                                       3</span>\n\n\navoid hardship to the importer on account of continued detention of goods.\n\nThe said circular further provides that the imported goods should not be\n\ndetained unless prohibited on simple valuation/classification disputes.\n\nPower of confiscation has to be exercised by a proper officer as defined\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1337055/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 2(34)</a> of the Act i.e. the officer who is assigned          those\n\nfunctions expressly. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1576576\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1576576/\" id=\"a_10\">Commissioner of Customs v. Sayed Ali</a>, 2011 (265)\n\nELT 17, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that the Proper Officer under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1337055/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 2(34)</a> should be specifically authorized to act as such. Thus, the\n\ngrievance of the petitioner is that action of the respondents in detaining the\n\ngoods and continuing to detain the same was without jurisdiction and\n\narbitrary.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">4.           The stand of the respondents in their reply is that goods were\n\ndetained on account of dispute of classification and valuation. The goods\n\nwere re-rollable material wrongly described as HMSS to evade payment of\n\nduty and once there is a misdeclaration, the goods are liable to be\n\nconfiscated under <a href=\"/doc/1384041/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 111</a> of the Act. Report of the Chartered Engineers\n\nsuggests that there is undervaluation. All the officers of the Directorate of\n\nRevenue Intelligence were officers of Customs and could be treated as\n\nproper officers to seize the goods. Order of provisional release had been\n\npassed on 3.5.2011 to release the goods subject to following conditions:-\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">             i)     On payment of differential duty.\n             ii)    On furnishing a bond for the full value of the seized\n                    goods i.e. Rs.1,24,85,736/-.\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">             iii)   On furnishing a B/G equal to 25% of the full market\n                    value of the seized goods.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">             iv)    On furnishing a declaration in the form of an affidavit\n                    that the party will not challenge the value and identity of\n                    the seized goods during the course of adjudication or\n                    prosecution proceedings, if any.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> CWP No.6732 of 2011                                                     4</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">5.

Main question for consideration is whether continued detention\n\nof goods can be justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">7.           Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the officer\n\neffecting the seizure was not authorised and simple dispute of classification\n\nand valuation did not render the goods liable to confiscation. Alternatively,\n\nit was submitted that imposing of condition of furnishing of bank guarantee\n\nequal to 25% of the full market value of goods and further condition that the\n\npetitioner will not challenge the value of goods during declaration or\n\nprosecution were arbitrary conditions.     In support of his submissions,\n\nreliance has been placed on the following judgments:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1756606\" id=\"span_5\"><a href=\"/doc/1756606/\" id=\"a_13\">i)     Century Metal Recycling Pvt.

We may now proceed to adjudicate on the issue involved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">10.          Even though, prima facie, the officer effecting the seizure is\n\nnot shown to be the officer specifically authorized to do so nor justification\n\nhas been shown for the seizure on a simple dispute of classification and\n\nvaluation, we leave these questions to be finally adjudicated in appropriate\n\nproceedings in view of the stand of the learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nthat at this stage, the relief required to be pressed was of immediate release\n\nof goods on reasonable conditions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">11.          We find merit in the contention that requirement of giving a\n\ndeclaration that the petitioner will not challenge the value of the goods, is\n\nunreasonable and arbitrary. The petitioner cannot be debarred from asserting\n\nits version as to the value and classification of goods. If such a condition is\n\nallowed to be imposed, the department can unilaterally allege any valuation\n\nand continue to keep the goods under detention unless the affected party\n\nagrees to withdraw the challenge to the valuation. This will amount to\n\ndenial of justice. Similarly, requirement of furnishing bank guarantee equal\n\nto 25% of the full market value of the seized goods is also, in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, arbitrary. Mere fact that condition of 10% of\n\nbank guarantee was upheld by this Court in T.L.Verma and M/s Kundan\n\nRice Mills cannot be justification to impose such conditions in each and\n\nevery case. In those cases, this Court was satisfied that the importers had\n\nadopted fraudulent tactics which, prima facie, justified opinion for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> CWP No.6732 of 2011                                                      6</span>\n\n\nconfiscation of goods. The said judgments cannot apply to every case of\n\ndetention. Mere allegation of liability to confiscation is not enough.\n\nCircumstances and grounds justifying opinion about liability to confiscation\n\nis open to judicial scrutiny.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">12.          Power of detention of goods is a drastic power and exercise of\n\nsuch power has to be hedged by safeguards to check its abuse and limit its\n\nexercise only to situation where it is intended by law to be exercised.\n\nExistence of power and exercise of power are independent. Mere fact that\n\nthere is a power to confiscate does not mean that such power could be\n\nexercised mechanically or arbitrarily. The authority exercising such power\n\nmust strictly justify the same. Balance has to be maintained between the\n\nneed for exercise of such power for the purpose for which the same has been\n\nconferred and adverse effects on rights of a citizen.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_12\">13.          As held in Mapsa Tapes Pvt. Limited, power of search and\n\nseizure to check evasion of tax has been upheld as temporary interference\n\nwith the right of a citizen. At the same time, seizure is not only invasion of\n\nright of property but also right of privacy.

That is what is meant by\n            proportionality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">15.         In the present case, dispute is about the classification and\n\nvaluation. The petitioner already paid duty even as per valuation of the\n\ndepartment. The department has not kept in mind guidelines of expeditious\n\ninvestigation and of not detaining the goods on simple dispute of\n\nvaluation/classification. The department has not shown prima facie case\n\nfor exercise of power of confiscation and has only relied upon existence of\n\npower. In these circumstances, the requirement of bank guarantee equal to\n\n25% of the value of goods is clearly arbitrary and malafide and the said\n\ncondition cannot be sustained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">16.         Accordingly, this petition is allowed and detained goods are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> CWP No.6732 of 2011                                                      9</span>\n\n\ndirected to be released forthwith subject to the conditions contained in the\n\norder of provisional release except equirement of a declaration by the\n\npetitioner that it will not dispute the value and requirement of furnishing\n\nbank guarantee.
