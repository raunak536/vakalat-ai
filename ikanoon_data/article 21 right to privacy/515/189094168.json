It is the\n\n                      contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that the publication,\n\n                      which is alleged to be defamatory and derogatory in character, in no way could\n\n                      be termed as defamation or derogation to the particular authority.

The principles as regards reasonable restriction as has\n                                 been stated by this Court from time to time are that the\n                                 restriction should not be excessive and in public interest. The\n                                 legislation should not invade the rights and should not smack of\n                                 arbitrariness.

The nature\n                              of social control which includes public interest has a role.

As the submissions would show, the stress is given on the\n                              right to freedom of speech and expression in the context of\n                              individual growth, progress of democracy, conceptual respect for\n                              a voice of dissent, tolerance for discordant note and acceptance\n                              of different voices. Right to say what may displease or annoy\n                              others cannot be throttled or garrotted. There can never be any\n                              cavil over the fact that the right to freedom of speech and\n                              expression is a right that has to get ascendance in a democratic\n                              body polity, but at the same time the limit has to be\n                              proportionate and not unlimited. It is urged that the defamation\n                              has been described as an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 499</a> IPC that\n                              protects an individual&#x27;s perception of his own reputation which\n                              cannot be elevated to have the status of public interest. The\n                              argument is that to give a remedy by taking recourse to criminal\n                              jurisprudence to curb the constitutional right, that is, right to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                      10/21</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                               ___________________\n                                                                                   Crl.

This is for the reason that once a matter\n                              becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n                              subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\n                              press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion\n                              that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must\n                              be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a\n                              sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not\n                              further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the\n                              incident being publicised in press/media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">                                 (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above —\n                              indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the\n                              case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n                              matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available\n                              with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge\n                              of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is\n                              based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the\n                              official establishes that the publication was made (by the\n                              defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n                              would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or\n                              media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of\n                              the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has\n                              written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be\n                              false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n                              defendant would have no defence and would be liable for\n                              damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the\n                              discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\n                              protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                      14/21</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                              ___________________\n                                                                                  Crl.
