The petitioner has also sought complete\n\n\n\n\n\n    ban on cow slaughter. There is no proper arrangement for food, medicine\n\n    and infrastructure for the cows.        The cows are found abandoned\n\n    throughout the State of Himachal Pradesh. The cows are also transported\n\n    outside the State brutally for slaughtering.        The devotion of Indians\n\n    towards worship of cows is an integral part of Hinduism.

The former President of India Dr. Radhakrishnan in his Speech\n\n    on &quot;The Role of Cow in Indian Economy&quot; has addressed as follows:\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                &quot;There is a great deal of sentiment for the cow; but in our daily\n                life the welfare of the cow has been sadly neglected. There is a\n                tendency among our people to maintain large numbers of\n                cattle and to take pride in them, but adequate attention is not\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n                paid to their being properly fed and cared for. The result has\n                been that the average productivity of the cow has remained\n                low.    In the changing economy of the country, there is\n                increasing need for more productive cattle for both milk and\n                draught.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                   rt  There is a large scope for non-official organizations\n                supplementing the efforts made by the governmental agencies\n                for cattle and dairy development in the country. Special\n\n                mention may be made of the traditional institutions of\n                gaushalas and pinjrapoles spread all over the country which, I\n                think, have to play an increasingly important role in the field of\n                protection and development of cattle. The gaushalas and\n                pinjrapoles, as voluntary public bodies, have the advantage of\n\n\n                being in direct contact with the people. With the advancement\n                of science and the spread of education in the country, our\n                people are becoming increasingly conscious of the need to\n                apply improved methods in all fields of development. The\n\n\n\n\n                gaushalas, which are reorienting their outlook on scientific\n                lines, can carry the message of scientific development of cattle\n\n\n\n\n\n                to the general public. Schemes for the development and\n                reorganization of gaushalas and pinjrapoles as cattle-breeding-\n                cum-milk production centres have been included in the Third\n                Five Year Plan, and it is noteworthy that these institutions are\n\n\n\n\n\n                availing themselves increasingly of the assistance provided\n                under various schemes.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">    3.          In &quot;The Indian Constitution Cornerstone of a Nation&quot;, the\n\n    learned author Granville Austin, has observed that the provision pertaining\n\n    to the improvement of agriculture and animal husbandry techniques and\n\n    the prohibition of cow slaughter was added to the Directive Principles for a\n\n    mixture of reasons. He made the following observations qua <a href=\"/doc/1452355/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 48:</a>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         3</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                &quot;The need to improve agriculture was obvious, and cattle\n                generally, the cow particularly, held a place of special\n                reverence in Hindu thought. The religious aspect of cow\n\n\n\n\n                                                                .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                protection had also long standing political ramifications.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                Indian Muslims killed cows both for food and as part of\n                religious ceremonies. Hindus, of course, resented this; cow\n                protection societies had existed for at least sixty years prior to\n                the Assembly, and a religious difference had become a major\n\n\n\n\n\n                political cause espoused by genuine believers and\n                unscrupulous opportunists alike, for reasons both honourable\n                and otherwise. In the days of the British Raj, many Hindu\n                revivalists had promised themselves that with independence\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n                cow killing would stop. Those of this persuasion in the\n                Assembly believed that the time for action was ripe and, as a\n                result of agreement in the Congress Assembly Party meeting,\n                the measure passed without opposition. No one would have\n                quarreled with the need to modernize agriculture, but many\n                   rt\n                may have found the reference to cow-killing distasteful. There\n                is good evidence that Nehru did. Generally speaking, however,\n                Hindu feeling ran high on the subject, and one may surmise\n\n                that those who opposed the anti-cow-killing cause bent with\n                the wind, believing the issue not sufficiently important to\n                warrant a firm stand against it. As various provisions of the\n                Irish Constitution show that Ireland is a Roman Catholic\n                nation, so <a href=\"/doc/1452355/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 48</a> shows that Hindu sentiment\n\n\n                predominated in the Constituent Assembly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">    4.          Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava, the Hon&#x27;ble Member of the\n\n\n\n\n    Constituent Assembly has eloquently debated the sensitive issue of\n\n\n\n\n\n    &quot;protection of cows&quot; on 24th November, 1948 in the Constituent Assembly\n\n    while seeking amendment in proposed Article 38-A at page 568 of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Constituent Assembly Debates (Vol. VII) as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                &quot;I wanted to speak in Hindi which is my own language about\n                the cow and I would request you not to order me to speak in\n                English. As the subject is a very important one, I would like to\n                express myself in the way in which I can express myself with\n                greater ease and facility. I would therefore request you kindly\n                to allow me to speak in Hindi.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                *[Mr. Vice-President, with regard to this amendment I would\n                like to submit before the House that in fact this amendment\n                like the other amendment, about which Dr. Ambedkar has\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 4</span>\n\n\n\n\n        stated, is his manufacture. Substantially there is no difference\n        between the two amendments. In a way this is an agreed\n        amendment. While moving this amendment, I have no\n\n\n\n\n                                                        .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        hesitation in stating that for people like me and those that do\n\n\n\n\n\n        not agree with the point of view of Dr. Ambedkar and others,\n        this entails, in a way, a sort of sacrifice. Seth Govind Das had\n        sent one such amendment to be included in the Fundamental\n        Rights and other members also had sent similar amendments.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        To my mind it would have been much better if this could have\n        been incorporated in the Fundamental Rights, but some of my\n        Assembly friends differed and it is the desire of Dr. Ambedkar\n        that this matter, instead of being included in Fundamental\n\n\n\n\n                               of\n        Rights should be incorporated in the Directive Principles. As a\n        matter of fact, it is the agreed opinion of the Assembly that this\n        problem should be solved in such a manner that the objective\n        is gained without using any sort of coercion. I have purposely\n        adopted this course, as to my mind, the amendment fulfils our\n           rt\n        object and is midway between the Directive Principles and the\n        Fundamental Rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        I do not want that due to its inclusion in the Fundamental\n        Rights, non-Hindus should complain that they have been\n        forced to accept a certain thing against their will. So far as the\n        practical question is concerned, in my opinion, there will be\n        absolutely no difference if the spirit of the amendment is\n\n\n        worked out faithfully, wheresoever this amendment is placed.\n        With regard to Article38 which the House has just passed, I\n        would like to state that <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 38</a> is like a body without a soul.\n        If you fail to pass Article 38-A which is the proposed\n\n\n\n\n        amendment, then <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 38</a> will be meaningless. How can you\n        improve your health and food position, if you do not produce\n\n\n\n\n\n        full quota of cereals and milk?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        This amendment is divided into three parts. Firstly, the\n        agriculture should be improved on scientific and modern lines.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        Secondly, the cattle breed should be improved; and thirdly, the\n        cow and other cattle should be protected from slaughter. To\n        grow more food and to improve agriculture and the cattle breed\n        are all inter-dependent and are two sides of the same coin.\n        Today, we have to hang our head in shame, when we find that\n        we have to import cereals from outside. I think our country is\n        importing 46 million tons of cereals from outside. If we\n        calculate the average of the last twelve years, namely, from\n        1935 to 1947, then it would be found that this country has\n        produced 45 million tons of cereals every year. Therefore, it is\n        certain that we are not only self-sufficient but can also export\n        cereals from our country. If we utilize water properly, construct\n        dams, and have proper change in the courses of rivers, use\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                     ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 5</span>\n\n\n\n\n        machines and tractors, make use of cropping and manuring,\n        then surely the production will increase considerably. besides\n        all these, the best way of increasing the production is to\n\n\n\n\n                                                        .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        improve the health of human beings and breed of cattle, whose\n\n\n\n\n\n        milk and manure and labour are most essential for growing\n        food. Thus the whole agricultural and food problem of this\n        country is nothing but the problem of the improvement of cow\n        and her breed. And therefore I would like to explain to you by\n\n\n\n\n\n        quoting some figures, how far cattle-wealth has progressed and\n        what is the position today.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">        In 1940, there were 11,56,00,960 oxen in India and in1945\n\n\n\n\n                               of\n        only 11,19,00,000 were left. That is to say, during these five\n        years, there was a decrease of 37 lacs in the number of oxen.\n        Similarly the number of buffaloes in 1940,was 3,28,91,300\n        and in 1945, this figure was reduced to3,25,44,400. According\n        to these figures, during these five years, their number was\n           rt\n        reduced by four lacs. Thus during these five years there was\n        decrease of 41 lacs in the sum total of both the above figures\n        taken together.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        Besides this, if we see the figures of the slaughtered cattle in\n        India we find that in 1944, 60,91,828 oxen were slaughtered,\n        while in 1945 sixty five lacs were slaughtered i.e., four lakhs\n        more. In the same year 7,27: 189 buffaloes were slaughtered. I\n\n\n        do not want to take much of your time. If you wish to see\n        latest figures then I have got them upto1945. You can see\n        them. I have got figures for Bombay and Madras. A look at\n        these figures will show that there has been no decrease in their\n\n\n\n\n        slaughter, rather it is on the increase. Therefore, I want to\n        submit before you that the slaughter of cattle should be\n\n\n\n\n\n        banned here Ours is an agricultural country and the cow is\n        `Kam-Dhenu&#x27; to us - fulfiller of all our wants. From both points\n        of view, of agriculture and food, protection of the cow becomes\n        necessary. Our ancient sages and Rishis, realising her\n\n\n\n\n\n        importance, regarded her as very sacred. here, Lord Krishna,\n        who served cows so devotedly that to this day, in affection he is\n        known as &quot;Makhan Chor&quot;. I would not relate to you the story of\n        Dalip, how that Raja staked his own life for his cow. But I\n        would like to tell you that even during the Muslim rule, Babar,\n        Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and even in the reign of\n        Aurangzeb, cow slaughter was not practised in India; not\n        because Muslims regarded it to be bad but because, from the\n        economic point of view, it was unprofitable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        Similarly in every country, in China, cow-slaughter is a crime.\n        It is banned in Afghanistan as well. A year ago, a similar law\n        was passed in Burma, before that, under a certain law cattle\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                     ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 6</span>\n\n\n\n\n        only above fourteen years of age could be slaughtered. But\n        eventually, the Burma Government realized that this partial\n        ban on slaughter was not effective. On the pretext of useless\n\n\n\n\n                                                        .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">        cattle many useful cattle are slaughtered. I have read in\n\n\n\n\n\n        newspapers that the Pakistan Government has decided to stop\n        the export of cattle from Western Pakistan, and they too have\n        enforced a partial ban on slaughter of animals. In the present\n        conditions in our country, cow-breeding is necessary, not for\n\n\n\n\n\n        milk supply alone, but also for the purposes of draught and\n        transport. It is no wonder that people worship cow in this land.\n        but I do not appeal to you in the name of religion; I ask you to\n        consider it in the light of economic requirements of the\n\n\n\n\n                               of\n        country. In this connection I would like to tell you the opinion\n        of the greatest leader of our country - the Father of the Nation\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        - on the subject. You know the ideas of revered Mahatmaji on\n        this topic. He never wanted to put any compulsion on Muslims\n        or non-Hindus. He said, &quot;I hold that the question of cow-\n           rt\n        slaughter is of great moment - in certain respects of even\n        greater moment - than that of Swaraj.

After this the Government\n        of India, appointed a committee - an expert representative\n        committee-to find out whether for the benefit of the country\n\n\n        the number of cattle can be increased, and whether their\n        slaughter can be stopped. The Committee has unanimously\n        decided in its favour. Seth Govind Das was also a member of\n        the committee. The committee unanimously decided that cattle\n\n\n\n\n        slaughter should be banned. Great minds were associated with\n        the said committee. They examined the question from the\n\n\n\n\n\n        economic view-point; they gave thought to the unproductive\n        and unserviceable cattle also. After viewing the problem from\n        all angles they came to the unanimous decision that slaughter\n        of cattle should be stopped. That resolution relates not to cows\n\n\n\n\n\n        alone. Slaughtering of buffaloes, which yield 50 per cent of our\n        milk supply, and of the goats which yield 3 per cent of our milk\n        supply, and also bring a profit of several crores, is as sinful as\n        that of cows. In my district of Hariana, a goat yields 3 to 4\n        seers of milk. Perhaps a cow does not yield that much in other\n        areas. Therefore I submit that we should consider it from an\n        economic point of view. I also want to state that many of the\n        cattle, which are generally regarded as useless, are not really\n        so. Experts have made an estimate of that, and they came to\n        the conclusion that the cattle which are regarded as useless\n        are not really so, because we are in great need of manure. A\n        cow, whether it be a milch-cow or not, is a moving manure\n        factory and so, as far as cow is concerned, there can be no\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                     ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                        7</span>\n\n\n\n\n               question of its being useless or useful. It can never be useless.\n               In the case of cow there can be no dispute on the point.]\n               (Hearing the bell being rung.) Am I to stop?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                                                               .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_8\">               As the Vice-President has ordered me to finish off, I shall not\n               go into the details; otherwise I can prove by figures that the\n               value of the refuse and urine of a cow is greater than the cost\n               of her maintenance. In the end, I would wind up by saying that\n\n\n\n\n\n               there might be people, who regard the question of banning\n               cow-slaughter as unimportant, but I would like to remind them\n               that the average age in our country is 23 years, and that many\n               children die under one year of age! The real cause of all this is\n\n\n\n\n                                      of\n               shortage of milk and deficiency in diet. Its remedy lies in\n               improving the breed of the cow, and by stopping its slaughter. I\n               attach very great importance to this amendment, so much so\n               that if on one side of the scale you were to put this amendment\n               and on the other all these315 clauses of the draft, I would\n                   rt\n               prefer the former. If this is accepted, the whole country would\n               be, in a way, electrified. Therefore, I request you to accept this\n               amendment unanimously with acclamation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">    5.

I therefore move my amendment to his\n\n\n\n\n               amendment. My amendment runs thus:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                     &quot;That in amendment No. 1002 of the list of Amendments\n                     in article 38-A the words and other useful cattle,\n                     specially milch cattle and of child bearing age, young\n                     stocks and draught cattle&#x27; be deleted and the following\n\n\n\n\n\n                     be added at the end:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                     &#x27;The word &quot;cow&#x27; includes bulls, bullocks, young stock of\n                     genus cow&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">               The object of the amendment is, I hope, quite clear from its\n               words. The amendment moved by Pandit Bhargava prohibits\n               the slaughter of cow and other useful cattle but according to it\n               unfit or useless cows may be slaughtered .But the object of my\n               amendment is, as far as cows are concerned, to prohibit the\n               slaughter of any cow, be it useful or useless and in my\n               amendment word &#x27;cow&#x27; includes bulls, bullocks and calves all\n               that are born of cows. As Pandit Thakur Das told you, I had\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  8</span>\n\n\n\n\n        submitted this earlier to be included in Fundamental Rights\n        but I regret that it could not be so included. The reason given\n        is that Fundamental Rights deal only with human beings and\n\n\n\n\n                                                         .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">        not animals. I had then stated that just as the practice of un\n\n\n\n\n\n        touchability was going to be declared an offence so also we\n        should declare the slaughter of cows to be an offence. But it\n        was said that while untouchability directly affected human\n        beings the slaughter of cows affected the life of animals only -\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">        and that as the Fundamental Rights were for human beings\n        this provision could not be included therein. Well, I did not\n        protest against that view and thought it proper to include this\n        provision in the Directive Principles. It will not be improper,\n\n\n\n\n                                of\n        Sir, if I mention here, that it is not for the first time that I am\n        raising the question of cow protection. I have been a member\n        of the Central Legislature for the last twenty-five years and I\n        have always raised this question in the Assembly and in the\n        Council of State. The protection of cow is a question of long\n           rt\n        standing in this country. Great importance has been attached\n        to this question from the time of Lord Krishna. I belong to a\n        family which worships Lord Krishna as &quot;Ishtadev&quot;. I consider\n\n        myself a religious minded person, and have no respect for\n        those people of the present day society whose attitude towards\n        religion and religious minded people is one of contempt. It is\n        my firm belief that Dharma had never been uprooted from the\n        world and nor can it be uprooted. There had been unbelievers\n\n\n        like Charvaka in our country also but the creed of Charvaka\n        could never flourish in this country. Now-a-days the\n        Communist leaders of the West also and I may name among\n        them Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, declare religion &quot;the opium of\n\n\n\n\n        the People&quot;. Russia recognised neither religion nor God but we\n        have seen that in the last war the Russian people offered\n\n\n\n\n\n        prayers to God in Churches to grant them victory. Thus it is\n        plain from the history of ancient times as also from that of\n        God-denying Russia that religion could not be uprooted.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">        Moreover, cow protection is not only a matter of religion with\n        us; it is also a cultural and economic question. Culture is a gift\n        of History. India is an ancient country; consequently no new\n        culture can be imposed on it. Whosoever attempts to do so is\n        bound to fail; he can never succeed. Ours is a culture that has\n        gradually developed with our long history. Swaraj will have no\n        meaning for our people in the absence of a culture. Great\n        important cultural issues - for instance the question of the\n        name of the country, question of National Language, question\n        of National Script, question of the National Anthem and\n        question of the prohibition of cow slaughter - are before this\n        Assembly and unless the Constituent Assembly decides these\n        questions according to the wishes of the people of the country,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                      ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 9</span>\n\n\n\n\n        Swarajya will have no meaning to the common people of our\n        country. I would like to submit, Sir, that a referendum be\n        taken on these issues and the opinion of the people be\n\n\n\n\n                                                        .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">        ascertained. Again, cow protection is also a matter of great\n\n\n\n\n\n        economic importance for us. Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava has\n        shown to you by quoting statistic how the cattle wealth of the\n        country is diminishing. This country is predominantly\n        agricultural in character. I would give some figures here\n\n\n\n\n\n        regarding the position of our cattle wealth. In 1935 there were\n        one hundred nineteen million and four hundred ninety one\n        thousand (11,94,91,000) heads of cattle. In 1940 their number\n        came down to one hundred fifteen million and six hundred ten\n\n\n\n\n                               of\n        thousand, and in 1945 it further came down to\n\n        one hundred eleven million and 9hundred thousand. While on\n        one side our population is increasing our cattle wealth is\n        decreasing. Our Government is carrying on a Grow More Food\n           rt\n        Campaign. Millions of rupees are being spent on this\n        campaign. This campaign cannot succeed so long as we do not\n        preserve the cows. Pandit Thakur Das has given us some\n\n        figures to show the number of cows slaughtered in our\n        country. I would like to quote here some figures from the Hide\n        and Skin Report of the Government of India. Fifty two lakhs of\n        cows and thirteen lakhs of buffaloes are slaughtered every year\n        in this country. It shows in what amazing numbers cattle are\n\n\n        slaughtered here. Thirty six crores acres of land are under\n        cultivation here. These figures also includes the land under\n        cultivation in Pakistan. I have to give these figures because we\n        have no figure of the land under cultivation in India since the\n\n\n\n\n        secession of Pakistan from our country. We have six crores\n        bullocks for the cultivation of the land. A scientific estimate\n\n\n\n\n\n        would show that we need another one and a half crore of\n        bullocks to keep this land under proper cultivation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">        So far as the question of milk supply is concerned I would like\n\n\n\n\n\n        to place before you figures of milk supply of other countries as\n        compared to that of our country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">        In New Zealand milk supply per capita is 56 ounces, in\n        Denmark 40, in Finland 63, in Sweden 61, in Australia 45, in\n        Canada 35, in Switzerland 49, in Netherland 35, in Norway43,\n        in U.S.A. 35, in Czechoslovakia 36, in Belgium 35, in Australia\n        30, in Germany 35, in France 30, in Poland 22, in Great\n        Britain 39 and in India it is only 7 ounces. Just think what will\n        be the state of health of the people of a country where they get\n        only seven ounces of milk per head. There is a huge infantile\n        mortality in this country. Children are dying like dogs and\n        cats. How can they be saved without milk?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                     ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                 10</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">        Thus even if we look at this problem from the economic point\n        of view, we come to the conclusion that for the supply of milk\n        and agriculture also, the protection of the cow is necessary.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">                                                         .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">        I would like to place before the House one thing more. It has\n        been proved by experience that whatever laws we may frame\n        for the prevention of the slaughter of useful cattle, their object\n        is not achieved. In every province there are such laws. There\n\n\n\n\n\n        people slaughter cattle and pay some amount towards fines\n        and sometimes escape even that. Thus our cattle wealth is\n        declining day by day.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                of\n        Sometime back there was a law like that in Burma but when\n        they saw that cattle could not be saved under it, they banned\n        cow slaughter altogether.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">        I would like to emphasise one point to my Muslim friends also.\n           rt\n        I would like to see my country culturally unified even though\n        we may follow different religions. Justas a Hindu and a Sikh or\n        a Hindu and a Jain can live in the same family, in the same\n\n        way a Hindu and a Muslim can also live in the same family.\n        The Muslims should come forward to make it clear that their\n        religion does not compulsorily enjoin on them the slaughter of\n        the cow. I have studied a little all the religions. I have read the\n        life of Prophet Mohammad Sahib. The Prophet never took beef\n\n\n        in his life. This is an historic fact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">        Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava pointed out just now that from\n        the time of Akbar to that of Aurangzeb, there was a banon cow\n\n\n\n\n        slaughter. I want to tell you what Babar, the first Moghul\n        Emperor told Humayun. He said: &quot;Refrain from cow-slaughter\n\n\n\n\n\n        to win the hearts of the people of Hindustan.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">        Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava just now referred to the\n        Committee constituted by the Government of India for this\n\n\n\n\n\n        purpose. It recommended that cow slaughter should be totally\n        banned. I admit that the Government will require money for\n        the purpose. I want to assure you that there will be no lack of\n        money for this purpose. If the allowance given to cattle-pounds\n        and Goshalas is realised from the people by law, all the money\n        needed would be realised. Even if the Government want to\n        impose a new tax for this purpose every citizen of this country\n        will be too glad to pay it. Therefore our Government should not\n        raise before us the financial bogey sooften raised by the British\n        Government. I have travelled a little in this country and I am\n        acquainted with the [views of the people.]&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                      ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:56 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                        11</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">    6.

One is the religious\n               aspect and the other is the economic aspect. I shall first deal\n               with the religious aspect. I am not one of those men who think\n\n\n\n\n\n               that merely because a thing has a religious aspect, it should\n               not be enacted as law. I personally feel that cow protection, if it\n               has become a part of the religion of the Hindus, it is because of\n               its economic and other aspects, I believe that the Hindu\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n               religion is based mostly on the principles which have been\n               found useful to the people of this country in the course of\n               centuries. Therefore, if thirty crores of our population feel that\n               this thing should be incorporated in the laws of the country, I\n               do not think that we as an Assembly representing 35 crores\n                   rt\n               should leave it out merely because it has a religious aspect. I\n               agree with Seth Govind Das that we should not think that\n               because a thing has a religious significance, so it is bad. I say,\n\n               religion itself sanctifies what is economically good. I wish to\n               show how important cattle preservation is for us mahatma\n               Gandhi infact, has written in so many of his articles about his\n               belief that cow protection was most essential for our country.\n               From the scientific point of view, I wish to point out that Dr.\n\n\n               Wright who is an expert on the subject in his report on our\n               National Income says that out of 22 crores of national income\n               per annum, about eleven crores are derived from the cattle\n               wealth of India, representing the wealth of most of our people\n\n\n\n\n               who live in the villages.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">               Sometimes it is supposed that we have too many cattle and\n               that most of them are useless, and therefore, they must be\n               slaughtered. This is a wrong impression.

That is all right. But when we attain\n\n\n\n\n               freedom, freedom to express ourselves in every form and\n               manner - our Preamble says &#x27;There shall be liberty of\n\n\n\n\n\n               expression&#x27; - is that merely expression of thought or is that the\n               expression of our whole being? This country evolved a\n               civilization and in that civilization we gave prominent place to\n               what we call Ahimsa or non-killing and non-injury, not merely\n\n\n\n\n\n               of human beings but also of the animal kingdom. The entire\n               universe was treated as one and the cow is the symbol of that\n               oneness of life and are we not going to maintain it? Brahma\n               hatya and go-hatya - the killing of the learned man, the\n               scientist, the philosopher or the sage and the killing of a cow\n               are on a par. If we do not allow the killing of a scientist or a\n               sage in this land it shall certainly be ordained by this House\n               that no cow shall be killed.

The mission was that we should go\n               about the world and carry the message of peace, love, freedom and\n               Abhaya (freedom from fear) to every body in the world. When\n               independence was achieved I was happy to believe that I shall carry\n                   rt\n               out my mission, that I shall carry to the world this message, viz.,\n               that India has got no grudge against any country in the world, it has\n               no expansionist ideas but that it is going to save the whole world\n\n               from the danger of internecine war, bloodshed and many other ills\n               that humanity is suffering from. In the same way and for the same\n               purpose I appeal to the House to discuss this subject from a\n               dispassionate point of view. It is not the crumbs, the loaves and\n\n\n               fishes that we are fighting for. Loaves and fishes were left behind by\n               some people thirty years back and by some others fifty years back.\n               We did not want to achieve this independence for loaves and fishes.\n               Those who want the mare welcome but men like us who have a\n\n\n\n\n               mission or a message for the world cannot love loaves and fishes.\n               We do not want ambassadorship, premierships, ministerships or\n\n\n\n\n\n               wealth. We want that India should declare today that the whole\n               human world as well as the whole animal world is free today and\n               will be protected. The cow is a representative of the animal\n\n\n\n\n\n               kingdom, the peepal tree is the representative of the vegetable\n               kingdom, the touchstone or the shaligram is the representative of the\n               mineral world. We want to save and give peace and protection to all\n               those four worlds and therefore it is that the Hindus of India have\n               put these four things as representatives of this world - the human\n               being, the cow, the peepal and the shaligram. All these were\n               worshipped because we wanted to protect the whole humantly.

Or is it the fundamental right of the cow?&quot; I replied to them\n                and tell them suppose it is a question of saving your mother or\n                protecting your mother.

No. It is my fundamental right to\n\n\n\n\n                                        of\n                protect my mother, to protect my wife, my children and my country.\n                In the Fundamental Rights you have said that you will give justice,\n                equity and all these things. Why? Because you say &quot;it is your\n                fundamental right to have justice&quot;. What does that justice mean? It\n                   rt\n                means that we shall be protected, our families shall be protected.\n                And our Hindu society, or our Indian society, has included the cow\n                in our fold. It is just like our mother. In fact it is more than our\n\n                mother. I can declare from this platform that there are thousands of\n                persons who will not run at a man to kill that man for their mother\n                or wife or children, but they will run at a man if that man does not\n                want to protect the cow or wants to kill her.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                With these few words, I wish to say that these two amendments\n                which have been put forward by Mr. Bhargava and Seth Govind Das\n                should be dealt with dispassionately.

The consequence has been the arrests of many,\n\n\n\n\n\n        molestation of even more, and imprisonment of some.\n        Therefore, if the House is of the opinion that slaughter of cows\n        should be prohibited, let it be prohibited in clear, definite and\n        unambiguous words.

In the interests of good-will in the country and of\n        cordial relations between the different communities I submit\n        that this is the proper occasion when the majority should\n        express itself clearly and definitely.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">        I for one can say that this is a matter on which we will not\n        stand in the way of the majority if the majority wants to\n        proceed in a certain way, whatever may be our inclinations. We\n        feel - we know that our religion does not necessarily say that\n\n\n\n\n        you must sacrifice cow: it permits it. The question is whether,\n        considering the sentiments that you have, considering the\n\n\n\n\n\n        regard which the majority have for certain classes of animals,\n        do they or do they not permit the minority - not a right - but a\n        privilege or a permission which it at present has?

Therefore, let the leaders of the\n        majority community here and now make it clear and not leave\n        it to the back-benchers to come forward and deliver sermons\n        one way or the other.

It is thus clear that because of various scientific factors,\n                namely, better cattle feeding, better medical health and better animal\n                husbandry services, the longevity of cattle in the State of Gujarat has\n                increased and in this context it is correct to say that if the scientific\n                tests were to be applied, bulls and bullocks upto sixteen years of age\n                can be said to be useful for the purpose of breeding, draught and other\n                agricultural purposes. In these circumstances the prescription of The\n                age of sixteen years in clauses (c) and (d) of sub-s.

This contention in our opinion has no force. The dealers in\n                different tpes of meat are not in the same class. It is only if the\n                classification is unreasonable that it can be struck down. But here a\n                clear distinction is maintained on scientific grounds between animals\n\n\n\n\n                                           of\n                which are useful and which have not yet reached the age of 16 years so\n                far as bulls and bullocks are concerned. As regards buffaloes there is\n                no restriction as to the age and the only restriction is sub-s. (2) of s. 5\n                and that section has remained unamended, namely the test is whether\n                the animal, male or female, is useful or likely to become useful for the\n                purposes of milch or draught or any kind of agricultural operations;\n                    rt\n                whether the animal, if male is useful or likely t become useful for the\n                purpose of breeding, and whether the animal, if female, is useful or\n\n                likely to become useful for the purpose of giving milk or bearing\n                offspring. So looking to the different purposes for which buffaloes and\n                their progeny on the one hand and cows and their progeny on the\n                other hand are used in each State it cannot be said that there is any\n                hostile discrimination against those who deal in meat of bulls and\n                bullocks. Bulls and bullocks, particularly bullocks, are useful for\n\n\n\n                agricultural purposes and male buffaloes are seldom used for any\n                purpose other than breeding or rearing progeny and under these\n                circumstances the impugned amendment is not hit by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_9\">Art. 14</a> of the\n                Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"101278772\" id=\"span_36\">16.

According to the livestock census 1988 of Gujarat State,\n        the availability of indigenous bullocks is around 2.84 millions. Thus\n        the availability of bullocks as a whole on percentage of requirement\n        works out to be about 25 per cent.

If a bullock survives even for five years\n        after becoming otherwise useless it can provide employment to a\n\n\n\n\n        person for five years whereas to a butcher, bullock can provide\n        employment only for a day or two.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">        (x) Even utility of urine has a great role in the field of pharmaceuticals\n        as well as in the manufacturing of pesticides.

Empirical research was carried out under field conditions in\n\n\n        North Gujarat Region (described as Zone-I) and Saurashtra region\n        (described as Zone-II). The average age of aged bullocks under the\n        study was 18.75 years. The number of bullocks/pair used under the\n        study were sufficient to draw sound conclusions from the study.

In addition to this, the experiment was conducted\n        during the months of May-June, 2000           a stressful summer season.\n        Therefore, these bullocks could definitely generate more work output\n           rt\n        during winter, being a comfortable season. The aged bullock above 16\n        years of age performed satisfactorily and disproved that they are unfit\n        for any type of draft output i.e. either agricultural operations, carting\n\n        or other works.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">        4.

Average Hb content (g%) at the start of\n        work was observed to be 10.72 g% and after 3 hours of work 11.14g%,\n        indicating the healthy state of bullocks. The increment in the\n        haemoglobin content after 3 to 4 hours of work was also within the\n        normal range and in accordance with prime bullocks under study as\n\n\n\n\n        well as the reported values for working bullocks.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_92\">        5.

Dung is a cheap and harmless fertilizer in absence\n           rt\n        whereof the farmers are forced to use costly and harmful chemical\n        fertilizers.

Even if the utility argument of the Quareshi&#x27;s judgment is\n        accepted, it cannot be accepted that bulls and bullocks become useless\n\n\n        after the age of 16. It has to be said that bulls and bullocks are not\n        useless to the society because till the end of their lives they yield\n        excreta in the form of urine and dung which are both extremely useful\n        for production of bio-gas and manure. Even after their death, they\n        supply hide and other accessories. Therefore, to call them &#x27;useless&#x27; is\n\n\n\n\n        totally devoid of reality. If the expenditure on their maintenance is\n        compared to the return which they give, at the most, it can be said\n\n\n\n\n\n        that they become &#x27;less useful&#x27;.(Report of the National Commission on\n        Cattle, July 2002, Volume I, p. 279.)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">        105. The Report of the National Commission on Cattle has analyzed\n\n\n\n\n\n        the economic viability of cows after they stopped yielding milk and it\n        also came to the conclusion that it shall not be correct to call such\n        cows &#x27;useless cattle&#x27; as they still continue to have a great deal of utility.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">        Similar is the case with other cattle as well.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">        &quot;37. Economic aspects:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">        37.1 The cows are slaughtered in India because the owner of the cow\n        finds it difficult to maintain her after she stops yielding milk. This is\n        because it is generally believed that milk is the only commodity\n        obtained from cows, which is useful and can be sold in exchange of\n        cash. This notion is totally wrong. Cow yields products other than\n        milk, which are valuable and saleable. Thus the dung as well as the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:57 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                   34</span>\n\n\n\n\n        urine of cow can be put to use by owner himself or sold to persons or\n        organizations to process them. The Commission noticed that there are\n        a good number of organizations (goshalas) which keep the cows\n\n\n\n\n                                                           .\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">        rescued while being carried to slaughter houses. Very few of such cows\n\n\n\n\n\n        are milk yielding. Such organizations use the urine and dung\n        produced by these cows to prepare Vermi-compost or any other form\n        of bio manure and urine for preparing pest repellents. The money\n        collected by the sale of such products is normally sufficient to allow\n\n\n\n\n\n        maintenance of the cows. In some cases, the urine and dung is used to\n        prepare the medical formulations also. The organizations, which are\n        engaged in such activities, are making profits also.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">                                 of\n        37.2 Commission examined the balance sheet of some such\n        organizations. The expenditure and income of one such organization\n        is displayed here.

In fact it can be said that products of cow are sufficient to\n        maintain them even without milk. The milk in such cases is only a by-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">        product.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">        37.4 It is obvious that all cow owners do not engage in productions of\n        fertilizers or insect repellents. It can also be understood that such\n        activity may not be feasible for owners of a single or a few cows. In\n\n\n\n\n        such cases, the cow&#x27;s urine and dung may be supplied to such\n        organizations, which utilize these materials for producing finished\n\n\n\n\n\n        products required for agricultural or medicinal purpose. Commission\n        has noticed that some organizations which are engaged in production\n        of agricultural and medical products from cow dung and urine do\n        purchase raw materials from nearby cow owner at a price which is\n\n\n\n\n\n        sufficient to maintain the cow.&quot; (Report of National Commission on\n        Cattle, July 2002, Vol. II, pp.68-69)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">        106.

We have, apart from the\n        affidavits, mainly referred to the reports published by the\n        Government of India, whose veracity cannot be doubted.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                        ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:57 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                   35</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">        107.

The utility of cow cannot be doubted at all. A total ban on cow\n        slaughter has been upheld even in Quareshi-I. The controversy in the\n        present case is confined to cow progeny. The important role that cow\n\n\n\n\n\n        and her progeny play in the Indian Economy was acknowledged in\n        Quareshi-I in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">        &quot;The discussion in the foregoing paragraphs clearly establishes the\n\n\n\n\n                                  of\n        usefulness of the cow and her progeny. They sustain the health of the\n        nation by giving them the life giving milk which is so essential an item\n        in a scientifically balanced diet. The working bullocks are\n        indispensable for our agriculture, for they supply power more than\n        any other animal. Good breeding bulls are necessary to improve the\n           rt\n        breed so that the quality and stamina of the future cows and working\n        bullocks may increase and the production of food and milk may\n        improve and be in abundance. The dung of the animal is cheaper than\n\n        the artificial manures and is extremely useful. In short, the back bone\n        of Indian agriculture is in a manner of speaking the cow and her\n        progeny. Indeed Lord Linlithgow has truly said        &quot;The cow and the\n        working bullock have on their patient back the whole structure of\n        Indian agriculture.&quot; (Report on the Marketing of Cattle in India, p.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">        20). If, therefore, we are to attain sufficiency in the production of\n\n\n\n        food, if we are to maintain the nation&#x27;s health, the efficiency and\n        breed of our cattle population must be considerably improved. To\n        attain the above objectives, we must devote greater attention to the\n        preservation, protection and improvement of the stock and organise\n\n\n\n\n        our agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">        109. On the basis of the available material, we are fully satisfied to\n        hold that the ban on slaughter of cow progeny as imposed by the\n        impugned enactment is in the interests of the general public within\n        the meaning of clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">        128. In the first and second Five Year Plans (Quareshi-I era), there\n        was scarcity of food which reflected India&#x27;s panic. The concept of food\n        security has since then undergone considerable change.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">        129. 47 years since, it is futile to think that meat originating from\n        cow progeny can be the only staple food or protein diet for the poor\n        population of the country. &#x27;India Vision 2020&#x27; (ibid, Chapter 3) deals\n        with &#x27;Food Security and Nutrition : Vision 2020&#x27;. We cull out a few\n        relevant findings and observations therefrom and set out in brief in\n        the succeeding paragraphs. Food availability and stability were\n        considered good measures of food security till the Seventies and the\n        achievement of self-sufficiency was accorded high priority in the food\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                        ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:57 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                     36</span>\n\n\n\n\n        policies. Though India was successful in achieving self-sufficiency by\n        increasing its food production, it could not solve the problem of\n        chronic household food insecurity. This necessitated a change in\n\n\n\n\n                                                             .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">        approach and as a result food energy intake at household level is now\n\n\n\n\n\n        given prominence in assessing food security. India is one of the few\n        countries which have experimented with a broad spectrum of\n        programmes for improving food security. It has already made\n        substantial progress in terms of overcoming transient food insecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n        by giving priority to self-sufficiency in foodgrains, employment\n        programmes, etc. The real problem, facing India, is not the availability\n        of food, staple food and protein rich diet; the real problem is its\n        unequal distribution. The real challenge comes from the slow growth\n\n\n\n\n                                   of\n        of purchasing power of the people and lack of adequate employment\n        opportunities. Another reason for lack of food and nutrient intake\n        through cereal consumption is attributable to changes in consumer\n        tastes and preferences towards superior food items as the incomes of\n        the household increases. Empirical evidence tends to suggest a\n        positive association between the calorie intake and nutritional status.\n           rt\n        The responsiveness is likely to be affected by the factors relating to\n        health and environment. It is unclear as to how much of the\n        malnutrition is due to an inadequate diet and how much due to the\n\n        environment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">        137. For multiple reasons which we have stated in very many details\n        while dealing with Question-6 in Part II of the judgment, we have\n        found that bulls and bullocks do not become useless merely by\n\n\n\n        crossing a particular age. The Statement of Objects and Reasons,\n        apart from other evidence available, clearly conveys that cow and her\n        progeny constitute the backbone of Indian agriculture and economy.\n        The increasing adoption of non-conventional energy sources like Bio-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">        gas plants justify the need for bulls and bullocks to live their full life in\n        spite of their having ceased to be useful for the purpose of breeding\n\n\n\n\n\n        and draught. This Statement of Objects and Reasons tilts the balance\n        in favour of the constitutional validity of the impugned enactment. In\n        Quareshi-I the Constitution Bench chose to bear it in mind, while\n        upholding the constitutionality of the legislations impugned therein,\n\n\n\n\n\n        insofar as the challenge by reference to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> was concerned, that\n        &quot;the legislature correctly appreciates the needs of its own people&quot;.\n        Times have changed; so have changed the social and economic needs.\n        The Legislature has correctly appreciated the needs of its own people\n        and recorded the same in the Preamble of the impugned enactment\n        and the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to it. In the light\n        of the material available in abundance before us, there is no escape\n        from the conclusion that the protection conferred by impugned\n        enactment on cow progeny is needed in the interest of Nation&#x27;s\n        economy. Merely because it may cause &#x27;inconvenience&#x27; or some\n        &#x27;dislocation&#x27; to the butchers, restriction imposed by the impugned\n        enactment does not cease to be in the interest of the general public.\n        The former must yield to the latter.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 20:54:57 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                          37</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">               138.

Countries like Switzerland,\n        Austria, Slovenia have enacted legislations to include animal welfare\n        in their national Constitutions so as to balance the animal owners&#x27;\n        fundamental rights to property and the animals&#x27; interest in freedom\n        from unnecessary suffering or pain, damage and fear.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">        60. Animals Welfare Act of 2006 (U.K.) also confers considerable\n        protection to the animals from pain and suffering.
