In terms of the\n      prayer, the second appeal is admitted and keeping in view the\n      urgency, the operation of CPIO&#x27;s reply and FAA&#x27;s order is stayed\n      till further orders.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">2.     Inview of the above, the aforesaid matters were thus adjourned and listed\ntoday for further hearing.Since, the cause of action has arisen from the same\nRTI application and orders of CPIO and FAA, therefore all the above matters\nare clubbed together in the interest of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">Hearing:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.

The Counsel for the appellant has referred the reply provided by CPIO\nand order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO, RBI and FAA had\nviolated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to the Appellant before passing their decisions in the matter. No reasons\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                       Page 2 of 17</span>\n were given for not offering personal hearing neither in CPIO&#x27;s reply nor in\nFAO. The appellant has filed the captioned Second Appeals challenging the\nOrder issued by the Ld. FAA, RBI as the Ld. FAA has failed to observed that\nthe applicant has sought disclosure of the said Inspection Reports which are\nexempted under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_1\">section 8</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, more particularly <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_2\">section 8 (1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">(a), <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_3\">section 8 (1) (d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_4\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> inter alia since the contents of the said\nInspection Reports sought to be disclosed contains confidential information\npertaining to the Appellant, its customers as well as details of the Appellant&#x27;s\ncommercial transactions and details regards to Appellant&#x27;s regulatory\ncompliances, which bear no relation with public activity and/ or larger public\ninterest, and disclosure of the same would cause prejudice to the Appellant and\nits competitive position in the market and will also affect customer&#x27;s confidence\nin the Appellant. The disclosure of information sought will be violative of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">The RTI Act</a> was enacted\nto increase the transparency and accountability in functioning of the public\nauthorities. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">The RTI Act</a> does not apply to private entities such as the Appellant,\nas the Appellant is not covered within the definition of &quot;public authorities&quot; as\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_9\">section 2 (h)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.     Also the Counsel for the appellant has referred the Full Bench judgment\nof this Hon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no.

Moreover, considering the fact\nthat several banks have filed inter alia Writ Petition No. 1159 of 2019 before\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court inter-alia impugning the disclosure of their\nInspection Reports by RBI under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">RTI Act</a>, this Hon&#x27;ble Commission has\nalso held that any decision by the CPIO in respect of disclosure of Inspection\nReport would amount to pre-judging the issues pending the admitted Writ\nPetition (s) before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.     The Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that the CPIO &amp; FAA\ndid not pass a reasoned order due to which the appellant could not be able to file\nproper appeal. Hence, it has restricted their right to challenge the impugned\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                           Page 3 of 17</span>\n order appropriately before the Commission on issues of facts or legal\ninfirmities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.     The representative of the Reserve Bank of India while presenting their\ncase inter alia submitted that the applicant, Shri Basant Soni, vide above RTI\napplications inter alia, sought, copy of Audit/ Inspection Reports from year\n2007-2019 etc. They further submitted that the then CPIO issued the notice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11(1)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Right to Information Act,\n2005 <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">(RTI Act</a>) to the third party i.e. appellant informing that RBI was required\nto disclose the information sought by Shri Basant Soni, enabling appellant to\nmake written submission within 10 days from the date of receipt of the notice as\nto whether the information sought by the applicant might be disclosed or not\nalong with reasons for the same. After considering the response from Appellant,\nthe CPIO decided to disclose the detail of Audit/ Inspection Reports from year\n2007-2019etc. to the applicant. He further submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in RBI vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry &amp; Ors (2016) 3 SCC 525 observed that :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       &quot;RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI\n       ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might\n       embarrass individual banks. It is duty bound to comply with the\n       provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_14\">RTI Act</a> and disclose the information sought by the\n       applicant.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">The FAA duly considered the contentions of the appellant. FAA observed that\nthe interim order of the Supreme Court as quoted by the appellant was against\ndisclosure of inspection reports/ risk assessment reports etc. of banks including\nState Bank of India and not of a credit information company like the appellant.\nAs such, it would not be possible for the appellant to take benefit of that order.\nAs regards, appellant&#x27;s contention that it is not a public authority as defined in\nthe Act, FAA observed that RBI which holds information is a public authority.\nRBI collects information from banks and other entities regulated by it, including\nthe appellant in exercise of its power under the relevant statute. Further due to\nCovid-19 pandemic, their office was working with limited resources which\ncaused delay in providing reply/ issuing notice under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_15\">section 11</a> of RTI Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">9.     The original applicant submitted that the respondent Reserve Bank of\nIndia was duty bound to disclose the information sought by the applicant in his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                       Page 4 of 17</span>\n above RTI applications as per Jayantilal Mistry caseand in compliance of this\norder should suo moto upload these reports under <a href=\"/doc/266825/\" id=\"a_16\">section 4 (1)</a> of RTI Act. He\nstated that the Reserve Bank of India was creator of reports and it acted as a\nguardian of public interest. Therefore, as per the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India dated 16.12.2015 and as per order dated 28.04.2021 complete\ninformation should be disclosed to the RTI applicant. He stated that there was\nno ambiguity in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and there was a larger public interest\nin disclosing the information. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19607639\" id=\"span_4\">He has further referred para no. 96 of one\njudgment passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in &quot;<a href=\"/doc/19607639/\" id=\"a_17\">Namit Sharma vs.\nUnion of India</a>&quot; wherein it was held that:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      &quot;This takes us to discuss the kind of duties and responsibilities that such\n      high post is expected to perform. Their functions are adjudicatory in\n      nature. They are required to give notice to the parties, offer them the\n      opportunity of hearing and pass reasoned orders. The orders of the\n      appellate authority and the Commission have to be supported by\n      adequate reasoning as they grant relief to one party, despite opposition\n      by the other or reject the request for information made in exercise of a\n      statutory right.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">Therefore, they have followed the mandate of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s\njudgment while passing the orders. Further he has contested the delay caused by\nthe CPIO while issuing notice under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_18\">section 11</a> of RTI Act as well as the FAA\nwhile deciding the first appeal. Therefore there was an undue delay in\ncompleting the proceedings on the part of CPIO and FAA. He also alleged that\nthe respondent is in connivance with the third party, therefore an unreasonable\ndelay has been caused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">Decision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89279518\" id=\"span_5\">10. The Commission, after hearing the submissions of both the parties and\nafter perusal of records, observes that the original RTI applicant has sought\ninformation regarding copy of Audit/ Inspection Reports from the year 2007 to\n2019. Further, he has asked to publish these reports on the website of the RBI in\nterms of judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of RBI vs.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                       Page 5 of 17</span>\n Jayantilal Mistry (<a href=\"/doc/89279518/\" id=\"a_19\">2016) (3) SCC (525) and Girish Mittal vs. Parvati</a> vs.\nSundaram (2019 SCC Online SC 607).The CPIO, Reserve Bank of India had\nissued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_21\">11(3)</a> to the appellant intending to\ndisclose the information. Aggrieved by the decision of the CPIO, the appellant\nhad filed first appeal with the First Appellate Authority. The FAA had also\ndismissed the first appeal of the appellant summarily.</span> The Commission\nobserves that the RTI applicant had insisted for disclosure of information as per\nJayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case and as per <a href=\"/doc/266825/\" id=\"a_22\">section 4 (1)</a> of RTI Act. The Appellant\ncontested that the information sought as a whole is exempted from disclosure\nunder <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8 (1) (a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8(1) (d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_25\">8(1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act. Despite the\nAppellant&#x27;s specific requests, no opportunity of personal hearing was provided\nin the matter. The Ld. FAA has erred in concluding that it was not necessary to\nprovide personal hearing in the matter. This is a clear violation of principles of\nnatural justice. He has further contended that the CPIO and FAA while passing\nunreasoned order have denied the right of the appellant to file appeal on merits\npointing out their errors/ legal infirmities in rejecting their objections.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">11. The contention of the original applicant is that although the CPIO and\nFAA has passed a reasoned order and the mandate of Supreme Court&#x27;s\njudgment duly considered while passing the order in the above RTI\nApplications, but on every stage whether issuing notice under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_26\">section 11</a> of the\nRTI Act or taking decision on response filed to the notice under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_27\">section 11</a> of\nthe RTI Act, the CPIO did not adhere with the prescribed time limits as per the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_28\">RTI Act</a>. Even FAA took unreasonably long time in deciding\nthe first appeal and suo moto instead of disclosing information gave extra 50\ndays&#x27; time to file second appeal and made a suggestion to take stay order on\ndisclosing the requested information from the appropriate forum. He has further\nalleged that considerable delay has been caused by the respondent as they are in\nconnivance with the third party. In response, the RBI submitted that due to\nCovid-19 pandemic, they were working with limited resources during that time;\nstill they have expeditiously decided the above RTI Applications. They had to\nprovide reasonable time to the appellant to file second appeal as per the\nprinciples of Natural Justice. Therefore, they have provided reasoned and fair\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                       Page 6 of 17</span>\n order while dealing with the above RTI Applications in view of Jayantilal\nMistry&#x27;s case along with other judicial pronouncement of Supreme Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">12. The Commission observes that it is already a settled position in Jayantilal\nMistry&#x27;s case that RBI is not fiduciary in relationship with the banks and\nfinancial institution irrespective of these being public or private entities. These\nCredit Rating Financial Institutions take transactional, financial &amp; operational\ndata of clients to analyze their functioning and rate them within the broad\nframework. Hence, inspection/ audit reports of these institutions will reflect on\nsuch data of clients viz. credit &amp; repayment history, names and information of\ntheir operational and financial transactions etc, entrusted by the clients to their\nrespective Credit Rating Financial Institutions which may get interspersed in\nthese reports and have to be examined in the light of para nos. 77 of the same\njudgment and various other judicial pronouncements protecting right to privacy\nand protection of commercial interests. Therefore, the CPIO, Reserve Bank of\nIndia has rightly invited objections but not expressed his reasoned view that to\nwhat extent he is agreeing or disagreeing by the objections of the Appellant\nwhile sharing the proposed redacted report for disclosure in some cases. The\nCommission is of the view that these reports are not a simple set of information\nas inspection and audit report consists of data about client including their credit,\nfinancial &amp; operational transactions etc, its analysis, judgment and observations\non the data provided by the clients as well as of institutions on their functioning,\nregulatory compliance, deficiencies and strengths, suggestions for course of\ncorrection, penal action as per provisions of the law etc., and may be much more\nwhich the Commission may not be in a position appreciate in toto at this stage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">13. The Commission further noted the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\nReserve Bank of India V/s Jayantilal N. Mistry case clarifies that the\nfunctional relationship between a regulator and a regulated entity is not\nfiduciary. On the other hand the relationship is based on a statutory obligation to\nensure operational discipline and support remedial framework. Hence its\nobservations, guidance, directions or remedial actions are an outcome of own\nfunctioning based on the analysis of the data shared by the regulated entity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_8\">14. Keeping in view the broader nature of business carried out between a\ncustomer and the bank/ financial institution, the Commission takes note of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                         Page 7 of 17</span>\n observations passed by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_29\">Central Board Of Sec.\nEducation &amp;Anr. vs Aditya Bandopadhyay&amp;Ors</a> [2011 (8) SCC 497] vide\norder dated 09.08.2011 examined and explained the expression &#x27;fiduciary\nrelationship&#x27;, and have illustrated a few relationships where parties were\ninvolved in an act of fiduciary capacity including &#x27;customers&#x27; in the following\nwords:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       &quot;20. The term `fiduciary&#x27; and `fiduciary relationship&#x27; refer to different\n       capacities and relationship, involving a common duty or obligation. 20.1)\n       Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (7th Edition, Page 640) defines `fiduciary\n       relationship&#x27; thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      A relationship in which one person is under a duty to act for the benefit of\n      the other on matters within the scope of the relationship. Fiduciary\n      relationships - such as trustee-beneficiary, guardian-ward, agent-\n      principal, and attorney-client - require the highest duty of care. Fiduciary\n      relationships usually arise in one of four situations : (1) when one person\n      places trust in the faithful integrity of another, who as a result gains\n      superiority or influence over the first, (2) when one person assumes\n      control and responsibility over another, (3) when one person has a duty\n      to act for or give advice to another on matters falling within the scope of\n      the relationship, or (4) when there is a specific relationship that has\n      traditionally been recognized as involving fiduciary duties, as with a\n      lawyer and a client or a stockbroker and a customer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      &quot;39. The term &quot;fiduciary&quot; refers to a person having a duty to act for the\n      benefit of another, showing good faith and candour, where such other\n      person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or\n      discharging the duty. The term &quot;fiduciary relationship&quot; is used to\n      describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places\n      complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs,\n      business or transaction(s). The term also refers to a person who holds a\n      thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in\n      confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use\n      good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                        Page 8 of 17</span>\n       belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to\n      the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard\n      to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in\n      confidence and is expected not to disclose the thing or information to any\n      third party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_11\">While taking into consideration the fact that the customers give their financial\ninformation even to the Credit Rating Institutions in confidence and with\ncomplete faith that may not be divulged as a result of disclosure by others, the\nfollowing observations passed by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_30\">Bihar Public Service\nCommission v.

Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\n      required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may come\n      to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give\n      that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and\n      fidelity.

Similarly, there may be cases\n      where the disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest\n      or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual.\n      All these protections have to be given their due implementation as they\n      spring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between\n      private interest and public interest. It is a matter where a constitutional\n      protection is available to a person with regard to the right to privacy.\n      Thus, the public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the\n      balance factor between right to privacy and right to information with the\n      purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                         Page 9 of 17</span>\n       the larger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge\n      from the constitutional values under the Constitution of India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_13\">As emphasized by the Supreme Court in the judgment of Central Public\nInformation Officer, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_31\">India vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a>\nin its judgment dated 13.11.2019, right to privacy and right to information have\nto be treated as co-equals and none can take precedence over the other, rather a\nbalance needs to be struck. The following observations may also be relied upon\nin that regard:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      &quot;42. Privacy, it is uniformly observed in K.S. Puttaswamy (supra), is\n      essential for liberty and dignity. Therefore, individuals have the need to\n      preserve an intrusion-free zone for their personality and family. This\n      facilitates individual freedom. On the question of invasion of personal\n      liberty, the main judgment has referred to a three-fold requirement in the\n      form of - (i) legality, which postulates the existence of law (RTI Act in the\n      present case); (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate State aim; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      (iii) proportionality, which ensures a rational nexus between the objects\n      and the means to be adopted to achieve them. The third requirement, we\n      would observe, is achieved in the present case by <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_32\">Sections 8(1)(j)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_33\">11</a>\n      of the RTI Act and the RTI Act cannot be faulted on this ground. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_34\">The RTI\n      Act</a> also defines the legitimate aim, that is a public interest in the\n      dissemination of information which can be confidential or private (or\n      held in a fiduciary relationship) when larger public interest or public\n      interest in disclosure outweighs the protection or any possible harm or\n      injury to the interest of the third party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_14\">Further in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_35\">K.S.

An individual has a right to protect his reputation from being\n      unfairly harmed and such protection of reputation needs to exist not only\n      against falsehood but also certain truths. It cannot be said that a more\n      accurate judgment about people can be facilitated by knowing private\n      details about their lives - people judge us badly, they judge us in haste,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                       Page 10 of 17</span>\n       they judge out of context, they judge without hearing the whole story and\n      they judge with hypocrisy. Privacy lets people protect themselves from\n      these troublesome judgments.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">15.   In view of the above, the Commission is of the view that these judicial\npronouncements have to be factored while deliberating all the claims of the\napplicant for complete disclosure which may include inadvertent disclosure of\nfinancial, transactional and operational data of the clients of the Bank etc.\nFurther, in NareshTrehan vs Rakesh Kumar Gupta [W.P.(C) 85/2010 &amp; CM\nNos.156/2010 &amp; 5560/2011], the Delhi High Court made the following\nobservations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      &quot;...It is, thus, essential that information relating to business affairs,\n      which is considered to be confidential by an assessee must remain so,\n      unless it is necessary in larger public interest to disclose the same. If the\n      nature of information is such that disclosure of which may have the\n      propensity of harming one&#x27;s competitive interests, it would not be\n      necessary to specifically show as to how disclosure of such information\n      would, in fact, harm the competitive interest of a third party. In order to\n      test the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act it is necessary to first\n      and foremost determine the nature of information and if the nature of\n      information is confidential information relating to the affairs of a private\n      entity that is not obliged to be placed in public domain, then it is\n      necessary to consider whether its disclosure can possibly have an adverse\n      effect on third parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_16\">The Supreme Court while deciding upon issues relating to personal\ninformation of an individual in terms of his income tax returns passed the\nfollowing observations in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_37\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central\nInformation Commr.</a> [(2013) 1 SCC 212] :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show-cause\n      notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third respondent from his\n      employer and also details viz. movable and immovable properties and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                       Page 11 of 17</span>\n       also the details of his investments, lending and borrowing from banks and\n      other financial institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of\n      gifts stated to have been accepted by the third respondent, his family\n      members and friends and relatives at the marriage of his son. The\n      information mostly sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of\n      the third respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n      &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI\n      Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the\n      details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to\n      the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n      censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information as\n      defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The performance\n      of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter\n      between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects\n      are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression\n      &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has no relationship\n      to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the\n      disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of\n      that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public\n      Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer of the\n      Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest\n      justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders\n      could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a\n      matter of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n      &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure under\n      clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger\n      public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the\n      State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n      satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n      such information.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">The aforementioned observations make it clear that the data has been shared by\nthe individuals with the Income Tax Department which is seeking such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                       Page 12 of 17</span>\n information as a statutory authority but while analyzing and assessing their\nincome keeps this data secured in the fiduciary capacity and hence it is\nprotected from disclosure. It is applicable not only for individuals but for other\nlegal entities recognizable under <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_41\">Income Tax Act</a>. Further, it has been observed\nthat the information in the hands of public authority even in the discharge of\nstatutory obligations is protected under fiduciary relationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">16. There are apparently two set of such information which have been shared\nby the Credit Rating Institutions with the regulator under statutory obligation.\nFirst is the information/data of clients relating to their business/commercial\noperations, financial transactions, business and commercial strategy which is\nshared by clients with financial institutions in full trust and confidence and is\nheld by them in fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_42\">RTI Act</a>\nin their hands. Second set is the information relating to business strategy,\ndecisions, transactions, other operational data etc. of financial institution which\nmay have bearing on their competitive position and also enjoys the exemption\nfrom disclosure in their hands, even if it is a public authority or otherwise, under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_43\">RTI Act</a>. The Commission is of the view that the exemption of disclosure of\ncertain information under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of\nfinancial institutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in\ngood faith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligations. This aspect\nis not the ratio of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s judgment and\ndecision of the regulator to consider redacting such data/information while\ndisclosing the reports is to be aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts covering such aspects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">17. The Commission further observes that by passing such orders simplicitors\nshows non-application of mind but also ensure that their orders are may not be\nquestioned further with specific facts and points of law. Rejection or acceptance\nof the specific objections raised by them was not spelt out in the order which\nhave been passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to them.The\nCommission further observes that the CPIO is at best free to take decisions on\ndisclosure of information as per provision of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_45\">RTI Act, 2005</a> giving a reasoned\norders on the objections filed. The CPIO while issuing notice under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 11</a>\nof the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Appellant to file their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                        Page 13 of 17</span>\n objections, if any, against disclosure of information sought but has not found it\nnecessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While not doing so, the CPIO\nhas not passed any reasoned order covering his deliberations on their objections,\nhis understanding of law or jurisprudence in deciding specific objections, in\nfavor of disclosure etc. Order passed by the CPIO is cryptic, without any\nreference to objections raised by the Appellant. Similarly, the FAA instead of\npassing a speaking order has also given a cryptic orderto the Appellant. The\nCPIO and the FAA are expected to apply their mind before issuing the order of\nintent of disclosing the information. Further, no opportunity of personal hearing\nwas given to the appellant nor speaking order have been passed by FAA for not\ngiving opportunity of hearing or elaborating reasons for accepting /not\naccepting their objections in his decision in the appeal. The Commission is of\nthe view that every objection should be dealt and rejected/accepted with a\nreason and reasons for not giving opportunity of personal hearing should be\nwell reasoned too in view of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">18. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicant has to\nbe adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institution, various\njudicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts providing\nguidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should necessarily be\nprovided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise if denied or not\ngiven reasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, order by CPIO should\nenumerate the principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of audit/ inspection\nreports or part thereof which may include personal information, commercially\nsensitive information of clients or institution and hence specifically excluded\ndisclosures under various Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165184810\" id=\"span_20\">19. The Commission in this context refer to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\nDelhi High Court in decision in <a href=\"/doc/165184810/\" id=\"a_47\">J P Aggarwal v.

Deciding appeals under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_48\">RTI Act</a> is a quasi judicial function. It\n           is, therefore, necessary that the appellate authority should see that the\n           justice is not only done but it should also appear to have been done. In\n           order to do so, the order passed by the appellate authority should be a\n           speaking order giving justification for the decision arrived at.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">           5..............................<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_49\">The Act</a> provides that the first appellate authority\n           would be an officer senior in rank to the CPIO. Thus, the appellate\n           authority, as per provisions of the Act, would be an officer in a\n           commanding position vis a vis&#x27; the CPIO. Nevertheless, if, in any\n           case, the CPIO does not implement the order passed by the appellate\n           authority and the appellate authority feels that intervention of higher\n           authority is required to get his order implemented, he should bring the\n           matter to the notice of the officer in the public authority competent to\n           take against the CPIO. Such competent officer shall take necessary\n           action so as to ensure implementation of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_50\">RTI Act</a>. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">20. The Commission has also taken a detailed view in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022 wherein issues of\nredaction, ratio of Jayantilal Mistry case and other related issues are discussed\nin detail. Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make\nit clear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right\nto information are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has held that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks and financial institutions may be allowed taking\ninto account the circumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a\nblanket manner.

The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of the\nCPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and\nlater in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be\nrequired to adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of\nthe Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take\nview on various objections filed by the Appellant and submissions made by\napplicant to reach the decision in favor or against on case to case basis. He has\nto factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry case,\nCommission&#x27;s judgment dated 05.05.2022 and other relevant judgments, some\nof which have been referred in this order as well. Hence, with these\nobservations the order passed by the CPIO and FAA in this matter is set aside\nand the case is being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh.
