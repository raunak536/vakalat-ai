The Respondent No.2 vide his Order dated 25.6.2016 supplied\n\nthe information sought at (a) supra but withheld information\n\npertaining to query No. (b) and (c), citing the reason that the\n\nRespondent No. 5 being a third-party had declined consent to the\n\nsupply of such information. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1138005\" id=\"span_4\">Aggrieved thereof, the Petitioner\n\npreferred an Appeal before the First Appellate Authority, Respondent\n\nNo.3, relying on the Order of the Chief Information Commissioner of\n\nIndia, in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/1138005/\" id=\"a_8\">Mr. Jayant G. Joshi vs. Mr. M.B. Patel1</a> wherein it\n\nwas, inter alia, held that disclosure of information such as assets of\n\na Public Servant which is routinely collected by the Public Authority\n\nand routinely provided by the Public Servant cannot be construed as\n\nan invasion on the privacy of an individual. However, by letter dated\n\n24.8.2016 issued by the Respondent No.2, the Petitioner was\n\ninformed that his First Appeal was disposed of ex-parte on\n\n22.08.2016. In the face of protests by the Petitioner, a re-hearing\n\nwas directed whereby the Respondent No.3 upheld the Order of the\n\nRespondent No.2, reasoning that the Petitioner did not succeed in\n\nestablishing larger public interest as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\n\nof the RTI Act.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_5\">Assailing this Order, an Appeal was preferred before\n\nthe Respondent No. 4 drawing strength from the decision in <a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_10\">State of\n\nU.P. vs. Raj Narain2</a>,     besides contending that the regular submission\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1</span>\n    (CIC/SG/A/2011/003103/16921)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">2</span>\n    (1975) 4 SCC 428\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                              WP(C) No. 31 of 2017                             5</span>\n\n\n               Shri Sancha Bahadur Subba   vs. State of Sikkim &amp; Others\n\n\n\n\nof information of assets and liabilities, including sources of income\n\nby all government servants including the Petitioner was a requisite\n\nunder Rule 19 of the Sikkim Government Servant (Conduct) Rules,\n\n1981. The Appellate Authority was also informed that the Petitioner\n\nwas already pursuing a Complaint/Representation in the matter of\n\ncorruption against the Respondent No.5 through departmental\n\nproceedings. Respondent No.4 concluded that query No. (b) and (c)\n\nof the Application of the Petitioner (extracted hereinabove) was\n\npersonal information which were confidential and on the failure of\n\nthe Petitioner to satisfy and convince the Commission that there was\n\nprima facie a case of corruption against the third-party, rejected the\n\nAppeal vide Order dated 09.03.2017. Hence, this Petition wherein it\n\nis, inter alia, contended that the Respondents No. 2, 3 and 4, being\n\nPublic Authorities within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act,\n\nare bound to ensure maximum disclosure and minimum exemptions\n\nin providing   the    information      necessary         for    transparency and\n\naccountability and to contain corruption as envisaged under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_12\">RTI\n\nAct</a> and not to muzzle, throttle or minimise disclosure.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"190408417\" id=\"span_9\">5.          Advancing his arguments for the Petitioner, learned\n\nCounsel sought to convince this Court that the disclosure of the\n\nassets of the Respondent No.5 would reveal whether there was large\n\nscale corruption or whether the assets of the Respondent No.5 were\n\nequivalent to his income. It was next contended that the exemptions\n\ncarved under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, vests discretion on the\n\nPublic Authority to hold that personal information of a third party\n\ncan be supplied to the person seeking information, when the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                      WP(C) No. 31 of 2017                               6</span>\n\n\n                       <a href=\"/doc/190408417/\" id=\"a_14\">Shri Sancha Bahadur Subba   vs. State of Sikkim &amp; Others</a>\n\n\n\n\ndisclosure outweighs the harm to protected interests and has some\n\nrelationship to any public activity or interest and when the authority\n\nis satisfied that larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such\n\ninformation. The Respondents No. 2, 3 and 4 failed to appreciate\n\nthis context and erred in concluding that there was no larger public\n\ninterest involved. Inviting the attention of this Court to <a href=\"/doc/1484095/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(2)</a>\n\nof the RTI Act, it was contended that the provision commences with\n\na non obstante clause overarching the exemptions carved out under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner would\n\nfurther canvass that the information sought by the Petitioner was\n\nnot third party information since it is public record maintained in the\n\nregular course of governance, to ensure transparency and contain\n\ncorruption. In this context, attention was also drawn to Rule 19 of\n\nthe Sikkim Government Servants‟ Conduct Rules, 1981 (for short\n\n„SGS Rules‟), which provides for yearly declaration of assets and\n\nliabilities       and    sources      of   income        of    a   Government     servant\n\ncommencing from his appointment till superannuation.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_11\">That, the\n\nRespondent No.3 erroneously relied upon the ratio in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_17\">Girish Chandra\n\nDeshpande vs. Central Information Commissioner and Others</a> 3,                      which in\n\nfact provides that when in a given case the Central Public\n\nInformation Officer or the SPIO or the Appellate Authority is\n\nsatisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n\nsuch information, appropriate orders could be passed.</span> Learned\n\nCounsel would argue that the ratio did not conclude that routine\n\ndeclaration of assets and liabilities by a Public Servant to a Public\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">3</span>\n    (2013) 1 SCC 212\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                      WP(C) No. 31 of 2017                                  7</span>\n\n\n                       Shri Sancha Bahadur Subba   vs. State of Sikkim &amp; Others\n\n\n\n\nAuthority in the course of public service is third-party confidential\n\ninformation within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, as a\n\npublic servant is expected to be accountable in the discharge of his\n\nduties and the privacy of a public servant cannot be of a larger\n\nconcern then the public interest in transparency and accountability\n\nof governance in containing corruption. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"14861813\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"135095591\" id=\"span_15\">It was further contended\n\nthat the Respondent No.4 failed to consider the ratio in the <a href=\"/doc/135095591/\" id=\"a_19\">State of\n\nKarnataka vs. Selvi J.

Countering the contentions advanced by the Petitioner,\n\nlearned Counsel for the Respondents No.1, 2 and 3, put forth the\n\narguments that the Petitioner was unsuccessful in establishing that\n\nthe information sought for was in larger public interest. That, in fact\n\nthe decision in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_21\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande</a> (supra) would aptly be\n\napplicable to the facts of the instant case, as the assets of an\n\nemployee was being sought thereunder but in appeal the Hon‟ble\n\nSupreme         Court       declined     to   allow      the     application.

That, the expression „public interest‟ like public purpose\n\nis not capable of any precise definition, however, public interest has\n\nto be construed keeping in mind the balance between right to\n\nprivacy and right to information and the decision based on objective\n\nsatisfaction,   ensuring      that    larger       public      interest    outweighs\n\nunwarranted invasion of privacy. That, no evidence was shown to\n\nindicate that the complaint of the Petitioner had been accepted by\n\nany competent authority including the Court nor has any proceeding\n\nof corruption been initiated against the Respondent No.5.

Thus, the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 19</a> indicates that the group of\n\nrights, listed as clause (a) to (g), though recognized as Fundamental\n\nRights conferred on citizens cannot be absolute, uncontrolled or\n\nwholly emancipated from restraints, which could result in anarchy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">16.                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1193965\" id=\"span_28\">In <a href=\"/doc/1193965/\" id=\"a_53\">Collector of Customs, Madras v.

At the same time, I hasten to add that no specific\n\nparameters can be laid down as it depends on the facts of every\n\nindividual case.

While <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_80\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_81\">4</a> seek to achieve the\n                  first objective, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_82\">Sections 8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_83\">9</a>, <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_84\">10</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_85\">11</a> seek to achieve\n                  the second objective. Therefore when <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 8</a>\n                  exempts certain information from being disclosed, it\n                  should not be considered to be a fetter on the right to\n                  information, but as an equally important provision\n                  protecting other public interests essential for the\n                  fulfillment and preservation of democratic ideals.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">                         62.
