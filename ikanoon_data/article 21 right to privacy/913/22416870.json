Honourable Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_21\">Suchita Srivastava\n\nVs.

It is important to recognise that reproductive choice\n\ncan be exercised to procreate                    as        well    as         to      abstain        from\n\nprocreating.         The    crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy,\n\ndignity and bodily integrity should be respected.                       In the instant matter, the\n\nmedical board has reported that the the risk of termination of pregnancy is\n\nwithin     normal       acceptable          limits.          It   is    further       reported        that\n\npetitioner, the victim of rape, has reportedly told before the board that if she is\n\nforced to continue with the pregnancy she would have no other option but to\n\ncommit suicide. It must be noted that the pregnancy carried by petitioner\n\nis as a result of physical abuse thrust against her and that she has a\n\nchoice whether to continue with such pregnancy which is result of offence\n\nagainst her person. The freedom of making choice by a woman which is\n\nintegral part of personal liberty cannot be taken away. It shall also be taken\n\ninto consideration         that        besides    physical        injury,   the      legislature      has\n\nwidened        the   scope        of    term     injury     by    including        injury   to   mental\n\nhealth    of     a   pregnant           woman.

A     woman         irrespective     of     her     marital status         can       be\n         pregnant either by choice or it can                       be        an        unwanted\n         pregnancy.         To be pregnant is a natural phenomenon for which\n         woman and man both are responsible. Wanted pregnancy is shared\n         equally, however, when it is an accident or unwanted, then the man\n         may not be there to share the burden but it may only be\n         the woman on whom the burden falls. Under such circumstances,\n         a question arises why only a woman should suffer.                                     There\n         are social, financial and other aspects immediately attached to the\n         pregnancy of the woman and if pregnancy                      is    unwant        it    can\n         have serious repercussions.              it undoubtedly affects her mental\n         health.
