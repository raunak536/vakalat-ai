According to the petitioners, the right of the petitioners to\ncohabitate as husband and wife by no stretch of imagination could be\ntermed to be a confinement and the issuance of the search warrant\nunder the impugned orders was violative of their fundamental right as\nenshrined under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_21\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\nMore so, on an application made by a third party, who had no locus\nstandi to file the subject application under <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 97</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1322403/\" id=\"a_24\">98</a>.

Placing reliance upon <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_28\">Govind vs. State of MP</a>, 1975\nCr.LJ 1111, the petitioners also plead that the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> includes the right to be let alone and\nevery citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\nfamily, marriage etc. Besides that, according to the petitioners,\nVirender&#x27;s action in making the subject application had the effect of\nenticing and taking away Laxmi and thereby, attracted <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 498</a>\nIPC, though, adultery stood struck down as unconstitutional. Also,\naccording to them, the impugned orders were hit by Latin maxim\n&#x27;Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit&#x27; and therefore, this court was under</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P.(Crl.)

As\nfor the purported complaint made by Laxmi, in the writ petition, it\nalso comes to be stated that during the business relationship of Laxmi\nwith Virender, she was made to sign certain blank papers for closure\nof the partnership a month before, which were used by Virender to\npressurise her to elope with him, which act of Virender was aided and\nabetted by Harish. In the short synopsis of submissions filed on behalf\nof the petitioners, it has also come to be stated that on the search\nwarrant issued in pursuance of the first order dated 10.04.2019 a clear\nreport was recorded by woman SI, who recorded after meeting Laxmi\nthat there was no case for illegal/wrong confinement and therefore,\nthe order of issuance of second search warrant by the lower court on\n22.04.2019 was contemptuous and non-est in the eyes of law, which\ninvited invocation of the parens patrice jurisdiction by this Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10755952\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"327590\" id=\"span_11\">5.

The impugned orders by itself do not disclose any reasons for\nthe Magistrate to form an opinion for the issuance of the search\nwarrant either on 10.04.2019 or on 22.04.2019. It appears, the\nimpugned orders have come to be passed without any application of\nmind much less due application of judicial mind. Reasons therefor\nare many. First of all, the nature of pleadings by itself do not clearly\ndisclose as to whether the application made was falling within the\ncontours of confinement amounting to an offence attracting <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n97</a> Cr.P.C. OR abduction or unlawful detention attracting <a href=\"/doc/1322403/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 98</a>\nCr.P.C. Suffice to say, <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 97</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1322403/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 98</a> Cr.P.C. are founded\non two entirely distinct premise. Broadly, it can be said that <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n97</a> is attracted when there is an element of wrongful confinement\nattracting commission of an offence, whereas, <a href=\"/doc/1322403/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 98</a> is attracted\nwhen there is abduction or unlawful detention of a woman or a female\nchild under the age of 18 years for any unlawful purpose. Certainly,\nthe application made by Virender did not have even a semblance of\nallegation of abduction or unlawful detention of Laxmi for any\nunlawful purpose. Squarely therefore, in the absence of even any\nallegation of her abduction or unlawful detention for any unlawful\npurpose, <a href=\"/doc/1322403/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 98</a> Cr.P.C. was not attracted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">7.      <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_43\">Sec. 97</a> Cr.P.C. reads, as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     &quot;Search for persons wrongfully confined. - If any\n     District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate or\n     Magistrate of the first class has reason to believe that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">W.P.(Crl.)

It\ncan be invoked by the Magistrate even of his own knowledge in\nexercise of power vesting in him under <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_45\">Sec. 190</a> Cr.P.C. when he has\nreason to believe that a confinement, which is an offence, has come to\nbe committed within his territorial jurisdiction. Intent being such, <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_46\">Sec.\n97</a> stipulates for a person searched to be immediately taken before a\nMagistrate to enable him to pass such orders as the circumstances of\nthe case may require. Exercise of such power is thus well defined and\nit requires no elaboration that power so vesting in the Magistrate is\nquite drastic and cannot be exercised lightly inamsuch as any\nunjustifiable and arbitrary use may lead to serious consequences of\nloss of reputation, emotional pain and suffering, insult etc. and\nseriously violate a person&#x27;s fundamental rights of life and liberty\nwhich, undoubtedly, would include a right of privacy. It is also to be\nremembered that <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_47\">Sec. 97</a> clearly defines the limitations for its exercise\ninasmuch as the confinement amounting to an offence is sine qua non\nto invoke it. It cannot be construed to be akin to habeas corpus action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">8.      The averments and the allegations made in the application\nbeing wholly vague, the other material before the lower court was the\npurported complaints and some mobile text messages, on the basis\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.P.(Crl.) No.1245/2019                                      Page 10 of 14</span>\n whereof, the complaint came to be made to SHO PS Farsh Bazar by\nHarish, who was none else but an Advocate of Virender, who equally\nmade the application under <a href=\"/doc/358646/\" id=\"a_48\">Sections 97</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1322403/\" id=\"a_49\">98</a> Cr.P.C. The\napplication so made before the Magistrate having jurisdiction over PS\nFarsh Bazar on the complaint made by an Advocate and so the\napplication, being unethical, was simply overlooked. This is\ncompounded by the fact that the other purported complaint attributed\nto Laxmi was made to SHO PS Shakarpur through Speed Post and a\nbare perusal of the copies of the postal receipts show that this was\nsent from District Court Complex, Saket on 28.03.2019. Sending of\nthis communication through post from District Court Complex, Saket-\nby itself, at least prima facie, was indicative of the fact that Laxmi\nwas not under a confinement, which could be construed to be an\noffence. More so, the said complaint purportedly made by Laxmi, as\nper the trial court record received by this court, which is maintained\nhaphazardly, is seen to be incomplete inasmuch as only first page of\nthe purported complaint made by Laxmi to SHO PS Shakarpur is seen\non the record of the lower court. Equally, nothing emerges from the\nrecord of the lower court for the State on its part having taken any\ninitiative to put forth and bring to the notice of the lower court for any\naction taken on any of the complaints received either at PS Farsh\nBazar or PS Shakarpur much less for any cognizance of the offence of\nwrongful confinement, which is cognizable, having been taken at any\npoint of time. Not only such inaction, it transpires from the lower\ncourt record that on the search warrant issued for Laxmi on\n10.04.2019, police officers led by an ASI of PS Farsh Bazar visited\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.(Crl.) No.1245/2019                                      Page 11 of 14</span>\n the house of the petitioners at Village &amp; Post Katrari, PS Deoria, UP\nand there, recorded the statements of Sudhir, Laxmi as also Sh. Jai\nPrakash Dubey, who was the father of Laxmi. As per the statement of\nboth Laxmi and her father, Laxmi was not under any confinement. To\nthe similar effect, it came to be stated by Sudhir, Laxmi and their son\nMaster Siddhant besides Mr. Jai Prakash Dubey-father of Laxmi; and,\nSh. Krishan Kumar Mishra-brother of Sudhir, when they appeared\nbefore this court and stated that they were living together as a family\nat Deoria without any friction amongst them of any kind whatsoever.\nIt appears, State on its part, whose duty was to protect and preserve\nthe sanctity of the pious relationship of husband and wife - Sudhir and\nLaxmi - which includes their personal privacy as also their house,\nadopted a lackadaisical approach, a stance of total silence. Were the\nofficers representing the State especially the police, oblivious of their\nfundamental duty, one wonders. Report of ASI dated 20.04.2019\nequally narrates a bizarre work, when police searches Laxmi in her\nown house and inspite of the statement made by her and her father\nthat she was not under any confinement, was still taken to the Court of\nCJM, Deoria and that too, at the instance of the complainant\nAdvocates Harish and S.P. Yadav, where also Laxmi reiterated for\nbeing not under any illegal detention. The act of the police in taking\nLaxmi to the court of CJM at the instance of Advocates Harish and\nS.P. Yadav - so recorded in the report dated 20.04.2019 - inspite of\nthe fact of Laxmi by herself having stated that she was not under any\ndetention, is wholly unacceptable. It is a serious reflection of\nhighhandedness of the police acting at the instance of Advocates\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.(Crl.)
