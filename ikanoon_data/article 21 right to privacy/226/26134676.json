The appellant was, at the material time, working on the post of Nursing Officer in\n\nthe Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research 1 at Chandigarh since\n\nher appointment on 25 November 2005. On 18 February 2014, the appellant married\n\nAmir Singh. The spouse of the appellant was married before his marriage to the\n\nappellant, but his former wife passed away on 16 February 2013. From his first\n\nmarriage, he has two children, a male child born on 1 February 2001 and a female child\n\nborn on 3 March 2005. The appellant filed an application on 4 May 2015, requesting the\n\nauthorities at PGIMER to enter the names of the two children born from the first\n\nmarriage of her spouse in the official service record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.         The appellant had her first biological child on 4 June 2019 from her marriage. On\n\n6 June 2019, she applied for maternity leave for the period from 27 June 2019 to 23\n\nDecember 2019 in terms of Rule 43 of the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules 1972. 2\n\nThe authorities at PGIMER sought a clarification on 3 July 2019 regarding the fact that\n\nthe spouse of the appellant had two surviving children from his first marriage. The\n\nappellant submitted a detailed reply on 24 July 2019. The request of the appellant for\n\nthe grant of maternity leave was rejected on 3 September 2019 on the ground that she\n\nhad two surviving children and had availed of child care leave earlier for the two\n\nchildren born from the first marriage of her spouse. Consequently, maternity leave for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">1</span>\n    “PGIMER”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">2</span>\n    “Rules of 1972”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                        3</span>\n\n\nthe child borne by her, considered as her third child, was found to be inadmissible in\n\nterms of the Rules of 1972. By an office order dated 21 January 2020, her leave for the\n\nperiod from 30 May 2019 to 3 June 2019; 4 June 2019 to 27 October 2019; 27 October\n\n2019 to 6 November 2019; and 7 November 2019 to 31 November 2019 was treated as\n\nearned leave, medical leave, half pay leave, and extraordinary leave respectively. The\n\nperiod of extraordinary leave was not counted towards increments in the scale of Rs.\n\n9300-34800 under FR-26(ii) of the Fundamental Rules, Volume-I.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">5.          Aggrieved by the decisions dated 3 September 2019 and 21 January 2020 of the\n\nadministrative authorities at PGIMER, the appellant moved the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal3 at its Chandigarh Bench in OA No 155 of 2020. By a judgment dated 29\n\nJanuary 2021, the Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed the OA, holding:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                  “10. [....] It is, thus, clear that the maternity leave can be granted\n                  to a female government servant only if she has less than two\n                  surviving children. As per her own request, the applicant has\n                  already shown her two children from the first marriage of her\n                  husband as her children and she has been availing benefit in\n                  their respect on many occasions earlier and subsequent to her\n                  marriage. Therefore, for all practical purposes and as far as\n                  respondent department is concerned, she has already two\n                  surviving children and she is taking benefit for them from the\n                  respondent department by way of Child Care Leave and other\n                  benefits.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                  11. In view of the above, any child born to her now will be\n                  considered only as a third child and cannot be taken as the first\n                  child. It may be true that Viren Partap Singh is first child born to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">3</span>\n    “CAT”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                      4</span>\n\n\n                 her after her first pregnancy with her husband. But, of her own\n                 choice, the applicant has already got the names of other two\n                 children from her husband&#x27;s first marriage entered in the record\n                 of the office as her children and is availing benefits on their\n                 behalf including Child Care Leave. The Rule position is clear and\n                 for all practical purposes, the applicant has two surviving\n                 children. As such, any child born to her now can only be\n                 considered as third child.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                 12. In view of the above, the decision of the respondents to reject\n                 her maternity leave is correct even though it may be first\n                 maternity for the applicant herself”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">6.        The appellant moved the High Court in a writ petition4 under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution, calling into question the judgment of the Tribunal, resulting in the\n\nimpugned judgment. By the impugned judgment and order dated 16 March 2021, the\n\nHigh Court dismissed the petition on the ground that there is no perversity or illegality in\n\nthe judgment of the CAT. The High Court held:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                 “12.    A bare perusal of the aforesaid rule would reveal that\n                 maternity leave can be granted to a female Government servant\n                 only if she has less than two surviving children. Though, the\n                 petitioner is not the biological mother of the two children born\n                 from the first wedlock of her husband, she cannot deny the fact\n                 that now she is the mother of them also after having married to\n                 Amar Singh. In this way, the petitioner has already two surviving\n                 children. Not only this, she has also availed CCL for them from\n                 the respondent Department. In this view of the matter, any child\n                 born to her is to be considered as a third child. We are of the\n                 considered view that the CAT has rightly observed in the\n                 impugned order that “....for all practical purposes, the applicant\n                 has two surviving children. As such, any child born to her now\n                 can only be considered as a third child.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">4</span>\n    CWP No 3460 of 2021\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                     5</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">7.

The High Court opined that since the appellant had availed of child care leave in\n\nrespect of the biological children of her spouse born from his first marriage, she would\n\nbe disentitled to the grant of maternity leave. After her marriage to Amar Singh, she was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                             6</span>\n\n\nconsidered to have two surviving children. The High Court found that she therefore did\n\nnot meet the requirement of sub-rule (1) of Rule 43 of having less than two surviving\n\nchildren for the purpose of being granted maternity leave.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">9.

The case of the appellant is that the maternity leave was sought by her on the\n\nbirth of her first biological child and the fact that there are two children of her spouse\n\nborn from an earlier marriage would not disentitle her under Rule 43 of the Rules of\n\n1972. Counsel for the appellant submitted that though the appellant had availed of child\n\ncare leave in respect of her step children, this leave is distinct from maternity leave.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">12.    The contention of the respondents is that having taken the benefit of child care\n\nleave in respect of the two children born to the spouse of the appellant from his first\n\nmarriage, the appellant was not entitled to maternity leave in respect of the birth of her\n\nown biological child. The appellant was, in the submission of the respondents,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                   7</span>\n\n\ndisentitled to maternity leave on the ground that she had two surviving children, in terms\n\nof Rule 43 of the Rules of 1972.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">13.

While dealing\n                  with the application of a destitute wife or hapless children or\n                  parents under this provision, the Court is dealing with the\n                  marginalised sections of the society. The purpose is to achieve\n                  “social justice” which is the constitutional vision, enshrined in the\n                  Preamble of the Constitution of India. The Preamble to the\n                  Constitution of India clearly signals that we have chosen the\n                  democratic path under the rule of law to achieve the goal of\n                  securing for all its citizens, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.\n                  It specifically highlights achieving their social justice.

Of late, in this very direction, it is emphasised that the courts\n                  have to adopt different approaches in “social justice\n                  adjudication”, which is also known as “social context\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">6</span>\n    (2014) 1 SCC 188\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                    11</span>\n\n\n               adjudication” as mere “adversarial approach” may not be very\n               appropriate. There are number of social justice legislations giving\n               special protection and benefits to vulnerable groups in the\n               society. Prof. Madhava Menon describes it eloquently:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">               “It is, therefore, respectfully submitted that ‘social context\n               judging’ is essentially the application of equality\n               jurisprudence as evolved by Parliament and the Supreme\n               Court in myriad situations presented before courts where\n               unequal parties are pitted in adversarial proceedings and\n               where courts are called upon to dispense equal justice.\n               Apart from the social-economic inequalities accentuating the\n               disabilities of the poor in an unequal fight, the adversarial\n               process itself operates to the disadvantage of the weaker party.\n               In such a situation, the Judge has to be not only sensitive to the\n               inequalities of parties involved but also positively inclined to the\n               weaker party if the imbalance were not to result in miscarriage of\n               justice. This result is achieved by what we call social context\n               judging or social justice adjudication.” [Keynote address on\n               “Legal Education in Social Context” delivered at National Law\n               University, Jodhpur on October 12, 2005, available on\n               http://web.archive.org/web/20061210031743/http:/www.nlujodhp\n               ur.ac.in/ceireports.htm [last visited on 25-12-2013]]\n\n               …\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">               16. The law regulates relationships between people. It prescribes\n               patterns of behaviour. It reflects the values of society. The role\n               of the court is to understand the purpose of law in society\n               and to help the law achieve its purpose. But the law of a\n               society is a living organism. It is based on a given factual\n               and social reality that is constantly changing. Sometimes\n               change in law precedes societal change and is even\n               intended to stimulate it. In most cases, however, a change in\n               law is the result of a change in social reality. Indeed, when\n               social reality changes, the law must change too. Just as\n               change in social reality is the law of life, responsiveness to\n               change in social reality is the life of the law. It can be said that\n               the history of law is the history of adapting the law to society&#x27;s\n               changing needs. In both constitutional and statutory\n               interpretation, the court is supposed to exercise discretion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                       12</span>\n\n\n                    in determining the proper relationship between               the\n                    subjective and objective purposes of the law.”\n\n                                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">17.

In alignment with the Constitution as well as the treaties mentioned above, Rule\n\n43(1) of the Rules of 1972 contemplates the grant of maternity leave for a period of 180\n\ndays. Independent of the grant of maternity leave, a woman is also entitled to the grant\n\nof child care leave for taking care of her two eldest surviving children whether for\n\nrearing or for looking after any of their needs, such as education, sickness and the like.\n\nChild care leave under Rule 43-C can be availed of not only at the point when the child\n\nis born but at any subsequent period as is evident from the illustrative causes which are\n\nadverted to in the provisions, which have been extracted in the earlier part of the\n\njudgment. Both constitute distinct entitlements.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\fCA 5308/2022</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                                     18</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_38\">24.    The facts of the present case indicate that the spouse of the appellant had a prior\n\nmarriage which had ended as a result of the death of his wife after which the appellant\n\nmarried him. The fact that the appellant‟s spouse had two biological children from his\n\nfirst marriage would not impinge upon the entitlement of the appellant to avail maternity\n\nleave for her sole biological child. The fact that she was granted child care leave in\n\nrespect of the two biological children born to her spouse from an earlier marriage may\n\nbe a matter on which a compassionate view was taken by the authorities at the relevant\n\ntime. Gendered roles assigned to women and societal expectations mean that women\n\nare always pressed upon to take a disproportionate burden of childcare work. According\n\nto a „time-use‟ survey conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\n\nDevelopment (OECD), women in India currently spend upto 352 minutes per day on\n\nunpaid work, 577% more than the time spent by men.12 Time spent in unpaid work\n\nincludes childcare. In this context, the support of care work through benefits such as\n\nmaternity leave, paternity leave, or child care leave (availed by both parents) by the\n\nstate and other employers is essential. Although certain provisions of the Rules of 1972\n\nhave enabled women to enter the paid workforce, women continue to bear the primary\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">12</span>\n        Organisation         for       Economic        Co-operation    and       Development, &#x27;Time-Use&#x27; (OECD\n      Stat) &lt;https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=TIME_USE#&gt; accessed 22 August 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                           19</span>\n\n\nresponsibility for childcare. The grant of child care leave to the appellant cannot be\n\nused to disentitle her to maternity leave under Rule 43 of the Rules of 1972.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">25.   Unless a purposive interpretation were to be adopted in the present case, the\n\nobject and intent of the grant of maternity leave would simply be defeated. The grant of\n\nmaternity leave under Rules of 1972 is intended to facilitate the continuance of women\n\nin the workplace. It is a harsh reality that but for such provisions, many women would\n\nbe compelled by social circumstances to give up work on the birth of a child, if they are\n\nnot granted leave and other facilitative measures. No employer can perceive child birth\n\nas detracting from the purpose of employment. Child birth has to be construed in the\n\ncontext of employment as a natural incident of life and hence, the provisions for\n\nmaternity leave must be construed in that perspective.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">26.   The predominant understanding of the concept of a “family” both in the law and in\n\nsociety is that it consists of a single, unchanging unit with a mother and a father (who\n\nremain constant over time) and their children. This assumption ignores both, the many\n\ncircumstances which may lead to a change in one‟s familial structure, and the fact that\n\nmany families do not conform to this expectation to begin with. Familial relationships\n\nmay take the form of domestic, unmarried partnerships or queer relationships. A\n\nhousehold may be a single parent household for any number of reasons, including the\n\ndeath of a spouse, separation, or divorce. Similarly, the guardians and caretakers (who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                            20</span>\n\n\ntraditionally occupy the roles of the “mother” and the “father”) of children may change\n\nwith remarriage, adoption, or fostering. These manifestations of love and of families\n\nmay not be typical but they are as real as their traditional counterparts. Such atypical\n\nmanifestations of the family unit are equally deserving not only of protection under law\n\nbut also of the benefits available under social welfare legislation. The black letter of the\n\nlaw must not be relied upon to disadvantage families which are different from traditional\n\nones. The same undoubtedly holds true for women who take on the role of motherhood\n\nin ways that may not find a place in the popular imagination.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">27.   The facts of the present case, too, indicate that the structure of the appellant‟s\n\nfamily changed when she took on a parental role with respect to her spouse‟s biological\n\nchildren from his previous marriage. When the appellant applied to PGIMER for\n\nmaternity leave, PGIMER was faced with facts that the law may not have envisaged or\n\nadequately accounted for. When courts are confronted with such situations, they would\n\ndo well to attempt to give effect to the purpose of the law in question rather than to\n\nprevent its application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">28.   For the above reasons, we hold that the appellant was entitled to the grant of\n\nmaternity leave. The communication of the third respondent denying her the entitlement\n\nwas contrary to the provisions of Rule 43. We accordingly set aside the impugned\n\njudgment of the High Court dated 16 March 2021 and the judgment of the CAT dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\fCA 5308/2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                            21</span>\n\n\n29 January 2021.
