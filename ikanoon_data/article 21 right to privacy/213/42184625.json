Such   a    magnificent,   compassionate   and\n\n          monumental document embodies emphatic inclusiveness which\n\n          has been further nurtured by judicial sensitivity when it has\n\n          developed the concept of golden triangle of fundamental rights. If\n\n          we have to apply the parameters of a fundamental right, it is an\n\n          expression of judicial sensibility which further enhances the\n\n          beauty of the Constitution as conceived of.

That is the\n\nmanifestation of concerned sensitivity. Individual dignity has a\n\nsanctified realm in a civilized society. The civility of a civilization\n\nearns    warmth    and   respect       when   it   respects   more   the\n\nindividuality of a woman. The said concept gets a further accent\n\nwhen a woman is treated with the real spirit of equality with a\n\nman. Any system treating a woman with indignity, inequity and\n\ninequality or discrimination invites the wrath of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Any provision that might have, few decades back, got the stamp\n\nof serene approval may have to meet its epitaph with the efflux of\n\ntime    and growing constitutional precepts and progressive\n\nperception.

And, it is time to say that a\n\nhusband is not the master. Equality is the governing parameter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">All historical perceptions should evaporate and their obituaries\n\nbe written. It is advisable to remember what John Stuart Mill had\n\nobserved:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">         ―The legal subordination of one sex to another –\n         is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief\n         hindrances to human improvement; and that it\n         ought to be replaced by a system of perfect\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                       3</span>\n\n\n               equality, admitting no power and privilege on\n               the one side, nor disability on the other.‖1\n\n           We are commencing with the aforesaid prefatory note as we\n\nare adverting to the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 497</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>) and <a href=\"/doc/854390/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 198</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure (<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_4\">CrPC</a>).\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">2.         At this juncture, it is necessary to state that though there is\n\nnecessity of certainty of law, yet with the societal changes and\n\nmore so, when the rights are expanded by the Court in respect of\n\ncertain aspects having regard to the reflective perception of the\n\norganic and living Constitution, it is not apposite to have an\n\ninflexible stand on the foundation that the concept of certainty of\n\nlaw should be allowed to prevail and govern. The progression in\n\nlaw and the perceptual shift compels the present to have a\n\npenetrating look to the past.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">3.         When we say so, we may not be understood that precedents\n\nare not to be treated as such and that in the excuse of perceptual\n\nshift, the binding nature of precedent should not be allowed to\n\nretain its status or allowed to be diluted. When a constitutional\n\ncourt faces such a challenge, namely, to be detained by a\n\nprecedent or to grow out of the same because of the normative\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">1</span>\n    On the Subjection of Women, Chapter 1 (John Stuart Mill, 1869)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                    4</span>\n\n\nchanges that have occurred in the other arenas of law and the\n\nobtaining precedent does not cohesively fit into the same, the\n\nconcept of cohesive adjustment has to be in accord with the\n\ngrowing legal interpretation and the analysis has to be different,\n\nmore so, where the emerging concept recognises a particular\n\nright to be planted in the compartment of a fundamental right,\n\nsuch as <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_5\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">21</a> of the Constitution.            In such a\n\nbackdrop, when the constitutionality of a provision is assailed,\n\nthe Court is compelled to have a keen scrutiny of the provision in\n\nthe context of developed and progressive interpretation.            A\n\nconstitutional court cannot remain entrenched in a precedent,\n\nfor the controversy relates to the lives of human beings who\n\ntranscendentally grow. It can be announced with certitude that\n\ntransformative constitutionalism asserts itself every moment and\n\nasserts itself to have its space.       It is abhorrent to any kind of\n\nregressive approach.    The whole thing can be viewed from\n\nanother perspective. What might be acceptable at one point of\n\ntime may melt into total insignificance at another point of time.\n\nHowever, it is worthy to note that the change perceived should\n\nnot be in a sphere of fancy or individual fascination, but should\n\nbe founded on the solid bedrock of change that the society has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                5</span>\n\n\nperceived, the spheres in which the legislature has responded\n\nand the rights that have been accentuated by the constitutional\n\ncourts. To explicate, despite conferring many a right on women\n\nwithin       the      parameters          of   progressive    jurisprudence   and\n\nexpansive constitutional vision, the Court cannot conceive of\n\nwomen still being treated as a property of men, and secondly,\n\nwhere the delicate relationship between a husband and wife does\n\nnot remain so, it is seemingly implausible to allow a criminal\n\noffence to enter and make a third party culpable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.

At that juncture, the Court\n\nnoted that:-</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          “Prima facie, on a perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 497</a> of\n          the Indian Penal Code, we find that it grants\n          relief to the wife by treating her as a victim.\n          It is also worthy to note that when an\n          offence is committed by both of them, one is\n          liable for the criminal offence but the other\n          is absolved. It seems to be based on a\n          societal    presumption.     Ordinarily,    the\n          criminal law proceeds on gender neutrality\n          but in this provision, as we perceive, the\n          said concept is absent. That apart, it is to be\n          seen when there is conferment of any\n          affirmative right on women, can it go to the\n          extent of treating them as the victim, in all\n          circumstances, to the peril of the husband.\n          Quite apart from that, it is perceivable from\n          the language employed in the Section that\n          the fulcrum of the offence is destroyed once\n          the consent or the connivance of the\n          husband is established. Viewed from the\n          said scenario, the provision really creates a\n          dent on the individual independent identity\n          of a woman when the emphasis is laid on\n          the connivance or the consent of the\n          husband.        This      tantamounts        to\n          subordination of a woman where the\n          Constitution confers equal status. A time\n          has come when the society must realise that\n          a woman is equal to a man in every field.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          This provision, prima facie, appears to be\n          quite archaic. When the society progresses\n          and the rights are conferred, the new\n          generation of thoughts spring, and that is\n          why, we are inclined to issue notice.‖\n\n     That is how the matter has been placed before us.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                7</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1343950\" id=\"span_20\">6.   At this stage, one aspect needs to be noted. At the time of\n\ninitial hearing before the three-Judge Bench, the decision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1343950/\" id=\"a_14\">Yusuf Abdul Aziz</a> (supra) was cited and the cited Law Report\n\nreflected that the judgment was delivered by four learned Judges\n\nand later on, it was noticed, as is reflectible from the Supreme\n\nCourt Reports, that the decision was rendered by a Constitution\n\nBench comprising of five Judges of this Court.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">7.   The said factual discovery will not detain us any further. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1343950\" id=\"span_21\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1343950/\" id=\"a_15\">Yusuf Abdul Aziz</a> (supra), the Court was dealing with the\n\ncontroversy that had travelled to this Court while dealing with a\n\ndifferent fact situation. In the said case, the question arose\n\nwhether <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 497</a> contravened <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_17\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_18\">15</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. In the said case, the appellant was being\n\nprosecuted for adultery under <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 497</a> IPC. As soon as the\n\ncomplaint was filed, the husband applied to the High Court of\n\nBombay to determine the constitutional question under <a href=\"/doc/1636756/\" id=\"a_20\">Article\n\n228</a> of the Constitution. The Constitution Bench referring to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 497</a> held thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">          ―3. Under <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 497</a> the offence of\n          adultery can only be committed by a man\n          but in the absence of any provision to the\n          contrary the woman would be punishable as\n          an abettor. The last sentence in <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 497</a>\n          prohibits this. It runs—\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                      8</span>\n\n\n      ―In such case the wife shall not be\npunishable as an abettor.‖ It is said that\nthis offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_25\">15.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">The portion of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 15</a> on which the\nappellant relies is this:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">―The State shall not discriminate against\nany citizen on grounds only of ... sex.‖\n\nBut what he overlooks is that that is subject\nto clause (3) which runs—\n\n―Nothing in this article shall prevent the\nState from making any special provision for\nwomen ....‖\n\nThe provision complained of is a special\nprovision and it is made for women,\ntherefore it is saved by clause (3).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">4. It was argued that clause (3) should be\nconfined to provisions which are beneficial\nto women and cannot be used to give them\na licence to commit and abet crimes. We are\nunable to read any such restriction into the\nclause; nor are we able to agree that a\nprovision which prohibits punishment is\ntantamount to a licence to commit the\noffence of which punishment has been\nprohibited.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">5. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 14</a> is general and must be read\nwith the other provisions which set out the\nambit of fundamental rights. Sex is a sound\nclassification and although there can be no\ndiscrimination in general on that ground,\nthe Constitution itself provides for special\nprovisions in the case of women and\nchildren. The two articles read together\nvalidate the impugned clause in <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 497</a>\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                         9</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                   6. The appellant is not a citizen of India. It\n                   was argued that he could not invoke <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles\n                   14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_30\">15</a> for that reason. The High Court\n                   held otherwise. It is not necessary for us to\n                   decide this question in view of our decision\n                   on the other issue.‖\n\n           On a reading of the aforesaid passages, it is manifest that\n\nthe Court treated the provision to be a special provision made for\n\nwomen and, therefore, saved by clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 15.</a> Thus, the\n\nCourt proceeded on the foundation of affirmative action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">8.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708017\" id=\"span_24\">In this context, we may refer to the observation made by the\n\nConstitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/708017/\" id=\"a_32\">Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra\n\nCommunity and another v.

The three-Judge Bench, while referring the matter, had\n\nbriefly dwelled upon the impact of the provision. To appreciate\n\nthe constitutional validity, first, we shall deal with the earlier\n\npronouncements and the principles enunciated therein and how\n\nwe can have a different perspective of such provisions. We have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                15</span>\n\n\nalready referred to what has been stated in <a href=\"/doc/1343950/\" id=\"a_50\">Yusuf Abdul Aziz</a>\n\n(supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">13.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"449750\" id=\"span_37\">In <a href=\"/doc/449750/\" id=\"a_51\">Sowmithri Vishnu</a> (supra), a petition preferred under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution challenged the validity of <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_53\">Section\n\n497</a> IPC. We do not intend to advert to the factual matrix. It was\n\ncontended before the three-Judge Bench that <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 497</a> confers\n\nupon the husband the right to prosecute the adulterer but it does\n\nnot confer any right upon the wife to prosecute the woman with\n\nwhom her husband has committed adultery; that <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 497</a>\n\ndoes not confer any right on the wife to prosecute the husband\n\nwho has committed adultery with another woman; and that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 497</a> does not take in cases where the husband has\n\nsexual relations with an unmarried woman with the result that\n\nhusbands have a free licence under the law to have extramarital\n\nrelationships with unmarried women. That apart, the submission\n\nwas advanced that <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 497</a> is a flagrant instance of ‗gender\n\ndiscrimination‘, ‗legislative despotism‘ and ‗male chauvinism‘. At\n\nfirst blush, it may appear as if it is a beneficial legislation\n\nintended to serve the interests of women but, on closer\n\nexamination, it would be found that the provision contained in\n\nthe section is a kind of ―romantic paternalism‖ which stems from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                  16</span>\n\n\nthe assumption that women, like chattels, are the property of\n\nmen.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">14.    The Court referred to the submissions and held thus:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">            ―…..The argument really comes to this that\n            the definition should be recast by extending\n            the ambit of the offence of adultery so that,\n            both the man and the woman should be\n            punishable for the offence of adultery. Were\n            such an argument permissible, several\n            provisions of the penal law may have to be\n            struck down on the ground that, either in\n            their definition or in their prescription of\n            punishment, they do not go far enough. For\n            example, an argument could be advanced as\n            to why the offence of robbery should be\n            punishable with imprisonment for ten years\n            under <a href=\"/doc/329571/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 392</a> of the Penal Code but the\n            offence of adultery should be punishable\n            with a sentence of five years only: ―Breaking\n            a matrimonial home is no less serious a\n            crime than breaking open a house.‖ Such\n            arguments go to the policy of the law, not to\n            its    constitutionality,     unless,     while\n            implementing the policy, any provision of\n            the Constitution is infringed. We cannot\n            accept that in defining the offence of\n            adultery so as to restrict the class of\n            offenders to men, any constitutional\n            provision is infringed. It is commonly\n            accepted that it is the man who is the\n            seducer and not the woman. This position\n            may have undergone some change over the\n            years but it is for the Legislature to consider\n            whether <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 497</a> should be amended\n            appropriately so as to take note of the\n            ―transformation‖ which the society has\n            undergone….‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                 17</span>\n\n\n      Proceeding further, the three-Judge Bench held that the\n\noffence of adultery as defined in that Section can only be\n\ncommitted by a man, not by a woman. Indeed, the Section\n\nexpressly provides that the wife shall not be punishable even as\n\nan abettor. No grievance can then be made that the Section does\n\nnot allow the wife to prosecute the husband for adultery. The\n\ncontemplation of the law, evidently, is that the wife, who is\n\ninvolved in an illicit relationship with another man, is a victim\n\nand not the author of the crime. The offence of adultery, as\n\ndefined in <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 497</a>, is considered by the Legislature as an\n\noffence against the sanctity of the matrimonial home, an act\n\nwhich is committed by a man, as it generally is. Therefore, those\n\nmen who defile that sanctity are brought within the net of the\n\nlaw. In a sense, the same point is reverted to; who can prosecute\n\nwhom for which offence depends, firstly, on the definition of the\n\noffence and, secondly, upon the restrictions placed by the law of\n\nprocedure on the right to prosecute.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">15.   The <a href=\"/doc/449750/\" id=\"a_61\">Court further held</a>:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">           ―…..Since <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 497</a> does not contain a\n           provision that she must be impleaded as a\n           necessary party to the prosecution or that\n           she would be entitled to be heard, the\n           section is said to be bad. Counsel is right\n           that <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 497</a> does not contain a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                18</span>\n\n\n          provision for hearing the married woman\n          with whom the accused is alleged to have\n          committed adultery. But, that does not\n          justify the proposition that she is not\n          entitled to be heard at the trial. We have no\n          doubt that if the wife makes an application\n          in the trial court that she should be heard\n          before a finding is recorded on the question\n          of adultery, the application would receive\n          due consideration from the court. There is\n          nothing, either in the substantive or the\n          adjectival criminal law, which bars the court\n          from affording a hearing to a party, which is\n          likely to be adversely affected, directly and\n          immediately, by the decision of the court. In\n          fact, instances are not unknown in criminal\n          law where, though the prosecution is in the\n          charge of the Public Prosecutor, the private\n          complainant is given permission to oversee\n          the proceedings. One step more, and the\n          wife could be allowed a hearing before an\n          adverse finding is recorded that, as alleged\n          by her husband, the accused had\n          committed adultery with her. The right of\n          hearing is a concomitant of the principles of\n          natural justice, though not in all situations.\n          That right can be read into the law in\n          appropriate cases.

Thus both the husband and\n                      the wife are disabled from striking each\n                      other with the weapon of criminal law. The\n                      petitioner wife contends that whether or not\n                      the law permits a husband to prosecute his\n                      disloyal wife, the wife cannot be lawfully\n                      disabled from prosecuting her disloyal\n                      husband…..‖\n\n\n           It placed heavy reliance on the three-Judge Bench in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/449750/\" id=\"a_69\">Sowmithri Vishnu</a> (supra) and proceeded to state that the\n\ncommunity               punishes   the   ‗outsider‘   who   breaks   into   the\n\nmatrimonial home and occasions the violation of sanctity of the\n\nmatrimonial tie by developing an illicit relationship with one of\n\nthe spouses subject to the rider that the erring ‗man‘ alone can\n\nbe punished and not the erring woman. It further went on to say\n\nthat it does not arm the two spouses to hit each other with the\n\nweapon of criminal law. That is why, neither the husband can\n\nprosecute the wife and send her to jail nor can the wife prosecute\n\nthe husband and send him to jail. There is no discrimination\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">9</span>\n    (1988) 2 SCC 72\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                                 20</span>\n\n\nbased on sex. While the outsider who violates the sanctity of the\n\nmatrimonial home is punished, a rider has been added that if the\n\noutsider is a woman, she is not punished. There is, thus, reverse\n\ndiscrimination in ―favour‖ of the woman rather than ―against‖\n\nher. The law does not envisage the punishment of any of the\n\nspouses at the instance of each other. Thus, there is no\n\ndiscrimination against the woman insofar as she is not permitted\n\nto prosecute her husband. A husband is not permitted because\n\nthe wife is not treated as an offender in the eye of law. The wife is\n\nnot permitted as <a href=\"/doc/373409/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 198(1)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/373409/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 198(2)</a> does not\n\npermit her to do so. In the ultimate analysis, the law has meted\n\nout even-handed justice to both of them in the matter of\n\nprosecuting each other or securing the incarceration of each\n\nother.   Thus,   no   discrimination    has    been   practised   in\n\ncircumscribing the scope of <a href=\"/doc/289904/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 198(2)</a> CrPC and fashioning\n\nit in such a manner that the right to prosecute the adulterer is\n\nrestricted to the husband of the adulteress but has not been\n\nextended to the wife of the adulterer. Expressing this view, the\n\nCourt held that the provision is not vulnerable to the charge of\n\nhostile discrimination.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                        21</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">17.

The provision is currently under\n                   criticism from certain quarters for showing\n                   a strong gender bias for it makes the\n                   position of a married woman almost as a\n                   property of her husband. But in terms of the\n                   law as it stands, it is evident from a plain\n                   reading of the section that only a man can\n                   be proceeded against and punished for the\n                   offence of adultery. Indeed, the section\n                   provides expressly that the wife cannot be\n                   punished even as an abettor. Thus, the\n                   mere fact that the appellant is a woman\n                   makes her completely immune to the charge\n                   of adultery and she cannot be proceeded\n                   against for that offence.‖\n\n           Be it noted, the issue of constitutional validity did not arise\n\nin the said case.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">18.

Hard as we tried, it is difficult to\ndiscover any ratio in this judgment, as one\npart of the judgment contradicts another\npart. If one particular statutory enactment\nis already under challenge, there is no\nreason why other similar enactments which\nwere also challenged should not have been\ndisposed of by this Court. Quite apart from\nthe above, it is a little difficult to appreciate\nsuch declination in the light of Prem Chand\nGarg (supra).

We may now proceed to test the provision on the touchstone\n\nof the aforesaid principles. On a reading of the provision, it is\n\ndemonstrable that women are treated as subordinate to men\n\ninasmuch as it lays down that when there is connivance or\n\nconsent of the man, there is no offence. This treats the woman\n\nas a chattel.   It treats her as the property of man and totally\n\nsubservient to the will of the master.    It is a reflection of the\n\nsocial dominance that was prevalent when the penal provision\n\nwas drafted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">23.   As we notice, the provision treats a married woman as a\n\nproperty of the husband. It is interesting to note that <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 497</a>\n\nIPC does not bring within its purview an extra marital\n\nrelationship with an unmarried woman or a widow.               The\n\ndictionary meaning of ―adultery‖ is that a married person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                27</span>\n\n\ncommits adultery if he has sex with a woman with whom he has\n\nnot entered into wedlock.      As per Black‘s Law Dictionary,\n\n‗adultery‘ is the voluntary sexual intercourse of a married person\n\nwith a person other than the offender‘s husband or wife.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">However, the provision has made it a restricted one as a\n\nconsequence of which a man, in certain situations, becomes\n\ncriminally liable for having committed adultery while, in other\n\nsituations, he cannot be branded as a person who has committed\n\nadultery so as to invite the culpability of <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 497</a> IPC.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/854390/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 198</a> CrPC deals with a ―person aggrieved‖. Sub-section\n\n(2) of <a href=\"/doc/373409/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 198</a> treats the husband of the woman as deemed to\n\nbe aggrieved by an offence committed under <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 497</a> IPC and\n\nin the absence of husband, some person who had care of the\n\nwoman on his behalf at the time when such offence was\n\ncommitted with the leave of the court. It does not consider the\n\nwife of the adulterer as an aggrieved person. The offence and the\n\ndeeming definition of an aggrieved person, as we find, is\n\nabsolutely and manifestly arbitrary as it does not even appear to\n\nbe rational and it can be stated with emphasis that it confers a\n\nlicence on the husband to deal with the wife as he likes which is\n\nextremely excessive and disproportionate. We are constrained to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">\f                                    28</span>\n\n\nthink so, as it does not treat a woman as an abettor but protects\n\na woman and simultaneously, it does not enable the wife to file\n\nany criminal prosecution against the husband. Indubitably, she\n\ncan take civil action but the husband is also entitled to take civil\n\naction. However, that does not save the provision as being\n\nmanifestly arbitrary. That is one aspect of the matter. If the\n\nentire provision is scanned being Argus-eyed, we notice that on\n\nthe one hand, it protects a woman and on the other, it does not\n\nprotect the other woman. The rationale of the provision suffers\n\nfrom the absence of logicality of approach and, therefore, we have\n\nno hesitation in saying that it suffers from the vice of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 14</a>\n\nof the Constitution being manifestly arbitrary.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">24.

Dignity as a\n               constitutional value finds expression in the\n               Preamble. The constitutional vision seeks the\n               realisation of justice (social, economic and\n               political); liberty (of thought, expression, belief,\n               faith and worship); equality (as a guarantee\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">32</span>\n     (2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">\f                          40</span>\n\n\nagainst arbitrary treatment of individuals) and\nfraternity (which assures a life of dignity to every\nindividual). These constitutional precepts exist in\nunity to facilitate a humane and compassionate\nsociety. The individual is the focal point of the\nConstitution because it is in the realisation of\nindividual rights that the collective well-being of\nthe community is determined. Human dignity is\nan integral part of the Constitution. Reflections\nof dignity are found in the guarantee against\narbitrariness (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 14</a>), the lamps of freedom\n(<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 19</a>) and in the right to life and personal\nliberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 21</a>).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      xxx                 xxxx             xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">119. To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen\nof the Constitution defined their vision of the\nsociety in which constitutional values would be\nattained by emphasising, among other freedoms,\nliberty and dignity. So fundamental is dignity\nthat it permeates the core of the rights\nguaranteed to the individual by Part III. Dignity\nis the core which unites the fundamental rights\nbecause the fundamental rights seek to achieve\nfor each individual the dignity of existence...‖\n\n      xxx                 xxx              xxx\n\n―298. Privacy of the individual is an essential\naspect of dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic\nand instrumental value. As an intrinsic value,\nhuman dignity is an entitlement or a\nconstitutionally protected interest in itself. In its\ninstrumental facet, dignity and freedom are\ninseparably inter-twined, each being a facilitative\ntool to achieve the other. The ability of the\nindividual to protect a zone of privacy enables\nthe realization of the full value of life and liberty.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy\nis a subset. All liberties may not be exercised in\nprivacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">\f                         41</span>\n\n\nprivate space. Privacy enables the individual to\nretain the autonomy of the body and mind. The\nautonomy of the individual is the ability to make\ndecisions on vital matters of concern to life.\nPrivacy has not been couched as an independent\nfundamental right. But that does not detract\nfrom the constitutional protection afforded to it,\nonce the true nature of privacy and its\nrelationship with those fundamental rights\nwhich are expressly protected is understood.\nPrivacy lies across the spectrum of protected\nfreedoms. The guarantee of equality is a\nguarantee against arbitrary state action. It\nprevents the state from discriminating between\nindividuals. The destruction by the state of a\nsanctified personal space whether of the body or\nof the mind is violative of the guarantee against\narbitrary state action. Privacy of the body entitles\nan individual to the integrity of the physical\naspects of personhood. The intersection between\none&#x27;s mental integrity and privacy entitles the\nindividual to freedom of thought, the freedom to\nbelieve in what is right, and the freedom of self-</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\ndetermination.‖\n\n      xxx                xxx              xxx\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">―525. But most important of all is the cardinal\nvalue of fraternity which assures the dignity of\nthe individual.359 The dignity of the individual\nencompasses the right of the individual to\ndevelop to the full extent of his potential. And\nthis development can only be if an individual has\nautonomy over fundamental personal choices\nand control over dissemination of personal\ninformation which may be infringed through an\nunauthorized use of such information. It is clear\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 21</a>, more than any of the other\nArticles in the fundamental rights chapter,\nreflects each of these constitutional values in\nfull, and is to be read in consonance with these\nvalues and with the international covenants that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">\f                                        42</span>\n\n\n               we have referred to.

From the aforesaid analysis, it is discernible that the Court,\n\nwith the passage of time, has recognized the conceptual equality\n\nof woman and the essential dignity which a woman is entitled to\n\nhave. There can be no curtailment of the same. But, <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_127\">Section\n\n497</a> IPC effectively does the same          by creating invidious\n\ndistinctions based on gender stereotypes which creates a dent in\n\nthe individual dignity of women. Besides, the emphasis on the\n\nelement of connivance or consent of the husband tantamounts to\n\nsubordination of women. Therefore, we have no hesitation in\n\nholding that the same offends <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">42.   Another aspect needs to be addressed.       The question we\n\nintend to pose is whether adultery should be treated as a\n\ncriminal offence.    Even assuming that the new definition of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">\f                                  46</span>\n\n\nadultery encapsules within its scope sexual intercourse with an\n\nunmarried woman or a widow, adultery is basically associated\n\nwith the institution of marriage. There is no denial of the fact\n\nthat marriage is treated as a social institution and regard being\n\nhad to various aspects that social history has witnessed in this\n\ncountry, the Parliament has always made efforts to maintain the\n\nrights of women.    For instance, <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 498-A</a> IPC deals with\n\nhusband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\n\ncruelty.   The Parliament has also brought in the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_130\">Protection of\n\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</a>.                   This enactment\n\nprotects women. It also enters into the matrimonial sphere. The\n\noffences under the provisions of the said enactment are different\n\nfrom the provision that has been conceived of under <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 497</a>\n\nIPC or, for that matter, concerning bringing of adultery within the\n\nnet of a criminal offence. There can be no shadow of doubt that\n\nadultery can be a ground for any kind of civil wrong including\n\ndissolution of marriage. But the pivotal question is whether it\n\nshould be treated as a criminal offence. When we say so, it is not\n\nto be understood that there can be any kind of social licence that\n\ndestroys the matrimonial home. It is an ideal condition when the\n\nwife   and   husband   maintain        their   loyalty.     We   are   not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">\f                                   47</span>\n\n\ncommenting on any kind of ideal situation but, in fact, focusing\n\non whether the act of adultery should be treated as a criminal\n\noffence.     In this context, we are reminded of what Edmund\n\nBurke, a famous thinker, had said, ―a good legislation should be\n\nfit and equitable so that it can have a right to command\n\nobedience‖.      Burke would like to put it in two compartments,\n\nnamely, ‗equity‘ and ‗utility‘. If the principle of Burke is properly\n\nunderstood, it conveys that laws and legislations are necessary to\n\nserve and promote a good life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">43.

Definition of crime.—There is no\n             satisfactory definition of crime which will\n             embrace the many acts and omissions\n             which are criminal, and which will at the\n             same time exclude all those acts and\n             omissions which are not.

We have referred to the aforesaid theories and authorities to\n\nunderstand whether adultery that enters into the matrimonial\n\nrealm should be treated as a criminal offence.      There can be\n\nmany a situation and we do not intend to get into the same.\n\nSuffice it to say, it is different from an offence committed under\n\nSection 498-A or any violation of the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_134\">Protection of Women from\n\nDomestic Violence Act, 2005</a> or, for that matter, the protection\n\nconceived of under <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">\f                                 52</span>\n\n\nor Sections 306 or 304B or 494 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_136\">IPC</a>. These offences are meant to\n\nsub-serve various other purposes relating to a matrimonial\n\nrelationship and extinction of life of a married woman during\n\nsubsistence of marriage.    Treating adultery an offence, we are\n\ndisposed to think, would tantamount to the State entering into a\n\nreal private realm. Under the existing provision, the husband is\n\ntreated as an aggrieved person and the wife is ignored as a\n\nvictim. Presently, the provision is reflective of a tripartite\n\nlabyrinth. A situation may be conceived of where equality of\n\nstatus and the right to file a case may be conferred on the wife.\n\nIn either situation, the whole scenario is extremely private.     It\n\nstands in contradistinction to the demand for dowry, domestic\n\nviolence, sending someone to jail for non-grant of maintenance or\n\nfiling a complaint for second marriage.     Adultery stands on a\n\ndifferent footing from the aforesaid offences. We are absolutely\n\nconscious that the Parliament has the law making power. We\n\nmake it very clear that we are not making law or legislating but\n\nonly stating that a particular act, i.e., adultery does not fit into\n\nthe concept of a crime. We may repeat at the cost of repetition\n\nthat if it is treated as a crime, there would be immense intrusion\n\ninto the extreme privacy of the matrimonial sphere. It is better to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">\f                                      53</span>\n\n\nbe left as a ground for divorce. For any other purpose as the\n\nParliament has perceived or may, at any time, perceive, to treat it\n\nas a criminal offence will offend the two facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, namely, dignity of husband and wife, as the case\n\nmay be, and the privacy attached to a relationship between the\n\ntwo. Let it be clearly stated, by no stretch of imagination, one\n\ncan say, that Section 498-A or any other provision, as mentioned\n\nhereinbefore, also enters into the private realm of matrimonial\n\nrelationship. In case of the said offences, there is no third party\n\ninvolved. It is the husband and his relatives. There has been\n\ncorrect imposition by law not to demand dowry or to treat women\n\nwith cruelty so as to compel her to commit suicide.              The said\n\nactivities deserve to be punished and the law has rightly provided\n\nso.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">50.

The purpose of referring to the aforesaid authorities is to\n\nhighlight how adultery has not been granted separate exclusive\n\nspace in the context of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_144\">Sections 306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_145\">498-A</a> IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">53.   In case of adultery, the law expects the parties to remain\n\nloyal and maintain fidelity throughout and also makes the\n\nadulterer the culprit.   This expectation by law is a command\n\nwhich gets into the core of privacy. That apart, it is a\n\ndiscriminatory command and also a socio-moral one. Two\n\nindividuals may part on the said ground but to attach criminality\n\nto the same is inapposite.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">54.   We may also usefully note here that adultery as a crime is\n\nno more prevalent in People‘s Republic of China, Japan,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                                 56</span>\n\n\nAustralia, Brazil and many western European countries.             The\n\ndiversity of culture in those countries can be judicially taken note\n\nof.   Non-criminalisation of adultery, apart from what we have\n\nstated hereinabove, can be proved from certain other facets.\n\nWhen the parties to a marriage lose their moral commitment of\n\nthe relationship, it creates a dent in the marriage and it will\n\ndepend upon the parties how they deal with the situation. Some\n\nmay exonerate and live together and some may seek divorce. It is\n\nabsolutely a matter of privacy at its pinnacle.        The theories of\n\npunishment, whether deterrent or reformative, would not save\n\nthe   situation.    A   punishment     is   unlikely     to   establish\n\ncommitment, if punishment is meted out to either of them or a\n\nthird party. Adultery, in certain situations, may not be the cause\n\nof an unhappy marriage. It can be the result. It is difficult to\n\nconceive of such situations in absolute terms.         The issue that\n\nrequires to be determined is whether the said ‗act‘ should be\n\nmade a criminal offence especially when on certain occasions, it\n\ncan be the cause and in certain situations, it can be the result. If\n\nthe act is treated as an offence and punishment is provided, it\n\nwould tantamount to punishing people who are unhappy in\n\nmarital relationships and any law that would make adultery a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">\f                                57</span>\n\n\ncrime would have to punish indiscriminately both the persons\n\nwhose marriages have been broken down as well as those\n\npersons whose marriages are not. A law punishing adultery as a\n\ncrime cannot make distinction between these two types of\n\nmarriages. It is bound to become a law which would fall within\n\nthe sphere of manifest arbitrariness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">55.   In this regard, another aspect deserves to be noted.     The\n\njurisprudence in England, which to a large extent, is adopted by\n\nthis country has never regarded adultery as a crime except for a\n\nperiod of ten years in the reign of Puritanical Oliver Cromwell. As\n\nwe see the international perspective, most of the countries have\n\nabolished adultery as a crime. We have already ascribed when\n\nsuch an act is treated as a crime and how it faces the frown of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_146\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_147\">21</a> of the Constitution. Thinking of adultery from\n\nthe point of view of criminality would be a retrograde step. This\n\nCourt    has   travelled   on    the    path   of   transformative\n\nconstitutionalism and, therefore, it is absolutely inappropriate to\n\nsit in a time machine to a different era where the machine moves\n\non the path of regression. Hence, to treat adultery as a crime\n\nwould be unwarranted in law.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">\f                                    58</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">56.

In one of the oldest, namely, in Hammurabi‘s Code,\n\ndeath by drowning was prescribed for the sin of adultery, be it\n\neither by the husband or the wife. In Roman law, it was not a\n\ncrime against the wife for a husband to have sex with a slave or\n\nan unmarried woman. The Roman lex Iulia de adulteriis\n\ncoercendis of 17 B.C., properly so named after Emperor\n\nAugustus‘ daughter, Julia, punished Julia for adultery with\n\nbanishment. Consequently, in the case of adulterers generally,\n\nboth guilty parties were sent to be punished on different islands,\n\nand part of their property was confiscated.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                                                       3</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">\f        2.

In Christianity, we find adultery being condemned as\n\n        immoral and a sin for both men and women, as is evidenced by\n\n        St. Paul‘s letter to the Corinthians.3 Jesus himself stated that a\n\n        man incurs sin the moment he looks at a woman with lustful\n\n        intent.4 However, when it came to punishing a woman for\n\n        adultery, by stoning to death in accordance with the ancient\n\n        Jewish law, Jesus uttered the famous words, ―let him who has\n\n        not sinned, cast the first stone.‖5\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">1</span>\n  Exodus 20:14 (King James Version).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_83\">  Leviticus 20:10 (King James Version).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">3</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">\n  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (King James Version).\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">4</span>\n  Matthew 5:27-28 (King James Version).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">5</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">\n  John, 8:7 (English Standard Version).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                                                             4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_86\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">\f       4.

The Dharmasutras speak\n\n       with different voices. In the Apastamba Dharmasutra, adultery\n\n       is punishable as a crime, the punishment depending upon the\n\n       class or caste of the man and the woman.8 However, in the\n\n       Gautama Dharmasutra, if a man commits adultery, he should\n\n       observe a life of chastity for two years; and if he does so with\n\n       the wife of a vedic scholar, for three years.9\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">       5.

In sixth-century Anglo-Saxon England, the law created\n\n           ―elaborate tables of composition‖ which the offended husband\n\n           could accept in lieu of blood vengeance.

However, as\n\nChristianity spread in England, adultery became morally wrong\n\nand therefore, a sin, as well as a wrong against the husband.\n\nPost 1066, the Normans who took over, viewed adultery not as\n\na crime against the State, but rather as an ecclesiastical\n\noffence dealt with by the Church. The common law of England\n\nprescribed an action in tort for loss of consortium based on the\n\nproperty interest a husband had in his wife. Thus, the action for\n\nconversation, which is compensation or damages, usually\n\nrepresented a first step in obtaining divorce in medieval\n\nEngland. In fact, adultery was the only ground for divorce in\n\nseventeenth-century England, which had to be granted only by\n\nParliament. Interestingly enough, it was only after King Charles\n\nI was beheaded in 1649, that adultery became a capital offence\n\nin Cromwell‘s Puritanical England in the year 1650, which was\n\nnullified as soon as King Charles II came back in what was\n\nknown as the ‗restoration of the monarchy‘. It will be seen\n\ntherefore, that in England, except for an eleven-year period\n\nwhen England was ruled by the Puritans, adultery was never\n\nconsidered to be a criminal offence.

When we come to India, Lord Macaulay, in his draft Penal\n\n           Code, which was submitted to the Law Commissioners, refused\n\n           to make adultery a penal offence.

The essence of the injury is considered by\nthe sufferer as lying in the ―per quod servitium\namisit.‖ Where the complainant does not ask to\nhave his wife again, he generally demands to be\nreimbursed for the expenses of his marriage.\nThese things being established it seems to us that\nno advantage is to be expected from providing a\npunishment for adultery. The population seems to\nbe divided into two classes- those whom neither the\nexisting punishment nor any punishment which we\nshould feel ourselves justified in proposing will\nsatisfy, and those who consider the injury produced\nby adultery as one for which a pecuniary\ncompensation will sufficiently atone. Those whose\nfeelings of honor are painfully affected by the\ninfidelity of their wives will not apply to the tribunals\nat all. Those whose feelings are less delicate will be\nsatisfied by a payment of money. Under such\ncircumstances we think it best to treat adultery\nmerely as a civil injury.‖\nxxx xxx xxx\n―These arguments have not satisfied us that\nadultery ought to be made punishable by law. We\ncannot admit that a Penal code is by any means to\nbe considered as a body of ethics, that the\nlegislature ought to punish acts merely because\nthose acts are immoral, or that because an act is not\npunished at all it follows that the legislature\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">                                                            12</span>\n\fconsiders that act as innocent. Many things which\nare not punishable are morally worse than many\nthings which are punishable. The man who treats a\ngenerous benefactor with gross in gratitude and\ninsolence, deserves more severe reprehension than\nthe man who aims a blow in a passion, or breaks a\nwindow in a frolic. Yet we have punishments for\nassault and mischief, and none for ingratitude. The\nrich man who refuses a mouthful of rice to save a\nfellow creature from death may be a far worse man\nthan the starving wretch who snatches and devours\nthe rice. Yet we punish the latter for theft, and we do\nnot punish the former for hard-heartedness.‖\nxxx xxx xxx\n―There is yet another consideration which we cannot\nwholly leave out of sight. Though we well know that\nthe dearest interests of the human race are closely\nconnected with the chastity of women, and the\nsacredness of the nuptial contract, we cannot but\nfeel that there are some peculiarities in the state of\nsociety in this country which may well lead a\nhumane man to pause before he determines to\npunish the infidelity of wives. The condition of the\nwomen of this country is unhappily very different\nfrom that of the women of England and France.\nThey are married while still children. They are often\nneglected for other wives while still young. They\nshare the attentions of a husband with several\nrivals. To make laws for punishing the inconstancy\nof the wife while the law admits the privilege of the\nhusband to fill his zenana with women, is a course\nwhich we are most reluctant to adopt. We are not so\nvisionary as to think of attacking by law an evil so\ndeeply rooted in the manners of the people of this\ncountry as polygamy. We leave it to the slow, but we\ntrust the certain operation of education and of time.\nBut while it exists, while it continues to produce its\nnever failing effects on the happiness and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                                          13</span>\n\f             respectability of women, we are not inclined to throw\n             into a scale already too much depressed the\n             additional weight of the penal law. We have given\n             the reasons which lead us to believe that any\n             enactment on this subject would be nugatory. And\n             we are inclined to think that if not nugatory it would\n             be oppressive. It would strengthen hands already\n             too strong. It would weaken a class already too\n             weak. It will be time enough to guard the\n             matrimonial contract by penal sanctions when that\n             contract becomes just, reasonable, and mutually\n             beneficial.‖18\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">      10.    However, when the Court Commissioners reviewed the\n\n      Penal Code, they felt that it was important that adultery be\n\n      made an offence.

We think the reasons for\n             continuing to treat it as a subject for the cognizance\n             of the criminal courts preponderate. We conceive\n             that Colonel Sleeman is probably right in regarding\n             the difficulty of proving the offence according to the\n             requirement of the Mohammedan law of evidence,\n             which demands an amount of positive proof that is\n             scarcely ever to be had in such a case, as having\n             some effect in deterring the Natives from\n             prosecuting adulterers in our courts, although the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">18</span>\n  A PENAL CODE PREPARED BY THE INDIAN LAW COMMISSIONERS, AND PUBLISHED BY COMMAND OF THE\n GOVERNOR GENERAL OF INDIA IN COUNCIL 91-93 (G.H.

The injured party will do it for\nhimself; great crimes, assassinations, poisonings,\nwill be the consequence.

He\nproposes that the punishment of a man ―convicted\nof seducing the wife of another‖ shall be\nimprisonment which may extend to seven years, or\na fine payable to the husband or both imprisonment\nand fine.

We would, however, put the parties\n              accused of adultery on trial together, and empower\n              the Court, in the event of their conviction, to\n              pronounce a decree of divorce against the guilty\n              woman, if the husband sues for it, at the same time\n              that her paramour is sentenced to punishment by\n              imprisonment or fine.

Significantly, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                                                                      25</span>\n\flearned counsel <a href=\"/doc/449750/\" id=\"a_212\">in that case</a> argued that Section 497 is a\n\nflagrant   instance   of   ‗gender   discrimination‘,   ‗legislative\n\ndespotism‘, and ‗male chauvinism‘. This Court repelled these\n\narguments stating that they had a strong emotive appeal but no\n\nvalid legal basis to rest upon. The first argument, namely, an\n\nargument of discrimination was repelled by stating that the\n\nambit of the offence of adultery should make the woman\n\npunishable as well. This was repelled by saying that such\n\narguments go to the policy of the law and not its\n\nconstitutionality. This was on the basis that it is commonly\n\naccepted that it is the man who is the seducer and not the\n\nwoman. Even in 1985, the Court accepted that this archaic\n\nposition may have undergone some change over the years, but\n\nit is for the legislature to consider whether Section 497 be\n\namended appropriately so as to take note of the transformation\n\nthat society has undergone.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">\nThe Court then referred to the 42nd Law Commission Report,\n\n1971, which recommended the retention of Section 497, with\n\nthe modification that, even the wife, who has sexual relations\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                                                       26</span>\n\fwith a person other than her husband, should be made\n\npunishable for adultery. The dissenting note of Mrs. Anna\n\nChandi was also taken note of, where the dissenter stated that\n\nthis is the right time to consider the question whether the\n\noffence of adultery, as envisaged in Section 497, is in tune with\n\nour present-day notions of women‘s status in marriage.\n\n\nThe second ground was repelled stating that a woman is the\n\nvictim of the crime, and as the offence of adultery is considered\n\nas an offence against the sanctity of the matrimonial home, only\n\nthose men who defile that sanctity are brought within the net of\n\nthe law. Therefore, it is of no moment that Section 497 does not\n\nconfer any right on the wife to prosecute the husband who has\n\ncommitted adultery with another woman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">\nThe third ground, namely, that Section 497 is underinclusive\n\ninasmuch as a husband who has sexual relations with an\n\nunmarried woman is not within the net of the law, was repelled\n\nstating that an unfaithful husband may invite a civil action by the\n\nwife for separation, and that the Legislature is entitled to deal\n\nwith the evil where it is felt and seen most.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                                                                      27</span>\n\fA challenge on the ground of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 21</a> was also repelled,\n\nstating that the fact that a provision for hearing the wife is not\n\ncontained   in   Section   497   cannot    render   that   Section\n\nunconstitutional.

Perhaps one reason is that\nadultery       occurs       in     different\ncircumstances. Every so often it\nhappens without any premeditation,\nwhen deterrence hardly plays a role. At\nthe other end of the scale, the adultery is\nsometimes carefully planned and the\nparticipants are confident that it will not\nbe discovered. Moreover, romantic\ninvolvement between one of the spouses\nand a third party can be as devastating\nto the marital relationship as (or even\nmore so than) sexual intercourse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">(c) If deterrence is the main purpose,\none would have thought that this could\nbetter be achieved by retaining the\nimposition of criminal sanctions or by the\ngrant of an interdict in favour of the\ninnocent spouse against both the guilty\nspouse and the third party to prevent\nfuture acts of adultery. But, as we know,\nthe crime of adultery had become\nabrogated through disuse exactly 100\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                                31</span>\n\fyears ago while an interdict against\nadultery has never been granted by our\ncourts (see, for example, Wassenaar v\nJameson, supra at 352H – 353H). Some\nof the reasons given in Wassenaar as to\nwhy an interdict would not be\nappropriate are quite enlightening and\nwould     apply      equally     to    the\nappropriateness of a claim for damages.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">These include, firstly, that an interdict\nagainst the guilty spouse is not possible\nbecause he or she commits no delict.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">Secondly, that as against a third party —\n  ‗it interferes with, and restricts the\n  rights and freedom that the third\n  party ordinarily has of using and\n  disposing of his body as he\n  chooses; . . . it also affects the\n  relationship of the third party with\n  the claimant&#x27;s spouse, who is and\n  cannot be a party to the interdict,\n  and therefore indirectly interferes\n  with, and restricts her rights and\n  freedom of, using and disposing of\n  her body as she chooses‘. [At\n  353E.]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_139\">(d) In addition the deterrence argument\nseems to depart from the assumption\nthat adultery is the cause of the\nbreakdown of a marriage, while it is now\nwidely recognised that causes for the\nbreakdown in marriages are far more\ncomplex.

Coming back to Section 497, it is clear that in order to\n\n           constitute the offence of adultery, the following must be\n\n           established:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">                   (i)       Sexual intercourse between a married woman and a\n\n                             man who is not her husband;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">                   (ii)      The man who has sexual intercourse with the married\n\n                             woman must know or has reason to believe that she\n\n                             is the wife of another man;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">                   (iii)     Such sexual intercourse must take place with her\n\n                             consent, i.e., it must not amount to rape;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">                   (iv)      Sexual intercourse with the married woman must\n\n                             take place without the consent or connivance of her\n\n                             husband.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">           22.           What is apparent on a cursory reading of these\n\n           ingredients is that a married man, who has sexual intercourse\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">24</span>\n     Id., 17-19.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">                                                                                    33</span>\n\fwith an unmarried woman or a widow, does not commit the\n\noffence of adultery. Also, if a man has sexual intercourse with a\n\nmarried woman with the consent or connivance of her husband,\n\nhe does not commit the offence of adultery. The consent of the\n\nwoman committing adultery is material only for showing that the\n\noffence is not another offence, namely, rape.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">23.   The background in which this provision was enacted now\n\nneeds to be stated. In 1860, when the Penal Code was\n\nenacted, the vast majority of the population in this country,\n\nnamely, Hindus, had no law of divorce as marriage was\n\nconsidered to be a sacrament. Equally, a Hindu man could\n\nmarry any number of women until 1955. It is, therefore, not far\n\nto see as to why a married man having sexual intercourse with\n\nan unmarried woman was not the subject matter of the offence.\n\nSince adultery did not exist as a ground in divorce law, there\n\nbeing no divorce law, and since a man could marry any number\n\nof wives among Hindus, it was clear that there was no sense in\n\npunishing a married man in having sex with an unmarried\n\nwoman as he could easily marry her at a subsequent point in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                                                    34</span>\n\ftime. Two of the fundamental props or bases of this archaic law\n\nhave since gone. Post 1955-1956, with the advent of the ―Hindu\n\nCode‖, so to speak, a Hindu man can marry only one wife; and\n\nadultery has been made a ground for divorce in Hindu Law.\n\n\nFurther, the real heart of this archaic law discloses itself when\n\nconsent or connivance of the married woman‘s husband is\n\nobtained – the married or unmarried man who has sexual\n\nintercourse with such a woman, does not then commit the\n\noffence of adultery. This can only be on the paternalistic notion\n\nof a woman being likened to chattel, for if one is to use the\n\nchattel or is licensed to use the chattel by the ―licensor‖,\n\nnamely, the husband, no offence is committed. Consequently,\n\nthe wife who has committed adultery is not the subject matter of\n\nthe offence, and cannot, for the reason that she is regarded\n\nonly as chattel, even be punished as an abettor. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_211\">This is also for\n\nthe chauvinistic reason that the third-party male has ‗seduced‘\n\nher, she being his victim. What is clear, therefore, is that this\n\narchaic law has long outlived its purpose and does not square\n\nwith today‘s constitutional morality, in that the very object with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                                                     35</span>\n\fwhich it was made has since become manifestly arbitrary,\n\nhaving lost its rationale long ago and having become in today‘s\n\nday and age, utterly irrational. On this basis alone, the law\n\ndeserves to be struck down, for with the passage of time,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 14</a> springs into action and interdicts such law as being\n\nmanifestly arbitrary. That legislation can be struck down on the\n\nground of manifest arbitrariness is no longer open to any doubt,\n\nas has been held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_222\">Shayara Bano v. Union of\n\nIndia and Ors.</a>, (2017) 9 SCC 1, as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">      ―101. …… Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be\n      something done by the legislature capriciously,\n      irrationally and/or without adequate determining\n      principle. Also, when something is done which is\n      excessive and disproportionate, such legislation\n      would be manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of\n      the view that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest\n      arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would\n      apply to negate legislation as well under Article 14.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">24.   It is clear, therefore, that the ostensible object of Section\n\n497, as pleaded by the State, being to protect and preserve the\n\nsanctity of marriage, is not in fact the object of Section 497 at\n\nall, as has been seen hereinabove. The sanctity of marriage\n\ncan be utterly destroyed by a married man having sexual\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                                                      36</span>\n\fintercourse with an unmarried woman or a widow, as has been\n\nseen hereinabove. Also, if the husband consents or connives at\n\nsuch sexual intercourse, the offence is not committed, thereby\n\nshowing that it is not sanctity of marriage which is sought to be\n\nprotected and preserved, but a proprietary right of a husband.\n\nSecondly, no deterrent effect has been shown to exist, or ever\n\nto have existed, which may be a legitimate consideration for a\n\nState enacting criminal law. Also, manifest arbitrariness is writ\n\nlarge even in cases where the offender happens to be a\n\nmarried woman whose marriage has broken down, as a result\n\nof which she no longer cohabits with her husband, and may in\n\nfact, have obtained a decree for judicial separation against her\n\nhusband, preparatory to a divorce being granted. If, during this\n\nperiod, she has sex with another man, the other man is\n\nimmediately guilty of the offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">25.

In its instrumental facet,\ndignity and freedom are inseparably intertwined,\neach being a facilitative tool to achieve the other.\nThe ability of the individual to protect a zone of\nprivacy enables the realisation of the full value of life\nand liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which\nprivacy is a subset. All liberties may not be\nexercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only\nwithin a private space. Privacy enables the\nindividual to retain the autonomy of the body and\nmind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to\nmake decisions on vital matters of concern to life.\nPrivacy has not been couched as an independent\nfundamental right. But that does not detract from the\nconstitutional protection afforded to it, once the true\nnature of privacy and its relationship with those\nfundamental rights which are expressly protected is\nunderstood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of\nprotected freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a\nguarantee against arbitrary State action. It prevents\nthe State from discriminating between individuals.\nThe destruction by the State of a sanctified personal\nspace whether of the body or of the mind is violative\nof the guarantee against arbitrary State action.\nPrivacy of the body entitles an individual to the\nintegrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The\nintersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity and\nprivacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought,\nthe freedom to believe in what is right, and the\nfreedom of self-determination. When these\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                                            39</span>\n\fguarantees intersect with gender, they create a\nprivate space which protects all those elements\nwhich are crucial to gender identity. The family,\nmarriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all\nintegral to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the\nprivacy of the individual recognises an inviolable\nright to determine how freedom shall be exercised.\nAn individual may perceive that the best form of\nexpression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a\nrealm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul\nin a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the\noutcome of a process of thought. A musician\ncontemplates upon notes which musically lead to\nsilence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on\nthe ability to choose how to convey thoughts and\nideas or interact with others. These are crucial\naspects of personhood. The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_230\">Article\n19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to\ndecide upon his or her preferences. Read in\nconjunction with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the\nindividual to have a choice of preferences on\nvarious facets of life including what and how one will\neat, the way one will dress, the faith one will\nespouse and a myriad other matters on which\nautonomy and self-determination require a choice to\nbe made within the privacy of the mind. The\nconstitutional right to the freedom of religion under\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_232\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the ability to choose a\nfaith and the freedom to express or not express\nthose choices to the world. These are some\nillustrations of the manner in which privacy facilitates\nfreedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">The Constitution does not contain a separate article\ntelling us that privacy has been declared to be a\nfundamental right. Nor have we tagged the\nprovisions of Part III with an alpha-suffixed right to\nprivacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting.\nDignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside\nwithin the inalienable values of life, liberty and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                                            40</span>\n\ffreedom which the Constitution has recognised.\nPrivacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of\nthe individual. It is a constitutional value which\nstraddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights\nand protects for the individual a zone of choice and\nself-determination.‖\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n―482. Shri Sundaram has argued that rights have to\nbe traced directly to those expressly stated in the\nfundamental rights chapter of the Constitution for\nsuch rights to receive protection, and privacy is not\none of them. It will be noticed that the dignity of the\nindividual is a cardinal value, which is expressed in\nthe Preamble to the Constitution. Such dignity is not\nexpressly stated as a right in the fundamental rights\nchapter, but has been read into the right to life and\npersonal liberty. The right to live with dignity is\nexpressly read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 21</a> by the judgment\nin Jolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin [Jolly\nGeorge Varghese v.

It is too\nlate in the day to canvas that a fundamental right\nmust be traceable to express language in Part III of\nthe Constitution. As will be pointed out later in this\njudgment, a Constitution has to be read in such a\nway that words deliver up principles that are to be\nfollowed and if this is kept in mind, it is clear that the\nconcept of privacy is contained not merely in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">                                                             41</span>\n\fpersonal liberty, but also in the dignity of the\nindividual.‖\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n―525.

[In 1834, Jacques-Charles DuPont de\nl&#x27;Eure associated the three terms liberty, equality\nand fraternity together in the Revue Républicaine,\nwhich he edited, as follows: ―Any man aspires to\nliberty, to equality, but he cannot achieve it without\nthe assistance of other men, without fraternity.‖\nMany of our decisions recognise human dignity as\nbeing an essential part of the fundamental rights\nchapter. For example, see Prem Shankar Shukla v.\nDelhi Admn., (1980) 3 SCC 526 at para 21, <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_235\">Francis\nCoralie Mullin v.

And this development can only be if an\nindividual has autonomy over fundamental personal\nchoices and control over dissemination of personal\ninformation which may be infringed through an\nunauthorised use of such information. It is clear that\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 21</a>, more than any of the other articles in the\nfundamental rights chapter, reflects each of these\nconstitutional values in full, and is to be read in\nconsonance with these values and with the\ninternational covenants that we have referred to.

It envisages the creation of a society where the ideals of equality,\n\ndignity and freedom triumph over entrenched prejudices and injustices. The\n\ncreation of a just, egalitarian society is a process. It often involves the\n\nquestioning and obliteration of parochial social mores which are antithetical to\n\nconstitutional morality. The case at hand enjoins this constitutional court to make\n\nan enquiry into the insidious permeation of patriarchal values into the legal order\n\nand its role in perpetuating gender injustices.\n\n\n\n2       Law and society are intrinsically connected and oppressive social values\n\noften find expression in legal structures. The law influences society as well but\n\nsocietal values are slow to adapt to leads shown by the law. The law on adultery\n\ncannot be construed in isolation. To fully comprehend its nature and impact,\n\nevery legislative provision must be understood as a ‘discourse’ about social\n\nstructuring.1 However, the discourse of law is not homogenous.2 In the context\n\nparticularly of Section 497, it regards individuals as ‘gendered citizens’.3 In doing\n\nso, the law creates and ascribes gender roles based on existing societal\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">1</span>\n  Ratna Kapur and Brenda Cossman, Subversive Sites: Feminist Engagements with Law in India, Sage Publications\n (1996) at page 40\n2 Ibid at page 41\n3 Ibid\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">                                                      2</span>\n\f                                                                                                       PART A\n\n\nstereotypes.        An understanding of law as a ‘discourse’ would lead to the\n\nrecognition of the role of law in creating ‘gendered identities’.4\n\n\n\n3       Over the years, legal reform has had a significant role in altering the\n\nposition of women in societal orderings. This is seen in matters concerning\n\ninheritance and in the protection against domestic violence. However, in some\n\ncases, the law operates to perpetuate an unequal world for women. Thus,\n\ndepending on the manner in which it is used, law can act as an agent of social\n\nchange as well as social stagnation.

It may\n                  be argued that Section 497 should not find a place in any\n                  modern Code of law. Days are past, when women were\n                  looked upon as property by their husbands.”\n\n\n\nA narrow challenge was addressed before this Court. The judgment of Justice\n\nVivian Bose records the nature of the challenge:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">                  “3. Under Section 497 the offence of adultery can only be\n                  committed by a man but in the absence of any provision to\n                  the contrary the woman would be punishable as an abettor.\n                  The last sentence in Section 497 prohibits this. It runs—\n                  “In such case the wife shall not be punishable as an abettor”.\n                  It is said that this offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_265\">Articles 14</a> and 15.”\n\n\n\nHence, the challenge was only to the prohibition on treating the wife as an\n\nabettor. It was this challenge which was dealt with and repelled on the ground\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_266\">Article 14</a> must be read with the other provisions of Part III which prescribe\n\nthe ambit of the fundamental rights. The prohibition on treating the wife as an\n\nabettor was upheld as a special provision which is saved by <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_267\">Article 15(3).</a> The\n\nconclusion was that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">                  “5. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 14</a> is general and must be read with the other\n                  provisions which set out the ambit of fundamental rights.

Sowmithri\n\nVishnu arose in a situation where a petition for divorce by the appellant against\n\nher husband on the ground of desertion was dismissed with the finding that it\n\nwas the appellant who had deserted her husband. The appellant’s husband then\n\nsued for divorce on the ground of desertion and adultery. Faced with this petition,\n\nthe appellant urged that a decree for divorce on the ground of desertion may be\n\npassed on the basis of the findings in the earlier petition. She, however, opposed\n\nthe effort of the husband to urge the ground of adultery. While the trial court\n\naccepted the plea of the husband to assert the ground of adultery, the High Court\n\nheld in revision that a decree of divorce was liable to be passed on the ground of\n\ndesertion, making it unnecessary to inquire into adultery. While the petition for\n13   1985 Supp SCC 137\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">                                           8</span>\n\f                                                                              PART B\n\n\ndivorce was pending against the appellant, her husband filed a complaint under\n\nSection 497 against the person with whom the appellant was alleged to be in an\n\nadulterous relationship. The appellant then challenged the constitutional validity\n\nof Section 497.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">The judgment of the three judge Bench indicates that three grounds of challenge\n\nwere addressed before this Court : first, while Section 497 confers a right on the\n\nhusband to prosecute the adulterer, it does not confer upon the wife to prosecute\n\nthe woman with whom her husband has committed adultery; second, Section\n\n497 does not confer a right on the wife to prosecute her husband who has\n\ncommitted adultery with another woman; and third, Section 497 does not cover\n\ncases where a man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman. The\n\nsubmission before this Court was that the classification under Section 497 was\n\nirrational and ‘arbitrary’. Moreover, it was also urged that while facially, the\n\nprovision appears to be beneficial to a woman, it is in reality based on a notion of\n\npaternalism “which stems from the assumption that women, like chattels, are the\n\nproperty of men.”\n\n\n\n10    The decision in Sowmithri Vishnu dealt with the constitutional challenge\n\nby approaching the discourse on the denial of equality in formal, and rather\n\nnarrow terms. Chandrachud, CJ speaking for the three judge Bench observed\n\nthat by definition, the offence of adultery can be committed by a man and not by\n\na woman. The court construed the plea of the petitioner as amounting to a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                                         9</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART B\n\n\nsuggestion that the definition should be recast in a manner that would make the\n\noffence gender neutral. The court responded by observing that this was a matter\n\nof legislative policy and that the court could invalidate the provision only if a\n\nconstitutional violation is established. The logic of the court, to the effect that\n\nextending the ambit of a statutory definition is a matter which requires legislative\n\nchange is unexceptionable. The power to fashion an amendment to the law lies\n\nwith the legislature. But this only leads to the conclusion that the court cannot\n\nextend the legislative prescription by making the offence gender neutral. It does\n\nnot answer the fundamental issue as to whether punishment for adultery is valid\n\nin constitutional terms. The error in Sowmithri Vishnu lies in holding that there\n\nwas no constitutional infringement. The judgment postulates that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">                    “7…It is commonly accepted that it is the man who is the\n                    seducer and not the woman. This position may have\n                    undergone some change over the years but it is for the\n                    Legislature to consider whether Section 497 should be\n                    amended appropriately so as to take note of the\n                    “transformation” which the society has undergone. The Law\n                    Commission of India in its Forty-second Report, 1971,\n                    recommended the retention of Section 497 in its present form\n                    with the modification that, even the wife, who has sexual\n                    relations with a person other than her husband, should be\n                    made punishable for adultery. The suggested modification\n                    was not accepted by the Legislature. Mrs Anna Chandi, who\n                    was in the minority, voted for the deletion of Section 497 on\n                    the ground that “it is the right time to consider the question\n                    whether the offence of adultery as envisaged in Section 497\n                    is in tune with our present-day notions of woman&#x27;s status in\n                    marriage”. The report of the Law Commission shows that\n                    there can be two opinions on the desirability of retaining a\n                    provision like the one contained in Section 497 on the statute\n                    book. But, we cannot strike down that section on the ground\n                    that it is desirable to delete it.”14\n\n\n\n\n14   Ibid. at page 141\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">                                                     10</span>\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\n\nThese observations indicate that the constitutional challenge was addressed\n\npurely from the perspective of the argument that Section 497 is not gender\n\nneutral, in allowing only the man but not to the woman in a sexual relationship to\n\nbe prosecuted. The court proceeded on the assumption, which it regards as\n\n“commonly accepted that it is the man who is the seducer and not the woman.”\n\nObserving that this position may have undergone some change, over the years,\n\nthe decision holds that these are matters for the legislature to consider and that\n\nthe desirability of deleting Section 497 is not a ground for invalidation.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">11    The decision in Sowmithri Vishnu has left unanswered the fundamental\n\nchallenge which was urged before the Court. Under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 14</a>, the challenge was\n\nthat the statutory provision treats a woman purely as the property of her\n\nhusband. That a woman is regarded no more than as a possession of her\n\nhusband is evidenced in Section 497, in more than one context. The provision\n\nstipulates that a man who has sexual intercourse with the wife of another will not\n\nbe guilty of offence if the husband of the woman were to consent or, (worse still,\n\nto connive. In this, it is evident that the legislature attributes no agency to the\n\nwoman. Whether or not a man with whom she has engaged in sexual intercourse\n\nis guilty of an offence depends exclusively on whether or not her husband is a\n\nconsenting individual. No offence exists if her husband were to consent. Even if\n\nher husband were to connive at the act, no offence would be made out. The\n\nmirror image of this constitutional infirmity is that the wife of the man who has\n\nengaged in the act has no voice or agency under the statute. Again, the law does\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_250\">                                          11</span>\n\f                                                                                        PART B\n\n\nnot make it an offence for a married man to engage in an act of sexual\n\nintercourse with a single woman. His wife is not regarded by the law as a person\n\nwhose agency and dignity is affected. The underlying basis of not penalising a\n\nsexual act by a married man with a single woman is that she (unlike a married\n\nwoman) is not the property of a man (as the law would treat her to be if she is\n\nmarried). Arbitrariness is writ large on the provision. The problem with Section\n\n497 is not just a matter of under inclusion. The court in Sowmithri Vishnu\n\nrecognised that an under-inclusive definition is not necessarily discriminatory and\n\nthat the legislature is entitled to deal with the evil where it is felt and seen the\n\nmost. The narrow and formal sense in which the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_278\">Article 14</a> have\n\nbeen construed is evident again from the following observations:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">                    “8…The contemplation of the law, evidently, is that the wife,\n                    who is involved in an illicit relationship with another man, is a\n                    victim and not the author of the crime. The offence of\n                    adultery, as defined in Section 497, is considered by the\n                    Legislature as an offence against the sanctity of the\n                    matrimonial home, an act which is committed by a man, as it\n                    generally is. Therefore, those men who defile that sanctity are\n                    brought within the net of the law. In a sense, we revert to the\n                    same point: Who can prosecute whom for which offence\n                    depends, firstly, on the definition of the offence and, secondly,\n                    upon the restrictions placed by the law of procedure on the\n                    right to prosecute.”15\n\n\n\nThe decision of the three judge Bench does not address the central challenge to\n\nthe validity of Section 497. Section 497, in its effort to protect the sanctity of\n\nmarriage, has adopted a notion of marriage which does not regard the man and\n\nthe woman as equal partners. It proceeds on the subjection of the woman to the\n\nwill of her husband. In doing so, Section 497 subordinates the woman to a\n\n15   Ibid. at page 142\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">                                                       12</span>\n\f                                                                                         PART B\n\n\nposition of inferiority thereby offending her dignity, which is the core of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">Significantly, even the challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 21</a> was addressed on behalf of the\n\npetitioner <a href=\"/doc/449750/\" id=\"a_281\">in that case</a> in a rather narrow frame. The argument before this Court\n\nwas that at the trial involving an offence alleged to have been committed under\n\nSection 497, the woman with whom the accused is alleged to have had sexual\n\nintercourse would have no right of being heard. It was this aspect alone which\n\nwas addressed in Sowmithri Vishnu when the court held that such a right of\n\nbeing heard can be read in an appropriate case. Ultimately, the court held that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">                    “12…It is better, from the point of view of the interests of the\n                    society, that at least a limited class of adulterous relationships\n                    is punishable by law.

The inarticulate major premise of the judgment is that prosecution for\n\nadultery is an effort to protect the stability of marriages and if the legislature has\n\nsought to prosecute only a limited class of ‘adulterous relationships’, its choice\n\ncould not be questioned. ‘Sowmithri Vishnu’ fails to deal with the substantive\n\naspects of constitutional jurisprudence which have a bearing on the validity of\n\nSection 497: the guarantee of equality as a real protection against arbitrariness,\n\nthe guarantee of life and personal liberty as an essential recognition of dignity,\n\nautonomy and privacy and above all gender equality as a cornerstone of a truly\n\nequal society.

Observing that Section\n\n497 and Section 198(2) constitute a “legislative packet”, the court observed that\n\nthe provision does not allow either the wife to prosecute an erring husband or a\n\nhusband to prosecute the erring wife.

A husband is not\n                   permitted because the wife is not treated as an offender in the\n                   eye of law.

The\n\nhistory of adultery throws light upon disparate attitudes toward male and female\n\ninfidelity, and reveals the double standard in law and morality that has been\n\napplied to men and women.20\n\n\n\n15      Throughout history, adultery has been regarded as an offence; it has been\n\ntreated as a religious transgression, as a crime deserving harsh punishment, as\n\na private wrong, or as a combination of these.21 The earliest recorded injunctions\n\nagainst adultery are found in the ancient code of the Babylonian king\n\nHammurabi, dating from circa 1750 B.C. The code prescribed that a married\n\nwoman caught in adultery be bound to her lover and thrown into water so that\n\nthey drown together.22 By contrast, Assyrian law considered adultery to be a\n\nprivate wrong for which the husband or father of the woman committing adultery\n\ncould seek compensation from her partner.23 English historian Faramerz\n\nDabhoiwala notes that the primary purpose of these laws was to protect the\n\nproperty rights of men:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">20</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">   See David Turner, Adultery in The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Women in World History (2008)\n21 Ibid\n22 James A.

The oldest surviving legal codes (c.2100-1700\n                  BCE), drawn up by the kings of Babylon made adultery\n                  punishable by death and most other near Eastern and\n                  classical culture also treated it as a serious offence…The\n                  main concern of such laws was usually to uphold the honour\n                  and property rights of fathers, husbands and higher status\n                  groups…”24\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">16       In Ancient Greco-Roman societies, there existed a sexual double standard\n\naccording to which adultery constituted a violation of a husband’s exclusive\n\nsexual access to his wife, for which the law allowed for acts of revenge. 25 In 17\n\nB.C., Emperor Augustus passed the Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis, which\n\nstipulated that a father was allowed to kill his daughter and her partner when\n\ncaught committing adultery in his or her husband’s house.26 While in the Judaic\n\nbelief adultery merited death by stoning for both the adulteress and her partner, 27\n\nChristianity viewed adultery more as a moral and spiritual failure than as a public\n\ncrime.28 The penalties of the Lex Julia were made more severe by Christian\n\nemperors. Emperor Constantine, for instance, introduced the death penalty for\n\nadultery, which allowed the husband the right to kill his wife if she committed\n\nadultery.29 Under the Lex Julia, adultery was primarily a female offence, and the\n\nlaw reflected the sentiments of upper-class Roman males.30\n\n\n\n\n24 Faramerz Dabhoiwala, The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution (2012), at page 5\n25 David Turner, Adultery in The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Women in World History (2008), at page 30\n26 Vern Bullough, Medieval Concepts of Adultery, at page 7\n27 The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Women in World History, (Bonnie G Smith ed.), Oxford, at page 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">28</span>\n   Martin Siegel, For Better or for Worse: Adultery, Crime &amp; the Constitution, Vol. 30, Journal of Family Law (1991), at\n   page 46\n29 Vern Bullough, Medieval Concepts of Adultery, at page 7\n30 James A.

In the sixteenth century,\n\nfollowing the Reformation, adultery became a crucial issue because Protestants\n\nplaced new emphasis on marriage as a linchpin of the social and moral order. 33\n\nSeveral prominent sixteenth century reformers, including Martin Luther and John\n\nCalvin, argued that a marriage was irreparably damaged by infidelity, and they\n\nadvocated divorce in such cases.34\n\n\n\n\nConcerned with the “moral corruption” prevalent in England since the\n\nReformation, Puritans in the Massachusetts Bay Colony introduced the death\n\npenalty for committing adultery.35 The strict morality of the early English colonists\n\nis reflected in the famous 1850 novel ‘The Scarlet Letter’ by Nathaniel\n\nHawthorne, in which an unmarried woman who committed adultery and bore a\n\nchild out of wedlock was made to wear the letter A (for adulterer) when she went\n\nout in public; her lover was not so tagged, suggesting that women were punished\n\n\n\n31 Jeremy D.

On an appraisal\n\nof the facts and opinions collected from all three Presidencies about the\n\nfeasibility criminalizing adultery, he concluded in his Notes to the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_290\">IPC</a> that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">                 “…All the existing laws for the punishment of adultery are\n                 altogether inefficacious for the purpose of preventing injured\n                 husbands of the higher classes from taking the law into their\n                 own hands; secondly; that scarcely any native of higher\n                 classes ever has recourse to the courts of law in a case of\n                 adultery for redress against either his wife, or her gallant;\n                 thirdly, that the husbands who have recourse in case of\n                 adultery to the Courts of law are generally poor men whose\n                 wives have run away, that these husbands seldom have any\n                 delicate feelings about the intrigue, but think themselves\n                 injured by the elopement, that they consider wives as useful\n                 members of their small households, that they generally\n                 complain not of the wound given to their affections, not of the\n                 stain on their honor , but of the loss of a menial whom they\n                 cannot easily replace, and that generally their principal object\n                 is that the women may be sent back.” These things being\n                 established, it seems to us that no advantage is to be\n                 expected from providing a punishment for adultery.

In its 42nd Report, the Law Commission of India considered the\n\nlegislative history of Section 497 and the purported benefit of criminal sanctions\n\nfor adultery. The Committee concluded that, “though some of us were personally\n\ninclined to recommend repeal of the section, we think on the whole that the time\n\nhas not yet come for making such a radical change in the existing position.” 55 It\n\nrecommended that Section 497 be retained, but with a modification to make\n\nwomen who commit adultery liable as well.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">23      In its 156th Report, the Law Commission made a proposal which it believed\n\nreflected the “‘transformation’ which the society has undergone,” by suggesting\n\nremoving the exemption from liability for women under Section 497. 56 In 2003,\n\nthe Justice Malimath Committee recommended that Section 497 be made\n\ngender-neutral, by substituting the words of the provision with “whosoever has\n\nsexual intercourse with the spouse of any other person is guilty of adultery.” 57\n\nThe Committee supported earlier proposals to not repeal the offence, but to\n\nequate liability for the sexes:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">                 “The object of the Section is to preserve the sanctity of\n                 marriage.

Though women are\n\nexempted from prosecution under Section 497, the underlying notion upon which\n\nthe provision rests, which conceives of women as property, is extremely harmful.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_173\">The power to prosecute lies only with the husband (and not to the wife in cases\n\nwhere her husband commits adultery), and whether the crime itself has been\n\ncommitted depends on whether the husband provides “consent for the allegedly\n\nadulterous act.”\n\n\n\n\n24         Women, therefore, occupy a liminal space in the law: they cannot be\n\nprosecuted for committing adultery, nor can they be aggrieved by it, by virtue of\n\ntheir status as their husband’s property. Section 497 is also premised upon\n\nsexual stereotypes that view women as being passive and devoid of sexual\n\nagency. The notion that women are ‘victims’ of adultery and therefore require the\n\nbeneficial exemption under Section 497 has been deeply criticized by feminist\n\nscholars, who argue that such an understanding of the position of women is\n\ndemeaning and fails to recognize them as equally autonomous individuals in\n\nsociety.59 Effectively, Indian jurisprudence has interpreted the constitutional\n\nguarantee of sex equality as a justification for differential treatment: to treat men\n\n\n\n58   Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1343950\" id=\"span_274\">59   Abhinav Sekhri, The Good, The Bad, And The Adulterous: Criminal Law And Adultery In India, Socio-Legal Review\n     (2016), at page 63\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">                                                         25</span>\n\f                                                                                                            PART C\n\n\nand women differently is, ultimately, to act in women’s interests. 60 The status of\n\nSection 497 as a “special provision”61 operating for the benefit of women,\n\ntherefore, constitutes a paradigmatic example of benevolent patriarchy.\n\n\n\n\n25       Throughout history, the law has failed to ask the woman question. 62 It has\n\nfailed to interrogate the generalizations or stereotypes about the nature,\n\ncharacter and abilities of the sexes on which laws rest, and how these notions\n\naffect women and their interaction with the law. A woman&#x27;s ‘purity’ and a man’s\n\nmarital ‘entitlement’ to her exclusive sexual possession may be reflective of the\n\nantiquated social and sexual mores of the nineteenth century, but they cannot be\n\nrecognized as being so today. It is not the “common morality” of the State at any\n\ntime in history, but rather constitutional morality, which must guide the law. In any\n\ndemocracy, constitutional morality requires the assurance of certain rights that\n\nare indispensable for the free, equal, and dignified existence of all members of\n\nsociety. A commitment to constitutional morality requires us to enforce the\n\nconstitutional guarantees of equality before law, non-discrimination on account of\n\nsex, and dignity, all of which are affected by the operation of Section 497.\n\n\n\n\n60 Brenda Cossman and Ratna Kapur, Subversive Sites: Feminist Engagements with Law in <a href=\"/doc/1343950/\" id=\"a_297\">India (1996)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_276\">61</span>\n   Yusuf Abdul Aziz v.

However, progressive action has primarily been\n\ntaken on the ground that provisions penalising adultery are discriminatory against\n\nwomen either patently on the face of the law or in their implementation. Reform\n\ntowards achieving a more egalitarian society in practice has also been driven by\n\nactive measures taken by the United Nations and other international human\n\nrights organizations, where it has been emphasized that even seemingly gender-\n\nneutral provisions criminalising adultery cast an unequal burden on women:63\n\n                  “Given continued discrimination and inequalities faced by\n                  women, including inferior roles attributed to them by\n                  patriarchal and traditional attitudes, and power imbalances in\n                  their relations with men, the mere fact of maintaining adultery\n                  as a criminal offence, even when it applies to both women\n                  and men, means in practice that women mainly will continue\n                  to face extreme vulnerabilities, and violation of their human\n                  rights to dignity, privacy and equality.”\n\n\n\nThe abolishing of adultery has been brought about in equal measure by\n\nlegislatures and courts. When decisions have been handed down by the judiciary\n\nacross the world, it has led to the creation of a rich body of transnational\n\njurisprudence.

In\n                  addition, the provision at Issue also restricts the right to\n                  privacy protected under <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_300\">Article 17</a> of the Constitution in that it\n                  restricts activities arising out of sexual life belonging to the\n                  intimate private domain.”\n\n\n\nThe Court used the test of least restrictiveness, and began by acknowledging\n\nthat there no longer existed public consensus on the criminalization of adultery,\n\nwith the societal structure having changed from holding traditional family values\n\nand a typeset role of family members to sexual views driven by liberal thought\n\nand individualism. While recognizing that marital infidelity is immoral and\n\nunethical, the Court stated that love and sexual life were intimate concerns, and\n\nthey should not be made subject to criminal law. Commenting on the balance\n\nbetween an individual’s sexual autonomy vis-à-vis societal morality, the Court\n\nremarked:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">                  “…the society is changing into one where the private interest\n                  of sexual autonomy is put before the social interest of sexual\n                  morality and families from the perspective of dignity and\n                  happiness of individuals.”68\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">67 <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_301\">Article 10</a> of the South Korean Constitution “All citizens are assured of human worth and dignity and have the right\n to pursue happiness.

Moreover, it held that the State had no business in seeking to control\n\nan individual’s actions which were within the sphere of his or her constitutionally\n\nprotected rights of privacy and self-determination.\n\n\n\nMoving on to the effectiveness of the provision at hand, the Court remarked that\n\ncriminalizing adultery did not help save a failing marriage. The Court remarked\n\nthat it was obvious that once a spouse was accused of adultery, the\n\nconsequence was generally intensified spousal conflict as opposed to the\n\npossibility of family harmony:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">                    “Existing families face breakdown with the invoking of the\n                    right to file an accusation. Even after cancellation of the\n                    accusation, it is difficult to hope for emotional recovery\n                    between spouses. Therefore, the adultery crime can no\n                    longer contribute to protecting the marital system or family\n                    order. Furthermore, there is little possibility that a person who\n                    was punished for adultery would remarry the spouse who had\n                    made an accusation against himself/herself. It is neither\n                    possible to protect harmonious family order because of the\n                    intensified conflict between spouses in the process of criminal\n                    punishment of adultery.”69\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">69   Supra, note 64, Part V- A (3)(3) (‘Effectiveness of Criminal Punishment’, under the head of ‘Appropriateness of\n     Means and Least Restrictiveness’)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">                                                            30</span>\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n\nAddressing the concern that an abolition of a penal consequence would result in\n\n“chaos in sexual morality” or an increase of divorce due to adultery, the Court\n\nconcluded that there was no data at all to support these claims in countries\n\nwhere adultery is repealed, stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_191\">             “Rather, the degree of social condemnation for adultery has\n             been reduced due to the social trend to value the right to\n             sexual self-determination and the changed recognition on\n             sex, despite of the punishment of adultery. Accordingly, it is\n             hard to anticipate a general and special deterrence effect for\n             adultery from the perspective of criminal policy as it loses the\n             function of regulating behaviour.”70\n\n\n\nThe Court also analysed the argument that adultery provisions protected women:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_192\">             “It is true that the existence of adultery crimes in the past\n             Korean society served to protect women. Women were\n             socially and economically underprivileged, and acts of\n             adultery were mainly committed by men. Therefore, the\n             existence of an adultery crime acted as psychological\n             deterrence for men, and, furthermore, enabled female\n             spouses to receive payment of compensation for grief or\n             divided assets from the male spouse on the condition of\n             cancelling the adultery accusation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_193\">             However, the changes of our society diluted the justification of\n             criminal punishment of adultery. Above all, as women’s\n             earning power and economic capabilities have improved with\n             more active social and economic activities, the premise that\n             women are the economically disadvantaged does not apply to\n             all married couples.”\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the Court concluded its analysis by holding that the interests of enforcing\n\nmonogamy, protecting marriage and promoting marital fidelity, balanced against\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">70   Ibid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">                                               31</span>\n\f                                                                                                       PART D\n\n\nthe interference of the State in the rights to privacy and sexual autonomy were\n\nclearly excessive and therefore failed the test of least restrictiveness.71\n\n\n\n\n28      In 2007, the Ugandan Constitutional Court in Law Advocacy for Women\n\nin Uganda v Attorney General of Uganda72, was called upon to rule on the\n\nconstitutionality of Section 154 of the Penal Code, on, the grounds that it violated\n\nvarious protections granted by the Ugandan Constitution and meted out\n\ndiscriminatory treatment between women and men. The law as it stood allowed a\n\nmarried man to have a sexual relationship with an unmarried woman. Moreover,\n\nonly a man could be guilty of the offence of adultery when he had sexual\n\nintercourse with a married woman. The same provision, however, penalized a\n\nmarried woman who engaged in a sexual relationship with an unmarried or\n\nmarried man outside of the marriage.

He presents three ways in which\n\nadultery implicates the right to privacy. The first is that adultery must be viewed\n\nas a constitutionally protected marital choice. Second, that certain adulterous\n\nrelationships are protected by the freedom of association and finally, that adultery\n\nconstitutes an action which is protected by sexual privacy.79 A brief study is also\n\nundertaken on whether action penalizing adultery constitutes a legitimate interest\n\nof the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">\n\n\nThe first privacy interest in adultery is the right to marital choice. The U.S.\n\nSupreme Court has upheld the values of ‘fundamental liberty’, ‘freedom of\n\nchoice’ and ‘the ‘right to privacy’ in marriage. With this jurisprudence, the author\n\nargues, it would be strange if a decision to commit adultery is not a treated as a\n\nmatter of marriage and family life as expressed in Cleveland Board80, ‘an act\n\noccurring in marriage’, as held in Griswold81 or a ‘matter of marriage and family\n\nlife’ as elucidated in Carey.82\n\n\n\n\n78 Martin J.

He observes that the essence of the offence is in fact the\n\nmarried status of one of the actors, and the mere fact that the commission of the\n\nact consisted of a mere sexual act or a series of them is legally irrelevant. If the\n\nargument that adultery, though unconventional, is an act related to marriage and\n\ntherefore fundamentally private is accepted, then it deserves equal protection.\n\nSiegel cites Laurence Tribe, on accepting the ‘unconventional variants’ that also\n\nform a part of privacy:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">                  “Ought the “right to marriage,” as elucidated by Griswold,\n                  Loving v. Virginia, Zablocki, Boddie v. Connecticut and\n                  Moore, also include marriage&#x27;s &quot;unconventional variants&quot;-in\n                  this case the adulterous union?”83\n\n\n\nThe mere fact that adultery is considered unconventional in society does not\n\njustify depriving it of privacy protection. The freedom of making choices also\n\nencompasses the freedom of making an ‘unpopular’ choice. This was articulated\n\nby Justice Blackmun in his dissent in Hardwick84:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">                  “A necessary corollary of giving individuals freedom to choose\n                  how to conduct their lives is acceptance of the fact that\n                  different individuals will make different choices.”85\n\n\n\n\nSiegel concludes that the privacy protections afforded to marriage must extend to\n\nall choices made within the marriage:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">83</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">   Martin J.

The right to freedom of association he states is ‘a close\n\nconstitutional relative of privacy’87, and they often interact in an intertwined\n\nmanner. Siegel proceeds to explain that adultery must not simply be looked at as\n\nan act of consensual adult sexual activity, as sexual activity may simply be one\n\nelement in a continuum of interactions between people:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">                  “Sexual activity may be preliminary or incidental to a\n                  developing association, or it may be its final culmination and\n                  solidification. In either case, it is simply one more element of\n                  the relationship. Two people may have sex upon first\n                  meeting. In this case, associational interests seem less\n                  important, although &quot;loveless encounters are sometimes\n                  prerequisites for genuine love relationships; to forbid the\n                  former is, therefore, to inhibit the latter.&quot;&#x27; 88\n\n\n\nNext, Siegel examines the plausible protection of adultery through the lens of the\n\nfreedom of expression. Since the act of engaging in sexual activity can be\n\ninterpreted as being expressive, Siegel claims adultery might also implicate First\n\nAmendment rights. In support he cites a body of case law89,where courts have\n\nheld that First Amendment rights are not limited to merely verbal expression but\n\nalso encompass the right to ‘expressive association’.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">86 Martin J.

This would\n\nbe manifestly unjust:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">                  “It is difficult, both theoretically and practically, to single out\n                  the sexual contacts two people may have from the rest of\n                  their relationship- to criminalize the one and constitutionally\n                  protect as fundamental the other”. 90\n\n\n\n\nLastly, Siegel discusses the connection between adultery and the right to sexual\n\nprivacy. It is accepted that a right to privacy safeguards an individual’s deeply\n\npersonal choices which includes a recognition accorded to the inherently private\n\nnature of all consensual adult sexual activity.91 This understanding of sexual\n\nprivacy found favour with the U.S. Supreme Court, which in Thornburgh v\n\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists92 quoted Charles\n\nFried with approval:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">                  “The concept of privacy embodies the moral fact that a\n                  person belongs to himself and not to others nor to society as\n                  a whole.”93\n\n\n\nSiegel reiterates the underlying intangible value of adult consensual sexual\n\nactivity:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">90 Martin J.

For some, adultery is a cruel betrayal, while\n                  for others it is just comeuppance for years of spousal neglect.\n                  In some marriages, sex is the epitome of commitment, while\n                  in others spouses jointly and joyfully dispense with sexual\n                  monogamy.”95\n\n\n\n\nIn concluding the author states that the foregoing three-layered analysis left no\n\nroom for doubt that adultery was a matter of marriage. It therefore deserved to be\n\nprotected like all other affairs occurring in marriage and implicated routine\n\nprivacy-based freedoms, and it was imperative to treat is as such.

It is a confidence in nothing less than the theory\n                  underscoring our entire political order: Our system of\n                  government requires that we have faith in the ability of the\n                  individual to decide wisely, if only he is fully appraised of the\n                  merits of the controversy.”96\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging the interest that the State has in preserving the institution\n\nof marriage, Siegel precisely points out the inefficacy of attaching criminal\n\nsanctions to adultery in the following words:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">                  “Even if we accept that a state is trying to foster the interests\n                  of specific deceived spouses by its laws criminalizing\n                  adultery, it is impossible to believe that a criminal penalty\n                  imposed on one of the spouses would somehow benefit a\n                  marriage instead of representing the final nail in its coffin. And\n                  if deterrence of adultery is the goal, then the state&#x27;s failure to\n                  arrest and prosecute offenders has long since removed any\n                  fear of legal sanction.”97\n\n\n\n\nDeborah L Rhode in her book titled “Adultery” argues that “intermittent\n\nidiosyncratic invocations of adultery prohibitions do little to enforce marital vows\n\nor reinforce confidence in the rule of law. There are better ways to signal respect\n\nfor the institution of marriage and better uses of law enforcement than policing\n\nprivate, consensual sexual activity.”98\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_300\">96</span>\n   Eisenstadt v.

No offence exists where a man\n\nwho has a subsisting marital relationship engages in sexual intercourse with a\n\nsingle woman. Though adultery is considered to be an offence relating to\n\nmarriage, the legislature did not penalise sexual intercourse between a married\n\nman and a single woman. Even though the man in such a case has a spouse,\n\nthis is considered to be of no legal relevance to defining the scope of the offence.\n\nThat is because the provision proceeds on the notion that the woman is but a\n\nchattel; the property of her husband. The fact that he is engaging in a sexual\n\nrelationship outside marriage is of no consequence to the law. The woman with\n\nwhom he is in marriage has no voice of her own, no agency to complain. If the\n\nwoman who is involved in the sexual act is not married, the law treats it with\n\nunconcern. The premise of the law is that if a woman is not the property of a\n\nmarried man, her act would not be deemed to be ‘adulterous’, by definition.\n\n\n\n31    The essence of the offence is that a man has engaged in an act of sexual\n\nintercourse with the wife of another man. But if the man to whom she is married\n\nwere to consent or even to connive at the sexual relationship, the offence of\n\nadultery would not be established. For, in the eyes of law, in such a case it is for\n\nthe man in the marital relationship to decide whether to agree to his spouse\n\nengaging in a sexual act with another. Indeed, even if the two men (the spouse\n\nof the woman and the man with whom she engages in a sexual act) were to\n\nconnive, the offence of adultery would not be made out.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">                                         41</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART E\n\n\n32         Section 497 is destructive of and deprives a woman of her agency,\n\nautonomy and dignity.               If the ostensible object of the law is to protect the\n\n‘institution of marriage’, it provides no justification for not recognising the agency\n\nof a woman whose spouse is engaged in a sexual relationship outside of\n\nmarriage.         She can neither complain nor is the fact that she is in a marital\n\nrelationship with a man of any significance to the ingredients of the offence. The\n\nlaw also deprives the married woman who has engaged in a sexual act with\n\nanother man, of her agency. She is treated as the property of her husband. That\n\nis why no offence of adultery would be made out if her husband were to consent\n\nto her sexual relationship outside marriage. Worse still, if the spouse of the\n\nwoman were to connive with the person with whom she has engaged in sexual\n\nintercourse, the law would blink. Section 497 is thus founded on the notion that a\n\nwoman by entering upon marriage loses, so to speak, her voice, autonomy and\n\nagency. Manifest arbitrariness is writ large on the provision.\n\n\n\n33         The test of manifest arbitrariness is rooted in Indian jurisprudence. In E P\n\nRoyappa v State of Tamil Nadu100, Justice Bhagwati characterised equality as a\n\n“dynamic construct” which is contrary to arbitrariness:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_305\">“85…Now, what is the content and reach of this great\n                   equalising principle?

Section 497 suffers from\n\nmanifest arbitrariness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_189\">\n\n\n36    While engrafting the provision into Chapter XX of the Penal Code – “of\n\noffences relating to marriage” – the legislature has based the offence on an\n\nimplicit assumption about marriage. The notion which the law propounds and to\n\nwhich it imposes the sanctions of penal law is that the marital tie subordinates\n\nthe role and position of the woman. In that view of marriage, the woman is bereft\n\nof the ability to decide, to make choices and give free expression to her\n\npersonality.   Human sexuality is an essential aspect of identity.     Choices in\n\nmatters of sexuality are reflective of the human desire for expression. Sexuality\n\ncannot be construed purely as a physiological attribute.      In its associational\n\nattributes, it links up with the human desire to be intimate with a person of one’s\n\nchoice.   Sharing of physical intimacies is a reflection of choice. In allowing\n\nindividuals to make those choices in a consensual sphere, the Constitution\n\nacknowledges that even in the most private of zones, the individual must have\n\nthe ability to make essential decisions. Sexuality cannot be dis-associated from\n\nthe human personality.    For, to be human involves the ability to fulfil sexual\n\ndesires in the pursuit of happiness. Autonomy in matters of sexuality is thus\n\nintrinsic to a dignified human existence. Human dignity both recognises and\n\nprotects the autonomy of the individual in making sexual choices. The sexual\n\nchoices of an individual cannot obviously be imposed on others in society and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">                                        46</span>\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\n\nare premised on a voluntary acceptance by consenting parties. Section 497\n\ndenudes the woman of the ability to make these fundamental choices, in\n\npostulating that it is only the man in a marital relationship who can consent to his\n\nspouse having sexual intercourse with another.         Section 497 disregards the\n\nsexual autonomy which every woman possesses as a necessary condition of her\n\nexistence. Far from being an equal partner in an equal relationship, she is\n\nsubjugated entirely to the will of her spouse. The provision is proffered by the\n\nlegislature as an effort to protect the institution of marriage. But it proceeds on a\n\nnotion of marriage which is one sided and which denies agency to the woman in\n\na marital tie. The ability to make choices within marriage and on every aspect\n\nconcerning it is a facet of human liberty and dignity which the Constitution\n\nprotects. In depriving the woman of that ability and recognising it in the man\n\nalone, Section 497 fails to meet the essence of substantive equality in its\n\napplication to marriage. Equality of rights and entitlements between parties to a\n\nmarriage is crucial to preserve the values of the Constitution.

The decisions in\n\nSowmithri and Revathi espoused a formal notion of equality, which is contrary\n\nto the constitutional vision of a just social order. Justness postulates equality. In\n\nconsonance with constitutional morality, substantive equality is “directed at\n\neliminating        individual,       institutional       and       systemic        discrimination          against\n\ndisadvantaged groups which effectively undermines their full and equal social,\n\neconomic, political and cultural participation in society.”106 To move away from a\n\nformalistic notion of equality which disregards social realities, the Court must take\n\ninto account the impact of the rule or provision in the lives of citizens.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary enquiry to be undertaken by the Court towards the realisation of\n\nsubstantive equality is to determine whether the provision contributes to the\n\nsubordination of a disadvantaged group of individuals.107 The disadvantage must\n\nbe addressed not by treating a woman as ‘weak’ but by construing her\n\nentitlement to an equal citizenship. The former legitimizes patronising attitudes\n\ntowards women. The latter links true equality to the realisation of dignity. The\n\nfocus of such an approach is not simply on equal treatment under the law, but\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_314\">106</span>\n    Kathy Lahey, Feminist Theories of (In)equality, in Equality and Judicial Nuetrality (S.Martin and K.Mahoney (eds.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_315\"> (1987)</span>\n107 Ratna Kapur On Woman, Equality and the Constitution: Through the Looking Glass of Feminism in Gender and\n\n   Politics in India (Nivedita Menon ed.)

However, when viewed in the context of a social structure\n\nwhich considers the husband as the owner of the wife’s sexuality, the law\n\nperpetuates a deeply entrenched patriarchal order.

However, a married man may engage\n\nin sexual relations outside marriage with a single woman without any\n\nrepercussion in criminal law. Though granted immunity from prosecution, a\n\nwoman is forced to consider the prospect of the penal action that will attach upon\n\nthe individual with whom she engages in a sexual act. To ensure the fidelity of\n\nhis spouse, the man is given the power to invoke the criminal sanction of the\n\nState. In effect, her spouse is empowered to curtail her sexual agency. The\n\nconsent of the husband serves as the key to the exercise of the sexual agency of\n\nhis spouse. That the married woman is in a consensual relationship, is of no\n\nconsequence to the possible prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">                                        51</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_193\">\f                                                                              PART F\n\n\nA married man may engage in sexual relations with an unmarried woman who is\n\nnot his wife without the fear of opening his partner to prosecution and without the\n\nconsent of his spouse. No recourse is provided to a woman against her husband\n\nwho engages in sexual relations outside marriage. The effect of Section 497 is to\n\nallow the sexual agency of a married woman to be wholly dependent on the\n\nconsent or connivance of her husband. Though Section 497 does not punish a\n\nwoman engaging in adultery as an abettor, a married man and a married woman\n\nare placed on different pedestals in respect to their actions. The effect of Section\n\n497, despite granting immunity from prosecution to the married woman, is to\n\nattach a notion of wrongdoing to the exercise of her sexual agency. Despite\n\nexempting her from prosecution, the exercise of her sexual agency is contingent\n\non the consent or connivance of the husband. A husband is considered an\n\naggrieved party by the law if his wife engages in sexual intercourse with another\n\nman, but the wife is not, if her husband does the same. Viewed from this angle,\n\nSection 497 discriminates between a married man and a married woman to her\n\ndetriment on the ground of sex. This kind of discrimination is prohibited by the\n\nnon-discrimination guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution. Section 497 also\n\nplaces a woman within marriage and the man with whom she shares a sexual\n\nrelationship outside marriage on a different footing.\n\n\n\n42    Section 497 criminalizes the conduct of the man who has sexual\n\nintercourse with the wife of another without his consent. It exempts women from\n\ncriminal liability. Underlying this exemption is the notion that women, being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">                                         52</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART F\n\n\ndenuded of sexual agency, should be afforded the ‘protection’ of the law. In\n\ncriminalizing the accused who engages in the sexual relationship, the law\n\nperpetuates a gender stereotype that men, possessing sexual agency are the\n\nseducers, and that women, as passive beings devoid of sexual agency, are the\n\nseduced. The notion that a woman is ‘submissive’, or worse still ‘naïve’ has no\n\nlegitimacy in the discourse of a liberal constitution. It is deeply offensive to\n\nequality and destructive of the dignity of the woman. On this stereotype, Section\n\n497 criminalizes only the accused man.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">\n\n43      Pertinent to the present enquiry, is that the provision allows only the\n\nhusband to initiate a prosecution for adultery. The consent or connivance of the\n\nhusband precludes prosecution. If a husband consents, his spouse is effectively\n\ngranted permission to exercise her sexual agency with another individual. This\n\nguarantees a degree of control to the husband over the sexual agency of his\n\nspouse. As a relic of Victorian morality, this control over the sexual agency of the\n\nspouse, views the wife as the property of the husband. Fidelity of the woman,\n\nand the husband’s control over it, is seen as maintaining the ‘property’ interest of\n\na husband in his wife.110 In this view, a woman is confounded with things that can\n\nbe possessed. In construing the spouse as a passive or inanimate object, the law\n\non adultery seeks to punish a person who attempts theft on the property of the\n\nhusband. Coontz and Henderson write that the stabilization of property rights and\n\n\n\n\n110Phyllis Coleman, Who’s Been Sleeping in My Bed?

In condemning the sexual agency\n\nof the woman, only the husband, as the ‘aggrieved’ party is given the right to\n\ninitiate prosecution. The proceedings once initiated, would be geared against the\n\nperson who committed an act of ‘theft’ or ‘trespass’ upon his spouse. Sexual\n\nrelations by a man with another man’s wife is therefore considered as theft of the\n\nhusband’s property. Ensuring a man’s control over the sexuality of his wife was\n\nthe true purpose of Section 497.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_195\">\n\n\nImplicit in seeking to privilege the fidelity of women in a marriage, is the\n\nassumption that a woman contracts away her sexual agency when entering a\n\nmarriage. That a woman, by marriage, consents in advance to sexual relations\n\nwith her husband or to refrain from sexual relations outside marriage without the\n\npermission of her husband is offensive to liberty and dignity. Such a notion has\n\nno place in the constitutional order. Sexual autonomy constitutes an inviolable\n\ncore of the dignity of every individual.

The second part is\n\nall about confining her to a space. The boundaries of that space are defined by\n\nwhat a woman should or should not be. A society which perceives women as\n\npure and an embodiment of virtue has no qualms of subjecting them to virulent\n\nattack: to rape, honour killings, sex-determination and infanticide. As an\n\nembodiment of virtue, society expects the women to be a mute spectator to and\n\neven accepting of egregious discrimination within the home. This is part of the\n\nprocess of raising women to a pedestal conditioned by male notions of what is\n\nright and what is wrong for a woman.

These spaces are immersed in power relations, but with ramifications for\n\nthe public sphere.127\n\n\n\nControl over women’s sexuality is the key patriarchal assumption that underlies\n\nfamily and marriage.128 When it shifts to the ‘public’ as opposed to the ‘private’,\n\nthe misogyny becomes even more pronounced.129 Section 497 embodies this. By\n\nthe operation of the provision, women’s sexuality is sought to be controlled in a\n\nnumber of ways. First, the husband and he alone is enabled to prosecute the\n\nman with whom his wife has sexual relations. Even in cases where the\n\nrelationship is based on the consent of the woman, the law treats it as an\n\noffence, denying a woman who has voluntarily entered into a consensual\n\nrelationship of her sexual agency. Second, such a relationship would be beyond\n\nthe reach of penal law if her husband consents to it.

It becomes imperative for us to\n\nintervene when structures of injustice and persecution deeply entrenched in\n\npatriarchy are destructive of constitutional freedom. But, in adjudicating on the\n\nrights of women, the Court is not taking on a paternalistic role and “granting”\n\nrights. The Court is merely interpreting the text of the Constitution to re-state\n\nwhat is already set in ink- women are equal citizens of this nation, entitled to the\n\nprotections of the Constitution. Any legislation which results in the denial of these\n\nConstitutional guarantees to women, cannot pass the test of constitutionality.\n\n\n\nPatriarchy and paternalism are the underpinnings of Section 497. It needs no\n\niteration that misogyny and patriarchal notions of sexual control find no place in a\n\nconstitutional order which has recognised dignity as intrinsic to a person,\n\nautonomy being an essential component of this right. The operation of Section\n\n497 denotes that ‘adulterous women’ virtually exercise no agency; or at least not\n\nenough agency to make them criminally liable.130                           They are constructed as\n\nvictims. As victims, they are to be protected by being exempt from sanctions of a\n\ncriminal nature.131 Not only is there a denial of sexual agency, women are also\n\nnot seen to be harmed by the offence.132 Thus, the provision is not simply about\n\nprotecting the sanctity of the marital relationship. It is all about protecting a\n\nhusband’s interest in his “exclusive access to his wife’s sexuality”.133\n\n\n130 Ratna Kapur and Brenda Cossman, Subversive Sites: Feminist Engagements with Law in India, Sage Publications\n   (1996) at page 119\n131 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_204\">132 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_205\">133 Ibid. at page 120\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_339\">                                                      63</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART G\n\n\n53    Section 497 chains the woman to antediluvian notions of sexuality.

When the liberty of even a single person\n              of the society is smothered under some vague and archival\n              stipulation that it is against the order of nature or under the\n              perception that the majority population is peeved when such\n              an individual exercises his/her liberty despite the fact that the\n              exercise of such liberty is within the confines of his/her private\n              space, then the signature of life melts and living becomes a\n              bare subsistence and resultantly, the fundamental right of\n              liberty of such an individual is abridged.”\n\n\n\n\nIn Navtej, one of us (Chandrachud J.) held that the recognition of the autonomy\n\nof an individual is an acknowledgement of the State’s respect for the capacity of\n\nthe individual to make individual choices:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">              “The right to privacy enables an individual to exercise his or\n              her autonomy, away from the glare of societal expectations.\n              The realisation of the human personality is dependent on the\n              autonomy of an individual. In a liberal democracy, recognition\n              of the individual as an autonomous person is an\n              acknowledgment of the State’s respect for the capacity of the\n              individual to make independent choices. The right to privacy\n              may be construed to signify that not only are certain acts no\n              longer immoral, but that there also exists an affirmative moral\n              right to do them.”\n\n\n\n\nTo characterise a woman as a passive object, denuded of agency, is a denial of\n\nautonomy. The same judgment in Navtej has recognized sexual choices as an\n\nessential attribute of autonomy, intimately connected to the self-respect of the\n\nindividual:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_340\">                                                 64</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">\f                                                                                         PART G\n\n\n                     “In order to understand how sexual choices are an essential\n                     attribute of autonomy, it is useful to refer to John Rawls’\n                     theory on social contract.

It compounds the encroachment on\n\nher right to life and personal liberty by adopting a notion of marriage which\n\nsubverts true equality. Equality is subverted by lending the sanctions of the penal\n\nlaw to a gender biased approach to the relationship of a man and a woman. The\n\nstatute confounds paternalism as an instrument for protecting marital stability.

Respect for sexual autonomy, it must be emphasized is\n\nfounded on the equality between spouses and partners and the recognition by\n\neach of them of the dignity of the other. Control over sexuality attaches to the\n\nhuman element in each individual. Marriage – whether it be a sacrament or\n\ncontract – does not result in ceding of the autonomy of one spouse to another.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_346\">                                        70</span>\n\f                                                                             PART G\n\n\n60    Recognition of sexual autonomy as inhering in each individual and of the\n\nelements of privacy and dignity have a bearing on the role of the state in\n\nregulating the conditions and consequences of marital relationships. There is a\n\nfundamental reason which militates against criminalization of adultery. Its\n\ngenesis lies in the fact that criminalizing an act is not a valid constitutional\n\nresponse to a sexual relationship outside the fold of marriage. Adultery in the\n\ncourse of a subsisting marital relationship may, and very often does question the\n\ncommitment of the spouse to the relationship. In many cases, a sexual\n\nrelationship of one of the spouses outside of the marriage may lead to the end of\n\nthe marital relationship. But in other cases, such a relationship may not be the\n\ncause but the consequence of a pre-existing disruption of the marital tie. All too\n\noften, spouses who have drifted apart irrevocably may be compelled for reasons\n\npersonal to them to continue with the veneer of a marriage which has ended for\n\nall intents and purposes. The interminably long delay of the law in the resolution\n\nof matrimonial conflicts is an aspect which cannot be ignored. The realities of\n\nhuman existence are too complex to place them in closed categories of right and\n\nwrong and to subject all that is considered wrong with the sanctions of penal law.\n\nJust as all conduct which is not criminal may not necessarily be ethically just, all\n\nconduct which is inappropriate does not justify being elevated to a criminal\n\nwrongdoing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_212\">\n\n\n61    The state undoubtedly has a legitimate interest in regulating many aspects\n\nof marriage. That is the foundation on which the state does regulate rights,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_347\">                                        71</span>\n\f                                                                              PART G\n\n\nentitlements and duties, primarily bearing on its civil nature. Breach by one of the\n\nspouses of a legal norm may constitute a ground for dissolution or annulment.\n\nWhen the state enacts and enforces such legislation, it does so on the postulate\n\nthat marriage as a social institution has a significant bearing on the social fabric.\n\nBut in doing so, the state is equally governed by the norms of a liberal\n\nConstitution which emphasise dignity, equality and liberty as its cardinal values.\n\nThe legitimate aims of the state may, it must be recognized, extend to imposing\n\npenal sanctions for certain acts within the framework of marriage. Physical and\n\nemotional abuse and domestic violence are illustrations of the need for legislative\n\nintervention. The Indian state has legitimately intervened in other situations such\n\nas by enacting anti dowry legislation or by creating offences dealing with the\n\nharassment of women for dowry within a marital relationship. The reason why\n\nthis constitutes a legitimate recourse to the sovereign authority of the state to\n\ncriminalize conduct is because the acts which the state proscribes are\n\ndeleterious to human dignity. In criminalizing certain types of wrongdoing against\n\nwomen, the state intervenes to protect the fundamental rights of every woman to\n\nlive with dignity. Consequently, it is important to underscore that this judgment\n\ndoes not question the authority and even the duty of the state to protect the\n\nfundamental rights of women from being trampled upon in unequal societal\n\nstructures. Adultery as an offence does not fit that paradigm. In criminalizing\n\ncertain acts, Section 497 has proceeded on a hypothesis which is deeply\n\noffensive to the dignity of women. It is grounded in paternalism, solicitous of\n\npatriarchal values and subjugates the woman to a position where the law\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_348\">                                         72</span>\n\f                                                                               PART H\n\n\ndisregards her sexuality. The sexuality of a woman is part of her inviolable core.\n\nNeither the state nor the institution of marriage can disparage it. By reducing the\n\nwoman to the status of a victim and ignoring her needs, the provision penalizing\n\nadultery disregards something which is basic to human identity. Sexuality is a\n\ndefinitive expression of identity. Autonomy over one’s sexuality has been central\n\nto human urges down through the ages. It has a constitutional foundation as\n\nintrinsic to autonomy. It is in this view of the matter that we have concluded that\n\nSection 497 is violative of the fundamental rights to equality and liberty as\n\nindeed, the right to pursue a meaningful life within the fold of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_357\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_358\">21.</a>\n\n\n\n62     The hallmark of a truly transformative Constitution is that it promotes and\n\nengenders societal change. To consider a free citizen as the property of another\n\nis an anathema to the ideal of dignity. Section 497 denies the individual identity\n\nof a married woman, based on age-old societal stereotypes which characterised\n\nwomen as the property of their spouse. It is the duty of this Court to break these\n\nstereotypes and promote a society which regards women as equal citizens in all\n\nspheres of life- irrespective of whether these spheres may be regarded as ‘public’\n\nor ‘private’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">H      Towards transformative justice\n\n\n63     Constitutional values infuse the letter of the law with meaning.

However, the quest for equality continues.\n\nWhile there has been a considerable degree of reform in the formal legal system,\n\nthere is an aspect of women’s lives where their subordination has historically\n\nbeen considered beyond reproach or remedy. That aspect is the family.

The provision seeks to only redress perceived harm\n\ncaused to the husband. This notion is grounded in stereotypes about permissible\n\nactions in a marriage and the passivity of women. Fidelity is only expected of the\n\nfemale spouse. This anachronistic conception of both, a woman who has entered\n\ninto marriage as well as the institution of marriage itself, is antithetical to\n\nconstitutional values of equality, dignity and autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn enforcing the fundamental right to equality, this Court has evolved a test of\n\nmanifest arbitrariness to be employed as a check against state action or\n\nlegislation which has elements of caprice, irrationality or lacks an adequate\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_350\">                                         74</span>\n\f                                                                            PART H\n\n\ndetermining principle.

SECTION 497 – HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\n    5.1. The Indo-Brahmanic traditions prevalent in India\n\n          mandated the chastity of a woman to be regarded\n\n          as her prime virtue, to be closely guarded to\n\n          ensure the purity of the male bloodline. The\n\n          objective was not only to protect the bodily\n\n          integrity of the woman, but to ensure that the\n\n          husband    retains control over her sexuality,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_365\">                          10</span>\n\f                     confirming her „purity‟ in order to ensure the\n\n                     purity of his own bloodline.14\n\n              5.2. The first draft of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_367\">I.P.C</a>. released by the Law\n\n                     Commission of India in 1837 did not include\n\n                     “adultery” as an offence. Lord Macaulay was of\n\n                     the view that adultery or marital infidelity was a\n\n                     private wrong between the parties, and not a\n\n                     criminal offence.15\n\n                         The views of Lord Macaulay were, however,\n\n                     overruled by the other members of the Law\n\n                     Commission, who were of the opinion that the\n\n                     existing remedy for „adultery‟ under Common Law\n\n                     would be insufficient for the „poor natives‟, who\n\n                     would have no recourse against the paramour of\n\n                     their wife.16\n\n              5.3.

As far as I am informed, it\n                           figures in the penal law of all nations\n                           except the English; and some of their\n                           most      celebrated    lawyers     have\n                           considered the omission as a defect.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">20    A Penal Code prepared by The Indian Law Commissioners, (1838), The Second Report on\n     the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_373\">Indian Penal Code</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_373\">                                            18</span>\n\f   Neither the immorality of the act, nor\nits injurious consequences on the\nhappiness of females, and very\nfrequently on the peace of society and\nthe lives of its members, can be denied.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_257\">The reason then why it should go\nunpunished does not seem very clear. It\nis emphatically one of that nature to\nwhich I have just referred, in which the\nresentment of the injured party will\nprompt him to take vengeance into his\nown hands, and commit a greater\noffence, if the laws of his country refuse\nto punish the lesser. It is the nature of\nman, and no legislation can alter it, to\nprotect himself where the laws refuse\ntheir aid; very frequently where they do\nnot; but where they will not give\nprotection against injury, it is in vain\nthat they attempt to punish him who\nsupplies by his own energy their\nremissness. Where the law refuses to\npunish this offence, the injured party\nwill do it for himself, he will break the\npublic peace, and commit the greatest of\nall crimes, and he is rarely or never\npunished.           Assaults,        duels,\nassassinations, poisonings, will be the\nconsequence.        They      cannot    be\nprevented; but, perhaps, by giving the\naid of the law to punish the offence\nwhich they are intended to avenge, they\nwill be less frequent; and it will, by\ntaking away the pretext for the\natrocious acts, in a great measure\ninsure the infliction of the punishment\nthey deserve. It is for these reasons\nthat the offence of adultery forms a\nchapter of this title.‖\n\n   Having given mature consideration to\nthe subject, we have, after some\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_374\">              19</span>\n\f                           hesitation, come to the conclusion that it\n                           is not advisable to exclude this offence\n                           from the Code.

For instance, adultery charges may require\n\n           the adulterous relationship to be “open and notorious,”25\n\n           or be more than a single act of infidelity, or require\n\n           cohabitation between the adulterer and the adulteress.\n\n           Such a definition would require a finding on the degree of\n\n           infidelity.26 In other instances, the spouses may also be\n\n           punishable for adultery. Such a provision raises a doubt\n\n           as to how that may secure the relationship between the\n\n           spouses       and     the     institution      of    marriage.       Another\n\n           variation, in some jurisdictions is that cognizance of the\n\n           offence of adultery is taken only at the instance of the\n\n           State, and its enforcement is generally a rarity.\n\n              7.1.

The issue remains as to whether „adultery‟ must be\n\n  treated as a penal offence subject to criminal sanctions,\n\n  or marital wrong which is a valid ground for divorce.\n\n    16.1. One view is that family being the fundamental\n\n          unit in society, if the same is disrupted, it would\n\n          impact   stability   and   progress.   The   State,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_428\">                          56</span>\n\ftherefore, has a legitimate public interest in\n\npreserving the institution of marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_339\">  Though adultery may be an act committed in\n\nprivate   by   two   consenting     adults,     it     is\n\nnevertheless not a victim-less crime. It violates\n\nthe sanctity of marriage, and the right of a spouse\n\nto marital fidelity of his/her partner. It impacts\n\nsociety as it breaks the fundamental unit of the\n\nfamily, causing injury not only to the spouses of\n\nthe adulteror and the adulteress, it impacts the\n\ngrowth and well-being of the children, the family,\n\nand society in general, and therefore must be\n\nsubject to penal consequences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_340\">  Throughout     history,   the   State   has        long\n\nretained an area of regulation in the institution of\n\nmarriage. The State has regulated various aspects\n\nof the institution of marriage, by determining the\n\nage when an adult can enter into marriage; it\n\ngrants legal recognition to marriage; it creates\n\nrights in respect of inheritance and succession; it\n\nprovides for remedies like judicial separation,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_429\">                57</span>\n\f    alimony,   restitution   of     conjugal    rights;      it\n\n    regulates surrogacy, adoption, child custody,\n\n    guardianship, partition, parental responsibility;\n\n    guardianship and welfare of the child. These are\n\n    all areas of private interest in which the State\n\n    retains a legitimate interest, since these are areas\n\n    which concern society and public well-being as a\n\n    whole.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_341\">       Adultery has the effect of not only jeopardising\n\n    the marriage between the two consenting adults,\n\n    but also affects the growth and moral fibre of\n\n    children. Hence the State has a legitimate public\n\n    interest in making it a criminal offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_342\">16.2. The contra view is that adultery is a marital\n\n    wrong,     which     should      have      only       civil\n\n    consequences. A wrong punishable with criminal\n\n    sanctions, must be a public wrong against society\n\n    as a whole, and not merely an act committed\n\n    against an individual victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_343\">       To criminalize a certain conduct is to declare\n\n    that it is a public wrong which would justify\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_430\">                    58</span>\n\f                        public censure, and warrant the use of criminal\n\n                        sanction against such harm and wrong doing.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_344\">                             The autonomy of an individual to make his or\n\n                        her choices with respect to his/her sexuality in\n\n                        the most intimate spaces of life, should be\n\n                        protected from public censure through criminal\n\n                        sanction.
