The report of the Project Co-ordinator points to the glaring\n\nconflicts of law relating to a sensitive and vulnerable issue\n\ntouching the privacy of the children given in adoption. The various\n\nCourts in Kerala issued orders on the applications preferred by the\n\nprosecution to collect DNA of children born to rape victims.

Orissa State Commission</a> for\n\nWomen [(2010) 8 SCC 633] the Supreme Court enunciated the test\n\nof the &quot;eminent need&quot; while considering a prayer for DNA test of the\n\nchild. It was a case where in a family dispute, the paternity of a\n\nchild was disputed.          The State Commission for Women, Orissa\n\nissued orders directing DNA test of a child. The matter reached\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> Crl.M.C No.5136 of 2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                        6</span>\n\nthe High Court in a writ petition. The High Court also issued an\n\norder directing that the DNA test of the child shall be conducted.\n\nThe Supreme Court considered the question of whether the High\n\nCourt and the State Commission for Women were justified in\n\nordering a DNA test of the child. The Supreme Court, after appreciating\n\nthe rights entitled to the child, especially the right to privacy, held thus:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                &quot;21. In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue\n        before the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely delicate\n        and sensitive aspect. One view is that when modern science\n        gives the means of ascertaining the paternity of a child, there\n        should not be any hesitation to use those means whenever the\n        occasion requires. The other view is that the court must be\n        reluctant in the use of such scientific advances and tools\n        which result in invasion of right to privacy of an individual and\n        may not only be prejudicial to the rights of the parties but may\n        have devastating effect on the child. Sometimes the result of\n        such scientific test may bastardise an innocent child even\n        though his mother and her spouse were living together during\n        the time of conception.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               22.    In our view, when there is apparent conflict\n        between the right to privacy of a person not to submit himself\n        forcibly to medical examination and duty of the court to reach\n        the truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after\n        balancing the interests of the parties and on due consideration\n        whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is eminently\n        needed. DNA test in a matter relating to paternity of a child\n        should not be directed by the court as a matter of course or in\n        a routine manner, whenever such a request is made. The court\n        has to consider diverse aspects including presumption under\n        <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order\n        and the test of &quot;eminent need&quot; whether it is not possible for the\n        court to reach the truth without use of such test.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">       11. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_19\">In <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_19\">K.S.

The Supreme Court laid down the\n\nthreefold test of Reasonableness while elevating the right to\n\nprivacy to the stature of a fundamental right.

Whether a person can be compelled to\n                provide a sample for DNA in such matters can also be\n                answered considering the test of proportionality laid\n                down in the unanimous decision of this Court in K.S.\n                Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5 J.) v.

Another aspect that needs to be considered in\n            the instant case is whether, for a just decision in the\n            divorce proceedings, a DNA test is eminently necessary.\n            This is not a case where a DNA test is the only route to\n            the truth regarding the adultery of the mother. If the\n            paternity of the children is the issue in a proceeding,\n            DNA test may be the only route to establish the truth.\n            However, in our view, it is not so in the present case. The\n            evidence of DNA test to rebut the conclusive\n            presumption available under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n            Act, can be allowed only when there is compelling\n            circumstances linked with &#x27;access&#x27;, which cannot be\n            liberally used as cautioned by this Court in Dipanwita\n            Roy.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">       17. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1150003\" id=\"span_31\">In <a href=\"/doc/1150003/\" id=\"a_26\">Sisu Bhavan v. Joy Yohannan</a> [2008 (4) KLT 550], this\n\nCourt considered the question regarding the necessity of a DNA\n\ntest in a rape trial. The Court held that the cardinal issue to be\n\naddressed in a rape trial is whether there was sexual intercourse\n\nagainst the will and without the consent of a victim. If the sexual\n\nintercourse was with the consent of the victim, the question is\n\nwhether the consent was obtained under circumstances falling\n\nunder clauses thirdly, fourthly and fifthly of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 375</a> IPC. The\n\nCourt observed that merely because there was an allegation by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> Crl.M.C No.5136 of 2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                         11</span>\n\nprosecution that pursuant to the sexual intercourse which the\n\naccused had with the victim a child was born, the question of\n\npaternity of the child which has absolutely no nexus with the\n\nalleged offence of rape, cannot arise. Whether the accused is\n\nproved to be the biological father or not was wholly irrelevant\n\nabout the fact in issue in the trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">       18.

The\n              prosecution will have to prove that the first respondent\n              had sexual intercourse with the lady without her consent\n              or against her will. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether she was\n              impregnated or not.
