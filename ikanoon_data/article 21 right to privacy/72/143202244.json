After hearing arguments from both sides, the Court\n\n  recorded that the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.152 of 2013 had\n\n  challenged his conviction primarily on three grounds, as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       “24.1. The conviction is based solely on the purported\n       confessional statement recorded under Section 67 of the\n       NDPS Act which has no evidentiary value inasmuch as:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (a) The statement was given to and recorded by an officer\n       who is to be treated as “police officer” and is thus, hit by\n       <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       (b) No such confessional statement could be recorded\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act. This provision\n       empowers to call for information and not to record such\n       confessional statements. Thus, the statement recorded\n       under this provision is akin to the statement under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n       161</a> CrPC.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">       (c) In any case, the said statement having been retracted,\n       it could not have been the basis of conviction and could\n       be used only to corroborate other evidence.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1584447\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"805009\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_11\">2. Under the caption “Evidentiary value of statement under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_5\">section 67</a> of\n\n  the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Act, 1985 (“<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_6\">NDPS\n\n  Act</a>”)”, the Court noted the decisions of <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_7\">Raj Kumar Karwal v. Union of\n\n  India</a> (1990) 2 SCC 409 and Kanhaiyalal v. Union of India (2008) 4\n\n  SCC 668, as also certain other judgments, most notably <a href=\"/doc/805009/\" id=\"a_8\">Abdul Rashid\n\n  v. State of Bihar</a> (<a href=\"/doc/1584447/\" id=\"a_9\">2001) 9 SCC 578 and Noor Aga v. State of Punjab</a>\n\n  (2008) 16 SCC 417, and thereafter came to the conclusion that the\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_10\">NDPS Act</a>, being a penal statute, is in contradistinction to the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_11\">Customs\n\n  Act, 1962</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_12\">Central Excise Act, 1944</a>, whose dominant object is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                       2</span>\n\fto protect the revenue of the State, and that therefore, judgments\n\nrendered in the context of those Acts may not be apposite when\n\nconsidering the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_13\">NDPS Act</a> – see paragraph 33.</span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_13\">After then considering a\n\nnumber of other judgments, the referral order states that a re-look into\n\nthe ratio of <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_14\">Raj Kumar Karwal</a> (supra) and Kanhaiyalal (supra) would\n\nbe necessary, and has referred the matter to a larger Bench thus:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     “41. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the\n     matter needs to be referred to a larger Bench for\n     reconsideration of the issue as to whether the officer\n     investigating the matter under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_15\">NDPS Act</a> would qualify\n     as police officer or not.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     42. In this context, the other related issue viz. whether the\n     statement recorded by the investigating officer under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 67</a> of the Act can be treated as confessional\n     statement or not, even if the officer is not treated as police\n     officer also needs to be referred to the larger Bench,\n     inasmuch as it is intermixed with a facet of the 1st issue\n     as to whether such a statement is to be treated as\n     statement under Section 161 of the Code or it partakes\n     the character of statement under Section 164 of the Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     43. As far as this second related issue is concerned we\n     would also like to point out that Mr Jain argued that the\n     provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 67</a> of the Act cannot be interpreted\n     in the manner in which the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/877314/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 108</a> of\n     the Customs Act or <a href=\"/doc/145990369/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 14</a> of the Excise Act had been\n     interpreted by a number of judgments and there is a\n     qualitative difference between the two sets of provisions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1898691\" id=\"span_14\">Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/877314/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act is concerned, it\n     gives power to the custom officer to summon persons “to\n     give evidence” and produce documents. Identical power is\n     conferred upon the Central Excise Officer under <a href=\"/doc/663765/\" id=\"a_21\">Section\n     14</a> of the Act. However, the wording to <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 67</a> of the\n     NDPS Act is altogether different. This difference has been\n     pointed out by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1898691/\" id=\"a_23\">Shahid\n     Khan v. Director of Revenue Intelligence</a> [2001 Cri LJ\n     3183 (AP)].”</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                      3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\f3. Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the\n\n  Appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 152 of 2013; 836 of 2011; 433 of\n\n  2014; 77 of 2015 and 1202 of 2017, outlined six issues before us, which\n\n  really boil down to two issues, namely:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       “1. Whether an officer “empowered under Section 42 of\n       the NDPS Act” and/or “the officer empowered under\n       Section 53 of the NDPS Act” are “Police Officers” and\n       therefore statements recorded by such officers would be\n       hit by Section 25 of the Evidence Act; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       2. What is the extent, nature, purpose and scope of the\n       power conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act\n       available to and exercisable by an officer under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_25\">section 42</a>\n       thereof, and whether power under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 67</a> is a power\n       to record confession capable of being used as substantive\n       evidence to convict an accused?”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">4. Shri Jain took us through the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_27\">NDPS Act</a> which,\n\n  according to him, is a special Act, and a complete code on the subject it\n\n  covers. He referred to how the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_28\">NDPS Act</a> sometimes overrides the\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_29\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 (“<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_30\">CrPC</a>”); sometimes says that it is\n\n  applicable; and sometimes states that it is made applicable with\n\n  necessary modifications. According to Shri Jain, <a href=\"/doc/1223622/\" id=\"a_31\">section 41(2)</a> and\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_32\">section 42</a> of the NDPS Act refer to a ‘First Information Report’ being\n\n  lodged by the officers referred to therein. As the source of information is\n\n  required to be kept a secret under <a href=\"/doc/980287/\" id=\"a_33\">section 68</a> of the NDPS Act, the\n\n  officer receiving information under these provisions is therefore treated\n\n  as an informant. The tasks assigned to officers under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_34\">section 42</a> of the\n\n  NDPS Act are four in number, namely, entry, search, seizure or arrest.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                           4</span>\n\fAs opposed to this, <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_35\">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act invests the designated\n\nofficers with all the powers of an ‘officer-in-charge of a police station’ for\n\nthe process of investigation, which would then begin after information\n\ncollected by a <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_36\">section 42</a> officer is handed over to the officer designated\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_37\">section 53</a>, and end with a final report being submitted under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_38\">section 173</a> of the CrPC to the Special Court under <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_39\">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of\n\nthe NDPS Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_17\">According to the learned Senior Advocate, <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_40\">section 67</a> is\n\nto be read only with <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_41\">section 42</a>, and is a power to call for information so\n\nthat the “reason to believe” mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_42\">section 42</a> can then be made\n\nout, without proceeding further under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_43\">NDPS Act</a>. Thus, “reason to\n\nbelieve”, which is at a higher threshold than “reason to suspect” – which\n\nphrase has been used in <a href=\"/doc/1798309/\" id=\"a_44\">section 49</a> of the NDPS Act – is a condition\n\nprecedent to the officer thereafter moving forward. Shri Jain argued that\n\nthe reason to believe must be formed before the officer acts, and that\n\ntherefore, <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_45\">section 67</a> operates at a stage antecedent to the exercise of\n\nthe powers of the officer designated under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_46\">section 42</a>. He then went on\n\nto argue that these provisions must be construed strictly in favour of the\n\nsubject, inasmuch as they impinge upon the fundamental right to\n\nprivacy, recently recognised by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_47\">K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr.\n\nv. Union of India and Ors.</a> (2017) 10 SCC 1. He also argued that the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_48\">NDPS Act</a> therefore incorporates a legislative balance between powers\n\nof investigation and the obligation to uphold privacy rights of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                            5</span>\n\findividual. He then went on to argue that the “information” under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_49\">section\n\n67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be equated with “evidence”, which is only\n\nevidence before a court, as per the definition of “evidence” under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_50\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> (“<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_51\">Evidence Act</a>”). He cited judgments to\n\nshow that even witness statements made under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_52\">section 164</a> of the\n\nCrPC are not substantive evidence. He then contrasted <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_53\">section 67</a> of\n\nthe NDPS Act with the power of officers under revenue acts to record\n\nevidence, such as <a href=\"/doc/877314/\" id=\"a_54\">section 108</a> of the Customs Act 1962, and <a href=\"/doc/82982698/\" id=\"a_55\">section 14</a>\n\nof the Central Excise Act 1944. He then went on to state that as none of\n\nthe safeguards contained in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_56\">sections 161-164</a> of the CrPC are\n\ncontained in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_57\">NDPS Act</a> when the person is examined under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_58\">section\n\n67</a>, obviously statements made to officers under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_59\">section 67</a> cannot\n\namount to substantive evidence on the basis of which conviction can\n\nthen take place. An important argument was that it would be highly\n\nincongruous if an officer of the police department, empowered under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_60\">section 42</a> and exercising the same powers under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_61\">section 67</a>, records a\n\nconfessional statement which would be hit by <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_62\">section 25</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, whereas officers exercising the same powers under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_63\">NDPS Act</a>, who are not regular policemen, would be able to record\n\nconfessional statements, and bypass all constitutional and statutory\n\nsafeguards. Shri Jain contended that as the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_64\">NDPS Act</a>\n\nare extremely stringent, they must be strictly construed, and safeguards\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                       6</span>\n\fprovided must be scrupulously followed. According to him, arbitrary\n\npower conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_65\">section 67</a> upon an officer above the rank of\n\npeon, sepoy or constable, but denied to a senior officer under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_66\">section\n\n53</a>, would be ex facie contrary to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. On the\n\nother hand, <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_68\">section 53</a> statutorily confers powers on the named officer\n\nof an officer-in-charge of a police station for the investigation of the\n\noffences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_69\">NDPS Act</a>. This, according to the learned counsel,\n\nwould contain the entire gamut of powers contained in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_70\">sections 160-173</a>\n\nof the CrPC, including the power to then file a charge-sheet before the\n\nSpecial Court under <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_71\">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act. The learned\n\ncounsel argued that <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_72\">section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act shows that\n\nconfessional statements that are made under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_73\">section 161</a> of the CrPC,\n\nwhich are otherwise hit by <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_74\">section 162</a> of the CrPC, are made relevant\n\nonly in the two contingencies mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_75\">section 53A</a> of the NDPS\n\nAct, being exceptions to the general rule stated in <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_76\">section 162</a> of the\n\nCrPC. He contended, therefore, that <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_77\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot\n\nbe used to bypass <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_78\">section 53A</a> therein and render it otiose. He stressed\n\nthe fact that all offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_79\">NDPS Act</a> are cognizable offences,\n\nunlike under revenue statutes like the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_80\">Customs Act, 1962</a> and <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_81\">Central\n\nExcise Act, 1944</a>, and then argued that the “complaint” that is referred\n\nto in <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_82\">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act has only reference to a\n\ncomplaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/809276/\" id=\"a_83\">section 59(3)</a> therein. He also pointed out the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                      7</span>\n\fanomalies of granting to the concerned officer under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_84\">section 53</a> all the\n\npowers of the officer-in-charge of a police station, which, unless it ends\n\nup in the form of a final report, would leave things hanging. Thus, if the\n\nconcerned officer finds that there is no sufficient evidence, and that the\n\naccused should be released, <a href=\"/doc/481610/\" id=\"a_85\">section 169</a> of the CrPC would apply. In\n\nthe absence of <a href=\"/doc/481610/\" id=\"a_86\">section 169</a> of the CrPC, as has been contended by the\n\nother side, there is no procedure for discharge of the accused if\n\nevidence against him is found to be wanting. In a without-prejudice\n\nargument that complaints under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_87\">NDPS Act</a> can be made outside of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/809276/\" id=\"a_88\">section 59(3)</a>, Shri Jain stressed the fact that there is in reality and\n\nsubstance no difference between the “complaint” under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_89\">NDPS Act</a>\n\nand the charge-sheet under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_90\">CrPC</a>, as investigation has already\n\nbeen carried out even before the complaint under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_91\">NDPS Act</a> is\n\nmade.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_21\">He therefore argued that both <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_92\">Raj Kumar Karwal</a> (supra) and\n\nKanhaiyalal (supra) require to be overruled by us, as they erroneously\n\napplied earlier judgments which concerned themselves with revenue\n\nstatutes, and not penal statutes like the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_93\">NDPS Act</a>. He then referred us\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution, and <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_95\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act,\n\nand cited a plethora of case law to drive home the point that in this\n\ncountry, as coercive methods are used against persons during the\n\ncourse of investigation, all confessions made to a police officer, whether\n\nmade during the course of investigation or even before, cannot be relied\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                        8</span>\n\f  upon as evidence in a trial. He then referred to several judgments of\n\n  this Court to state that the expression “police officer” is not defined, and\n\n  the functional test therefore must apply, namely, that a person who is\n\n  given the same functions as a police officer under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_96\">CrPC</a>, particularly\n\n  in the course of investigating an offence under the Act, must be\n\n  regarded as a police officer for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_97\">section 25</a> of the\n\n  Evidence Act.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"387476\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"690751\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"32824\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1409644\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1090657\" id=\"span_28\">In the course of his submissions, he referred to a number\n\n  of judgments of this Court, and most particularly, the judgments of <a href=\"/doc/1090657/\" id=\"a_98\">State\n\n  of Punjab v.

Shri Anand Grover, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the\n\n Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 90 of 2017, followed in the wake of the\n\n two Jains, père et fils. The learned Senior Advocate stressed the\n\n various provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_109\">NDPS Act</a> which showed that it was extremely\n\n stringent, in that it had minimum sentences for even possession of what\n\n is regarded as a “commercial quantity” of a drug or psychotropic\n\n substance, being a minimum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of 10\n\n years, going up to 20 years. This, coupled with various presumptions\n\n raised against the accused, and stringent bail conditions, all made the\n\n <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_110\">NDPS Act</a> a very stringent measure of legislation, which, the more\n\n stringent it is, must contain necessary safeguards against arbitrary\n\n search, seizure and arrest, or else it would fall foul of the fundamental\n\n rights chapter of the Constitution. He argued that the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_111\">NDPS Act</a> was\n\n penal in nature, and contained regulatory provisions as well, but given\n\n the fact that we are concerned only with the penal provisions, could be\n\n distinguished from the revenue statutes whose dominant object is the\n\n collection of revenue, and not the punishment of crime. He stressed the\n\n fact that the “enquiry” under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_112\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act is not a judicial\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                        10</span>\n\fenquiry, but only a preliminary fact-finding exercise before a “reason to\n\nbelieve” is formed under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_113\">section 42</a>, which could then lead to\n\ninvestigation of an offence under the Act. He also referred to <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_114\">section 50</a>\n\nof the NDPS Act, and stated that given a higher protection as to\n\nconditions under which a search of person may be conducted, it would\n\nbe inconceivable to then conclude that under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_115\">section 67</a>, confessional\n\nstatements can be recorded without more, subject to no safeguards\n\nwhatsoever, on which convictions can then be based. He relied strongly\n\non <a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_116\">State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh</a> (1999) 6 SCC 172 and its\n\naftermath <a href=\"/doc/1145861/\" id=\"a_117\">Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja v. State of Gujarat</a> (2011) 1\n\nSCC 609 to argue that even after sub-sections (5) and (6) were added\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_118\">section 50</a> of the NDPS Act, they did not dilute what was contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1288137/\" id=\"a_119\">section 50(1)</a>-(4), and could only be used in emergent and urgent\n\nsituations.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_34\">He referred to statutes like the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_120\">Terrorist and Disruptive\n\nActivities (Prevention) Act, 1987</a> (“TADA”), and stated that where under\n\ncertain limited circumstances exceptions were made to <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_121\">section 25</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, they were hedged in with a number of safeguards, as\n\nwere <a href=\"/doc/1145861/\" id=\"a_122\">laid down by</a> this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1813801/\" id=\"a_123\">Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (1994)\n\n3 SCC 569. According to him, therefore, “police officer” needs to be\n\nconstrued functionally to include special police officers under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_124\">NDPS\n\nAct</a>, in the context of confessions made, with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_125\">section 25</a> of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                      11</span>\n\f  the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_126\">Evidence Act</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_36\">He joined Shri Jain in asking for an overruling of <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_127\">Raj\n\n   Kumar Karwal</a> (supra) and Kanhaiyalal (supra).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7. Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the\n\n  Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1826 of 2013, referred to <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_128\">sections 41</a>\n\n  to <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_129\">43</a> of the NDPS Act, and emphasised the fact that no powers to\n\n  “investigate” any offences are vested in the officers mentioned in these\n\n  sections. He then referred to <a href=\"/doc/1013783/\" id=\"a_130\">section 36</a> of the CrPC, and said that the\n\n  scheme followed in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_131\">NDPS Act</a> could be assimilated to <a href=\"/doc/1182815/\" id=\"a_132\">section 36</a>, in\n\n  that, police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police\n\n  station may exercise the same powers, throughout the local area to\n\n  which they are appointed, as may be exercised by such officer within\n\n  the limits of his station. He emphasised the fact that <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_133\">section 25</a> of the\n\n  Evidence Act only applies to confessions made against the maker, as\n\n  against statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_134\">section 161</a> of the CrPC, which are\n\n  completely barred from being received in evidence under <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_135\">section 162</a> of\n\n  the CrPC, save and except for purposes of contradiction. He argued\n\n  that a confessional statement made to a <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_136\">section 41</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_137\">section 42</a> officer\n\n  was also hit by <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_138\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. He added that the\n\n  special procedure in <a href=\"/doc/1712009/\" id=\"a_139\">section 36A</a> of the NDPS Act applies only qua\n\n  offences punishable for a term of more than three years, and where\n\n  offences under the Act are punishable for terms up to three years, they\n\n  are to be tried by a Magistrate under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_140\">CrPC</a>. Obviously, officers\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                         12</span>\n\f under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_141\">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act would investigate an offence under\n\n the Act that is punishable for a term up to three years, and file a police\n\n report, as no complaint procedure, being the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/1712009/\" id=\"a_142\">section\n\n 36A</a> of the NDPS Act, would then apply. According to him, this would\n\n show that investigation does culminate in a police report for offences\n\n punishable for a term up to three years, as a result of which <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_143\">section\n\n 36A(1)(d)</a> has to be read as providing two methods of approaching a\n\n Special Court – one, by way of a police report, and the other, by way of\n\n   a complaint to the Special Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">8. Shri Uday Gupta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the\n\n Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 344 of 2013, supplemented the\n\n arguments of his predecessors, and stressed the fact that the “enquiry”\n\n under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_144\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot possibly be governed by the\n\n definition of “inquiry” under <a href=\"/doc/132965/\" id=\"a_145\">section 2(g)</a> of the CrPC, as that “inquiry”\n\n relates only to inquiries conducted by a Magistrate or Court. Hence, the\n\n expression “enquiry” under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_146\">section 67</a> must be given its ordinary\n\n meaning, which would indicate that it is only a preliminary fact-finding\n\n enquiry that is referred to. He relied strongly on the Directorate of Law\n\n Enforcement Handbook, in which the Directorate made it clear that\n\n when statements are recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_147\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act by the\n\n police, these would amount to statements under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_148\">section 161</a> of the\n\n CrPC. He contended that if this is so, it would be extremely anomalous\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                        13</span>\n\f   to have statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_149\">section 67</a> by officers other than the\n\n   police – mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_150\">sections 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_151\">42</a> of the NDPS Act, which\n\n   are not statements made under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_152\">section 161</a> of the CrPC – being\n\n   admissible in evidence, on which a conviction of an accused can then\n\n    be based.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\"> 9. Shri Gupta was followed by Shri Sanjay Jain, learned Advocate\n\n   appearing on behalf of the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1750 of\n\n   2009, who supplemented the arguments of his predecessors by\n\n   referring to <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_153\">section 53A</a>, and notifications made under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_154\">section 53</a>, of the\n\n   NDPS Act. He reiterated that officers under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_155\">section 42</a> and officers\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_156\">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act perform different functions, and that a\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_157\">section 53</a> officer, being empowered to “investigate”, most certainly has\n\n    the power to file a police report before the Special Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">10. Shri Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on\n\n   behalf of the Union of India, took us through the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_158\">NDPS Act</a>, and said,\n\n   that read as a whole, it is a balanced statute which protected both the\n\n   investigation of crime, as well as the citizen, in that several safeguards\n\n   were contained therein. He was at pains to point out that it was not his\n\n   case that a confession recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_159\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act,\n\n   without more, would be sufficient to convict a person accused of an\n\n   offence under the Act. According to him, this could only be done if\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_160\">section 24</a> of the Evidence Act was met, and the Court was satisfied\n\n   that the confession so recorded was both voluntary and truthful. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"354201\" id=\"span_39\">In any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                          14</span>\n\fcase, he asserted that the safeguards that have been pointed out in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/354201/\" id=\"a_161\">D.K. Basu v. Union of India</a> (1997) 1 SCC 416 at 435, 436, have now\n\nlargely been incorporated in Chapter V of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_162\">CrPC</a>, which safeguards\n\nwould also operate qua confessions recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_163\">section 67</a> of the\n\nNDPS Act. According to him, <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_164\">section 67</a> on its plain language does not\n\nrefer to the “information” spoken of in <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_165\">section 42</a>, as it uses the\n\nexpression “require” any person to produce or deliver a document, as\n\nopposed to information “called for” from such persons. He also argued,\n\nbased on judgments of this Court, that confessions, if properly\n\nrecorded, are the best form of evidence, as these are facts known to the\n\naccused, about which he then voluntarily deposes. He also argued that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_166\">section 190</a> of the CrPC is not completely displaced by <a href=\"/doc/1894406/\" id=\"a_167\">section 36A(1)</a></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_41\">(d) of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_168\">NDPS Act</a>, in that the requirement of the filing of a complaint\n\nand/or a police report contained in section 190 continues to apply, in\n\nsupport of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_169\">Raj Kumar Karwal</a> (supra).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"32824\" id=\"span_42\">He then referred\n\nin detail to <a href=\"/doc/32824/\" id=\"a_170\">Badku Joti Savant</a> (supra), and stated that this judgment\n\nwas not considered in the reference order, and that finally, the only test\n\nthat is <a href=\"/doc/32824/\" id=\"a_171\">laid down by</a> several Constitution Bench judgments to determine\n\nwhether a person is or is not a “police officer” is whether such person is\n\ngiven the right to file a report under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_172\">section 173</a> of the CrPC. He made it\n\nclear that <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_173\">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act did not deem the officers named\n\ntherein to be police officers – they were only given certain powers of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                       15</span>\n\finvestigation, which did not ultimately lead to filing of a charge-sheet\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_174\">section 173</a> of the CrPC. What was clear was that only a\n\n“complaint” could be filed by such officers under <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_175\">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the\n\nNDPS Act – the police report being only filed by the police force as\n\nconstituted under the <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_176\">Police Act, 1861</a>. He disagreed vehemently with\n\nthe submission of Shri Jain that the “complaint” under <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_177\">section 36A(1)(d)</a>\n\nwould refer only to the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/809276/\" id=\"a_178\">section 59(3)</a> of the NDPS Act,\n\nand referred to <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_179\">section 2(xxix)</a> of the NDPS Act to refer to the definition\n\nof “complaint” under <a href=\"/doc/255245/\" id=\"a_180\">section 2(d)</a> of the CrPC, which is used in the\n\nsame sense as in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_181\">CrPC</a>. He then pointed out several provisions in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_182\">NDPS Act</a>, where the word “police” or “police officer” is used in\n\ncontrast to the other persons or officers who are part of the narcotics\n\nand other setups.

In any case, he argued that the officers mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_188\">sections 41</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_189\">42</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be tarnished with the same brush as the\n\nregular police, as there is nothing to show that these officers use third-\n\ndegree measures to extort confessions.

Sharma and Ors. v. Satish\n\n   Chandra</a> 1954 SCR 1077, an eight-Judge Bench of this Court set out\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 20(3)</a>, and then went into the historical origin of this Article in\n\n   English law. In an important passage, the Court held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">         “In view of the above background, there is no inherent\n         reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right as\n         comprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate\n         to confine it to the barely literal meaning of the words\n         used, since it is a recognised doctrine that when\n         appropriate a constitutional provision has to be liberally\n         construed, so as to advance the intendment thereof and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                                          18</span>\n\fto prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms in which\nthis right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be\nsaid to consist of the following components. (1) It is a right\npertaining to a person “accused of an offence”; (2) It is a\nprotection against “compulsion to be a witness”; and (3) It\nis a protection against such compulsion resulting in his\ngiving evidence “against himself”.”\n                                            (at page 1086)\nxxx xxx xxx\nBroadly stated the guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 20(3)</a> is against\n“testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is\nconfined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial\nfor an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can\nsee no reason to confine the content of the constitutional\nguarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would\nbe to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to\nmiss the substance for the sound as stated in certain\nAmerican decisions. The phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_209\">Article 20(3)</a> is\n“to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely\nby giving oral evidence but also by producing documents\nor making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb\nwitness (See <a href=\"/doc/211471/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 119</a> of the Evidence Act) or the like.\n“To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish\nevidence” and such evidence can be furnished through\nthe lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in\nother modes. So far as production of documents is\nconcerned, no doubt <a href=\"/doc/334170/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 139</a> of the Evidence Act\nsays that a person producing a document on summons is\nnot a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the\nright of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the\nconnotation of the word “witness”, which must be\nunderstood in its natural sense i.e. as referring to a\nperson who furnishes evidence. Indeed, every positive\nvolitional act, which furnishes evidence is testimony, and\ntestimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures\nthe positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as\nopposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission\non his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the\nprotection in respect of the evidence so procured is\nconfined to what transpires at the trial in the court room.\nThe phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 20(3)</a> is “to be a witness” and\nnot to “appear as a witness”: It follows that the protection\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                 19</span>\n\f         afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the\n         phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of\n         testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well\n         extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from\n         him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a\n         formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence\n         has been levelled which in the normal course may result\n         in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in\n         other situations does not call for decision in this case.\n         Considered in this light, the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 20(3)</a>\n         would be available in the present cases to these\n         petitioners against whom a first information report has\n         been recorded as accused therein. It would extend to any\n         compulsory     process       for production of   evidentiary\n         documents which are reasonably likely to support a\n         prosecution against them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                               (at pages 1087-1088)\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">16. The Court then went on to state that there was no “fundamental right to\n\n   privacy” under the Indian Constitution, like the Fourth Amendment to the\n\n   US Constitution, about which more shall be said a little later. What is\n\n   important, however, is the fact that even in this early judgment, a mere\n\n   literal reading was not given to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 20(3).</a> The Court recognised that\n\n   a person can be said to be a witness not merely by giving oral\n\n   evidence, but also by producing documents – evidence being furnished\n\n   through the lips of a person or by production of a thing or of a document\n\n   or in other modes. It is important to stress that the protection was\n\n   afforded to a person formally accused of an offence on the basis of a\n\n   statement that may be compulsorily taken from him even before\n\n   evidence is given in a court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                                         20</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_56\">17.

However, the Court went on to state that\n\n   “furnishing evidence” would exclude thumb-impressions or writing\n\n   specimens, for the reason that the taking of impressions of parts of the\n\n   body often becomes necessary for the investigation of a crime (see\n\n   page 29). Incriminating information must therefore include statements\n\n   based on personal knowledge.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"481284\" id=\"span_58\">The Court then went on to consider\n\n   whether <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_221\">section 27</a> of the Evidence Act would fall foul of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 20(3)</a>,\n\n   having already been upheld when a constitutional challenge under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 14</a> had been repelled by the Court in <a href=\"/doc/481284/\" id=\"a_224\">State of U.P. v.

In the result, the Court held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     “(1) An accused person cannot be said to have been\n     compelled to be a witness against himself simply because\n     he made a statement while in police custody, without\n     anything more.

The area covered by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_236\">Article\n        20(3)</a> and Section 161(2) is substantially the same.

He relied on some passages\n        in American decisions but, in our understanding, those\n        passages do not so circumscribe and, on the other hand,\n        the landmark Miranda [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436\n        (1966)] ruling did extend the embargo to police\n        investigation also. Moreover, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 20(3)</a>, which is our\n        provision, warrants no such truncation. Such a narrow\n        meaning may emasculate a necessary protection. There\n        are only two primary queries involved in this clause that\n        seals the lips into permissible silence: (i) Is the person\n        called upon to testify “accused of any offence”? (ii) Is he\n        being compelled to be witness against himself? A\n        constitutional provision receives its full semantic range\n        and so it follows that a wider connotation must be\n        imparted to the expressions “accused of any offence” and\n        “to be witness against himself”. The learned Advocate-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">        General, influenced by American decisions rightly agreed\n        that in expression Section 161(2) of the Code might cover\n        not merely accusations already registered in police\n        stations but those which are likely to be the basis for\n        exposing a person to a criminal charge. Indeed, this wider\n        construction, if applicable to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 20(3)</a>, approximates\n        the constitutional clause to the explicit statement of the\n        prohibition in Section 161(2). This latter provision\n        meaningfully uses the expression “expose himself to a\n        criminal charge”. Obviously, these words mean, not only\n        cases where the person is already exposed to a criminal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                                                      24</span>\n\fcharge but also instances which will imminently expose\nhim to criminal charges. In <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_241\">Article 20(3)</a>, the expression\n“accused of any offence” must mean formally accused in\npraesenti not in futuro — not even imminently as\ndecisions now stand. The expression “to be witness\nagainst himself” means more than the court process. Any\ngiving of evidence, any furnishing of information, if likely to\nhave an incriminating impact, answers the description of\nbeing witness against oneself. Not being limited to the\nforensic stage by express words in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_242\">Article 20(3)</a>, we have\nto construe the expression to apply to every stage where\nfurnishing of information and collection of materials takes\nplace. That is to say, even the investigation at the police\nlevel is embraced by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_243\">Article 20(3).</a> This is precisely what\nSection 161(2) means. That sub-section relates to oral\nexamination by police officers and grants immunity at that\nstage. Briefly, the Constitution and the Code are co-\nterminus in the protective area. While the Code may be\nchanged, the Constitution is more enduring. Therefore, we\nhave to base our conclusion not merely upon Section\n161(2) but on the more fundamental protection, although\nequal in ambit, contained in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_244\">Article 20(3).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">57. We hold that Section 161 enables the police to\nexamine the accused during investigation. The prohibitive\nsweep of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 20(3)</a> goes back to the stage of police\ninterrogation — not, as contended, commencing in court\nonly. In our judgment, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 20(3)</a> and\nSection 161(1) substantially cover the same area, so far\nas police investigations are concerned. The ban on self-\naccusation and the right to silence, while one investigation\nor trial is under way, goes beyond that case and protects\nthe accused in regard to other offences pending or\nimminent, which may deter him from voluntary disclosure\nof criminatory matter. We are disposed to read “compelled\ntestimony” as evidence procured not merely by physical\nthreats or violence but by psychic torture, atmospheric\npressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative\nprolixity, overbearing and intimidatory methods and the\nlike — not legal penalty for violation. So, the legal perils\nfollowing upon refusal to answer, or answer truthfully,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                  25</span>\n\fcannot be regarded as compulsion within the meaning of\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_247\">Article 20(3).</a> The prospect of prosecution may lead to\nlegal tension in the exercise of a constitutional right, but\nthen, a stance of silence is running a calculated risk. On\nthe other hand, if there is any mode of pressure, subtle or\ncrude, mental or physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently\nsubstantial, applied by the policeman for obtaining\ninformation from an accused strongly suggestive of guilt, it\nbecomes “compelled testimony”, violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_248\">Article 20(3).</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">58. A police officer is clearly a person in authority.\nInsistence on answering is a form of pressure especially\nin the atmosphere of the police station unless certain\nsafeguards erasing duress are adhered to. Frequent\nthreats of prosecution if there is failure to answer may\ntake on the complexion of undue pressure violating <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_249\">Article\n20(3).</a> Legal penalty may by itself not amount to duress\nbut the manner of mentioning it to the victim of\ninterrogation may introduce an element of tension and\ntone of command perilously hovering near compulsion.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">59. We have explained elaborately and summed up, in\nsubstance, what is self-incrimination or tendency to\nexpose oneself to a criminal charge. It is less than\n“relevant” and more than “confessional”. Irrelevance is\nimpermissible but relevance is licit but when relevant\nquestions are loaded with guilty inference in the event of\nan answer being supplied, the tendency to incriminate\nsprings into existence. We hold further that the accused\nperson cannot be forced to answer questions merely\nbecause the answers thereto are not implicative when\nviewed in isolation and confined to that particular case. He\nis entitled to keep his mouth shut if the answer sought has\na reasonable prospect of exposing him to guilt in some\nother accusation actual or imminent, even though the\ninvestigation under way is not with reference to that. We\nhave already explained that in determining the\nincriminatory character of an answer the accused is\nentitled to consider — and the Court while adjudging will\ntake note of — the setting, the totality of circumstances,\nthe equation, personal and social, which have a bearing\non making an answer substantially innocent but in effect\nguilty in import. However, fanciful claims, unreasonable\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                                  26</span>\n\f         apprehensions and vague possibilities cannot be the\n         hiding ground for an accused person.

Coming to the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_262\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, Section 161 empowers a\npolice officer making an investigation to examine orally\nany person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and to reduce into writing any\nstatement made to him in the course of such examination.\nSection 162 which speaks of the use of the statement so\nrecorded, states that no statement recorded by a police\nofficer, if reduced into writing, be signed by the person\nmaking it and that the statement shall not be used for any\npurpose save as provided in the Code and the provisions\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_263\">Evidence Act</a>. The ban imposed by Section 162\napplies to all the statements whether confessional or\notherwise, made to a police officer by any person whether\naccused or not during the course of the investigation\nunder Chapter XII of the Code. But the statement given by\nan accused can be used in the manner provided by\n<a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_264\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act in case the accused\nexamines himself as a witness for the defence by availing\nSection 315(1) of the Code corresponding to Section 342-\nA of the old Code and to give evidence on oath in disproof\nof the charges made against him or any person charged\ntogether with him at the same trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">209. There is a clear embargo in making use of this\nstatement of an accused given to a police officer under\n<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, according to which, no\nconfession made to a police officer shall be proved as\nagainst a person accused of any offence and under\n<a href=\"/doc/186683/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 26</a> according to which no confession made by any\nperson whilst he is in custody of a police officer, unless it\nis made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall\nbe proved as against such person.

The\nexplanation to the section reads that “offence” as used in\nthis section includes the abetment of, or attempt to\ncommit, the offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">212. Section 164 of the Code speaks of recording of\nconfessions and statements by Magistrates specified in\nthat section by complying with the legal formalities and\nobserving the statutory conditions including the\nappendage of a Certificate by the Magistrate recording the\nconfession as contemplated under sub-sections (2) to (6)\nthereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">213. Though in the old Code, there was a specific\nembargo on a police officer recording any statement or\nconfession made to him in the course of an investigation\nembodied in the main sub-section (1) of Section 164 itself,\nin the present Code the legal bar is now brought by a\nseparate proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 164 which\nreads:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">“Provided that no confession shall be recorded by a police\nofficer on whom any power of a Magistrate has been\nconferred under any law for the time being in force.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                              29</span>\n\f         This is a new provision but conveys the same meaning as\n         embodied in the main sub-section (1) of Section 164 of\n         the old Code.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1013766\" id=\"span_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"637970\" id=\"span_78\">214. Thus, an accused or a person accused of any\n         offence is protected by the constitutional provisions as\n         well as the statutory provisions to the extent that no self-\n         incriminating statement made by an accused to the police\n         officer while he is in custody, could be used against such\n         maker.

It applies as much to an\n         offence committed under TADA as under any other Act.\n         The word, ‘compelled’ ordinarily means ‘by force’. This\n         may take place positively and negatively. When one\n         forces one to act in a manner desired by him it is\n         compelling him to do that thing. Same may take place\n         when one is prevented from doing a particular thing\n         unless he agrees to do as desired. In either case it is\n         compulsion. A confession made by an accused or\n         obtained by him under coercion suffers from infirmity\n         unless it is made freely and voluntarily. No civilised\n         democratic country has accepted confession made by an\n         accused before a police officer as voluntary and above\n         suspicion, therefore, admissible in evidence. One of the\n         established rule or norms accepted everywhere is that\n         custodial confession is presumed to be tainted.

The class of offences dealt by TADA\n         may be different than other offences but the offender\n         under TADA is as much entitled to protection of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_293\">Articles 20</a>\n         and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_294\">21</a> as any other.

The crucial\ntest <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_304\">laid down in</a> Kathi Kalu Oghad is that of\n\n“imparting knowledge in respect of relevant facts, by\nmeans of oral statements or statements in writing by a\nperson who has personal knowledge of the facts to be\ncommunicated to a court or to a person holding an\nenquiry or investigation” (ibid. at SCR p. 30.).</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_88\">The difficulty arises since the majority opinion <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_305\">in that case</a>\nappears to confine the understanding of “personal\ntestimony” to the conveyance of personal knowledge\nthrough oral statements or statements in writing. The\nresults obtained from polygraph examination or a BEAP\ntest are not in the nature of oral or written statements.\nInstead, inferences are drawn from the measurement of\nphysiological responses recorded during the performance\nof these tests. It could also be argued that tests such as\npolygraph examination and the BEAP test do not involve a\n“positive volitional act” on part of the test subject and\nhence their results should not be treated as testimony.\nHowever, this does not entail that the results of these two\ntests should be likened to physical evidence and thereby\nexcluded from the protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_306\">Article 20(3).</a></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_89\">181. We must refer back to the substance of the decision\nin Kathi Kalu Oghad which equated a testimonial act with\nthe imparting of knowledge by a person who has personal\nknowledge of the facts that are in issue. It has been\nrecognised in other decisions that such personal\nknowledge about relevant facts can also be\ncommunicated through means other than oral or written\nstatements. For example in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_307\">M.P. Sharma</a> case, it was\nnoted that “…evidence can be furnished through the lips\nor by production of a thing or of a document or in other\nmodes.” (ibid. at SCR p. 1087) Furthermore, common\nsense dictates that certain communicative gestures such\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                                                34</span>\n\fas pointing or nodding can also convey personal\nknowledge about a relevant fact, without offering a verbal\nresponse. It is quite foreseeable that such a\ncommunicative gesture may by itself expose a person to\n“criminal charges or penalties” or furnish a link in the\nchain of evidence needed for prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">182. We must also highlight that there is nothing to show\nthat the learned Judges in Kathi Kalu Oghad had\ncontemplated the impugned techniques while discussing\nthe scope of the phrase “to be a witness” for the purpose\nof <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_308\">Article 20(3).</a> At that time, the transmission of\nknowledge through means other than speech or writing\nwas not something that could have been easily conceived\nof. Techniques such as polygraph examination were fairly\nobscure and were the subject of experimentation in some\nwestern nations while the BEAP technique was developed\nseveral years later. Just as the interpretation of statutes\nhas to be often re-examined in light of scientific\nadvancements, we should also be willing to re-examine\njudicial observations with a progressive lens.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">183. An explicit reference to the lie detector tests was of\ncourse    made       by   the    US      Supreme      Court\nin Schmerber [384 US 757 (1965)] decision, wherein\nBrennan, J. had observed at US p. 764: (L Ed p. 916)\n\n“…To compel a person to submit to testing in which an\neffort will be made to determine his guilt or innocence on\nthe basis of physiological responses, whether willed or\nnot, is to evoke the spirit and history of the Fifth\nAmendment.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">184. Even though the actual process of undergoing a\npolygraph examination or a BEAP test is not the same as\nthat of making an oral or written statement, the\nconsequences are similar. By making inferences from the\nresults of these tests, the examiner is able to derive\nknowledge from the subject&#x27;s mind which otherwise would\nnot have become available to the investigators. These two\ntests are different from medical examination and the\nanalysis of bodily substances such as blood, semen and\nhair samples, since the test subject&#x27;s physiological\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                              35</span>\n\fresponses are directly correlated to mental faculties.\nThrough lie detection or gauging a subject&#x27;s familiarity\nwith the stimuli, personal knowledge is conveyed in\nrespect of a relevant fact. It is also significant that unlike\nthe case of documents, the investigators cannot possibly\nhave any prior knowledge of the test subject&#x27;s thoughts\nand memories, either in the actual or constructive sense.\nTherefore, even if a highly strained analogy were to be\nmade between the results obtained from the impugned\ntests and the production of documents, the weight of\nprecedents leans towards restrictions on the extraction of\n“personal knowledge” through such means.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">185. During the administration of a polygraph test or a\nBEAP test, the subject makes a mental effort which is\naccompanied by certain physiological responses. The\nmeasurement of these responses then becomes the basis\nof the transmission of knowledge to the investigators. This\nknowledge may aid an ongoing investigation or lead to the\ndiscovery of fresh evidence which could then be used to\nprosecute the test subject. In any case, the compulsory\nadministration of the impugned tests impedes the\nsubject&#x27;s right to choose between remaining silent and\noffering substantive information. The requirement of a\n“positive volitional act” becomes irrelevant since the\nsubject is compelled to convey personal knowledge\nirrespective of his/her own volition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">189. In light of the preceding discussion, we are of the\nview that the results obtained from tests such as\npolygraph examination and the BEAP test should also be\ntreated as “personal testimony”, since they are a means\nfor “imparting personal knowledge about relevant facts”.\nHence, our conclusion is that the results obtained through\nthe involuntary administration of either of the impugned\ntests (i.e. the narcoanalysis technique, polygraph\nexamination and the BEAP test) come within the scope of\n“testimonial compulsion”, thereby attracting the protective\nshield of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_309\">Article 20(3).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">xxx xxx xxx\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                 36</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">\f262. In our considered opinion, the compulsory\nadministration of the impugned techniques violates the\n“right against self-incrimination”. This is because the\nunderlying rationale of the said right is to ensure the\nreliability as well as voluntariness of statements that are\nadmitted as evidence. This Court has recognised that the\nprotective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 20(3)</a> extends to the\ninvestigative stage in criminal cases and when read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_311\">Section 161(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 it\nprotects accused persons, suspects as well as witnesses\nwho are examined during an investigation. The test\nresults cannot be admitted in evidence if they have been\nobtained through the use of compulsion. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_312\">Article 20(3)</a>\nprotects an individual&#x27;s choice between speaking and\nremaining silent, irrespective of whether the subsequent\ntestimony proves to be inculpatory or exculpatory. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_313\">Article\n20(3)</a> aims to prevent the forcible “conveyance of personal\nknowledge that is relevant to the facts in issue”. The\nresults obtained from each of the impugned tests bear a\n“testimonial” character and they cannot be categorised as\nmaterial evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">263. We are also of the view that forcing an individual to\nundergo any of the impugned techniques violates the\nstandard of “substantive due process” which is required\nfor restraining personal liberty. Such a violation will occur\nirrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly\nadministered during the course of an investigation or for\nany other purpose since the test results could also expose\na person to adverse consequences of a non-penal nature.\nThe impugned techniques cannot be read into the\nstatutory provisions which enable medical examination\nduring investigation in criminal cases i.e. the Explanation\nto <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_314\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_315\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_316\">54</a> of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973. Such an expansive interpretation is not\nfeasible in light of the rule of “ejusdem generis” and the\nconsiderations which govern the interpretation of statutes\nin relation to scientific advancements. We have also\nelaborated how the compulsory administration of any of\nthese techniques is an unjustified intrusion into the mental\nprivacy of an individual. It would also amount to “cruel,\ninhuman or degrading treatment” with regard to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                                37</span>\n\f         language of evolving international human rights norms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">         Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from\n         these techniques comes into conflict with the “right to fair\n         trial”. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot\n         justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the “right\n         against self-incrimination”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">         264. In light of these conclusions, we hold that no\n         individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the\n         techniques in question, whether in the context of\n         investigation in criminal cases or otherwise. Doing so\n         would amount to an unwarranted intrusion into personal\n         liberty. However, we do leave room for the voluntary\n         administration of the impugned techniques in the context\n         of criminal justice provided that certain safeguards are in\n         place. Even when the subject has given consent to\n         undergo any of these tests, the test results by themselves\n         cannot be admitted as evidence because the subject does\n         not exercise conscious control over the responses during\n         the administration of the test. However, any information or\n         material that is subsequently discovered with the help of\n         voluntary administered test results can be admitted in\n         accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">25.

Moreover, the decision does not\n         adjudicate upon whether privacy could be a\n         constitutionally protected right under any other provision\n         such as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_327\">Article 21</a> or under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 19.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">         xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">         316.

It was stated that: (ER p. 769)\n\n“… To enter a man&#x27;s house by virtue of a nameless\nwarrant, in order to procure evidence, is worse than the\nSpanish Inquisition; a law under which no Englishman\nwould wish to live an hour….”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">443. This statement of the law was echoed\nin Entick v. Carrington [Entick v.

The first thing that strikes one on reading the\naforesaid passage is that the Court (in M.P.

Also, the\nfundamental right to privacy, stated to be analogous to the\nFourth Amendment, was held to be something which\ncould not be read into <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_335\">Article 20(3).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">457. The second interesting thing to be noted about these\nobservations is that there is no broad ratio in <a href=\"/doc/152402172/\" id=\"a_336\">the said\njudgment</a> that a fundamental right to privacy is not\navailable in Part III of the Constitution. The observation is\nconfined to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_337\">Article 20(3).</a> Further, it is clear that the actual\nfinding in the aforesaid case had to do with the law which\nhad developed in this Court as well as the US and the UK\non <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_338\">Article 20(3)</a> which, on the facts of the case, was held\nnot to be violated. Also we must not forget that this was an\nearly judgment of the Court, delivered in the Gopalan era,\nwhich did not have the benefit of R.C. Cooper or Maneka\nGandhi. Quite apart from this, it is clear that by the time\nthis judgment was delivered, India was already a\nsignatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_339\">Article 12</a> of which states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">“12.

It will be seen that different smaller Benches of this\nCourt were not unduly perturbed by the observations\ncontained in M.P. Sharma as it was an early judgment of\nthis Court delivered in the Gopalan era which had been\neroded by later judgments dealing with the interrelation\nbetween fundamental rights and the development of the\nfundamental right to privacy as being part of the liberty\nand dignity of the individual.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">469.

Colorado [Wolf v. Colorado 338 US 25\n(1949)] to the effect that the security of one&#x27;s\nprivacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police is basic to\na free society. The Court then went on to quote the US\nFourth Amendment which guarantees the rights of the\npeople to be secured in their persons, houses, papers and\neffects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nThough the Indian Constitution did not expressly confer a\nlike guarantee, the majority held that nonetheless an\nunauthorised intrusion into a person&#x27;s home would violate\nthe English Common Law maxim which asserts that every\nman&#x27;s house is his castle. In this view of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_344\">Article 21</a>,\nRegulation 236(b) was struck down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_70\">xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">475. If the passage in the judgment dealing with\ndomiciliary visits at night and striking it down is contrasted\nwith the later passage upholding the other clauses of\nRegulation 236 extracted above, it becomes clear that it\ncannot be said with any degree of clarity that the majority\njudgment upholds the right to privacy as being contained\nin the fundamental rights chapter or otherwise. As the\nmajority judgment contradicts itself on this vital aspect, it\nwould be correct to say that it cannot be given much value\nas a binding precedent. In any case, we are of the view\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                                                 43</span>\n\fthat the majority judgment is good law when it speaks of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_345\">Article 21</a> being designed to assure the dignity of the\nindividual as a most cherished human value which\nensures the means of full development and evolution of a\nhuman being. The majority judgment is also correct in\npointing out that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_346\">Article 21</a> interdicts unauthorised\nintrusion into a person&#x27;s home. Where the majority\njudgment goes wrong is in holding that fundamental rights\nare in watertight compartments and in holding that the\nright to privacy is not a guaranteed right under our\nConstitution. It can be seen, therefore, that the majority\njudgment is like the proverbial curate&#x27;s egg—good only in\nparts. Strangely enough when the good parts alone are\nseen, there is no real difference between Subba Rao, J.&#x27;s\napproach in the dissenting judgment and the majority\njudgment. This then answers the major part of the\nreference to this nine-Judge Bench in that we hereby\ndeclare that neither the eight-Judge nor the six-Judge\nBench can be read to come in the way of reading the\nfundamental right to privacy into Part III of the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_72\">xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">521.

The scope of the section is\n\n   not limited by time – it is immaterial that the person was not an accused\n\n   at the time when the confessional statement was made.

The expression, “accused person” in <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_374\">Section\n        24</a> and the expression “a person accused of any offence”\n        have the same connotation, and describe the person\n        against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal\n        proceeding.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons for enacting the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_430\">NDPS Act</a> is\n\n   important and states as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">        “The statutory control over narcotic drugs is exercised in\n        India through a number of Central and State enactments.\n        The principal Central Acts, namely the Opium Act, 1857,\n        the <a href=\"/doc/72261612/\" id=\"a_431\">Opium Act, 1878</a> and the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930\n        were enacted a long time ago. With the passage of time\n        and the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and\n        drug abuse at national and international level, many\n        deficiencies in the existing laws have come to notice,\n        some of which are indicated below:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">        (i)    The scheme of penalties under the present Acts is\n               not sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge of\n               well organized gangs of smugglers. The Dangerous\n               Drugs Act, 1930 provides for a maximum term of\n               imprisonment of 3 years with or without fine and 4\n               years imprisonment with or without fine for repeat\n               offences. Further, no minimum punishment is\n               prescribed in the present laws, as a result of which\n               drug traffickers have been some times let off by the\n               courts with nominal punishment. The country has for\n               the last few years been increasingly facing the\n               problem of transit traffic of drugs coming mainly\n               from some of our neighbouring countries and\n               destined mainly to Western countries.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">        (ii)   The existing Central laws do not provide for\n               investing the officers of a number of important\n               Central enforcement agencies like Narcotics,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                                        53</span>\n\f                Customs, Central Excise, etc., with the power of\n                investigation of offences under the said laws.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">        (iii)   Since the enactment of the aforesaid three Central\n                Acts a vast body of international law in the field of\n                narcotics control has evolved through various\n                international   treaties   and     protocols.    The\n                Government of India has been a party to these\n                treaties and conventions which entail several\n                obligations which are not covered or are only partly\n                covered by the present Acts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">        (iv)    During recent years new drugs of addiction which\n                have come to be known as psychotropic substances\n                have appeared on the scene and posed serious\n                problems to national government. There is no\n                comprehensive law to enable exercise of control\n                over psychotropic substances in India in the manner\n                as envisaged in the Convention on Psychotropic\n                Substances, 1971 to which India has also acceded.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">        2. In view of what has been stated above, there is an\n        urgent need for the enactment of a comprehensive\n        legislation on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances\n        which, inter alia, should consolidate and amend the\n        existing laws relating to narcotic drugs, strengthen the\n        existing controls over drug abuse, considerably enhance\n        the penalties particularly for trafficking offences, make\n        provisions for exercising effective control over\n        psychotropic substances and make provisions for the\n        implementation of international conventions relating to\n        narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances to which\n        India has become a party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_93\">        3.

The very first thing that this Statement addresses is the woeful\n\n   inadequacy of three old Acts, insofar as the scheme of penalties is\n\n   concerned, which were not sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                                        54</span>\n\f   of well organised gangs of smugglers, together with the importance of\n\n   investing, for the first time, the officers of central enforcement agencies\n\n   with the power of investigation of offences under the new law.\n\n   Undoubtedly, the NDPS Act is a comprehensive legislation which makes\n\n   provisions for exercising control over narcotic drugs and psychotropic\n\n   substances, at the heart of which is the power vested in various officers\n\n   to investigate offences under the Act, so as to prevent and punish the\n\n   same against offenders being, inter alia, organised gangs of smugglers\n\n   who indulge in what is considered by Parliament to be a menace to\n\n   society. Also, the preamble to the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_432\">NDPS Act</a> states:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">         “<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_433\">An Act</a> to consolidate and amend the law relating to\n         narcotic drugs, to make stringent provisions for the control\n         and regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and\n         psychotropic substances, to provide for the forfeiture of\n         property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic in narcotic\n         drugs and psychotropic substances, to implement the\n         provisions of the International Convention on Narcotic\n         Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and for matters\n         connected therewith.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">41. This itself refers to the Act being a “stringent” measure to combat the\n\n   menace of crimes relatable to drugs and psychotropic substances.\n\n   Under Chapter IV, which deals with “Offences and Penalties”, sections\n\n   15-24 speak of various drugs and psychotropic substances, in which\n\n   the golden thread running through these sections is that where the\n\n   contravention involves “small quantity” as defined, there can be a\n\n   rigorous imprisonment for a term that may extend to one year, or a fine\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                                           55</span>\n\f    that may extend to ten thousand rupees or both; where the\n\n    contravention involves an intermediate quantity, i.e. between “small”\n\n    and “commercial” quantity, with rigorous imprisonment that may extend\n\n    to ten years and with fine that may extend to one lakh rupees; and\n\n    where the contravention involves “commercial quantity” as defined, with\n\n    rigorous imprisonment for a minimum of ten years but which may\n\n    extend to twenty years, and also be liable to a fine which shall not be\n\n    less than one lakh, but which may extend to two lakhs – the court, for\n\n    reasons to be recorded, is also given the power to impose a fine\n\n    exceeding two lakhs. Under <a href=\"/doc/646188/\" id=\"a_434\">sections 28</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_435\">29</a>, punishments for\n\n    attempts to commit offences, and for abetment and criminal conspiracy,\n\n    are then set out. An extremely important section is <a href=\"/doc/634898/\" id=\"a_436\">section 30</a>, where\n\n    even preparation to commit an offence is made an offence 1. Under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1736438/\" id=\"a_437\">section 31</a>, where a person is already convicted of the commission of,\n\n    or attempt to commit, or abetment of, or criminal conspiracy to commit,\n\n    any of the offences punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_438\">NDPS Act</a>, and is\n\n    subsequently convicted of the commission of, or attempt to commit, or\n\n    abetment of, or criminal conspiracy to commit, an offence punishable\n\n    under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_439\">NDPS Act</a>, the punishment then goes to up to a term which\n\n    may extend to one and one-half times the maximum term of\n\n1 It may be remembered that in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_440\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860 (“<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_441\">IPC</a>”), the only\nsection where preparation is made an offence, is “preparation to commit\ndacoity”.

From this section it is clear that only when the concerned officer has\n\n   “reason to believe” from personal knowledge or information given by\n\n   any person and taken down in writing that an offence has been\n\n   committed, that the concerned officer may, only between sunrise and\n\n   sunset, enter, search, seize drugs and materials, and arrest any person\n\n   who he believes has committed any offence. By the first proviso, this\n\n   can be done only by an officer not below the rank of sub-inspector.\n\n   Under sub-section (2) in addition, where the information in writing is\n\n   given, the officer involved must send a copy thereof to his immediate\n\n   official superior within seventy-two hours. It is important here to contrast\n\n   “reason to believe” with the expression “reason to suspect”, which is\n\n   contained in <a href=\"/doc/1798309/\" id=\"a_469\">section 49</a> of the NDPS Act. Thus, “reason to believe” has\n\n   been construed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/321914/\" id=\"a_470\">A.S. Krishnan v. State of Kerala</a>\n\n   (2004) 11 SCC 576 as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">         “9. Under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_471\">IPC</a>, guilt in respect of almost all the offences is\n         fastened either on the ground of “intention” or “knowledge”\n         or “reason to believe”. We are now concerned with the\n         expressions “knowledge” and “reason to believe”.\n         “Knowledge” is an awareness on the part of the person\n         concerned indicating his state of mind. “Reason to\n         believe” is another facet of the state of mind. “Reason to\n         believe” is not the same thing as “suspicion” or “doubt”\n         and mere seeing also cannot be equated to believing.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                                            62</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">\f        “Reason to believe” is a higher level of state of mind.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">        Likewise “knowledge” will be slightly on a higher plane\n        than “reason to believe”. A person can be supposed to\n        know where there is a direct appeal to his senses and a\n        person is presumed to have a reason to believe if he has\n        sufficient cause to believe the same. <a href=\"/doc/1475631/\" id=\"a_472\">Section 26</a> IPC\n        explains the meaning of the words “reason to believe”\n        thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">        “26. ‘Reason to believe’.—A person is said to have\n        ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to\n        believe that thing but not otherwise.””\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">47. <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_473\">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act contains extremely important conditions\n\n   under which a search of persons shall be conducted. <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_474\">Section 50</a> states:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">        “50.

Dealing with <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_496\">Section 50</a>, it was held that in\n         the context in which the right had been conferred, it must\n         naturally be presumed that it is imperative on the part of\n         the officer to inform the person to be searched of his right\n         that if he so requires he shall be searched before a\n         gazetted officer or Magistrate and on such request being\n         made by him, to be taken before the gazetted officer or\n         Magistrate for further proceedings. The reasoning given\n         in <a href=\"/doc/61381973/\" id=\"a_497\">Balbir Singh</a> case [(1994) 3 SCC 299] was that to afford\n         an opportunity to the person to be searched “if he so\n         requires to be searched before a gazetted officer or a\n         Magistrate” he must be made aware of that right and that\n         could be done only by the empowered officer\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                                        64</span>\n\fby informing him of the existence of that right. The Court\nwent on to hold that failure to inform the person to be\nsearched of that right and if he so requires, failure to take\nhim to the gazetted officer or the Magistrate, would mean\nnon-compliance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_498\">Section 50</a> which in\nturn would “affect the prosecution case and vitiate the\ntrial”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"795643\" id=\"span_134\">The following conclusions were arrived at by the\ntwo-Judge Bench in <a href=\"/doc/795643/\" id=\"a_499\">State of Punjab v.

On the basis of the reasoning and discussion above,\nthe following conclusions arise:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">(1) That when an empowered officer or a duly authorised\nofficer acting on prior information is about to search a\nperson, it is imperative for him to inform the concerned\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                               67</span>\n\fperson of his right under Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_531\">Section 50</a> of\nbeing taken to the nearest Gazetted Officer or the nearest\nMagistrate for making the search. However, such\ninformation may not necessarily be in writing;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">(2) That failure to inform the concerned person about the\nexistence of his right to be searched before a Gazetted\nOfficer or a Magistrate would cause prejudice to an\naccused;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">(3) That a search made, by an empowered officer, on prior\ninformation, without informing the person of his right that,\nif he so requires, he shall be taken before a Gazetted\nOfficer or a Magistrate for search and in case he so opts,\nfailure to conduct his search before a Gazetted Officer or\na Magistrate, may not vitiate the trial but would render the\nrecovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate the\nconviction and sentence of an accused, where the\nconviction has been recorded only on the basis of the\npossession of the illicit article, recovered from his person,\nduring a search conducted in violation of the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_532\">Section 50</a> of the Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">(4) That there is indeed need to protect society from\ncriminals. The societal intent in safety will suffer if persons\nwho commit crimes are let off because the evidence\nagainst them is to be treated as if it does not exist. The\nanswer, therefore, is that the investigating agency must\nfollow the procedure as envisaged by the statute\nscrupulously and the failure to do so must be viewed by\nthe higher authorities seriously inviting action against the\nconcerned official so that the laxity on the part of the\ninvestigating authority is curbed. In every case the end\nresult is important but the means to achieve it must\nremain above board. The remedy cannot be worse than\nthe disease itself. The legitimacy of judicial process may\ncome under cloud if the court is seen to condone acts of\nlawlessness conducted by the investigating agency during\nsearch operations and may also undermine respect for\nlaw and may have the effect of unconscionably\ncompromising the administration of justice. That cannot\nbe permitted. An accused is entitled to a fair trial. A\nconviction resulting from an unfair trial is contrary to our\nconcept of justice. The use of evidence collected in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                                  68</span>\n\fbreach of the safeguards provided by <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_533\">Section 50</a> at the\ntrial, would render the trial unfair.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">(5) That whether or not the safeguards provided\nin <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_534\">Section 50</a> have been duly observed would have to be\ndetermined by the Court on the basis of evidence led at\nthe trial. Finding on that issue, one way or the other,\nwould be relevant for recording an order of conviction or\nacquittal. Without giving an opportunity to the prosecution\nto establish, at the trial, that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_535\">Section 50</a>,\nand particularly the safeguards provided therein were duly\ncomplied with, it would not be permissible to cut-short a\ncriminal trial;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">(6) That in the context in which the protection has been\nincorporated in <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_536\">Section 50</a> for the benefit of the person\nintended to be searched, we do not express any opinion\nwhether the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_537\">Section 50</a> are mandatory or\ndirectory, but, hold that failure to inform the concerned\nperson of his right as emanating from Sub-section (1)\nof <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_538\">Section 50</a>, may render the recovery of the contraband\nsuspect and the conviction and sentence of an accused\nbad and unsustainable in law;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">(7) That an illicit article seized from the person of an\naccused during search conducted in violation of the\nsafeguards provided in <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_539\">Section 50</a> of the Act cannot be\nused as evidence of proof of unlawful possession of the\ncontraband on the accused though any other material\nrecovered during that search may be relied upon by the\nprosecution, in other proceedings, against an accused,\nnotwithstanding the recovery of that material during an\nillegal search;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">(8) A presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1297682/\" id=\"a_540\">Section 54</a> of the Act can only be\nraised after the prosecution has established that the\naccused was found to be in possession of the contraband\nin a search conducted in accordance with the mandate\nof <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_541\">Section 50</a>.

It can, thus, be seen that apart from the fact that\nin Karnail Singh [(2009) 8 SCC 539], the issue was\nregarding the scope and applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_552\">Section 42</a> of the\nNDPS Act in the matter of conducting search, seizure and\narrest without warrant or authorisation<a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_553\">, <a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_554\">the said decision</a></a>\ndoes not depart from the dictum <a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_555\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1259796/\" id=\"a_556\">Baldev\nSingh</a> case [(1999) 6 SCC 172] insofar as the obligation of\nthe empowered officer to inform the suspect of his right\nenshrined in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_557\">Section 50</a> of the NDPS\nAct is concerned. It is also plain from the said paragraph\nthat the flexibility in procedural requirements in terms of\nthe two newly inserted sub-sections can be resorted to\nonly in emergent and urgent situations, contemplated in\nthe provision, and not as a matter of course. Additionally,\nsub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_558\">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act makes it\nimperative and obligatory on the authorised officer to send\na copy of the reasons recorded by him for his belief in\nterms of sub-section (5), to his immediate superior officer,\nwithin the stipulated time, which exercise would again be\nsubjected to judicial scrutiny during the course of trial.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_113\">xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">29.

So far as the first requirement\nis concerned, it can be seen that the legislature intended\nthat only certain Magistrates and certain officers of higher\nrank and empowered can act to effect the arrest or\nsearch. This is a safeguard provided having regard to the\ndeterrent sentences contemplated and with a view that\ninnocent persons are not harassed. Therefore if an arrest\nor search contemplated under these provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_607\">NDPS\nAct</a> has to be carried out, the same can be done only by\ncompetent and empowered Magistrates or officers\nmentioned thereunder.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">11.

Varghese v. Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam and Anr.</a> (1981) 4\n\n   SCC 173, a marginal note is an important internal tool for indicating the\n\n   meaning and purpose of a section in a statute, as it indicates the “drift”\n\n   of the provision.

It\n         is undoubtedly true that the marginal note to a section\n         cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the\n         section but it can certainly be relied upon as indicating the\n         drift of the section or, to use the words of Collins, M.R.\n         in Bushel v.

The word\n\n   “enquiry” has been used in <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_617\">section 67</a> to differentiate it from “inquiry” as\n\n   used in <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_618\">section 53A</a>, which is during the course of investigation of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                                                           78</span>\n\f    offences2.

The first safeguard is that\n\n   such officer must have “reason to believe”, which as has been noted, is\n\n   different from mere “reason to suspect”. It is for this reason that such\n\n   officer must make an enquiry in connection with the contravention of the\n\n   provisions of this Act, for otherwise, even without such enquiry, mere\n\n   suspicion of the commission of an offence would be enough. It is in this\n\n   enquiry that he has to call for “information” under sub-clause (a), which\n\n   “information” can be given by any person and taken down in writing, as\n\n   is provided in <a href=\"/doc/855593/\" id=\"a_627\">section 42(1)</a>. Further, the information given must be for\n\n   the purpose of “satisfying” himself that there has been a contravention\n\n   of the provisions of this Act, which again goes back to the expression\n\n   “reason to believe” in <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_628\">section 42</a>.

It is important to notice that it is an inclusive definition, by\n\n   which, “evidence” is collected by a police officer or a person authorised\n\n   by the Magistrate. The “enquiry” that is made by a <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_636\">section 42</a> officer is\n\n   so that such officer may gather “information” to satisfy himself that there\n\n   is “reason to believe” that an offence has been committed in the first\n\n   place.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                                                              81</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_142\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">\f64.

It is clear, therefore, that <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_642\">section 67</a> is at an\n\n   antecedent stage to the “investigation”, which occurs after the\n\n   concerned officer under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_643\">section 42</a> has “reason to believe”, upon\n\n   information gathered in an enquiry made in that behalf, that an offence\n\n   has been committed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1643745\" id=\"span_166\">65. Equally, when we come to <a href=\"/doc/1925275/\" id=\"a_644\">section 67(c)</a> of the NDPS Act, the\n\n   expression used is “examine” any person acquainted with the facts and\n\n   circumstances of the case. The “examination” of such person is again\n\n   only for the purpose of gathering information so as to satisfy himself\n\n   that there is “reason to believe” that an offence has been committed.\n\n   This can, by no stretch of imagination, be equated to a “statement”\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_645\">section 161</a> of the CrPC, as is argued by Shri Lekhi, relying upon\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1643745/\" id=\"a_646\">Sahoo v. State of U.P.</a> (1965) 3 SCR 86 (at page 88), which would\n\n   include the making of a confession, being a sub-species of “statement”.</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                                                         82</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">\f66.

First and foremost, even according to Shri\n\n   Lekhi, a police officer, properly so-called, may be authorised to call for\n\n   information etc. under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_650\">section 67</a>, as he is an officer referred to in\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/855593/\" id=\"a_651\">section 42(1)</a>. Yet, while “investigating” an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_652\">NDPS Act</a>\n\n   i.e. subsequent to the collection of information etc. under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_653\">section 67</a>, the\n\n   same police officer will be bound by <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_654\">sections 160-164</a> of the CrPC,\n\n   together with all the safeguards mentioned therein – firstly, that the\n\n   person examined shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to\n\n   such case put to him, other than questions which would tend to\n\n   incriminate him; secondly, the police officer is to reduce this statement\n\n   into writing and maintain a separate and true record of this statement;\n\n   thirdly, the statement made may be recorded by audio-video electronic\n\n   means to ensure its genuineness; and fourthly, a statement made by a\n\n   woman can only be made to a woman police officer or any woman\n\n   officer. Even after all these safeguards are met, no such statement can\n\n   be used at any inquiry or trial, except for the purpose of contradicting\n\n   such witness in cross-examination. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56195\" id=\"span_168\">In <a href=\"/doc/56195/\" id=\"a_655\">Tahsildar Singh v. State of U.P.</a>,\n\n   1959 Supp (2) SCR 875, Subba Rao J., speaking for four out of six\n\n   learned Judges of this Court, had occasion to refer to the history of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                                                                           83</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_656\">section 162</a> of the CrPC. After setting out this history in some detail, the\n\nlearned Judge held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">     “It is, therefore, seen that the object of the legislature\n     throughout has been to exclude the statement of a\n     witness made before the police during the investigation\n     from being made use of at the trial for any purpose, and\n     the amendments made from time to time were only\n     intended to make clear the said object and to dispel the\n     cloud cast on such intention. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_657\">The Act</a> of 1898 for the first\n     time introduced an exception enabling the said statement\n     reduced to writing to be used for impeaching the credit of\n     the witness in the manner provided by the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_658\">Evidence Act</a>.\n     As the phraseology of the exception lent scope to defeat\n     the purpose of the legislature, by the Amendment Act of\n     1923, the section was redrafted defining the limits of the\n     exception with precision so as to confine it only to\n     contradict the witness in the manner provided under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_659\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act. If one could guess the\n     intention of the legislature in framing the section in the\n     manner it did in 1923, it would be apparent that it was to\n     protect the accused against the user of the statements of\n     witnesses made before the police during investigation at\n     the trial presumably on the assumption that the said\n     statements were not made under circumstances inspiring\n     confidence. Both the section and the proviso intended to\n     serve primarily the same purpose i.e., the interest of the\n     accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">                                             (at pages 889 – 890)\n\n     xxx xxx xxx\n\n     The object of the main section as the history of its\n     legislation shows and the decided cases indicate is to\n     impose a general bar against the use of statement made\n     before the police and the enacting clause in clear terms\n     says that no statement made by any person to a police\n     officer or any record thereof, or any part of such statement\n     or record, be used for any purpose. The words are clear\n     and unambiguous. The proviso engrafts an exception on\n     the general prohibition and that is, the said statement in\n     writing may be used to contradict a witness in the manner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                                                                        84</span>\n\fprovided by <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_660\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act. We have\nalready noticed from the history of the section that the\nenacting clause was mainly intended to protect the\ninterests of accused. At the stage of investigation,\nstatements of witnesses are taken in a haphazard\nmanner. The police officer in the course of his\ninvestigation finds himself more often in the midst of an\nexcited crowd and babel of voices raised all round. In\nsuch an atmosphere, unlike that in a court of law, he is\nexpected to hear the statements of witnesses and record\nseparately the statement of each one of them. Generally\nhe records only a summary of the laments which appear\nto him to be relevant. These statements are, therefore\nonly a summary of what a witness says and very often\nperfunctory. Indeed, in view of the aforesaid facts, there is\na statutory prohibition against police officers taking the\nsignature of the person making the statement, indicating\nthereby that the statement is not intended to be binding on\nthe witness or an assurance by him that it is a correct\nstatement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">At the same time, it being the earliest record of the\nstatement of a witness soon after the incident, any\ncontradiction found therein would be of immense help to\nan accused to discredit the testimony of a witness making\nthe statement. The section was, therefore, conceived in\nan attempt to find a happy via media, namely, while it\nenacts an absolute bar against the statement made\nbefore a police officer being used for any purpose\nwhatsoever, it enables the accused to rely upon it for a\nlimited purpose of contradicting a witness in the manner\nprovided by <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_661\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act by drawing\nhis attention to parts of the statement intended for\ncontradiction. It cannot be used for corroboration of a\nprosecution or a defence witness or even a court witness.\nNor can it be used for contradicting a defence or a court\nwitness. Shortly stated, there is a general bar against its\nuse subject to a limited exception in the interest of the\naccused, and the exception cannot obviously be used to\ncross the bar.”\n\n                                       (at pages 894 – 895)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                                                85</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56195\" id=\"span_172\">67.

This confession can only be recorded\n\n   after the Magistrate explains to the person making it that he is not\n\n   bound to make a confession and that, if he does so, it may be used as\n\n   evidence against him – see <a href=\"/doc/873866/\" id=\"a_665\">section 164(2)</a> of the CrPC. The Magistrate\n\n   is then to make a memorandum at the foot of the record that he has, in\n\n   fact, warned the person that he is not bound to make such confession,\n\n   and that it may be used as evidence against him – see <a href=\"/doc/91322/\" id=\"a_666\">section 164(4)</a> of\n\n   the CrPC.

It would be remarkable that if a police officer, properly so-called, were to\n\n   “investigate” an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_668\">NDPS Act</a>, all the safeguards\n\n   contained in <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_669\">sections 161</a> to <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_670\">164</a> of the CrPC would be available to the\n\n   accused, but that if the same police officer or other designated officer\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_671\">section 42</a> were to record confessional statements under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_672\">section\n\n   67</a> of the NDPS Act, these safeguards would be thrown to the winds, as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">                                                                             86</span>\n\f   was admitted by Shri Lekhi in the course of his arguments.

Take, for example, an investigation conducted by the regular police\n\n   force of a State qua a person trafficking in ganja. If the same person\n\n   were to be apprehended with ganja on a subsequent occasion, this time\n\n   not by the State police force but by other officers for the same or similar\n\n   offence, the safeguards contained in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_675\">sections 161-164</a> of the CrPC\n\n   would apply insofar as the first incident is concerned, but would not\n\n   apply to the subsequent incident. This is because the second time, the\n\n   investigation was not done by the State police force, but by other\n\n   officers. The fact situation mentioned in the aforesaid example would\n\n   demonstrate manifest arbitrariness in the working of the statute, leading\n\n   to a situation where, for the first incident, safeguards available under\n\n   the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_676\">CrPC</a> come into play because it was investigated by the local State\n\n   police, as opposed to officers other than the local police who\n\n   investigated the second transaction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">70. Take another example. If X &amp; Y are part of a drug syndicate, and X is\n\n   apprehended in the State of Punjab by the local State police with a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                                                           87</span>\n\f   certain quantity of ganja, and Y is apprehended in the State of\n\n   Maharashtra by officers other than the State police, again with a certain\n\n   quantity of ganja which comes from the same source, the investigation\n\n   by the State police in Punjab would be subject to safeguards contained\n\n   in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_677\">CrPC</a>, but the investigation into the ganja carried by Y to\n\n   Maharashtra would be carried out without any such safeguards, owing\n\n   to the fact that an officer other than the local police investigated into the\n\n   offence. These anomalies are real and not imaginary, and if a statute is\n\n   so read as to give rise to such anomalies, it would necessarily have to\n\n   be struck down under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_678\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as being\n\n   discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">71.

If Shri Lekhi’s argument were correct, that a confessional statement\n\n   made under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_682\">section 67</a> is sufficient as substantive evidence to convict\n\n   an accused under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_683\">NDPS Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_684\">section 53A</a> would be rendered otiose.\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_685\">Sections 53</a> and <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_686\">53A</a> of the NDPS Act, when read together, would make\n\n   it clear that <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_687\">section 53A</a> is in the nature of an exception to <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_688\">sections 161</a>,\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_689\">162</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1330928/\" id=\"a_690\">172</a> of the CrPC. This is for the reason that <a href=\"/doc/23637/\" id=\"a_691\">section 53(1)</a>, when\n\n   it invests certain officers or classes of officers with the power of an\n\n   officer in charge of a police station for investigation of offences under\n\n   the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_692\">NDPS Act</a>, refers to Chapter XII of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_693\">CrPC</a>, of which sections 161,\n\n   162 and 172 are a part. First and foremost, under <a href=\"/doc/1153129/\" id=\"a_694\">section 162(1)</a> of the\n\n   CrPC, statements that are made in the course of investigation are not\n\n   required to be signed by the person making them – under <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_695\">section 53A</a>\n\n   they can be signed by the person before an officer empowered under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_696\">section 53</a>. Secondly, it is only in two circumstances [under <a href=\"/doc/968858/\" id=\"a_697\">section\n\n   53A(1)(a)</a> and (b)] that such a statement is made relevant for the\n\n   purpose of proving an offence against the accused: it is only if the\n\n   person who made the statement is dead, cannot be found, is incapable\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                                                           89</span>\n\f   of giving evidence; or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or\n\n   whose presence cannot be obtained without delay or expense which\n\n   the court considers unreasonable, that such statement becomes\n\n   relevant. Otherwise, if the person who made such a statement is\n\n   examined as a witness, and the court thinks that in the interest of justice\n\n   such statement should be made relevant and does so, then again, such\n\n   statement may become relevant. None of this would be necessary if\n\n   Shri Lekhi’s argument were right, that a confessional statement made\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_698\">section 67</a> – not being bound by any of these constraints – would\n\n   be sufficient to convict the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"154139001\" id=\"span_177\">73.

On the basis of this judgment, Shri Lekhi argued that “investigation”\n\n   under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_741\">NDPS Act</a> includes search and seizure which is to be done by\n\n   a <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_742\">section 42</a> officer and would, therefore, begin from that stage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">77. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1361495\" id=\"span_182\">In this connection, it is important to advert first to the decision of this\n\n   Court in <a href=\"/doc/1361495/\" id=\"a_743\">H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi</a> (1955) 1\n\n   SCR 1150. This judgment explains in great detail as to what exactly the\n\n   scope of “investigation” is under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_744\">CrPC</a>. It states:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">         “In order to ascertain the scope of and the reason for\n         requiring such investigation to be conducted by an officer\n         of high rank (except when otherwise permitted by a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                                                                            92</span>\n\fMagistrate), it is useful to consider what “investigation”\nunder the Code comprises. Investigation usually starts on\ninformation relating to the commission of an offence given\nto an officer in charge of a police station and recorded\nunder Section 154 of the Code. If from information so\nreceived or otherwise, the officer in charge of the police\nstation has reason to suspect the commission of an\noffence, he or some other subordinate officer deputed by\nhim, has to proceed to the spot to investigate the facts\nand circumstances of the case and if necessary to take\nmeasures for the discovery and arrest of the offender.\nThus investigation primarily consists in the ascertainment\nof the facts and circumstances of the case. By definition, it\nincludes “all the proceedings under the Code for the\ncollection of evidence conducted by a police officer”. For\nthe above purposes, the investigating officer is given the\npower to require before himself the attendance of any\nperson appearing to be acquainted with the\ncircumstances of the case. He has also the authority to\nexamine such person orally either by himself or by a duly\nauthorised deputy. The officer examining any person in\nthe course of investigation may reduce his statement into\nwriting and such writing is available, in the trial that may\nfollow, for use in the manner provided in this behalf in\nSection 162. Under Section 155 the officer in charge of a\npolice station has the power of making a search in any\nplace for the seizure of anything believed to be necessary\nfor the purpose of the investigation. The search has to be\nconducted by such officer in person. A subordinate officer\nmay be deputed by him for the purpose only for reasons\nto be recorded in writing if he is unable to conduct the\nsearch in person and there is no other competent officer\navailable. The investigating officer has also the power to\narrest the person or persons suspected of the commission\nof the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1297682/\" id=\"a_745\">Section 54</a> of the Code. A police\nofficer making an investigation is enjoined to enter his\nproceedings in a diary from day-to-day. Where such\ninvestigation cannot be completed within the period of 24\nhours and the accused is in custody he is enjoined also to\nsend a copy of the entries in the diary to the Magistrate\nconcerned. It is important to notice that where the\ninvestigation is conducted not by the officer in charge of\nthe police station but by a subordinate officer (by virtue of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                                                93</span>\n\fone or other of the provisions enabling him to depute such\nsubordinate officer for any of the steps in the\ninvestigation) such subordinate officer is to report the\nresult of the investigation to the officer in charge of the\npolice station. If, upon the completion of the investigation\nit appears to the officer in charge of the police station that\nthere is no sufficient evidence or reasonable ground, he\nmay decide to release the suspected accused, if in\ncustody, on his executing a bond. If, however, it appears\nto him that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable\nground, to place the accused on trial, he is to take the\nnecessary steps therefore under Section 170 of the Code.\nIn either case, on the completion of the investigation he\nhas to submit a report to the Magistrate under Section 173\nof the Code in the prescribed form furnishing various\ndetails. Thus, under the Code investigation consists\ngenerally of the following steps: (1) Proceeding to the\nspot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of\nthe case, (3) Discovery and arrest of the suspected\noffender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the\ncommission of the offence which may consist of (a) the\nexamination of various persons (including the accused)\nand the reduction of their statements into writing, if the\nofficer thinks fit, (b) the search of places or seizure of\nthings considered necessary for the investigation and to\nbe produced at the trial, and (5) Formation of the opinion\nas to whether on the material collected there is a case to\nplace the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so\ntaking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a\ncharge-sheet under Section 173. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1710467\" id=\"span_185\">The scheme of the Code\nalso shows that while it is permissible for an officer in\ncharge of a police station to depute some subordinate\nofficer to conduct some of these steps in the investigation,\nthe responsibility for every one of these steps is that of the\nperson in the situation of the officer in charge of the police\nstation, it having been clearly provided in Section 168 that\nwhen a subordinate officer makes an investigation he\nshould report the result to the officer in charge of the\npolice station. It is also clear that the final step in the\ninvestigation, viz. the formation of the opinion as to\nwhether or not there is a case to place the accused on\ntrial is to be that of the officer in charge of the police\nstation. There is no provision permitting delegation thereof\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                                                                 94</span>\n\f         but only a provision entitling superior officers to supervise\n         or participate under Section 551.”\n                                               (at pages 1156-1158)\n\n   This statement of the law was reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/1710467/\" id=\"a_746\">State of Madhya Pradesh\n\n   v. Mubarak Ali</a> (1959) Supp. 2 SCR 201 at 211, 212.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">78. It is important to remember that an officer-in-charge of a police station,\n\n   when he investigates an offence, begins by gathering information, in the\n\n   course of which he may collect evidence relating to the commission of\n\n   the offence, which would include search and seizure of things in the\n\n   course of investigation, to be produced at the trial. Under the scheme of\n\n   the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_747\">NDPS Act</a>, it is possible that the same officer who is authorised\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_748\">section 42</a> is also authorised under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_749\">section 53</a>.

Also, we must bear in mind the fact that the Constitution Bench’s focus\n\n   was on a completely different point, namely, whether the complainant\n\n   and the investigator of an offence could be the same. From the point of\n\n   view of this question, <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_785\">section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act is not relevant and\n\n   has, therefore, not been referred to by the Constitution Bench.

For all these\n\n   reasons, we do not accede either to Shri Puneet Jain’s argument to\n\n   refer Mukesh Singh (supra) to a larger Bench for reconsideration, or to\n\n   Shri Lekhi’s argument based on the same judgment, as the point\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                                                         99</span>\n\f   involved in Mukesh Singh (supra) was completely different from the\n\n   one before us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">   WHETHER AN OFFICER DESIGNATED UNDER SECTION 53 OF\n   THE NDPS ACT CAN BE SAID TO BE A POLICE OFFICER\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_157\">86.

The case law on the subject of who would constitute a “police officer” for\n\n   the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_790\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act begins with the judgment\n\n   of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1090657/\" id=\"a_791\">Barkat Ram</a> (supra). In this judgment, by a 2:1 majority,\n\n   this Court held that a Customs Officer under the Land Customs Act,\n\n   1924 is not a “police officer” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_792\">section 25</a> of the\n\n   Evidence Act. The majority judgment of Raghubar Dayal, J. first set out\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/545058/\" id=\"a_793\">section 9</a> of the Land Customs Act as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">         ““The provisions of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 (VIII of\n         1878), which are specified in the Schedule, together with\n         all notifications, orders, rules or forms issued, made or\n         prescribed, thereunder, shall, so far as they are\n         applicable, apply for the purpose of the levy of duties of\n         land customs under this Act in like manner as they apply\n         for the purpose of the levy of duties of customs on goods\n         imported or exported by sea.”\n\n         Among the sections of the Sea Customs Act made\n         applicable by sub-s.

The Court then examined the <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_795\">Police Act, 1861</a>, and found:\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                                                          100</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">\f“<a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_796\">The Police Act, 1861</a> (Act 5 of 1861), is described as an\nAct for the regulation of police, and is thus an Act for the\nregulation of that group of officers who come within the\nword ‘police’ whatever meaning be given to that word. The\npreamble of the Act further says: ‘whereas it is expedient\nto re-organise the police and to make it a more efficient\ninstrument for the prevention and detection of crime, it is\nenacted as follows’. This indicates that the police is the\ninstrument for the prevention and detection of crime which\ncan be said to be the main object and purpose of having\nthe police. <a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_797\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_798\">25</a> lay down the duties of the\npolice officers and <a href=\"/doc/919170/\" id=\"a_799\">Section 20</a> deals with the authority they\ncan exercise. They can exercise such authority as is\nprovided for a police officer under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_800\">Police Act</a> and any\nAct for regulating criminal procedure. The authority given\nto police officers must naturally be to enable them to\ndischarge their duties efficiently. Of the various duties\nmentioned in<a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_801\"> s. 23</a>, the more important duties are to\ncollect and communicate intelligence affecting the public\npeace, to prevent the commission of offences and public\nnuisances and to detect and bring offenders to justice and\nto apprehend all persons whom the police officer is legally\nauthorised to apprehend. It is clear, therefore, in view of\nthe nature of the duties imposed on the police officers, the\nnature of the authority conferred and the purpose of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_802\">Police Act</a>, that the powers which the police officers enjoy\nare powers for the effective prevention and detection of\ncrime in order to maintain law and order.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">The powers of Customs Officers are really not for such\npurpose. Their powers are for the purpose of checking the\nsmuggling of goods and the due realisation of customs\nduties and to determine the action to be taken in the\ninterests of the revenues of the country by way of\nconfiscation of goods on which no duty had been paid and\nby imposing penalties and fines.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">Reference to<a href=\"/doc/545058/\" id=\"a_803\"> s.9(1)</a> of the Land Customs Act may be\nusefully made at this stage. It is according to the\nprovisions of this sub-section that the provisions of the\nSea Customs Act and the orders, Rules etc. prescribed\nthereunder, apply for the purpose of levy of duties of land\ncustoms under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_804\">Land Customs Act</a> in like manner as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                                                               101</span>\n\f        they apply for the purpose of levy of duties of customs on\n        goods imported or exported by sea. This makes it clear\n        that the provisions conferring various powers on the Sea\n        Customs Officers are for the purpose of levying and\n        realisation of duties of customs on goods and that those\n        powers are conferred on the Land Customs Officers also\n        for the same purpose. Apart from such an expression in\n        <a href=\"/doc/545058/\" id=\"a_805\">Section 9(1)</a> of the Land Customs Act, there are good\n        reasons in support of the view that the powers conferred\n        on the Customs Officers are different in character from\n        those of the police officers for the detection and\n        prevention of crime and that the powers conferred on\n        them are merely for the purpose of ensuring that dutiable\n        goods do not enter the country without payment of duty\n        and that articles whose entry is prohibited are not brought\n        in. It is with respect to the detecting and preventing of the\n        smuggling of goods and preventing loss to the Central\n        Revenues that Customs Officers have been given the\n        power to search the property and person and to detain\n        them and to summon persons to give evidence in an\n        enquiry with respect to the smuggling of goods.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">        The preamble of the Sea Customs Act says: “Whereas it\n        is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to\n        the levy of Sea Customs-duties”. Practically, all the\n        provisions of the Act are enacted to achieve this object.”\n                                                  (pages 343-344)\n\n        “The Customs Officer, therefore, is not primarily\n        concerned with the detection and punishment of crime\n        committed by a person, but is mainly interested in the\n        detection and prevention of smuggling of goods and\n        safeguarding the recovery of customs duties. He is more\n        concerned with the goods and customs duty, than with the\n        offender.”\n                                                     (page 345)\n                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">89.

The salutary principle underlying\n         the section would apply equally to other officers, by\n         whatever designation they may be known, who have the\n         power and duty to detect and investigate into crimes and\n         is for that purpose in a position to extract confessions\n         from the accused.”\n                                                         (at page 357)\n\n         “It is not the garb under which they function that matters,\n         but the nature of the power they exercise or the character\n         of the function they perform is decisive.

After referring to various High Court judgments which contained the\n\n   “broad view” – i.e. Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which would include\n\n   all three classes of police officers referred to, as against the “narrow\n\n   view” of the Patna High Court, where only a person who is designated\n\n   as a police officer under the <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_832\">Police Act, 1861</a> was accepted to be a\n\n   police officer under <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_833\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, Subba Rao, J., then\n\n   finally concluded that, given the functional test and the object of <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_834\">section\n\n   25</a>, a customs officer would be a “police officer” properly so called.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                                                                           106</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">\f96. (1) The majority view in this judgment first emphasised the point that the\n\n   Land Customs Act, 1924 and the Sea Customs Act, 1878 were statutes\n\n   primarily concerned with the levy of duties of customs, and ancillary to\n\n   this duty, officers designated in those Acts are given certain powers to\n\n   check smuggling of goods for due realisation of customs duties. In a\n\n   significant sentence, the Court, therefore, stated that a customs officer\n\n   is more concerned with the goods and customs duty than with the\n\n   offender. (2) The persons who are not enrolled as “police” under the\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_835\">Police Act, 1861</a>, would be included as “police” under the inclusive\n\n   definition contained in that Act, leading to the acceptance of the “broad\n\n   view” and rejection of the “narrow view” of       the meaning of “police\n\n   officer”. (3) The protection of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_836\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act is very\n\n   wide, and applies to a confession made to any member of the police\n\n   whatever his rank, and at whatever time it is made, whether before or\n\n   after being accused of an offence. (4) That the powers of search,\n\n   seizure, etc. that are conferred under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_837\">Land Customs Act</a> are of a\n\n   limited character, for the limited object of safeguarding the revenues of\n\n   the State. (5) That section 171A of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 which\n\n   empowers the customs officer to summon a person to give evidence, or\n\n   produce a document in an enquiry which he makes, is a judicial enquiry\n\n   – as a result, a customs officer can never be said to be a police officer\n\n   as a police officer never acts judicially.

Sub-section (1)\nof <a href=\"/doc/217159/\" id=\"a_851\">Section 77</a> empowers the Collector of Excise to\ninvestigate without the order of a Magistrate any offence\npunishable under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_852\">Excise Act</a> committed within the\nlimits of his jurisdiction. Sub-section (2) of that section\nprovides that any other Excise Officer specially\nempowered behalf in this by the State Government in\nrespect of all or any specified class of offences punishable\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_853\">Excise Act</a> may, without the order of a\nMagistrate, investigate any such offence which a court\nhaving jurisdiction within the local area to which such\nofficer is appointed would have power to enquire into or\ntry under the aforesaid provisions. By virtue of these\nprovisions the Lieutenant Governor of Bihar and Orissa by\nNotification 470-F dated 15-1-1919 has specially\nempowered Inspectors of Excise and Sub-Inspectors of\nExcise to investigate any offence punishable under the\nAct. It is not disputed before us that this notification is still\nin force. By virtue of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_854\">Section 92</a> the Act it\nshall have effect as if enacted in the Act. It would thus\nfollow that an Excise Inspector or Sub-Inspector in the\nState of Bihar shall be deemed to be an officer in charge\nof a police station with respect to the area to which he is\nappointed and is in that capacity entitled to investigate\nany offence under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_855\">Excise Act</a> within that area without\nthe order of Magistrate. Thus he can exercise all the\npowers which an officer in charge of a police station can\nexercise under Chapter XIV of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_856\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>. He can investigate into offences, record\nstatements of the persons questioned by him, make\nsearches, seize any articles connected with an offence\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_857\">Excise Act</a>, arrest an accused person, grant him\nbail, send him up for trial before a Magistrate, file a\ncharge-sheet and so on. Thus his position in so far as\noffences under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_858\">Excise Act</a> committed within the area\nto which his appointment extends are concerned is no\ndifferent from that of an officer in charge of a police\nstation. As regards these offences not only is he charged\nwith the duty of preventing their commission but also with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                                                    109</span>\n\ftheir detection and is for these purposes empowered to\nact in all respects as an officer in charge of a police\nstation. No doubt unlike an officer in charge of a police\nstation he is not charged with the duty of the maintenance\nof law and order nor can he exercise the powers of such\nofficer with respect to offences under the general law or\nunder any other special laws. But all the same, in so far\nas offences under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_859\">Excise Act</a> are concerned, there is\nno distinction whatsoever in the nature of the powers he\nexercises and those which a police officer exercises in\nrelation to offences which it is his duty to prevent and\nbring to light. It would be logical, therefore, to hold that a\nconfession recorded by him during an investigation into an\nexcise offence cannot reasonably be regarded as\nanything different from a confession to a police officer.\nFor, in conducting the investigation he exercises the\npowers of a police officer and the act itself deems him to\nbe a police officer, even though he does not belong to the\npolice force constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_860\">Police Act</a>. It has been\nheld by this court that the expression “police officer” in\n<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_861\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act is not confined to persons\nwho are members of the regularly constituted police force.\nThe position of an Excise Officer empowered under\n<a href=\"/doc/20197784/\" id=\"a_862\">Section 77(2)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act is not\nanalogous to that of a Customs Officer for two reasons.\nOne is that the Excise Officer, does not exercise any\njudicial powers just as the Customs Officer does under the\nSea Customs Act, 1878. Secondly, the Customs Officer is\nnot deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station\nand therefore can exercise no powers under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_863\">Code of\nCriminal Procedure</a> and certainly not those of an officer in\ncharge of a police station. No doubt, he too has the power\nto make a search, to seize articles suspected to have\nbeen smuggled and arrest persons suspected of having\ncommitted an offence under the Sea Customs Act. But\nthat is all. Though he can make an enquiry, he has no\npower to investigate into an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1291024/\" id=\"a_864\">Section 156</a> of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.

In regard to certain matters, he does not\npossess powers even analogous to those of a Police\nOfficer. Thus he is not entitled to submit a report to a\nMagistrate under <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_866\">Section 190</a> of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure with a view that cognizance of the offence be\ntaken by the Magistrate. Section 187(A) of the Sea\nCustoms Act specially provides that cognizance of an\noffence under the Sea Customs Act can be taken only\nupon a complaint in writing made by the Customs Officers\nor other officer of the customs not below the rank of an\nAssistant Collector of Customs authorised in this behalf by\nthe Chief Customs Officer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">It may well be that a statute confers powers and impose\nduties on a public servant, some of which are analogous\nto those of a police officer. But by reason of the nature of\nother duties which he is required to perform he may be\nexercising various other powers also. It is argued on\nbehalf of the State that where such is the case the mere\nconferral of some only of the powers of a police officer on\nsuch a person would not make him a police officer and,\ntherefore, what must be borne in mind is the sum total of\nthe powers which he enjoys by virtue of his office as also\nthe dominant purpose for which he is appointed. The\ncontention thus is that when an officer has to perform a\nwide range of duties and exercise correspondingly a wide\nrange of powers, the mere fact that some of the powers\nwhich the statute confers upon him are analogous to or\neven identical with those of a police officer would not\nmake him a police officer and, therefore, if such an officer\nrecords a confession it would not be hit by <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_867\">Section 25</a> of\nthe Evidence Act. In our judgment what is pertinent to\nbear in mind for the purpose of determining as to who can\nbe regarded a “police officer” for the purpose of this\nprovision is not the totality of the powers which an officer\nenjoys but the kind of powers which the law enables him\nto exercise. The test for determining whether such a\nperson is a “police officer” for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_868\">Section 25</a> of\nthe Evidence Act would, in our judgment, be whether the\npowers of a police officer which are conferred on him or\nwhich are exercisable by him because he is deemed to be\nan officer in charge of police station establish a direct or\nsubstantial relationship with the prohibition enacted by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                                                111</span>\n\f          <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_869\">Section 25</a>, that is, the recording of a confession. In our\n          words, the test would be whether the powers are such as\n          would to facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession\n          from a suspect or delinquent. If they do, then it is\n          unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for which\n          he is appointed or the question as to what other powers\n          he enjoys. These questions may perhaps be relevant for\n          consideration where the powers of the police officer\n          conferred upon him are of a very limited character and are\n          not by themselves sufficient to facilitate the obtaining by\n          him of a confession.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">                                                   (at pages 762-766)\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\"> 99.

A police officer for\n         purposes of clause (b) above can in our opinion only be a\n         police officer properly so-called as the scheme of the\n         <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_905\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> shows and it seems therefore\n         that a Central Excise Officer will have to make a complaint\n         under clause (a) above if he wants the Magistrate to take\n         cognizance of an offence, for example, under <a href=\"/doc/775154/\" id=\"a_906\">Section 9</a> of\n         the Act. Thus though under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_907\">Section 21</a>\n         the Central Excise Officer under the Act has the powers of\n         an officer in charge of a police station when investigating\n         a cognizable case, that is for the purpose of his inquiry\n         under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_908\">Section 21</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_909\">Section 21</a> is in terms\n         different from <a href=\"/doc/170328401/\" id=\"a_910\">Section 78(3)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa\n         Excise Act, 1915 which came to be considered in Raja\n         Ram Jaiswal’s case [(1964) 2 SCR 752] and which\n         provided in terms that “for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1291024/\" id=\"a_911\">Section 156</a> of\n         the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the area to which\n         an excise officer empowered under <a href=\"/doc/217159/\" id=\"a_912\">Section 77</a>, sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">         section (2), is appointed shall be deemed to be a police-\n         station, and such officer shall be deemed to be the officer\n         in charge of such station”. It cannot therefore be said that\n         the provision in <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_913\">Section 21</a> is on par with the provision in\n         <a href=\"/doc/170328401/\" id=\"a_914\">Section 78(3)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act. All that\n         <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_915\">Section 21</a> provides is that for the purpose of his enquiry,\n         a Central Excise Officer shall have the powers of an\n         officer in charge of a police station when investigating a\n         cognizable case.

The judgment then went\n\n    on to state:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">          “20… <a href=\"/doc/1294540/\" id=\"a_1046\">Section 52</a> deals with the disposal of persons\n          arrested and articles seized under <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_1047\">Sections 41</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_1048\">42</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_1049\">43</a> or\n          44 of the Act.

Then comes <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1056\">Section 53</a> which\n         we have extracted earlier. <a href=\"/doc/1363838/\" id=\"a_1057\">Section 55</a> requires an officer-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_201\">         in-charge of a police station to take charge of and keep in\n         safe custody, pending the orders of the Magistrate, all\n         articles seized under the Act within the local area of that\n         police station and which may be delivered to him. <a href=\"/doc/669884/\" id=\"a_1058\">Section\n         57</a> enjoins upon any officer making an arrest or effecting\n         seizure under the Act to make a full report of all the\n         particulars of such arrest or seizure to his immediate\n         official superior within 48 hours next after such arrest or\n         seizure. These provisions found in <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1059\">Chapter V of the Act</a>\n         show that there is nothing in the Act to indicate that all the\n         powers under Chapter XII of the Code, including the\n         power to file a report under Section 173 of the Code have\n         been expressly conferred on officers who are invested\n         with the powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1060\">Section 53</a>, for the purpose of investigation of\n         offences under the Act.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_202\">131.After referring to <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_1061\">sections 41</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_1062\">42</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_1063\">43</a>, <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1064\">44</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1294540/\" id=\"a_1065\">52</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1304888/\" id=\"a_1066\">52A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/669884/\" id=\"a_1067\">57</a> of the NDPS\n\n    Act, the Court concluded that these powers are more or less similar to\n\n    the powers conferred on customs officers under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1068\">Customs Act, 1962</a>\n\n    – see paragraph 21. The Court then concluded:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">         22…The investigation which so commences must be\n         concluded, without unnecessary delay, by the submission\n         of a report under Section 173 of the Code to the\n         concerned Magistrate in the prescribed form. Any person\n         on whom power to investigate under Chapter XII is\n         conferred can be said to be a ‘police officer’, no matter by\n         what name he is called. The nomenclature is not\n         important, the content of the power he exercises is the\n         determinative factor. The important attribute of police\n         power is not only the power to investigate into the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_276\">                                                                          135</span>\n\fcommission of cognizable offence but also the power to\nprosecute the offender by filing a report or a charge-sheet\nunder Section 173 of the Code. That is why this Court has\nsince the decision in Badku Joti Savant accepted the ratio\nthat unless an officer is invested under any special law\nwith the powers of investigation under the Code, including\nthe power to submit a report under Section 173, he cannot\nbe described to be a ‘police officer’ under <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1069\">Section 25</a>,\nEvidence Act. Counsel for the appellants, however argued\nthat since the Act does not prescribe the procedure for\ninvestigation, the officers invested with power under\n<a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1070\">Section 53</a> of the Act must necessarily resort to the\nprocedure under Chapter XII of the Code which would\nrequire them to culminate the investigation by submitting a\nreport under Section 173 of the Code. Attractive though\nthe submission appears at first blush, it cannot stand\nclose scrutiny. In the first place as pointed out earlier there\nis nothing in the provisions of the Act to show that the\nlegislature desired to vest in the officers appointed under\n<a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1071\">Section 53</a> of the Act, all the powers of Chapter XII,\nincluding the power to submit a report under Section 173\nof the Code. But the issue is placed beyond the pale of\ndoubt by sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1712009/\" id=\"a_1072\">Section 36-A</a> of the Act which\nbegins with a non-obstante clause — notwithstanding\nanything contained in the Code — and proceeds to say in\nclause (d) as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">“36-A. (d) a Special Court may, upon a perusal of police\nreport of the facts constituting an offence under this Act or\nupon a complaint made by an officer of the Central\nGovernment or a State Government authorised in this\nbehalf, take cognizance of that offence without the\naccused being committed to it for trial.”\n\nThis clause makes it clear that if the investigation is\nconducted by the police, it would conclude in a police\nreport but if the investigation is made by an officer of any\nother department including the DRI, the Special Court\nwould take cognizance of the offence upon a formal\ncomplaint made by such authorised officer of the\nconcerned government. Needless to say that such a\ncomplaint would have to be under Section 190 of the\nCode. This clause, in our view, clinches the matter. We\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">                                                                  136</span>\n\f          must, therefore, negative the contention that an officer\n          appointed under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1073\">Section 53</a> of the Act, other than a police\n          officer, is entitled to exercise ‘all’ the powers under\n          Chapter XII of the Code, including the power to submit a\n          report or charge-sheet under Section 173 of the Code.\n          That being so, the case does not satisfy the ratio\n          of Badku Joti Savant and subsequent decisions referred\n          to earlier.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_203\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_278\">132.Despite the fact that <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_1074\">Raj Kumar Karwal</a> (supra) notices the fact that the\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1075\">NDPS Act</a> prescribes offences which are “very severe” and that <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_1076\">section\n\n    25</a> is a wholesome protection which must be understood in a broad and\n\n    popular sense, yet it arrives at a conclusion that the designated officer\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1077\">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be said to be a police officer\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1078\">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.

This is unlike the revenue\n\nstatutes where the main object was the due realisation of customs\n\nduties and the consequent ancillary checking of smuggling of goods (as\n\nin the Land Customs Act, 1924, the Sea Customs Act, 1878 and the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1085\">Customs Act, 1962</a>); the levy and collection of excise duties (as in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_1086\">Central Excise Act, 1944</a>); or as in the <a href=\"/doc/38107498/\" id=\"a_1087\">Railway Property (Unlawful\n\nPossession Act</a>), 1966, the better protection and security of Railway\n\nproperty.

Thirdly, <a href=\"/doc/731740/\" id=\"a_1151\">section 190(1)(c)</a> of the CrPC is\n\nconspicuous by its absence in <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1152\">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act – the\n\nSpecial Court cannot, upon information received from any person other\n\nthan a police officer, or upon its own knowledge, take cognizance of an\n\noffence under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1153\">NDPS Act</a>.

If, for example, an accused is tried for an\n\n    offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/186683/\" id=\"a_1192\">section 26</a> of the NDPS Act, he may be tried\n\n    by a Magistrate and not the Special Court. This being the case, the\n\n    special procedure provided in <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1193\">section 36A(1)(d)</a> would not apply, the\n\n    result being that the <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1194\">section 53</a> officer who investigates this offence, will\n\n    then deliver a police report to the Magistrate under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_1195\">section 173</a> of the\n\n    CrPC. Absent any provision in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1196\">NDPS Act</a> truncating the powers of\n\n    investigation for prevention and detection of crimes under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1197\">NDPS\n\n    Act</a>, it is clear that an offence which is punishable for three years and\n\n    less can be investigated by officers designated under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1198\">section 53</a>,\n\n    leading to the filing of a police report. However, in view of <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_1199\">Raj Kumar\n\n    Karwal</a> (supra), a <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1200\">section 53</a> officer investigating an offence under the\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1201\">NDPS Act</a> can end up only by filing a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1202\">section 36A(1)(d)</a>\n\n    of the NDPS Act. Shri Lekhi’s only answer to this anomaly is that under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/67836473/\" id=\"a_1203\">section 36A(5)</a> of the NDPS Act, such trials will follow a summary\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">                                                                             148</span>\n\f    procedure, which, in turn, will relate to a complaint where investigation\n\n    is undertaken by a narcotics officer. First and foremost, trial procedure\n\n    is post-investigation, and has nothing to do with the manner of\n\n    investigation or cognizance, as was submitted by Shri Lekhi himself.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1030147\" id=\"span_305\">Secondly, even assuming that the mode of trial has some relevance to\n\n    this anomaly, <a href=\"/doc/729109/\" id=\"a_1204\">section 258</a> of the CrPC makes it clear that a summons\n\n    case can be instituted “otherwise than upon complaint”, which would\n\n    obviously refer to a summons case being instituted on a police report –\n\n    see <a href=\"/doc/1030147/\" id=\"a_1205\">John Thomas v. Dr. K. Jagadeesan</a> (2001) 6 SCC 30 (at\n\n    paragraph 8).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_216\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1097490\" id=\"span_306\">143.<a href=\"/doc/1573215/\" id=\"a_1206\">Section 59</a> of the NDPS Act is an important pointer to when cognizance\n\n    of an offence can take place only on a complaint, and not by way of a\n\n    police report. By <a href=\"/doc/809276/\" id=\"a_1207\">section 59(3)</a>, both in the case of an offence under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1608599/\" id=\"a_1208\">section 59(1)</a> [which is punishable for a term which may extend to one\n\n    year] or in the case of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/159973858/\" id=\"a_1209\">section 59(2)</a> [which is\n\n    punishable for a term which shall not be less than 10 years, but which\n\n    may extend to 20 years], no Court shall take cognizance of any offence\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1608599/\" id=\"a_1210\">section 59(1)</a> or (2), except on a complaint in writing made with\n\n    the previous sanction of the Central Government, or, as the case may\n\n    be, the State Government. Thus, under <a href=\"/doc/1573215/\" id=\"a_1211\">section 59</a>, in either case i.e. in\n\n    a case where the trial takes place by a Magistrate for an offence under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1608599/\" id=\"a_1212\">section 59(1)</a>, or by the Special Court for an offence under section\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">                                                                         149</span>\n\f    <a href=\"/doc/159973858/\" id=\"a_1213\">59(2)</a>, cognizance cannot be taken either by the Magistrate or the\n\n    Special Court, except on a complaint in writing. This provision is in\n\n    terms markedly different from <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1214\">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, which provides two\n\n    separate procedures for taking cognizance of offences made out under\n\n    the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1215\">NDPS Act</a>. For all these reasons, it is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1097490/\" id=\"a_1216\">Raj Kumar Karwal</a>\n\n    (supra) cannot possibly have laid down the law correctly.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_217\">144.At this juncture, it is important to state that we do not accept the\n\n    submission of Shri S.K. Jain that the “complaint” referred to in <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1217\">section\n\n    36A(1)(d)</a> refers only to <a href=\"/doc/1573215/\" id=\"a_1218\">section 59</a> of the NDPS Act. A complaint can be\n\n    made by a designated officer qua offences which arise under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1219\">NDPS\n\n    Act</a> – it is not circumscribed by a provision which requires previous\n\n    sanction for an offence committed under <a href=\"/doc/233696/\" id=\"a_1220\">section 58</a>, as that would do\n\n    violence to the plain language of <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1221\">section 36A(1)(d)</a>. This argument is,\n\n    therefore, rejected.   It is always open, therefore, to the designated\n\n    officer, designated this time for the purpose of filing a complaint under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/26119/\" id=\"a_1222\">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, to do so before the Special Court, which is a\n\n    separate procedure provided for under the special statute, in addition to\n\n    the procedure to be followed under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1223\">section 53</a>, as delineated\n\n    hereinabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_218\">145.Shri Lekhi, however, argued that <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1224\">section 53</a> does not use the\n\n    expression “deemed” and that therefore, the power contained in <a href=\"/doc/23637/\" id=\"a_1225\">section\n\n    53(1)</a> is only a truncated power to investigate which does not culminate\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">                                                                         150</span>\n\f    in a police report being filed. We cannot agree. The officer who is\n\n    designated under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1226\">section 53</a> can, by a legal fiction, be deemed to be an\n\n    officer in charge of a police station, or can be given the powers of an\n\n    officer in charge of a police station to investigate the offences under the\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1227\">NDPS Act</a>. Whether he is deemed as an officer in charge of a police\n\n    station, or given such powers, are only different sides of the same coin\n\n    – the aforesaid officer is not, in either circumstance, a police officer who\n\n    belongs to the police force of the State. To concede that a deeming\n\n    fiction would give full powers of investigation, including the filing of a\n\n    final report, to the designated officer, as against the powers of an officer\n\n    in charge of a police station being given to a designated officer having\n\n    only limited powers to investigate, does not stand to reason, and would\n\n    be contrary to the express language and intendment of <a href=\"/doc/23637/\" id=\"a_1228\">section 53(1)</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1409644\" id=\"span_309\">146.Another argument of Shri Lekhi is that police officers or policemen who\n\n    belong to the police force are recognised in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1229\">NDPS Act</a> as being\n\n    separate and distinct from the officers of the Department of Narcotics,\n\n    etc. This argument has no legs on which to stand when it is clear that\n\n    the expression “police officers” does not only mean a police officer who\n\n    belongs to the State police force, but includes officers who may belong\n\n    to other departments, such as the Department of Excise in <a href=\"/doc/1409644/\" id=\"a_1230\">Raja Ram\n\n    Jaiswal</a> (supra), who are otherwise invested with all powers of\n\n    investigation so as to attract the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_1231\">section 25</a> of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">                                                                            151</span>\n\f   <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_1232\">Evidence Act</a>. Further, if the distinction between police officer as\n\n   narrowly defined and the officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau is\n\n   something that is to be stressed, then any interpretation which would\n\n   whittle down the fundamental rights of an accused based solely on the\n\n   designation of a particular officer, would fall foul of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1233\">Article 14</a>, as the\n\n   classification between the two types of officers would have no rational\n\n   relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question,\n\n   which is the prevention and detection of crime.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">147.What remains to be considered is Kanhaiyalal (supra). In this\n\n   judgment, the question revolved around a conviction on the basis of a\n\n   confessional statement made under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_1234\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act. This\n\n   Court, after setting out <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_1235\">section 67</a>, then drew a parallel between the\n\n   provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_1236\">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act and <a href=\"/doc/1347936/\" id=\"a_1237\">sections 107</a> and <a href=\"/doc/877314/\" id=\"a_1238\">108</a> of\n\n   the Customs Act, 1962, <a href=\"/doc/978947/\" id=\"a_1239\">section 32</a> of the Prevention of Terrorism Act,\n\n   2002 (“POTA”) and <a href=\"/doc/1046310/\" id=\"a_1240\">section 15</a> of the TADA – see paragraph 41.

As already noticed, POTA has absorbed into it the\n         guidelines spelt out in Kartar Singh and D.K. Basu in\n         order to impart an element of fairness and\n         reasonableness into the stringent provisions of POTA in\n         tune with the philosophy of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1272\">Article 21</a> and allied\n         constitutional provisions. These salutary safeguards are\n         contained in <a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1273\">Sections 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1294540/\" id=\"a_1274\">52</a> of POTA. The\n         peremptory prescriptions embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1275\">Section 32</a> of POTA\n         are:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_280\">         (a) The police officer shall warn the accused that he is not\n         bound to make the confession and if he does so, it may\n         be used against him [vide sub-section (2)].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_281\">         (b) The confession shall be recorded in an atmosphere\n         free from threat or inducement and shall be in the same\n         language in which the person makes it [vide sub-section\n         (3)].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_282\">         (c) The person from whom a confession has been\n         recorded under sub-section (1) shall be produced before\n         the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or Chief Judicial\n         Magistrate along with the original statement of confession,\n         within forty-eight hours [vide sub-section (4)].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_283\">         (d) The CMM/CJM shall record the statement, if any,\n         made by the person so produced and get his signature\n         and if there is any complaint of torture, such person shall\n         be directed to be produced for medical examination.

Almost similar prescriptions were there under TADA\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">                                                                        158</span>\n\falso. In fact, the fulfilment of such mandate is inherent in\nthe process of recording a confession by a statutory\nauthority. What is necessarily implicit is, perhaps, made\nexplicit. But the notable safeguards which were lacking in\nTADA are to be found in sub-sections (4) and (5).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_233\">157. The lofty purpose behind the mandate that the maker\nof the confession shall be sent to judicial custody by the\nCJM before whom he is produced is to provide an\natmosphere in which he would feel free to make a\ncomplaint against the police, if he so wishes. The feeling\nthat he will be free from the shackles of police custody\nafter production in court will minimise, if not remove, the\nfear psychosis by which he may be gripped. The various\nsafeguards enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1276\">Section 32</a> are meant to be\nstrictly observed as they relate to personal liberty of an\nindividual. However, we add a caveat here. The strict\nenforcement of the provision as to judicial remand and the\ninvalidation of the confession merely on the ground of its\nnon-compliance may present some practical difficulties at\ntimes. Situations may arise that even after the confession\nis made by a person in custody, police custody may still\nbe required for the purpose of further investigation.\nSending a person to judicial custody at that stage may\nretard the investigation. Sometimes, the further steps to\nbe taken by the investigator with the help of the accused\nmay brook no delay. An attempt shall however be made to\nharmonise this provision in <a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1277\">Section 32(5)</a> with the powers\nof investigation available to the police. At the same time, it\nneeds to be emphasised that the obligation to send the\nconfession maker to judicial custody cannot be lightly\ndisregarded. Police custody cannot be given on the mere\nasking by the police. It shall be remembered that sending\na person who has made the confession to judicial custody\nafter he is produced before the CJM is the normal rule\nand this procedural safeguard should be given its due\nprimacy. The CJM should be satisfied that it is absolutely\nnecessary that the confession maker shall be restored to\npolice custody for any special reason. Such a course of\nsending him back to police custody could only be done in\nexceptional cases after due application of mind. Most\noften, sending such person to judicial custody in\ncompliance with <a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1278\">Section 32(5)</a> soon after the proceedings\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">                                                                 159</span>\n\fare recorded by the CJM subject to the consideration of\nthe application by the police after a few days may not\nmake material difference to the further investigation. The\nCJM has a duty to consider whether the application is only\na ruse to get back the person concerned to police custody\nin case he disputes the confession or it is an application\nmade bona fide in view of the need and urgency involved.\nWe are therefore of the view that the non-compliance with\nthe judicial custody requirement does not per se vitiate the\nconfession, though its non-compliance should be one of\nthe important factors that must be borne in mind in testing\nthe confession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_234\">158. These provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1279\">Section 32</a>, which are conceived\nin the interest of the accused, will go a long way to screen\nand exclude confessions, which appear to be involuntary.\nThe requirements and safeguards <a href=\"/doc/1769219/\" id=\"a_1280\">laid down in</a> sub-\nsections (2) to (5) are an integral part of the scheme\nproviding for admissibility of confession made to the police\nofficer. The breach of any one of these requirements\nwould have a vital bearing on the admissibility and\nevidentiary value of the confession recorded under\n<a href=\"/doc/1434671/\" id=\"a_1281\">Section 32(1)</a> and may even inflict a fatal blow on such\nconfession.

The illicit production, distribution, sale and consumption of\n\ndrugs and psychotropic substances, is a crime of multi-dimensional\n\nmagnitude, that imposes a staggering burden on the society. In an\n\nArticle “Narcotic Aggression and Operation Counter Attack” published\n\nin the Mainstream dated March 7, 1992, V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. said:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_294\">     “Religion is opium of the people, but today opium is the religion of the\n     people, and like God, is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Alas!\n     Opium makes you slowly ill and eventually kills, makes you a new\n     criminal to rob and buy the stuff, tempts you to smuggle at risk to\n     become rich quick, makes you invisible trafficker of psychotropic\n     substances and operator of a parallel international illicit currency and\n     sub rosa evangelist mafia culture.

What noxious\n     menace is this most inescapable evil that benumbs the soul of student,\n     teacher, doctor, politician, artists and professional, and corrupts\n     innocent millions of youth and promising intellectuals everywhere.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">3.     In the words of Krishna Iyer, J., “the global scenario in its\n\nsombre macabre, devouring delinquency, is dominated by drug abuse\n\nand narcotic trade. Trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances\n\nis not any local or regional crime confined only to India and third-\n\nworld countries, but is a worldwide phenomenon.                 All nations\n\nincluding India, had huge drug abuse as a threat to the survival of\n\nhuman beings.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_246\">4.     Illicit   drug   trafficking   is   an   organised   crime,    highly\n\nsophisticated and complex. This illicit traffic, cleverly carried out by\n\nhardened criminals with dexterity and skill, not only violates national\n\ndrug laws and international conventions,          but also involves many\n\nother criminal activities, including racketeering, conspiracy, bribery\n\nand corruption of public officials, tax evasion, banking law violations,\n\nillegal money transfers, import/export violations, crimes of violence\n\nand terrorism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_247\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">5.     Narcotics are often supplied for money and also in exchange\n\nfor weapons. There are numerous drug trafficking mafia yielding,\n\nimmense power in various regions of the world, including India. The\n\nfar-reaching consequences of illicit drug trade, even threatens the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_341\">                                                                         166</span>\n\fintegrity and stability of governments and renders law enforcement\n\naction vulnerable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_250\">6.     Considering the huge profits derived by drug barons from\n\nrampant consumption of opium and other narcotic drugs, tycoons of\n\nthe drug cartels, who have international links, go to any extent, to\n\nexploit and manipulate      unhealthy economic conditions, as well as\n\ncorruption and weaknesses in the administration, to push drugs into\n\nthe society, in complete disregard of the health, morality and well-\n\nbeing of the people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\">7.     India has been directly engulfed in drug trafficking by virtue of\n\nits geographical location, flanked on three sides by illicit narcotic drug\n\nproduction regions. To the West lies the Golden Crescent, comprising\n\nIran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which illegally produce a huge volume\n\nof opium, converted into heroin in illicit factories.     In the East, the\n\nGolden Triangle is made up of Burma, Thailand and Laos, which\n\nproduce thousands of tons of opium, cultivated over thousands of\n\nhectares of land. The third flank is along the 1,568 km border with\n\nNepal in the North. The Himalayan foot hills and the Terrai regions of\n\nNepal produce inter alia ‘cannabis restin’.     The long land border with\n\nPakistan and a network of airports and seaports linking India to other\n\ncountries has facilitated illegal trafficking in drugs.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_342\">                                                                       167</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">\f8.       India is not only a transit point for the export of narcotic drugs\n\nfrom the regions surrounding it, to Western and other countries.\n\nIndia also provides a lucrative market for narcotic drugs and\n\npsychotropic substances. That apart, there is widespread illicit\n\ncultivation of plants yielding narcotic drugs, like opium and ganja in\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_255\">9.       Illicit drugs from the Golden Crescent, the Golden Triangle, as\n\nwell as from Nepal and China, are smuggled into India for\n\nconsumption and sale and also onward transmission to other\n\ncountries. Illicit drugs find their way, inter alia, into metropolitan\n\ncities of India like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru etc. The amount of illicit\n\nnarcotic drugs that are seized in India by law enforcement\n\nauthorities, only constitute the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_256\">10.      The menace of illicit, manufacture and sale of narcotic drugs\n\nand psychotropic substances has been of international concern. As\n\nearly as in July 1906, Reverend Brent wrote a letter to President\n\nRoosevelt expressing his anxiety over the increasing illicit traffic in\n\nopium and the necessity of curbing the same. That was followed by a\n\nseries of meetings amongst various nations of the world, at regular\n\nintervals, leading to the enactment of several Drug Laws in those\n\nnations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">                                                                       168</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_258\">\f11.    An International Convention was held at Hague in 1912, to\n\ninter alia regulate the preparation and sale of raw and prepared\n\nopium and other derivatives like Morphine and Cocaine etc.\n\nHowever, the enforcement of the said Convention was kept in\n\nabeyance for nearly six years, presumably due to the first World War,\n\nand came into force in the middle of 1919.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_259\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_260\">12.

The Geneva Opium Agreement made elaborate\n\nrecommendations in respect, of the problems relating to intake and\n\nillicit traffic of opium. The next Convention was held at Geneva in\n\n1931 for limiting the manufacture as well as regulating the\n\ndistribution of Narcotic drugs. In 1936, another Convention for the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">                                                                  169</span>\n\fsuppression of illicit traffic in dangerous drugs was held in Geneva.\n\nThe Resolutions adopted in the convention came into force in 1939.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">14.

Again,\n\nthere was an International Conference on drug abuse and illicit\n\ntrafficking held in Vienna from June 17 to June 26, 1987.              The\n\nprincipal document prepared before the Conference by the United\n\nNations was a comprehensive multi-disciplinary plan of future\n\nactivities to control drug abuse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">19.

It may be pertinent to point out that, even before the\n\nenactment of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1930, there was statutory\n\ncontrol over Narcotic Drugs in India through enactments like the\n\nOpium Acts of 1857 and 1878.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_277\">23.    With the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and\n\ndrug abuse at the National and International level, many flaws were\n\nnoticed in the laws. It was realised that the provisions of the Acts\n\nwere not stringent enough to effectively control drug abuse and\n\nrelated crimes like preparation, transport, sale etc. of narcotic drugs\n\nand psychotropic substances.      The laws in existence were not a\n\ndeterrent to illicit business in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\n\nsubstances.

The Principal Central Acts,\n      namely, the Opium Act, 1857, the <a href=\"/doc/72261612/\" id=\"a_1317\">Opium Act, 1878</a> and the Dangerous\n      Drugs Act, 1930 were enacted a long time ago. With the passage of\n      time and the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and drug\n      abuse at national and international level many deficiencies in the\n      existing laws have come to notice, some of which are indicated below:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_303\">      (i) The scheme of penalties under the present Acts is not\n          sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge of well\n          organised gangs of smugglers. The Dangerous Drugs Act,\n          1930 provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of three\n          years with or without fine and four years imprisonment with or\n          without fine with repeat offences.

The spill over from such traffic has caused problems of abuse\n      and additction. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1371\">The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n      1985</a> provides deterrent punishments for drug trafficing offences. Even\n      though the major offences are non-bailable by virtue of the level of\n      punishments, on technical grounds, drug offenders were being released\n      on bail. In the light of certain difficulties faced in the enforcement of\n      the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1372\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985</a>, the need to\n      amend the law to further strengthen it, has been felt.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_317\">           (2) A Cabinet Sub-Committee, which was constituted for\n           combating drug traffic and preventing drug abuse, also made a\n           number of recommendations of the Cabinet Sub-Committee and\n           the working of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotoripc Substances\n           Act, in the last three years, it is proposed to amend the said Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_309\">                The amendments, inter alia, provide for the following :\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_318\">           (i) to constitute a National Fund for control of Drugs abuse to\n           meet the expenditure incurred in connection with the measures for\n           combating illicit traffic and preventing drug abuse;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">           (ii) to bring certain controlled substances, which are used for\n           manufacture of Narcotic drugs and Psychotropic Substances, under\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">                                                                                 182</span>\n\f         the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1373\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act</a> and\n         to provide deterrent punishment for violation thereof;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">         (iii) to provie that no sentence awarded under the Act shall be\n         suspended, remitted or commuted;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_321\">         (iv) to provide that no sentence awarded under the Act shall be\n         suspended, remitted or commuted;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_322\">         (iv) to provide for pre-trial disposal of seized drugs;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_323\">         (v) to provide death penalty on second conviction in respect of\n         specified quantities of certain drugs;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_324\">         (vi) to provide for forfeiture of property and detailed procedure\n         relating to the same; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_325\">         (vii) to provide that the offences shall be congnizable and non-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_310\">         bailable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_311\">\n         (3)    The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_312\">46.    <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1374\">The     NDPS      Act</a>   was    further    amended       by    the     <a href=\"/doc/1997854/\" id=\"a_1375\">NDPS\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2001</a>, to rationalize the sentence structure to\n\nensure that drug traffickers who traffic in significant quantities of\n\ndrugs are punished with deterrent sentences, but addicts and others\n\nwho commit less serious offences, are sentenced to less severe\n\npunishment.

Drug Trafficking and illicit use of Narcotic Drugs and\n      Psychotropic Substances.—The genesis and development of the\n      Indian drug trafficking scenario are closely connected with the strategic\n      and geographical location of India which has massive inflow of heroin\n      and hashish from across the Indo-Pak border originating from “Golden\n      Crescent” comprising of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan which is one of\n      the major illicit drug supplying areas of the world. On the North Eastern\n      side of the country is the “Gold Triangle” comprising of Burma, Loas and\n      Thailand which is again one of the largest sources of illicit opium in the\n      world. Nepal also is a traditional source of cannabis, both herbal and\n      resinous. Cannabis is also of wide growth in some states of India. As far\n      as illicit drug trafficking from and through India is concerned, these\n      three sources of supply have been instrumental in drug trafficking. Prior\n      to the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1380\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\n      Act, 1985</a>, the statutory control over narcotic drugs was exercised in\n      India through a number of Central and State enactments. The principal\n      Central Acts were (a) the Opium Act, 1857, (b) the Opium Act, 1878 and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_320\">      (c) the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_321\">50.

Even otherwise, the context in which the words\n\n     have been used is relevant, as a less careful draftsman may use\n\n     different words to convey the same meaning, in a hurriedly enacted\n\n     statute.     This   proposition   finds   support   from   <a href=\"/doc/1954949/\" id=\"a_1635\">Kanhaiyalal\n\n     Vishindas Gidwani v. Arun Dattatreya Mehta11</a>.

As per the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Eleventh Edition) the\n\nword investigate means ‘carry out a systematic or formal enquiry into an incident\n\nor allegation as to establish the truth’. Investigation, is the act of investigating.\n\nThe word “enquire” is, as per the same dictionary, to ask for information. It also\n\nmeans “investigate”. Enquiry is the act of asking for information.

The words “inquiry” and “investigation” have also been used\n\nin statutes such as the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_1647\">Central Excise Act</a> 1944, the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1648\">Customs Act</a>\n\n1962, the <a href=\"/doc/38107498/\" id=\"a_1649\">Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act</a> 1966, and the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1650\">Cr.P.C</a>.     which also prescribe a procedure for proceeding against\n\noffenders.       These statutes may be taken into consideration to\n\nconstrue the meaning of the expression “inquiry” in <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_1651\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act\nand the difference, if any, between the expression “inquiry” as used in <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_1652\">Section 67</a>\n\nof the NDPS Act and the expression “investigation” as used in <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1653\">Section 53</a> of the said\n\nAct.   While <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1654\">Sections 155-157</a> of the Cr.P.C. speak of investigation of cognizable\n\noffences, <a href=\"/doc/147224772/\" id=\"a_1655\">Section 8</a> of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, speaks of\n\ninquiry into the charge of commission of an offence under that Act, <a href=\"/doc/82982698/\" id=\"a_1656\">Section 14</a> of\n\nthe Central Excise Act contemplates inquiry for the purposes of the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_1657\">Central Excise\n\nAct</a> which could also include inquiry for the prosecution of an offence under the said\n\nAct and <a href=\"/doc/1347936/\" id=\"a_1658\">Section 107</a> of the Customs Act speaks of inquiry in connection with\n\nsmuggling.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_431\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_391\">                                                                                 206</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">\f99.     It seems that the word ‘inquiry’ has been used in the Railway Property\n\n(Unlawful Possession) Act, Customs Act, Central Excise Act in the same sense as the\n\nword ‘investigation’ in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1659\">Cr.P.C</a>. in respect of an offence. The choice of the\n\nexpression ‘inquiry’ in preference to investigation, in the statutes named above,\n\nexcept the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1660\">Cr.P.C</a>., may perhaps be linked to the definition of ‘inquiry’ in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1661\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n\nto mean an inquiry other than a trial by a Magistrate or a Court, since inquiry under\n\nthose statutes enjoy the status of judicial proceedings, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/308396/\" id=\"a_1662\">Sections\n\n193</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1969991/\" id=\"a_1663\">228</a> of the IPC.

An inquiry as contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_1670\">Section 67</a>\n\nis the collection of information generally, to find out if there has been any\n\ncontravention of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1671\">NDPS Act</a>, whereas investigation is the probing of an offence\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1672\">NDPS Act</a> and collection of materials to find out the truth of the case\n\nsought to be made out against an accused offender. However investigation may\n\nfollow an enquiry or be part of an enquiry.

It is not for this Court to question the wisdom of the\n\nLegislature. The fact that the Special Court may take cognizance of\n\nan offence, upon a complaint made by an officer of the Central or\n\nState Government, authorized in this behalf, and not a report, as\n\nrequired in case of the police, also shows that an inquiry or\n\ninvestigation under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1812\">NDPS Act</a> is not to be treated in the same\n\nway, as a police investigation into an offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_538\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_539\">127.

We now refer to certain aspects which lead us to\n        consider that the expression “police officer” has not such\n        a wide meaning as to include persons on whom certain\n        police powers are conferred. The object of enacting\n        <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1908\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, whose provisions formerly\n        formed part of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1909\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, was to\n        exclude from evidence confessions made to the regular\n        police which had a very bad reputation for the methods it\n        employed in investigation, especially in forcibly extracting\n        confessions with the object of securing a conviction. The\n        past conduct of the members of the police organization\n        justified the provision. It is too much to suppose that the\n        legislature did intend that all persons, who may have to\n        investigate or arrest persons or seize articles in pursuance\n        of any particular law of which at the time it had no\n        conception, should be considered to be so unreliable that\n        any confession made to them must be excluded just as a\n        confession made to a regular police officer. If it could not\n        contemplate the later creation of offences or of agencies\n        to take action in respect to them under future legislation,\n        it could not have intended the expression “police officer”\n        to include officers entrusted in future with the duty of\n        detecting and preventing smuggling and similar offences\n        with the object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of\n        Customs duties. If the legislature had intended to use the\n        expression “police officer” for such a wide purpose, it\n        would have used a more comprehensive expression. It\n        could have expressed its intention more clearly by making\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_441\">                                                                         242</span>\n\f               any confession made to any officer whose duty is to detect\n               and prevent the commission of offences inadmissible in\n               evidence.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_411\">     160.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1409644\" id=\"span_442\">In   <a href=\"/doc/1409644/\" id=\"a_1910\">Raja Ram Jaiswal v.

The broad ground for declaring confessions made to a police\n            officer inadmissible is to avoid the danger of admitting false\n            confessional statements obtained by coercion, torture or ill-treatment.\n            But a Customs Officer is not a member of the police force.

He is\n            entrusted with powers which specifically relate to the\n            collection of customs duties and prevention of smuggling. There\n            is no warrant for the contention raised by counsel for Mehta that a\n            Customs Officer is invested in the enquiry under the Sea Customs Act\n            with all the powers which a police officer in charge of a police station\n            has under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1959\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>...”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_418\">            10.

But the test for determining whether an\n            officer of customs is to be deemed a police officer is whether he\n            is invested with all the powers of a police officer qua\n            investigation of an offence, including the power to submit a\n            report under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_1961\">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Counsel for the appellants, however\n          argued that since the Act does not prescribe the procedure for\n          investigation, the officers invested with power under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1993\">Section 53</a> of the\n          Act must necessarily resort to the procedure under Chapter XII of the\n          Code which would require them to culminate the investigation by\n          submitting a report under Section 173 of the Code. Attractive though\n          the submission appears at first blush, it cannot stand close scrutiny. In\n          the first place as pointed out earlier there is nothing in the provisions of\n          the Act to show that the legislature desired to vest in the officers\n          appointed under <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_1994\">Section 53</a> of the Act, all the powers of Chapter XII,\n          including the power to submit a report under Section 173 of the Code.\n          But the issue is placed beyond the pale of doubt by sub-section (1) of\n          <a href=\"/doc/1712009/\" id=\"a_1995\">Section 36-A</a> of the Act which begins with a non-obstante clause —\n          notwithstanding anything contained in the Code — and proceeds to say\n          in clause (d) as under:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_621\">27.

The existing law i.e. the Penal Code was found\n             insufficient to eradicate or even to control the growing evil of bribery\n             and corruption corroding the public service of our country. The\n             provisions broadly include the existing offences under Sections 161\n             and 165 of the Penal Code, 1860 committed by public servants and\n             enact a new rule of presumptive evidence against the accused. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2047\">The\n             Act</a> also creates a new offence of criminal misconduct by public\n             servants though to some extent it overlaps on the pre-existing\n             offences and enacts a rebuttable presumption contrary to the well-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_651\">             known principles of criminal jurisprudence.

From the United States, where\n        the terminology of “compelling State interest” originated, a strict\n        standard of scrutiny comprises two things—a “compelling State\n        interest” and a requirement of “narrow tailoring” (narrow tailoring\n        means that the law must be narrowly framed to achieve the objective).\n        As a term, “compelling State interest” does not have definite contours\n        in the US.

If   a   statutory   provision   is   open   to   more   than   one\n\ninterpretation, the Court has to choose that interpretation which\n\nrepresents the true intention of the legislature. It is to be presumed\n\nthat in enacting a post constitutional law the legislative intent could\n\nnot have been to violate any fundamental right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_847\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_848\">246.   In ascertaining the intention of the legislature the Court is to\n\nexamine two aspects, the meaning of the words and phrases used in\n\nthe statute and the purpose and object or the reason and spirit\n\npervading through the statute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_849\">247.   Legislative intention, that is the true legal meaning of an\n\nenactment, is deduced by considering the meaning of the words used\n\nin the enactment, in the light of any discernible purposes or object of\n\nthe enactment. When any question arises as to the meaning of any\n\nprovision in a statute, it is proper to read that provision in the context\n\nof the intention of the legislature.    The intention of the Legislature\n\nmust be found by reading the statute as a whole.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_850\">248.   A statute or any statutory provision must be construed and\n\ninterpreted in a manner that makes the statute effective and\n\noperative on the principle expressed in the maxim ut res magis\n\nvaleat quam pereat and/or in other words, the principle that courts\n\nwhile pronouncing on the constitutionality of a statute starts with the\n\npresumption in favour of constitutionality and prefer a construction\n\nwhich keeps the statute within the competence of the legislature.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_553\">                                                                       300</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_851\">\f249.      Thus when a statute is vague, the Court will give such an\n\ninterpretation    that      keeps   the   statute   in   conformity   with   the\n\nfundamental rights.           Similarly, if a statute is capable of two\n\ninterpretations one of which violates the fundamental rights and the\n\nother of which protects the fundamental rights the court would opt\n\nfor the latter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_852\">250.      When a statutory provision is clear and there is no ambiguity,\n\nthis Court cannot alter that provision by its interpretation.         To do so,\n\nwould be to legislate, which this Court is not competent to do.              If a\n\nprovision is free from ambiguity or vagueness, and is clear, but\n\nviolative of a fundamental right, the Court will have to strike the\n\nsame down. Any omission in a statute cannot be filled in by Court as\n\nto do that would amount to the legislation and not construction. The\n\nCourt cannot      fill in   casus omissus and language permitting Court\n\nshould avoid creating casus omissus where there is none.                 In the\n\ninterpretation of statute the Courts must always presume that\n\nlegislature inserted every part thereof for a purpose and the\n\nlegislative intention is that every part of the statute should have\n\neffect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_853\">251.      The attention of this Bench has not been drawn to any\n\nambiguous provision capable of two or more interpretations, one of\n\nwhich would be in consonance with the fundamental rights and the\n\nother violative of the fundamental rights.

It is obvious that no two statutes can be identical. There may\n\nbe differences.    If there were no differences, It would not be\n\nnecessary to enact a separate statute.       The question is whether\n\nthere were any such differences which can logically lead to the\n\nconclusion that the law as interpreted in those judgments would not\n\napply to the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2297\">NDPS Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_866\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_867\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"690751\" id=\"span_565\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"32824\" id=\"span_566\">262.

The proposition of law laid down by the Constitution Bench in\n\nthe judgments referred to above and, in particular, Romesh\n\nChandra Mehta (supra) is that, the test to determine whether an\n\nofficer is deemed to be a police officer within the meaning of Section\n\n25 of the Evidence Act is, whether such officer has all the powers of a\n\npolice officer including the power to file a report under Section 173 of\n\nthe Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_869\">264.

The NDPS Act does not even contain any provision for filing a\n\nreport in a Court of law which is akin to a police report under\n\nSection 173 of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_873\">268.   As per the well established norms of judicial discipline and\n\npropriety, a Bench of lesser strength cannot revisit the proposition\n\nlaid down by at least three Constitution Benches, that an officer can\n\nbe deemed to be a police officer within the meaning of Section 25 of\n\nthe Evidence Act only if the officer is empowered to exercise all the\n\npowers of a police officer including the power to file a report under\n\nSection 173 of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_874\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_571\">                                                                               307</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_875\">\f269.
