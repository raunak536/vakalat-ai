Petitioner came to\nbe appointed as Labour Enforcement Officer, (Central) in the year 1987.\nIn 2017, he was posted as Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central)\nat Dehradun, Uttarakhand. By order dated 9 October 2017, he was\ntransferred to Mumbai where he joined on 11 October 2017 and started\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     Page No.2 of 41</span>\n                                    6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">     ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                               WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nfunctioning as Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central). While\nworking in Mumbai, the Petitioner had procured two mobile phone\nnumbers, viz. 8218574304 and 9968004524. On 9 March 2018, first\nRespondent passed order authorising interception of any message from\nand to the mobile phone bearing No. 8218574304 relating to clandestine\ncontact/movement/activity etc. The order was passed in exercise of\npowers by the Central Government under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 5</a> of\nthe Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_3\">(Telegraph Act</a>). On 17 March 2018,\nsimilar order was passed in respect of Petitioner&#x27;s other mobile number\ni.e. 9968004524. It appears that in pursuance of the orders dated 9\nMarch 2018 and 17 March 2018, certain messages of Petitioner were\nintercepted by the first Respondent and provided to CBI, based on\nwhich FIR bearing No. RC/BA1/2018/A0011 was registered against\nPetitioner and other officials working under him under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 7</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/642316/\" id=\"a_5\">12</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 120-B</a> of the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860. It is alleged in the FIR that a reliable source\ninformation was received that Petitioner was indulging in corrupt and\nillegal activities and criminal conspiracy with other persons and staff\nworking in the office of Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central)\nand seeking illegal gratification for official acts/functions like\nprocessing of renewal/issuance of labour licenses, certificate of\nregistration, building and other works, construction work certificates\nand deciding on inspection matters etc. The FIR alleges that the source\ninformation revealed that M/s. Som Projects Pvt. Ltd had undertaken\nproject in Colaba, Mumbai and two personnel of the said Company were\nin regular touch of the Petitioner relating to the work of\nrenewal/issuance of licenses and other pending works in the office of\nthe Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central), Mumbai. The FIR\nalleges that Petitioner demanded illegal gratification of Rs. 1,20,000/- in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     Page No.3 of 41</span>\n                                    6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">     ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                               WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nthree packets of Rs.70,000/-, Rs.30,000/- and Rs.20,000/- for himself and\ntwo other public servants. The FIR was registered after learning that\nthe Company person was likely to deliver illegal gratification to the\nPetitioner and other two public servants. CBI alleges that a trap was\nconducted on 20 April 2018 in which the bribe amount was recovered\nfrom Petitioner and the bribe amounts of Rs. 70,000/- and Rs.20,000/-\nwere recovered from Petitioner&#x27;s cabin and the third bag of bribe\namount of Rs.30,000/- was recovered from the backpack of another\npublic servant. CBI also alleges recovery of license issued after delivery\nof bribe amount from the backpack of Shri. Pradeep Vishwakarma,\nemployee of Som Projects Pvt. Ltd.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">4)              Petitioner was arrested on 20 April 2018 and was also\nplaced under deemed suspension. He was released on bail on 2 May\n2018. After completion of investigations, chargesheet has been filed\nagainst Petitioner, Smt.

SUBMISSIONS\n\n\n6)               Dr. Chandrachud, the learned counsel appearing for the\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">Petitioner would submit that the impugned orders passed by the first\nRespondent do not conform to the requirement of sub-section (2) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 5</a> of the Telegraph Act, which requires recording of reasons in\nwriting for interception of messages. In the present case, perusal of the\nimpugned orders would indicate that the first Respondent has merely\nrecited the language used in sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5</a> by virtually\ncopying the words used in the said provision. He would submit that in a\ncase like the present one, there is no element of public safety or public\nemergency and that in absence of demonstrable case of existence of\npublic safety or public emergency, the impugned orders are routinely\npassed without application of mind. That the Apex Court has repeatedly\nfrowned upon reciting the statutory provisions in the order instead of\nrecording cogent reasons in writing. In support, he would rely upon\nConstitution Bench judgment in Barium Chemicals Ltd &amp; Anr. Versus.\nCompany Law Board &amp; Ors.1 wherein the Apex Court has deprecated\nrepetition of words of Section in the order. Relying on the Constitution\nBench Judgment of Apex Court in Mohinder Singh Gill &amp; Anr. Versus.\nThe Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi &amp; Ors. 2 he would contend\nthat the validity of an order made by statutory authority must be\njudged by reasons mentioned in the order and order cannot be\nsupplemented by fresh reason in the shape of Affidavit.

Union of India &amp; Ors. 4. Dr. Chandrachud\nwould submit that every case involving allegation of corruption may\nnot essentially involve the element of public safety or public\nemergency. Giving the illustration of a Municipal Officer accepting\nbribe to issue Occupancy Certificate in respect of a building not\nconstructed in accordance with sanctioned plans and endangering the\nlives of public at large, he would submit that such a case would involve\nan element of public safety, in contradistinction to a case involving\nacceptance of bribe by a Ticket Checker or Bus Conductor which may\nnot necessarily involve the element of public safety or public\nemergency. That public emergency and public safety being sine qua non\nfor exercise of powers under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 5</a>, in absence of\nreasons being recorded demonstrating existence of public safety and\npublic emergency, the order would fall foul of mandatory requirements\nof <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 5(2)</a>.</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">3</span>\n     (2010) 9 SCC 496\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">4</span>\n     (2020) 3 SCC 637\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                      Page No.6 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                 WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n8)                Dr. Chandrachud would also rely upon Indian Telegraph\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">Rules, 1951 (Telegraph Rules) and would invite my attention to Rule\n419A, which according to him, again mandates recording of reasons. He\nwould submit that under sub-rule (2) of Rule 419A, an order passed by\nthe Competent Authority is required to be forwarded to the concerned\nReview Committee, constitution of which is provided under sub-rule\n(16). In the present case, there is nothing on record to indicate that the\nReview Committee is either constituted or that the impugned orders\nwere sent within seven working days to the Review Committee. Relying\non the provisions of sub-rule (17) of Rule 419A, Dr. Chandrachud would\nsubmit that the Review Committee can order destruction of copies of\nintercepted messages if it is found that the same is not recorded in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 5</a>. That in\nabsence of intercepted messages being placed before the Review\nCommittee within the stipulated time and in absence of filing of\nprocedure under sub-Rule 17 of Rule 419A, the intercepted messages\ncannot be used for any purposes.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107953018\" id=\"span_15\">9)                Dr. Chandrachud would thereafter submit that the Division\nBench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/107953018/\" id=\"a_20\">Vinit Kumar Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation</a>\nand others5 has held that in absence of demonstration of element of\npublic safety, the interception orders are invalid in law. He is fair\nenough in pointing out the Division Bench judgment in Vinit Kumar has\nbeen challenged by CBI before the Supreme Court and the order of the\nHigh Court has been stayed by the Supreme Court.

Mr. Patil would raise a\npreliminary objection to the maintainability of the petition.

That therefore the Petitioner cannot now be permitted to turn\naround and file a fresh petition challenging the interception orders.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">12)      Mr. Patil would submit that the case has been built on secret\ninformation and is not based on any complaint.                       That therefore\ninterception of messages became necessary and therefore permission\nwas sought from the first Respondent. That without intercepting the\nmessages, it was not possible to conduct a trap in the present case. That\nsince element of public safety and public emergency is involved, the\nfirst Respondent has rightly appreciated the necessity for interception\nof telephonic messages. Mr. Patil would further submit that the ground\nof non-placement of interception order before the Review Committee is\nspeculative in absence of any concrete material produced in that\nregard. That the procedure prescribed under Rule 419A has been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                      Page No.9 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nfollowed in the present case and in that regard, he would take me\nthrough the reply filed by the CBI. Mr. Patil would further submit that\ninterception of the telephonic message was also necessary for\npreventing incitement to commission of offence as observed in the\nimpugned orders. He would submit that in any case, the admissibility\nof the intercepted messages is a triable issue which can be raised by\nPetitioner during the course of the trial and that it is too premature to\nexpect the said issue to be determined before commencement of the\ntrial. Mr. Patil would pray for dismissal of the petition.\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_7\">D.

It appears that the Petitioner filed application seeking discharge\nunder Section 227 of the Code before the learned Special Judge at\nExhibit-18, which has been rejected by order dated 23 September 2022.</p><pre id=\"pre_9\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                     Page No.10 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                    WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">Mr. Patil has contended that while seeking his discharge, Petitioner has\nurged the very same ground of defect in intercepted messages under\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act and that the said issue has already\nbeen considered by the learned Judge while rejecting the application\nvide order dated 23 September 2022. The order rejecting application for\ndischarge was tested by Petitioner before this Court by filing Criminal\nRevision Application No. 523 of 2022, which he withdrew on 23 August\n2023. Thus, the issue of Petitioner&#x27;s discharge from Special Case\nNo.24/2019 has attained finality. According to Mr. Patil, since the issue\nof validity of interception orders passed under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\nTelegraph Act was a part of discharge application, Petitioner cannot\nhave another bite at the cherry by filing independent petition\nchallenging validity of the said orders.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">15)                Mr. Patil has placed on record copy of the Discharge\nApplication filed at Exhibit-18. So far as the validity of orders\npermitting interception of the telephonic conversation is concerned,\nPetitioner raised following pleadings in the Discharge Application:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107953018\" id=\"span_35\">&quot;Even otherwise interception of telephonic conversation is barred under\n               <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 except on the occurrence of\n               any public emergency or in the interest of public safety. The said issue of\n               admissibility of intercepted conversation was challenged in <a href=\"/doc/107953018/\" id=\"a_29\">Vinit Kumar\n               Vs.

The Report of the Review Committee constituted under Rule\n               419-A (16) of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 consisting of the Cabinet\n               Secretary;     Secretary,    Legal     Affairs     and   the    Secretary,\n               Telecommunications either confirming or setting aside the interception\n               orders dated 9.3.2018 and 17.3.2018 issued by the Secretary, Home Affairs\n               (D-13 of the charge-sheet at Page 357 and 258) has also not been brought\n               on records by the CBI despite a lapse of more than four and half years\n               although the same was required to be on records within two months at\n               the most as per Rule 419-A (17) of the said Rules.</span></blockquote><pre id=\"pre_10\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                         Page No.11 of 41</span>\n                                         6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                          ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n\n16)              It does appear that Petitioner did raise the issue of validity\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">of orders sanctioning interception of telephonic conversation in his\ndischarge application. However, the issue raised by the Petitioner in the\nDischarge Application was about &#x27;admissibility of intercepted\nconversation&#x27;. Petitioner could not have challenged the validity of\norders dated 9 March 2018 and 17 March 2018 before the Special Judge\nwho otherwise does not have jurisdiction to uphold or set aside the said\norders, that too during pendency of the trial. In application filed under\nSection 227 of the Code, Petitioner attempted to seek his discharge from\nthe said case by raising various grounds, including the ground of\nadmissibility of intercepted telephonic conversation. The discharge was\nnot sought only on the ground of admissibility of intercepted\ntelephonic conversation and in the lengthy application running into 37\npages, various grounds, mainly the ground of non-availability of\nsufficient material for raising grave suspicion, were raised. The issue of\nadmissibility of intercepted conversation was raised in just one\nparagraph. In my view, therefore mere raising of one stray ground in\nthe application for discharge relating to admissibility of intercepted\ntelephonic conversation would not preclude Petitioner from setting up\nan independent challenge to the orders dated 9 March 2018 and 17\nMarch 2018 by filing Writ Petition invoking jurisdiction of this Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Articles 226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_32\">227</a> of the Constitution of India. In the present\npetition, Petitioner is not seeking discharge from Special Case No.24 of\n2019. Even if the petition is allowed, Petitioner&#x27;s prosecution in the said\nSpecial Case would continue. I am therefore unable to uphold the\npreliminary objection raised by Mr. Patil to the maintainability of the\npetition and the same is accordingly repelled.</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_11\">\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                     Page No.12 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                     WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n\nD. 2              REFLECTION OF COGENT REASONS IN IMPUGNED ORDERS\n\n\n17)               So far as the ground of non-reflection of cogent reasons in\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">the impugned order is concerned, it would be sufficient to reproduce\none of the impugned orders passed on 9 March 2018, since both the\norders are identically worded.

The Secretary has also stated in his order\nthat the satisfaction is recorded for reason of public safety.\nAdditionally, it is also stated in the order that monitoring of the\ntelephone was necessary as information could not be acquired through\nany other reasonable means. While it is true that the Secretary could\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                       Page No.19 of 41</span>\n                                       6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                        ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nhave made a brief reference to the facts of the case as to how it was not\npossible to acquire information through other reasonable means. Also,\nwhile recording satisfaction about existence of element of public safety\nand interest of public order, the Secretary could have elaborated in the\norder as to how the facts of the case involve the element of public safety\nand how interception of message would aid in preventing incitement to\ncommission of an offence. The question is whether the failure on his\npart to do so would render the order void. To my mind, mere failure on\nthe part of the Secretary to elaborate reasons in the order would not\nmake the order fall foul of the requirement of recording reasons in\nwriting as envisages under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 5</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">28)              It must be borne in mind that the Secretary to the\nGovernment of India, who has been authorised under sub-rule (1) of\nRule 419(A) of the Telegraph Rules to exercise powers of Central\nGovernment, performs administrative function not requiring grant of\nopportunity of hearing. True it is that even an administrative order\nmust speak for itself. However, there is a distinction between recording\nof elaborate reasons and recording succinct reasons. An administrative\norder which conveys succinct reasons for exercise of statutory power\ncannot be branded as cryptic. In fact, in para-37(l) of its judgment in\nKranti Associates Private Limited, the Apex Court has held that though\nthe reason must be cogent and clear, they also need to be succinct. It\nmust also be borne in mind that the orders under sub-section (2) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 5</a> are required to be passed in most of the cases in urgent or\nemergent situations. The situations in which they are required to be\npassed involve element of secrecy. The issue therefore is whether the\nSecretary is expected to record elaborate reasons and pass a detailed\norder while granting permission for interception of telephonic message\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                     Page No.20 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nunder sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 5</a>. The answer to the question, to my\nmind, appears to be in the negative. In fact, requirement of recording of\ndetailed reasons with respect of facts of each case may frstrate the\nentire objective of passing such order as the emergent situation may\ncease to exist if the officer concerned is expected to spend time in\ngathering necessary material for recording detailed reasons.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">29)              In the present case, I am satisfied that recording of succinct\nreasons about existence of element of public safety as well as necessity\nfor interception of telephonic message in the interest of public order\nand for preventing of incitement to commission of an offence meets the\nrequirements under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 5</a>. What is more\nimportant is the reason recorded in the third paragraph about reaching\na satisfaction by the Secretary that no other reasonable means were\navailable for gathering of information except by monitoring the\nconcerned telephone number. As rightly pointed out by Mr. Patil, the\ncase was based on source information and not on the basis of the\ncomplaint of the person to whom demand of bribe was made. Recording\nof detailed reasons would expose the source of the information\nendangering the safety of the source. It appears that gathering of\ninformation for a laying a trap required monitoring of the concerned\ntelephone and the Secretary has rightly observed in his order that\nexcept such monitoring, no other means were available for gathering\nthe relevant information. I am unable to accept the submission of Dr.\nChandrachud that no cogent reasons are recorded or that the reasons\nare mere recitation of statutory language or that the order contains\nmerely &#x27;rubber-stamp reasons&#x27;. The first objection for setting aside the\nimpugned order is therefore rejected.</p><pre id=\"pre_12\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                     Page No.21 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                  WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n\nD. 3              ELEMENT OF PUBLIC EMERGENCY AND PUBLIC SAFETY\n\n\n30)                The second point raised by Dr. Chandrachud is about non-\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">existence of element of &#x27;public safety&#x27; and/or &#x27;public emergency&#x27; for\nexercise of powers under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 5</a> of the Telegraph\nAct.

Dr. Chandrachud has contended that the emergency\ncontemplated under the statutory provision is not a usual or normal\nemergency but what is contemplated is &#x27;public emergency&#x27;. The Apex\nCourt has examined the concepts of &#x27;public emergency&#x27; as well as\n&#x27;interest of public safety&#x27; in its four judge Bench decision in Hukam\nChand Shyam Lal Versus. Union of India 13. It is held in para 13 of the\njudgment as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                  &quot;13. <a href=\"/doc/593470/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 5(1)</a> if properly construed, does not confer unguided and\n                  unbridled power on the Central Government/State Government/\n                  specially authorised officer to take possession of any telegraphs.\n                  Firstly, the occurrence of a &quot;public emergency&quot; is the sine qua non\n                  for the exercise of power under this section. As a preliminary step to\n                  the exercise of further jurisdiction under this section the Government\n                  or the authority concerned must record its satisfaction as to the\n                  existence of such an emergency. Further, the existence of the\n                  emergency which is a prerequisite for the exercise of power under\n                  this section, must be a &quot;public emergency&quot; and not any other kind of\n                  emergency. The expression public emergency has not been defined in\n                  the statute, but contours broadly delineating its scope and features\n                  are discernible from the section which has to be read as a whole. In\n                  subsection (1) the phrase &#x27;occurrence of any public emergency&#x27; is\n                  connected with and is immediately followed by the phrase &quot;or in the\n                  interests of the public safety&quot;. These two phrases appear to take\n                  colour from each other. In the first part of subsection (2) those two\n                  phrases again occur in association with each other, and the context\n                  further clarifies with amplification that a &quot;public emergency&quot; within\n                  the contemplation of this section is one which raises problems\n                  concerning the interest of the public safety, the sovereignty and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">13</span>\n      (1976) 2 SCC 128\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                       Page No.22 of 41</span>\n                                       6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">       ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                       ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                 WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n                 integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with\n                 foreign States or public order or the prevention of incitement to the\n                 commission of an offence.

The Apex Court has further held that\nthe emergency which is a prerequisite for exercise of power must be\n&#x27;public emergency&#x27; and not any other kind of emergency. The Apex\nCourt has further held that the phrase &#x27; occurrence of a public\nemergency&#x27; is connected with and immediately followed by the phrase\n&#x27;or in the interest of public safety &#x27; and that the two phrases take colour\nfrom each other. It is further held that a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; must be the\none which raises problems concerning the interest of public safety,\nsovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly\nrelations with foreign States or public order or for preventing\nincitement to the commission of an offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">32)      In People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties v.

Unless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of\n                public safety demands, the authorities have no jurisdiction to\n                exercise the powers under the said Section. Public emergency would\n                mean the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting\n                the people at large calling for immediate action. The expression\n                &quot;public safety&quot; means the state or condition of freedom from danger\n                or risk for the people at large. When either of these two conditions\n                are not in existence, the Central Government or a State Government\n                or the authorised officer cannot resort to telephone tapping even\n                though there is satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient so to do\n                in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India etc. In other\n                words, even if the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary\n                or expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity\n                of India or the security of the State or friendly relations with\n                sovereign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the\n                commission of an offence, it cannot intercept the messages or resort\n                to telephone tapping unless a public emergency has occurred or the\n                interest of public safety or the existence of the interest of public\n                safety requires. Neither the occurrence of public emergency nor the\n                interest of public safety are secretive conditions or situations. Either\n                of the situations would be apparent to a reasonable person.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">                29. The first step under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act, therefore, is the\n                occurrence of any public emergency of the existence of a public-\n                safety interest. Thereafter the competent authority under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_60\">Section\n                5(2)</a> of the Act is empowered to pass an order of interception after\n                recording its satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient so to do in\n                the interest of (i) sovereignty and integrity of India, (ii) the security\n                of the State, (iii) friendly relations with foreign States, (iv) public\n                order or (v) for preventing incitement to the commission of an\n                offence. When any of the five situations mentioned above to the\n                satisfaction of the competent authority require then the said\n                authority may pass the order for interception of messages by\n                recording reasons in writing for doing so.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">                30. The above analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act shows that so far the\n                power to intercept messages/conversations is concerned the Section\n                clearly lays-down the situations/conditions under which it can be\n                exercised. But the substantive law as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\n                Act must have procedural backing so that the exercise of power is fair\n                and reasonable. The said procedure itself must be just, fair and\n                reasonable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_68\">It has been settled by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_63\">Maneka\n                Gandhi v.

Keeping in mind the wordings of the section, and the above two\n                 pronouncements of this Court, what emerges is that the prerequisite\n                 for an order to be passed under this subsection, and therefore the\n                 Suspension Rules, is the occurrence of a &quot;public emergency&quot; or for it\n                 to be &quot;in the interest of public safety&quot;.

The word &quot;emergency&quot; has various connotations. Everyday\n                 emergency, needs to be distinguished from the type of emergency\n                 wherein events which involve, or might involve, serious and\n                 sometimes widespread risk of injury or harm to members of the\n                 public or the destruction of, or serious damage to, property. <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 4</a>\n                 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, notes that\n                 &#x27;[I]n time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation\n                 and the existence of which is officially proclaimed... &#x27;.

We may only point out\n                 that the &quot;public emergency&quot; is required to be of serious nature, and\n                 needs to be determined on a case to case basis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">                                                                      (emphasis added)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">34)              Thus, considering the law expounded by the Apex Court in\nits judgments in Hukam Chand Shyam Lal and Anuradha Bhasin, it\nappears to be now well settled that the phrases &#x27; public emergency&#x27; and\n&#x27;in the interest of public safety &#x27; are to be used in conjunction with each\nother and that the &#x27;emergency&#x27; need not be everyday emergency as\ncontradistinct from a &#x27;public emergency&#x27;.

The above observations are made by the Apex Court in the\ncontext of the issues involved in the case, which did not include the\nissue of existence of element of public emergency or public safety in a\ncase involving allegations of corruption. However, the judgments in\nHukam Chand Shyam Lal and Anuradha Bhasin, undoubtedly interpret\n<a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 5</a> of the Telegraph Act and both the judgments provide\nassistance for determination of the issue involved in the present case as\nwell.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">35)              Dr. Chandrachud has contended that in every case\ninvolving allegations of corruption, occurrence of public emergency or\nexistence of public safety cannot be inferred and the Competent\nAuthority must apply its mind to the facts and circumstances of each\ncase and it is only when it is satisfied about existence of elements of\npublic emergency and public safety, power under sub-section (2) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 5</a> for interception of messages can be exercised. He has sought\nto distinguish cases involving corruption against municipal official\nissuing occupancy certificate in respect of dangerous construction and\nallegation of corruption against Ticket Checker or Bus Conductor and\nsubmits that in the former case, there could be an element of public\nsafety but the same cannot be said to be involved in the latter category\nof cases. In my view however, it is not possible to put the cases\ninvolving elements of public emergency or public safety in a\nstraitjacket formula. The expressions &#x27;public emergency&#x27; and &#x27;public\nsafety&#x27; need to be considered from the angle of emergency or safety\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                     Page No.26 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                               WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nrelating to the public at large as contradistinct with an emergency or\nsafety involving a particular individual. Corrupt activities of a public\nservant can pose threat to the public at large where he/she is accused\nof performing an act, which he/she is not supposed to perform, but\nperforms on account of gratification offered. In some cases, a public\nservant may demand and accept gratification for performance of an act,\nwhich he/she is otherwise is duty bound to perform, like demand of\ngratification for sanction of TDS, which is otherwise sanctionable as per\nlaw. In other cases, what could not be done and what should not be\ndone is done by him/her only on account of gratification offered to\nhim. Governing the activities of State and its instrumentalities as per\nrule of law by eliminating corrupt activities of public servants is the\nlarger public interest, as opposed to protection of private interest of\nany individual. When a public servant is prosecuted and punished for\ndemanding and accepting bribe, it is not only the grievance of person to\nwhom demand is made which gets vindicated, but such prosecution and\nconviction addresses larger public interest. Corrupt activities of public\nservants pose threat to the whole organization, which is being run for\nlarger public interest. A railway ticket checker permitting passenger to\ntravel ticketless and misappropriating the fare amount causes losses to\nrailways and if railways does not curb such activities, its existence is\nput to threat thereby affecting the larger public, in whose interest the\nrailway service is run. It is another matter that the illustration of ticket\nchecker or bus conductor cited by Dr. Chandrachud would seldom\nrequire interception of telephone messages. Therefore whether\ninterception of messages is warranted or not would depend on facts of\neach case.</p><pre id=\"pre_14\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                    Page No.27 of 41</span>\n                                    6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">     ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n36)              As discussed above, a public servant can indulge in corrupt\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">activities either to do a prohibited act or for performance of act\npermissible by law. When prosecuting agency requests for permission\nto intercept messages relating to corrupt activities of a public servant,\nit would be too farfetched to expect the Competent Authority to make a\nguesswork about the exact reason why demand for illegal gratification\nis being made-whether it is for doing a prohibited act or to do what is\nmandated by law? Also, what must be borne in mind is the broader\nobjective of the State to weed out corruption from the system, for\nwhich assistance in the form of interception of messages is needed. In\nsome cases, the prosecuting agency may want to keep a tap on the\nactivities of a public servant, against whom no complaint is received in\nrespect of a specified act. The prosecuting agency is not debarred from\ncatching hold of a public servant indulging in corruption in absence of a\ncomplaint by bribe giver. In such circumstances, the monitoring of\nactivities of public servant becomes necessary. It is inconceivable to\ncontend that the elements of public safety or public emergency is not\ninvolved in such cases. <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_71\">The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a> is a\nspecial legislation enacted to combat the menace of corruption. Corrupt\nactivities of public servants pose a risk to the public at large, which also\namounts to threat to public safety. Prosecuting a public servant\nindulging in corruption is in the interest of public at large. Existence of\nelements of public safety and/or public emergency in a particular case\ninvolving corruption allegations would depend on facts and\ncircumstances of that case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">37)              Coming back to the facts of the present case, the Petitioner\nin his capacity as Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central), Mumbai\nwas vested with powers and functions like processing of issuance of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                     Page No.28 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\nlabour licenses, certificate of registration, building and other\nconstruction work certificates and deciding on inspection matters, etc.\nThe Petitioner faces an allegation that he was indulging in corrupt and\nillegal activities while performing the functions relating to the work of\nrenewal/issuance of licenses to the Company for the project of Boat\nRepair Centre. It therefore cannot be contended that his alleged corrupt\nactivities would not endanger public safety or that no element of public\nemergency is involved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">38)              The matter can also be seen from another angle. The\nCompetent Authority has recorded subjective satisfaction of existence\nof element of public safety in the present case. The Competent\nAuthority has considered that for monitoring activities of the Petitioner\nrelating to his alleged corrupt activities, interception of his telephonic\nmessages is necessary. The authority has further recorded a reason that\nthe requisite information could not be gathered by any other means.\nThe issue is whether in exercise of writ jurisdiction, this Court would be\nin a position to question the correctness of such subjective satisfaction\nrecorded by the Competent Authority and hold that in no case relating\nto allegations of corruption, element of public safety or public\nemergency can be involved or that other means were available to\ngather the requisite information. The answer to the question, to my\nmind, appears to be in the negative. The contours of jurisdiction of\ncourts while determining correctness of subjective satisfaction\nrecorded by a statutory authority about existence of public safety or\npublic emergency would lie in narrow compass and courts cannot sit as\nan Appellate Authority over the satisfaction so recorded by the\nAuthority for arriving at a conclusion different than the one reached by\nthat authority.</p><pre id=\"pre_15\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                     Page No.29 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n\n39)              What is vital in the present case is the reason recorded in\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">the third paragraph of the impugned orders where the Secretary has\nrecorded a satisfaction that monitoring of telephone of the Petitioner\nwas necessary as it was not possible to acquire the requisite\ninformation through any other reasonable means. The entire action in\nthe present case is initiated by CBI on the basis of source information\nthat officials in the office of the Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner\n(Central), Mumbai were indulging in corrupt activities. In order to\nverify the correctness of the source information, in absence of any\nspecific complaint, it became necessary for CBI to monitor the\ntelephone of the Petitioner. Recording of elaborate reasons disclosing\nthe details of source information in the present case would have posed\na risk to the sources. In my view therefore element of public safety is\nclearly involved in the present case. It appears that monitoring of the\ntelephone ultimately revealed that there was telephonic conversation\non 19 April 2018 between Petitioner and Assistant Labour Commissioner\nrelating to issuance of license to M/s. Som Projects Ltd. and the\nemployee of M/s. Som Project Pvt. Ltd is allegedly found to have\ndelivered the packets containing the bribe amount to the Petitioner and\nother officials. Therefore, the reason recorded in the third paragraph of\nthe impugned order about impossibility of securing the requisite\ninformation through any other means appears to my mind as a cogent\nreason for permitting interception of messages on telephone number of\nthe Petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_16\">D.4              VIEWS EXPRESSED BY VARIOUS HIGH COURTS\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                     Page No.30 of 41</span>\n                                     6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">      ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                  WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n40)              There appear to be cleavage of opinion about existence of\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">elements of public emergency and public safety while making an order\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act in matters concerning\nallegations of corruption.

The order reads that\n                 Union Home Secretary is satisfied that it was necessary and expedient\n                 in public safety to order inception. What public safety was involved in\n                 the case at hand is not known, and it is not discernible anywhere\n                 either in the order or in the case at hand. The allegation is with\n                 regard to acceptance of illegal gratification. If that be so, a drastic\n                 measure of wiretapping could not have been permitted against the\n                 petitioner, as admittedly he did not involve any of the trait necessary\n                 under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 5</a> of the Act and its interpretation by\n                 the Apex Court. Therefore, wiretapping is loosely permitted against\n                 the petitioner. This finding that the act of wiretapping is illegal would\n                 cut at the root of the matter and obliterate all the acts or steps taken\n                 by the prosecution in its aftermath.

The learned\nSingel Judge held in paras-12 and 15 of the judgment as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                12. In the above, the action of the interception in the case on hand\n                was for detection, prevention, investigation and the prosecution of\n                corrupt activities. As such the contention of the petitioners that the\n                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the case of PUCL (supra) has held\n                that the telephone tapping cannot happen unless specific criteria as\n                mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 5(2)</a> of Indian Telegraph Act or satisfied along\n                with the criteria laid down is not applicable to the case on hand.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">                Further it is also seen that the first respondent passed the order with\n                application of mind taking into consideration the circumstances\n                prevailing in the matter after having satisfied on the basis of the\n                material placed before the authority that the circumstances of the\n                case warrants lawful interception. The five circumstances laid under\n                Section (5) (2) of the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_100\">Indian Telegraph Act</a> related to the public\n                emergency or interest of the public safety. The authority is within the\n                powers conferred by the Act to order for lawful interception. It would\n                also be seen that not only the bodily injury to the members of the\n                public or the injury to a minimum number of persons would\n                constitute public safety. With the latest communication tools in the\n                form of powerful mobile phones becoming available in every hand in\n                the country which are equipped with applications ensuring encrypted\n                communication. The available avenues with the potential criminals,\n                have increased manifolds and it is becoming increasingly difficult to\n                prevent and detect crime. Restricting the concept of public safety to\n                the mere &quot;situations that would be apparent to the reasonable\n                persons&quot; will exclude most of the actual threats which present the\n                most grave circumstances like terrorist attacks, corruption at high\n                places, economic and organised crimes, most of which are hatched in\n                the most secretive of manners. In most of the circumstances, threat\n                to public safety is from hidden factor which are neither apparent nor\n                obvious to the general public and members of the law enforcement\n                community and the information about these circumstances and\n                factors cannot be connected by any other reasonable means. In\n                addition, most of such information, is sensitive in nature, which may\n                not be circulated in the public domain. Therefore, the first\n                respondent passed the order to intercept phone messages of the\n                petitioners herein.</p><pre id=\"pre_18\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                      Page No.37 of 41</span>\n                                      6 September 2024\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">     ::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2024                        ::: Downloaded on - 27/09/2024 00:35:53 :::</span>\n Neeta Sawant                                                                 WP-3389-2024-JR\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">                 15.

The Petitioner in a separate application dated 18 th\n                 March, 2023, preferred before the CBI Court had called upon the\n                 prosecution to produce a copy of the order of the Review Committee\n                 recording its finding. It is, therefore, submitted that either the orders\n                 have not been forwarded to the Review Committee by the Respondent\n                 or the Review Committee has not given its findings as required under\n                 law Hence, the Respondent has failed to comply with the mandatory\n                 provisions of law. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that\n                 an order has been passed by the Review Committee endorsing the\n                 orders issued by the Respondent No. 1 i.e. Ld. Secretary, Home Affairs,\n                 the said order shall still be amenable to judicial scrutiny by this\n                 Hon&#x27;ble Court. Annexed herewith at Exhibit &#x27;G&#x27; is a copy of the\n                 discharge application without its annexures and at Exhibit &#x27;H&#x27; is a\n                 copy of the application dated 18th March, 2023 filed by the Petitioner\n                 in the proceeding before the CBI Court.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">52)              Thus, on account of non-receipt of response received by the\nPetitioner to application dated 18 March 2023 preferred before CBI\nCourt for production of order of the Review Committee, Petitioner has\nraised a speculation that the interception orders are possibly not\nforwarded to the Review Committee or that the Review Committee has\nnot recorded its findings as required under law. In absence of any\nconcrete factual information, the Petitioner has raised an alternate\nsubmission that the order of the Review Committee, if passed, is\namenable to judicial scrutiny. Thus, from the pleadings raised in the\npetition, it is clear that the contention of non-following of procedure\nunder sub-rule (2) and (17) of the Rule 419A of Telegraph Rules is\nmerely speculative in nature. Respondent-CBI has filed Affidavit-in-\nReply in which it is contended in para-7 as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                 7. ....
