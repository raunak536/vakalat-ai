Subsequently, the following additional issues were framed:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;1.Whether the election petition which is filed before this\n      Court, was filed in person or not in compliance of <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 81</a> of\n      the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred\n      to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      2.Whether the absence of words &#x27;True Copy&#x27; on every copy form\n      part of Annexure in spite of signatures and attestation amounts\n      to non-compliance of <a href=\"/doc/308266/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 81(3)</a> of the Act?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      3.Whether the petitioner has made out the grounds under\n      <a href=\"/doc/152271000/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 100 (1)</a> of the Act?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      4.Whether the compliances of the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 81(1)</a>\n      and <a href=\"/doc/308266/\" id=\"a_6\">81 (3)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/122848074/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 86(1)</a> of the Act with regard to\n      filing of copies as many copies thereof as there are respondents\n      and other non-compliance, after the original limitation of forty-\n      five days, filing of EP is permissible?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      5.Whether the Registrar has power to allow the election\n      petitioner to rectify the defects in original Election Petition?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      6.Whether the Election Petition lacks cause of action?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">11.    Heard both sides.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\nAdditional Issue No.1:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">12.    Learned counsel for the respondent has contended that there\n\nis no endorsement on the election petition that the election\n\npetitioner was physically present when the election petition was\n\npresented, as required under <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act. It is also his\n\ncontention that the election petition has to be filed personally by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                   7</span>\n                                                                     ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                        E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nthe election petitioner before the Registrar, so that the Registrar\n\nmay make preliminary verification with the election petitioner to\n\nsee that the petition is neither frivolous nor vexatious.           The\n\npresence of the election petitioner is also required as and when the\n\nelection petition is re-presented. It is his contention that evidence\n\non record shows that the physical presence of the election\n\npetitioner as claimed by him on the date of first presentation is not\n\nproved. Similarly, at the time of re-presentation, the presence of\n\nthe election petitioner was also not proved. Therefore, compliance\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act was not done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">13.   Learned counsel for the election petitioner has contended\n\nthat the election petitioner and his advocate were personally\n\npresent at the time of presentation of the election petition. There\n\nis no evidence that there was no physical presence of the election\n\npetitioner.   He has also contended that at the time of re-\n\npresentation, the presence of the election petitioner is not\n\nrequired, since the preliminary verification must have been done at\n\nthe time of first presentation.       At the time of re-presentation,\n\npresence of advocate of the election petitioner is sufficient and it\n\nfulfills the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act. Therefore, the\n\nobjection raised by the respondent is liable to be rejected.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                      8</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">                                                                         ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                            E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">14.

The object was to ensure the\n\ngenuineness and curtail vexatious litigation. For that purpose, the\n\npresence of the election petitioner is required for preliminary\n\nverification.        This means, the statutory requirement mandates\n\npresence of the election petitioner at the time of filing of the\n\nelection petition.       However, Rule No.3 framed by this Court to\n\nregulate trial of the election petition shows that the election\n\npetition shall be filed in the office of the Registrar by the election\n\npetitioner or by advocate duly appointed by the election petitioner.\n\nThis Rule is running contrary to the statutory requirement of\n\nphysical presence of the election petitioner at the time of filing of\n\nthe election petition, as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the\n\nAct.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1998529\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"924801\" id=\"span_24\">17.

No doubt, Rule No.3 framed by this Court permits the\n\nelection petitioner to file the election petition by himself or\n\nthrough advocate appointed by him.         This Rule is against the\n\nstatutory requirement, and if this Rule is accepted, it whittles down\n\nthe effect of <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act. Therefore, the election\n\npetitioner cannot take shelter under said Rule No.3 and he has to\n\ncomply with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">19.   The endorsement on the election petition is not indicative\n\nwith regard to presence or absence of the election petitioner.\n\nTherefore, some kind of evidence must be brought on record by the\n\nelection petitioner to establish his presence at the time of filing of\n\nthe election petition.   The purpose of presence of the election\n\npetitioner has been indicated by the Apex Court.       The presence\n\nfacilitates preliminary verification with the election petitioner to\n\nensure genuineness of his claim of the election petitioner and to\n\navoid frivolous and vexatious litigation. The endorsement on the\n\nelection petition does not refer to any such preliminary verification\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  12</span>\n                                                                    ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                       E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\neither by the Registrar or any officer of the Registry.

The evidence of P.W.1 i.e., the election petitioner is silent\n\nwith regard to his presence at the time of filing of the election\n\npetition. However, in the cross-examination, P.W.1 claims that he\n\nwas present on the date of filing of the election petition i.e., on\n\n24.01.2019 in the concerned section along with his advocate. The\n\nelection petition was presented on 24.01.2019 and it was returned\n\non 28.02.2019 with 15 objections. The evidence of P.W.1 shows\n\nthat on two occasions, he was present in the High Court premises.\n\nThe first occasion was on 24.01.2019 and the second occasion was\n\non 23.03.2019.    This means, at the time of re-presentation on\n\n06.03.2019, the election petitioner was not physically present. The\n\nelection petitioner has not examined the advocate with whom he\n\nwas present on the date of filing of the election petition. His chief\n\nexamination is also silent with regard to physical presence along\n\nwith his advocate. Such claim has been only made by him in his\n\ncross-examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">21.   Learned counsel for the respondent brought to the notice of\n\nthis Court that circumstances made out from the evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                  13</span>\n                                                                   ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                      E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nimprobablize the presence of the election petitioner along with his\n\nadvocate when the election petition was presented.           The first\n\ncircumstance is that the original election petition shows that the\n\nverification was done on 23.01.2019, whereas the annexure shows\n\nthat verification was done on 24.01.2019. The attestation was done\n\nby notary Challari Nageswara Rao, Advocate, who is resident of HIG-\n\nI, B-4, F-12, Baghlingampally, Hyderabad-44. The bank receipts and\n\nlodgment schedule show initials of the advocate, and they do not\n\nshow the signatures of the election petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">22.   The second circumstance brought to the notice of this Court\n\nis that admittedly, for entry into the premises of this Court,\n\nsecurity gate pass was required. The election petitioner did not\n\nassertively say that he obtained gate pass from the security on\n\n24.01.2019. In cross-examination, he admitted that security gate\n\npass is required to enter into the High Court premises, but it was\n\nnot required to enter into the filing section. This means, he admits\n\nrequirement of gate pass for entering into the High Court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">23.   The other circumstance was that he was unable to say\n\naffirmatively that whether documents were notarized on one day or\n\non the different dates. He has also claimed that notary was done\n\nby the side of Gate No.6 of the High Court and he also admitted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                    14</span>\n                                                                     ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                        E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nthat   the   address   of   the    notary   advocate   is   shown     as\n\nBaghlingampally.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">24.    Learned counsel for the respondent, by bringing the above\n\ncircumstances, tried to contend that those circumstances clearly\n\nimprobablize the claim of P.W.1 that he was physically present\n\nalong with his advocate on the date of filing of the election\n\npetition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">25.    In the present case, initially, receiving officer had not noted\n\nwhether the election petition was filed by the election petitioner or\n\nhis advocate. In the absence of such endorsement, the evidentiary\n\nburden is on the election petitioner to prove his physical presence\n\nwith advocate on the date of presentation of the election petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">26.    In the present case, in fact, no claim has been made in the\n\nchief-examination of P.W.1, in spite of knowledge of preliminary\n\nissue in this regard was raised, much before commencement of\n\ntrial. Such issue was postponed by framing additional issue, so that\n\nthe parties were given full opportunity to establish the requirement\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">27.    In the present case, in spite of framing such an issue, P.W.1\n\ndid not plead in his chief-examination about his physical presence.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                   15</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">                                                                      ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                         E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nThe election petition does not refer about his physical presence.\n\nThe only rightful person is either the officer, who received the\n\nelection petition or the advocate with whom the election petitioner\n\nclaimed to have accompanied on the date of filing of the election\n\npetition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">28.   In the present case, these two crucial witnesses have not\n\nbeen introduced in the evidence with regard to presence of the\n\nelection    petitioner.      P.W.1     only    claimed        in     the\n\ncross-examination about his presence along with his advocate.\n\nExcept the same, there is no other evidence.         However, the\n\ncircumstances    put      forth   by   the    respondent       in    the\n\ncross-examination of P.W.1 show absence of security gate pass,\n\nwhich admittedly is required for entering into the premises of this\n\nCourt and there is no signature of the election petitioner on the\n\ndeposit slip of the State Bank of India (Hyderabad), which is\n\nsituated in the High Court premises, and also in the lodgment\n\nschedule. They only refer to the presence of advocate.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">29.   The other circumstance was attestation by notary.              The\n\nelection petitioner could not able to claim affirmatively whether\n\nthe verification of the election petition and documents was done on\n\none day or different days. The election petition shows that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  16</span>\n                                                                      ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                         E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nverification was done on 23.01.2019 and the affidavit and other\n\ndocuments were attested on 24.01.2019. The election petitioner\n\nclaims that attestation was done at Gate No.6 of this Court, since\n\nthe notary advocate was having his office at Gate No.6. There is no\n\nevidence to the effect that the notary advocate has set up his\n\noffice in the premises of this Court and that any permission is\n\ngranted by this Court to establish his office at Gate No.6. Further,\n\nthe office seal of the notary advocate shows that he is resident of\n\nBaghlingampally and that his office is in Baghlingampally. The seal\n\ndisclose attestation was done at Baghlingampally. The claim of the\n\nelection petitioner that attestation was done in the premises of this\n\nCourt can also be doubted by his own admission. According to\n\nP.W.1, he has first time come to this court on 24.01.2019, the date\n\nof presentation of the election petition. Attestation of election was\n\ndone on 23.01.2019 which is one day prior to filing of the election\n\npetition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">30.   The    circumstance    brought   out    by   the      respondent\n\nimprobablizes claim set up by the election petitioner that he was\n\nphysically present along with his advocate on the date of filing of\n\nthe election petition.   The evidence also shows that the election\n\npetition was returned on 28.02.2019 and it was re-presented on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                    17</span>\n                                                                    ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                       E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n06.03.2019. Admittedly, the election petitioner visited this Court\n\non 24.01.2019, and next, on 23.03.2019.            This means, on\n\n06.03.2019, he was not present. In the cross-examination, P.W.1\n\nadmitted that there is slight difference in his signatures at page\n\nNos.93 and 94 when compared with that of page Nos.84 to 92. The\n\nobjection No.7 of return endorsement shows that signature of the\n\nelection petitioner was not on all papers. This means, this variation\n\nin signature might be on account of his absence when the\n\nattestation was done by notary on the date mentioned therein.\n\nThere is no proper explanation from the election petitioner as to\n\nwhy there was variation in the signatures in those papers.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">31.   All these circumstances make out that the claim set up by the\n\nelection petitioner is improbalized by the respondent.       Further,\n\nadmittedly, he was not present at the time of re-presentation. The\n\npresentation includes re-presentation and when the law insists for\n\nphysical presence as and when there was presentation. The physical\n\npresence is also essential at the time of re-presentation.\n\nTherefore, the election petitioner has not substantially complied\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/33494092/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 81 (1)</a> of the Act. Accordingly, this issue is answered\n\nagainst the election petitioner.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                     18</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_54\">                                                                     ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                        E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nAdditional issue No.2:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">32.       The main contention of the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent in this regard is that the copies which are accompanied\n\nwith the election petition are only bearing the signature of the\n\nelection petitioner and there is no incorporation of words &#x27;true\n\ncopy&#x27;, which amounts to non-compliance of <a href=\"/doc/308266/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 81(3)</a> of the\n\nAct. It is also his contention that copies served to the respondent\n\ncontain blanks in verification. Therefore, he sought dismissal of the\n\nelection petition on this ground alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"68057\" id=\"span_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"877458\" id=\"span_45\">33.       On the contrary, learned counsel for the election petitioner\n\nhas contended that there is signature of the election petitioner on\n\nthe copies served to the respondent, and mere omission of words\n\n&#x27;true copy&#x27; is not fatal to the case. He has further contended that\n\nit is not the case of the respondent that copies received were not\n\nsubstantially similar to the original election petition and Annexures\n\nfiled in the Court.       As there was substantial compliance, the\n\nelection petition cannot be dismissed on that ground. He has relied\n\nupon the decisions of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/877458/\" id=\"a_30\">Umesh Challiyill v. K.P.\n\nRajendran5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68057/\" id=\"a_31\">Mithilesh Kumar Pandey v. Baidyanath Yadav6</a>.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">5</span>\n    (2008) 11 SCC 740\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">6</span>\n    (1984) 2 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                    19</span>\n                                                                      ML,J</span></span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                         E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">34.      A reading of the above decisions, it is clear that the defects\n\nin verification, non-serving of proper copies and non-bearing of\n\nsignatures in the papers of the election petition at one or two\n\nplaces are minor defects which are curable. But, in the true copies\n\nif any vital and material variations are found from the original\n\npetition, the election petition suffers from fatality.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166715821\" id=\"span_50\">35.

C.Poulose7</a> and held that the\n\ntest to determine whether a copy was a true one or not was to find\n\nout whether any variation from the original was calculated to\n\nmislead a reasonable person. It is further held that the word &#x27;copy&#x27;\n\ndoes not mean absolutely exact copy. It means, a copy so true that\n\nnobody can by any possibility misunderstand it.          The true test\n\nwhether the copy is a true or not is whether any variation from the\n\noriginal is calculated to mislead an ordinary person.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">36.      In the present case, there is signature of the election\n\npetitioner on the copy served to the respondent, which is not in\n\ndispute. The words &#x27;true copy&#x27; are missing.

If the Court\n\nfeels that the defects are not material defects and they are\n\ncurable, the Court can extend the time as held by the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/139450230/\" id=\"a_67\">Abdulrasakh</a>&#x27;s case (cited 20th supra).

In the present case, though the Assistant Registrar had no\n\npower, he extended the time.         For such a mistake, the election\n\npetitioner cannot be made to suffer.

There are\n\nno details with regard to the person actually involved in\n\nreplacement of affidavit except general allegation that the\n\nrespondent, in connivance with the Returning Officer, replaced the\n\naffidavit. The act of replacement amounts to malpractice. The\n\nbasis for such an allegation was Ex.X-3, report of District Revenue\n\nOfficer, Mahabubnagar, dated 11.12.2021 and such report reference\n\nis also not pleaded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">58.

There is a deletion of some data. According to\n\nreport of P.W.6, this must have been done by the Returning Officer.\n\nThe cross-examination of P.W.6 shows that such a conclusion was\n\narrived on the basis of information given by Murali and Kiran, staff\n\nof election section of Returning Officer.      They worked in the\n\nelection duties at the relevant point of time.     The evidence of\n\nP.W.7, the Returning Officer, shows that there is no deletion.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                  30</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">                                                                   ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                      E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">59.   The case of the election petitioner is not with regard to\n\ndeletion, but with regard to replacement of the affidavit. There is\n\nno evidence of replacement of the affidavit and it is a case of\n\nalleged deletion.       The clarification made by the Election\n\nCommissioner shows that certain information, which is not relavant,\n\ndo not visible online and same cannot be said to be deleted. The\n\nproper persons to explain about the deletion are Murali and Kiran,\n\nbut they were not examined. The evidence of P.W.6 and report is\n\nbased hear-say evidence. Such evidence is contrary to the evidence\n\nof P.W.7, the Returning Officer. Therefore, it is not established\n\nthat there is replacement of any affidavit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">60.   In the course of arguments, learned counsel for the election\n\npetitioner has not pressed issue No.2 in view of the clarification\n\nmade by the Election Commissioner.

Out of\n\nthem, two documents are dated 02.09.2014, but the document\n\nNo.7704/2011 relating to land admeasuring Ac.0-31 guntas in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                  32</span>\n                                                                    ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                       E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nSy.No.259 was referred. According to him, this amounts to non-\n\ndisclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_127\">64.     Learned counsel for the respondent has contended that the\n\nrespondent purchased the total extent of land admeasuring Ac.5-34\n\nguntas in the above survey numbers under the seven sale deeds.\n\nOut of them, two sale deeds dated 02.09.2014 and other five sale\n\ndeeds     are   dated   05.01.2015,   06.08.2015,   09.10.2015     and\n\n20.09.2016.     The alleged non-disclosure of land admeasuring\n\nAc.0-31 guntas forms part of Ac.5-34 guntas.          This has been\n\nadmitted by P.W.1 in his cross examination.         According to the\n\nlearned counsel for the respondent, the only grievance of the\n\nelection petitioner is that when two sale deeds are of same date,\n\nthe election petitioner ought to have referred two dates, but not a\n\nsingle date.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">65.     The admission of P.W.1 shows that entire extent of lands\n\nrelating to Palankonda village covering Sy.Nos.258, 259, 268 and\n\n269 are Ac.5-34 guntas. Ac.0-31 guntas of land is also part of total\n\nextent of Ac.5-34 guntas. There is complete disclosure of entire\n\nextent of land held by the spouse of the respondent relating to\n\nPalakonda village covering the above said survey numbers.

According to him, when\n\nthe dates of sales are mentioned, the respondent should have\n\nmentioned two dates i.e., 02.09.2014 and 02.09.2014. This stand\n\nof the election petitioner appears to be illogical. In Form No.26,\n\nthere is no requirement of mentioning the sale deed document\n\nnumbers. Total extent of land purchased by spouse is mentioned\n\nand dates of purchase are also mentioned. They are substantial\n\ncompliance. There is no suppression. Therefore, this Court finds\n\nthat the details of the immovable properties are correctly\n\ndisclosed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_131\">66.

The\n\ndefence of the respondent is that the spouse is having independent\n\nbusiness and he is not participating in such business and having no\n\nknowledge about availment of mortgaged loan by his spouse.\n\nSimilarly, he took the defence that he has no knowledge that\n\naccount was still in operative relating to State Bank of India,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                   34</span>\n                                                                       ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                                          E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nErragadda Branch, Hyderabad.

The jurisdiction of the Election Commission is wide enough to\n        include all powers necessary for smooth conduct of elections and\n        the word &#x27;elections&#x27; is used in a wide sense to include the entire\n        process of election which consists of several stages and embraces\n        many steps.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">        2. The limitation on plenary character of power is when the\n        Parliament or State Legislature has made a valid law relating to or in\n        connection with elections, the Commission is required to act in\n        conformity with the said provisions. In case where law is silent,\n        <a href=\"/doc/950881/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 324</a> is a reservoir of power to act for the avowed purpose of\n        having free and fair election. Constitution has taken care of leaving\n        scope for exercise of residuary power by the Commission in its own\n        right as a creature of the Constitution in the infinite variety of\n        situations that may emerge from time to time in a large democracy,\n        as every contingency could not be foreseen or anticipated by the\n        enacted laws or the rules. By issuing necessary directions\n        Commission can fill the vacuum till there is legislation on the\n        subject. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"109582941\" id=\"span_128\">In <a href=\"/doc/109582941/\" id=\"a_72\">Kanhiya Lal Omar</a>&#x27;s case, the Court construed the\n        expressions &quot;superintendence, direction and control&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/359300/\" id=\"a_73\">Article\n        324(1)</a> and held that a direction may mean an order issued to a\n        particular individual or a precept which may have to follow and it\n        may be a specific or a general order and such phrase should be\n        construed liberally empowering the election commission to issue\n        such orders.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">        3.

Fair election contemplates disclosure by the candidate of\n        his past including the assets held by him so as to give a proper\n        choice to the candidate according to his thinking and opinion. As\n        stated earlier, in Common Cause case (supra), the Court dealt with a\n        contention that elections in the country are fought with the help of\n        money power which is gathered from black sources and once elected\n        to power, it becomes easy to collect tons of black money, which is\n        used for retaining power and for re-election.

To maintain the purity of elections and in particular to bring\ntransparency in the process of election, the Commission can ask the\ncandidates about the expenditure incurred by the political parties\nand this transparency in the process of election would include\ntransparency of a candidate who seeks election or re-election. In a\ndemocracy, the electoral process has a strategic role.

However, such\n\nevidence is lacking in the present case. The only evidence adduced\n\nby the election petitioner is that such disclosure was not made in\n\nForm No.26.     The disclosure of such facts would arise when the\n\nperson who did not disclose had knowledge about existence of such\n\na fact. Existence of fact to the knowledge of the respondent must\n\nbe established by the election petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">74.   In this case, such evidence is lacking.

The other ground raised by the election petitioner is that the\n\nrespondent has not disclosed the loan pertaining to Toyota Fortuner\n\nbearing registration No.TS-0-6EL-6666 from HDFC Bank, Ranigunj\n\nBranch, Secunderabad.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                   40</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">                                                                      ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                                         E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">76.   There is no doubt that the respondent had obtained loan from\n\nHDFC Bank, Ranigunj Branch, Secunderabad, for purchase of the\n\nsaid car and the said car is in the name of the respondent. It is also\n\nadmitted fact that in paragraph No.8 of Form No.26 with reference\n\nto the loans of the respondent with the banks/financial institutions,\n\nit is shown as &#x27;nil&#x27;. In fact, there is a loan standing to the credit of\n\nthe respondent. The defence of the respondent in this regard is\n\nthat he was under the impression that his loan was cleared. This\n\ncontention is untenable for the reason that when the respondent\n\nwas conscious about the hypothecation and loan period, he cannot\n\ncontend that he was under the impression that all installments are\n\ncleared since payment of monthly installments are by electronic\n\nprocess.

One of such acts is that threatening to\n\ncandidate or any elector or any person in whom candidate or an\n\nelector is interested, with injury of any kind including social\n\nostracism and excommunication or expulsion from any caste or\n\ncommunity. The other acts of inducement or attempt to induce a\n\ncandidate or an elector to believe that he or any person in whom he\n\nis interested will become or will be rendered an object of divine\n\ndispleasure or spiritual censure.

Further, <a href=\"/doc/47448231/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 100(2)</a> of the Act carves out an exception\n\nthat if the High Court is satisfied that no corrupt practice was\n\ncommitted at the election by the candidate or his election agent\n\nand every such corrupt practice was committed without consent of\n\nthe candidate or his election agent, then the High Court may decide\n\nthat the election of the returned candidate is not void.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                   46</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">                                                                     ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                                        E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">86.   The word &#x27;undue influence&#x27; was also found in <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 16</a> of\n\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872, which is also one of the grounds to\n\nvitiate the free consent of party to the contract. The presumption\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 16</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, with regard to\n\nundue influence is available. &quot;Undue influence&quot; generally means,\n\none of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other\n\nand uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_182\">87.   <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 123 (2)</a> of the Act defines undue influence in general\n\nand certain acts are presumed to constitute undue influence and\n\nsuch presumption is rebuttable.        Non-disclosure of assets and\n\nliabilities are not acts and omissions falling under the proviso, so as\n\nto extend the presumption with regard to undue influence. This\n\nmeans, undue influence must be pleaded and proved by the party,\n\nwho assails the election of the returned candidate.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">88.   Undue influence in the context of <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 123 (2)</a> of the Act\n\nin general, required any direct or indirect interference or attempt\n\nto interfere by the candidate or his agent, or of any other person\n\nwith the consent of the candidate or his election agent, with the\n\nfree exercise of any electoral right. In the context of facts in the\n\npresent case, non-disclosed information is car loan and withholding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                      47</span>\n                                                                          ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                                             E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\nof such information must be proved to have created any direct or\n\nindirect interference with free exercise of any electoral right. This\n\nmeans such acts and omissions of withholding information must\n\nhave elated the position of returned candidate to dominate the will\n\nof the electors and uses such position either directly or indirectly to\n\nobtain an unfair advantage by causing or attempt to cause\n\ninterference in free exercise of any electoral right of voters.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_184\">89.    In this regard, it is relevant to refer <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 83</a> of the Act,\n\nwhich reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      83.

A reading of above provision, it is clear that whenever corrupt\n\npractice is pleaded, full particulars of such corrupt practice, date\n\nand place of such corrupt practice must be pleaded and separate\n\naffidavit has to be filed in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_186\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_187\">91.   In the present case, the election petitioner did not plead\n\ncorrupt practice and did not file any affidavit indicating allegation\n\nof corrupt practice. Further, petitioner has not placed any evidence\n\nto show how non-disclosure created undue influence and vitiated\n\nfree exercise of electoral rights of any voters. This must be proved\n\nby placing some evidence. The presumption of undue influence is\n\nnot available infavour of the election petitioner.          Absolutely,\n\nevidence is lacking in the present case. There is no evidence from\n\nany voter who exercised his electoral right in favour of returned\n\ncandidate to say that if such information was disclosed, he would\n\nnot have casted his vote in favour of returned candidate.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\">92.   Form-26 shows that the respondent disclosed criminal\n\nantecedent.     Similarly, the respondent has also disclosed the\n\nvehicle which is in his name and ownership document (Registration\n\nCertificate) reflects endorsement of hypothecation to HDFC Bank.\n\nThere is no evidence that there were any defaults in payment of\n\nloan amount. The evidence also shows that from the entire loan\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                  49</span>\n                                                                    ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                                       E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\namount availed only three lakhs and odd was due by the time when\n\nthe election affidavit was filed. Most of the loan amount was\n\ncleared from the State Bank of India (Hyderabad), Secretariat\n\nBranch, Hyderabad, of the respondent. Such account shows\n\navailability of Rs.28 lakhs and odd. In the background of such facts,\n\nnon-disclosure of vehicle loan has not proved to have impacted free\n\nexercise of electoral rights by the voters. The respondent has\n\nsecured the majority of 57,775 votes in spite of disclosure of\n\ncriminal cases pending against him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_189\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_190\">93.   The evidence on record shows that the vehicle purchased by\n\nthe respondent is hypothecated.         Such endorsement was in\n\nexistence when Form No.26 was filed. However, no bank officials\n\nof HDFC Bank were introduced in the evidence. No details as to\n\nhow much loan amount was availed towards purchase and how\n\nmuch amount is still due were given. When the ownership of the\n\nvehicle is given in the affidavit, the ownership document itself\n\nindicates hypothecation of the vehicle meaning thereby existence\n\nof loan. No doubt, there is a reference of &quot;nil&quot; in the column meant\n\nfor loan obtained by the respondent from banks or financial\n\ninstitutions.   However, every act of undue influence is not corrupt\n\npractice.   When such an act of undue influence which has a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                   50</span>\n                                                                     ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                                        E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\ncapacity to affect the free exercise of electoral rights of the voters,\n\nthen only such act amounts corrupt practice. For proof of that,\n\nsome pleading and evidence is required since the presumption is not\n\navailable to the election petitioner.       Absolutely, there is no\n\nevidence on record except evidence to prove non-disclosure.\n\nTherefore, I hold that there is no corrupt practice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">94.   Non-compliance of requirement to furnish full details as\n\nrequired under Rule 4-A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961,\n\namounts to one of the grounds referred to in <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 100 (1) (d) (iv)</a>\n\nof the Act. To establish the grounds enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 100\n\n(1) (d)</a> of the Act, apart from proving of grounds, there must be\n\nevidence to show that such an act materially affected the election\n\nof the returned candidate. Seeing from the votes polled to various\n\ncandidates and majority obtained by the respondent, in spite of\n\ndisclosure of criminal antecedents, non-compliance of Rule-4A, in\n\nthe circumstances of this case has not materially affected the\n\nelection of the returned candidate. The election petitioner failed to\n\nprove that non-compliance of Rule 4-A of the Conduct of Election\n\nRules, 1961, has materially affected the election of the respondent.\n\nTherefore, the election of the respondent cannot be set aside on\n\nthe ground of non-disclosure of loan availed by the respondent.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                 51</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">                                                                   ML,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                                      E.P.No.23 of 2019</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_193\">95.
