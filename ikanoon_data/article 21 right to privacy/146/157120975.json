The contents of letter dated 04.02.2019 are\n\nthat &quot;unfortunately, even my repeated directions have had no\n\neffects. Ms. Seema Singh retired on Jan. 31st, 2019.

The ACB Department on malicious\n\ninstructions of senior officials of Department of Home namely\n\nMr. Rajeeva Swarup, the then Additional Chief Secretary\n\n(Home) who later-on was promoted to the post of Chief\n\nSecretary only acted against the accused petitioner and\n\narbitrarily, discriminatorily, illicitly, vexatious, maliciously and\n\nmalafidely did not take any action against the other personnel\n\nof the Department of the accused petitioner, despite cogent\n\nfact such as Ms. Seema Singh was the signing authority on all\n\nthose alleged documents.

Mr. Rajeeva Swarup, Addl. Chief Secretary (Home)\n\non 04.02.2019 wrote a letter to the D.G., ACB. The contents\n\nof the said letter are as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;Dear Mr. Tripathi,\n\n\nI am extremely concerned about the working in Group XI of\nHome Department and have every reason to believe that the\nofficials working in that Group are in connivance with the\ndelinquent police officials of the Rajasthan Subordinate Police\nServices and, accordingly, are putting up files with notings in\nfavour of the police officials concerned on acceptance of\ngratification.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">Under Rule 34 of the Rajasthan CCA Rules, any official\npunished by the Disciplinary Authority and aggrieved with the\norders of the Appellate Authority, may submit a Review\nPetition before the Governor. In such cases the Governor&#x27;s\nSecretariat         seeks    comments              from      the    Administrative\nDepartment, which form the basis of final decision. These\ncomments, in the case of Police office&#x27;s are dealt with in\nGroup XI of Home Department.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                        (Downloaded on 08/03/2025 at 01:00:58 AM)</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"> [2025:RJ-JP:5846]                  (30 of 68)                      [CRLMP-6395/2022]\n\n\nIn Subordinate Police Services, the Disciplinary Authority is\nspecified for each of the ranks, (Constable to Inspector),\nwhich is District SP / Range IG concerned (and in some cases\nthe DGP) and the Appellate Authority is the next higher\nofficial. The delinquent police official, in addition to the\ngrounds stated in the appeal, is also provided an opportunity\nof personal hearing in the appeal, wherein he brings to notice\nof the appellate authority the factual inconsistencies in the\npunishment order issued by the Disciplinary Authority. It is\nreasonable to expect that both the Disciplinary Authority, as\nwell as the Appellate Authority, being senior and responsible\nofficers, apply due mind and a speaking order is issued.\nAccordingly, under normal circumstances, there remains little\npossibility of the issues raised by the delinquent official in his\ndefense to remain unaddressed, first at the stage of the\ninitial isciplinary enquiry and then subsequently in appeal.\nHence, in Departmental examination, unless any major\nfactual inconsistency is evident in the order of the Appellate\nAuthority, the normal course of action in the Departmental\nnote should be to recommend rejection of the Petition.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">I was surprised to receive files where in the bulk majority of\nthe cases the Group was recommending acceptance of the\nReview Petition, and, in most cases, it was stated in the\ncomments to be sent to Raj Bhawan that the punishment be\nchanged to &quot;unwritten warning&quot;, even wherein &quot;censure&quot; had\nbeen accorded, or even when the Appellate Authority had\nreduced      the    punishment         imposed          by       the   Disciplinary\nAuthority. In one such case, the punishment had been\nimposed by the DGP and upheld by the then ACS Home with\na detailed speaking order. And even in such case the lower\nofficials presumed they had more wisdom in finding both\norders faulty and lacking due application of mind! It is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                     (Downloaded on 08/03/2025 at 01:00:58 AM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JP:5846]                     (31 of 68)                     [CRLMP-6395/2022]\n\n\npertinent     to    mention      that      &quot;unwritten             warning&quot;     is   not\nconsidered a punishment and, hence, does not affect the\nservice record or promotion.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">In going over the files, I have observed that instead of\nexamining whether any new fact of factual inconsistency was\nraised in the Review Petition which was not addressed earlier\nin the orders of the Disciplinary Authority and the Appellate\nAuthority, reliance was more placed on the plea of the\ndelinquent police official. In many instances I also observed\nthat the manner of noting and explanation of technical facts\nstated in the comments were as if written by the delinquent\npolice official concerned rather than the Group officials who\nhave little idea of police functioning and procedures at field\nlevel.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">How is it possible that the decisions of the Disciplinary\n/Appellate      Authorities      in     Police     Department           (all    senior\nofficials) of the Police Department across the State, in the\nbulk majority of the cases, are faulty?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">I called the then Joint Secretary, Ms. Seema Singh and\nverbally told her that I did not appreciate the manner of\nexamination and recommendation. Only in the exceptional\ncases where factual inconsistency is established should the\nDepartment recommend reduction / cancellation of the\npunishment imposed. This was repeated at least 4 times, on\ndifferent occasions, and on two occasions, even the Section\nOfficer concerned, Mr. Rakesh Kumar Meena, was summoned\nalong with the then JS and my directions given verbally (in\none instance on file too). I had even gone to the extent of\nindicating what implication their &quot;sympathetic&quot; comments\nhad.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                      (Downloaded on 08/03/2025 at 01:00:58 AM)</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\"> [2025:RJ-JP:5846]                  (32 of 68)                         [CRLMP-6395/2022]\n\n\nUnfortunately, even my repeated directions have had no\neffect.

The prosecution has to satisfy the court that at\n     the time of sending the matter for grant of sanction by\n     the competent authority, adequate material for such\n     grant was made available to the said authority. This\n     may also be evident from the sanction order, in case it\n     is extremely comprehensive, as all the facts and\n     circumstances of the case may be spelt out in the\n     sanction order. However, in every individual case, the\n     court has to find out whether there has been an\n     application of mind on the part of the sanctioning\n     authority concerned on the material placed before it. It\n     is so necessary for the reason that there is an\n     obligation on the sanctioning authority to discharge its\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                     (Downloaded on 08/03/2025 at 01:00:58 AM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JP:5846]                    (39 of 68)                    [CRLMP-6395/2022]\n\n\n   duty to give or withhold sanction only after having full\n   knowledge of the material facts of the case. Grant of\n   sanction is not a mere formality.

It is to be kept in mind that sanction lifts the bar\n   for prosecution. Therefore, it is not an acrimonious\n   exercise but a solemn and sacrosanct act which affords\n   protection to the government servant against frivolous\n   prosecution. Further, it is a weapon to discourage\n   vexatious prosecution and is a safeguard for the\n   innocent, though not a shield for the guilty.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1096521\" id=\"span_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86350\" id=\"span_51\">15. Consideration of the material implies application of\n   mind. Therefore, the order of sanction must ex facie\n   disclose that the sanctioning authority had considered\n   the evidence and other material placed before it. In\n   every individual case, the prosecution has to establish\n   and satisfy the court by leading evidence that those\n   facts were placed before the sanctioning authority and\n   the authority had applied its mind on the same. If the\n   sanction order on its face indicates that all relevant\n   material     i.e.   FIR,     disclosure          statements,       recovery\n   memos, draft charge-sheet and other materials on\n   record were placed before the sanctioning authority and\n   if it is further discernible from the recital of the sanction\n   order that the sanctioning authority perused all the\n   material, an inference may be drawn that the sanction\n   had been granted in accordance with law. This becomes\n   necessary in case the court is to examine the validity of\n   the order of sanction inter alia on the ground that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                       (Downloaded on 08/03/2025 at 01:00:58 AM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JP:5846]                   (40 of 68)                         [CRLMP-6395/2022]\n\n\n   order suffers from the vice of total non-application of\n   mind.

We agree that an order of sanction should not be\n     construed in a pedantic manner.

Ordinarily, the sanctioning authority is the best\n     person to judge as to whether the public servant\n     concerned should receive the protection under the Act\n     by refusing to accord sanction for his prosecution or\n     not.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     10. For the aforementioned purpose, indisputably,\n     application of mind on the part of the sanctioning\n     authority is imperative.
