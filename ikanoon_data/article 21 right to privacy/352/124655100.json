What looms before us is Lord Hale&#x27;s Ghost. Thus, the key question\n                            which arises for consideration in these matters is whether or not we should\n                            exorcize Hale&#x27;s Ghost? Hale&#x27;s formulation was embedded in the doctrine of\n                            coverture; a condition which allowed a married woman to sue only through\n                            the personality of her husband. Since then, the world has moved on. Women\n                            in most parts of the world are treated as individuals, free to enter into\n                            contracts in their own right but when it comes to sexual communion with\n                            their husbands, their consent counts for nothing. In plain words, the poser\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                              Page 4 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             before the court is: Should a husband be held criminally liable for raping his\n                            wife who is not under 18 years of age?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                            1.1.    Before I proceed further, I must state, with all humility at my\n                            command, that as I began to pen this judgment, the enormity of its impact on\n                            the society was not lost on me. I do not lay claim to being the repository of\n                            all wisdom that must be brought to bear in dealing with a sensitive issue that\n                            I am to rule on. That said, it is incumbent on courts to take decisions\n                            concerning complex social issues and not dribble past them, as that is the\n                            mandate of the Constitution and, therefore; a duty and obligation which\n                            must be discharged if one is to remain true to the oath taken under the\n                            Constitution. Thus, the mea culpa on behalf of the institution is that one way\n                            or the other the issue ought to have been laid to rest much earlier.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                            2.      As was evident to us during the hearing that both within the court and\n                            outside, people all across have views concerning the issue at hand which\n                            vary in their contour and texture depending on which side of the debate they\n                            fall on; the legal issue, though, rests in a narrow space.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                            3.      The moot point is (which is a more particularized version of what was\n                            stated right at the beginning) whether or not Exception 2 appended to\n                            <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 375</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 [hereafter referred to as &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>&#x27;]\n                            should remain on the statute. Having said that, it is the impact and its ripple\n                            effect, in law, that one is required to grapple with. Thus, those who support\n                            the proposition that Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, which is\n                            ubiquitously referred to as Marital Rape Exception [hereafter referred to as\n                            &#x27;MRE&#x27;] should be struck down, broadly, contend that it is an archaic\n                            provision which represents the most abhorrent vestiges of colonialism while\n                            those who argue that the provision should be retained on the statute, contend\n                            that striking down the provision is fraught with the danger of disrupting\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                       Page 5 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             marital and familial relationships, triggering misuse of law and transgression\n                            of the Constitutional periphery within which the courts are obliged to\n                            function.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                            4.      At this juncture, I must also advert to the fact that those who seek\n                            striking down of MRE i.e., Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, in\n                            consonance with the arguments advanced qua the said provision, also seek\n                            striking down of <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 376B</a> which concerns sexual intercourse by a\n                            separated husband with his wife, albeit, without her consent. Consequently,\n                            prayer is also made for striking down <a href=\"/doc/73825649/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 198B</a> of the Code of Criminal\n                            Procedure, 1973 [hereafter referred to as the &#x27;Code&#x27;] which prohibits a court\n                            from taking cognizance of an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 376B</a> of the\n                            IPC except upon satisfaction of the facts which constitute the offence once a\n                            complaint is lodged by the wife against her husband.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                            5.

This submission is made in the backdrop of the following broad\n                            averments made in the writ petition : that the petitioner is married to one Ms\n                            Alina i.e., respondent no.2, and that at the point in time, when the petitioner\n                            i.e., Mr Farhan and Ms Alina/respondent no.2 entered into sexual\n                            communion in the first instance, the latter was about 15 years of age. In\n                            other words, based on <a href=\"/doc/1325952/\" id=\"a_23\">Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) and Muslim Personal\n                            Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937</a> [in short &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1325952/\" id=\"a_24\">Shariat Act</a>&quot;] which accords\n                            pre-eminence to the former, the stand taken is that the provisions of the\n                            <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_25\">POCSO Act</a> would have no impact on MRE.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">                            6.4.

The charge against the proposition that the impugned provisions\n                            should be struck down was led by Mr J. Sai Deepak, who appeared for the\n                            intervenor - Men Welfare Trust (MWT) and Mr R.K. Kapoor, who\n                            represented another applicant i.e., an NGO by the name Hridaya.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">                            9.      The arguments of Mr Deepak, broadly paraphrased, were as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                            9.1.    MWT is not opposed to the criminalization of spousal sexual\n                            offences, especially, non-consensual sex between spouses or those in spouse\n                            like relationships. MWT does not contend that husbands/men have a right to\n                            impose themselves on their wives/spouses sighting marriage, as be all and\n                            end all of, implied consent to every marital privilege including sexual\n                            intercourse. That being said, trust, dignity and respect which form the basis\n                            of a marriage is a two-way street. A multilayered and multivariable nature of\n                            a marital relationship has been reduced by the petitioners to one singular\n                            issue i.e., consent; a proposition with which MWT disagrees. MWT\n                            propounds a more calibrated position. Thus, MWT&#x27;s objections to the writ\n                            actions are, principally, the following :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                            (i)     The prayers made in the writ petition are beyond the scope of this\n                            court&#x27;s jurisdiction and/or power that it may wield under any law or the\n                            Constitution since the prayers if granted would create a new class/specie of\n                            offence which is beyond the power of judicial review conferred on this\n                            court.

Therefore, if this court were to grant the prayers sought by the\n                            petitioners, it would have the effect of keeping the Republic outside the pale\n                            of participation in law and policymaking on a sensitive social issue thereby\n                            truncating fundamental rights as well as empowering an &quot;unelected body&quot; to\n                            undertake an exercise which is beyond its constitutional mandate and\n                            expertise. The striking down of MRE would result in the creation of a new\n                            offence without considering its social impact. There is a need to create an\n                            ecosystem to deal with the issue at hand, such as the provision of a\n                            &quot;definition&quot;, &quot;processes&quot;, &quot;safeguards&quot;, &quot;evidentiary standards&quot;, &quot;forums&quot;\n                            amongst others; none of which the court is equipped to forge or prescribe.\n                            The court is, thus, a sub-optimal forum for considering a variety of\n                            perspectives that are not only legal but also social and cultural. The court by\n                            its very construct does not allow the participation of multiple stakeholders\n                            which is why the creation of a new class of offence is beyond its\n                            constitutional remit involving judicial review. The proceeding at hand is a\n                            textbook case in point since it has not allowed for inputs from various\n                            legitimate stakeholders who are better qualified to weigh in on the subject\n                            beyond the narrow and incomplete confines of legality and constitutionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                            (iii)   Since the learned Amici, lean in favour of the position adopted by the\n                            petitioners, in the interest of balance and natural justice, inputs ought to have\n                            been sought from other Amicus Curiae as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">                            (iv)    It is emphasized that while MWT does not question the right of\n                            learned Amici to hold and present their position on the issue at hand,\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                        Page 9 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             additional Amicis should have been appointed to present a more diverse\n                            perspective.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                            (v)     MRE does not in any manner envisage or require a wife to submit to\n                            forced sex by the husband and does not encourage a husband to impose\n                            himself on the wife; contrary to what the petitioners contend. It is important\n                            to note that there are remedies available to address non-consensual sex\n                            between spouses, something which is apparent on a plain reading of Section\n                            376B and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC as also the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_27\">Protection of\n                            Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</a> [hereafter referred to as &quot;<a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_28\">D.V.\n                            Act</a>&quot;].

While MWT has\n                            actively campaigned for gender-neutral laws and the preservation of the\n                            institution of marriage, the petitioners have sought gender-specific prayers\n                            and the creation of gender-specific offences at the expense of marital\n                            institutions. The abuse of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC has\n                            been recognised by the courts and, therefore, there is a need to introduce\n                            gender-neutrality in the sphere of sexual violence. Therefore, if MRE is\n                            struck down, it would only add to the existing inequities and injustice. Thus,\n                            the appropriate forum would be the legislature as the enactment of law\n                            requires the formulation of policy which ought to be informed by a baseline\n                            study and not mere legal arguments. Since this court has taken up the matter\n                            after seven years and it has taken over two months to hear legal submissions,\n                            the legislature is surely entitled to, being accorded sufficient time to\n                            undertake consultation with the States and various public interest groups and\n                            organisations which operate in this space.

In this context, it was contended that a bare perusal of\n                            paragraphs 1 and 190 of the judgment would show: firstly, that the court<a href=\"/doc/87705010/\" id=\"a_52\">, <a href=\"/doc/87705010/\" id=\"a_53\">in\n                            that case</a></a>, had confined its discussion to the issue concerning whether sexual\n                            intercourse between a man and his wife being a girl between 15 and 18 years\n                            of age would tantamount to rape.

The\n                            court&#x27;s anxiety was to do away with the immunity granted to men who marry\n                            girls under the age of 18 when <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_56\">POCSO Act</a> defined a child as a person who\n                            was below 18 years of age. According to the court, the problem was\n                            compounded since <a href=\"/doc/136804760/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 42A</a> of POCSO Act provides that it would\n                            override all other legislations. It is in this context that the Supreme Court\n                            read down MRE with respect to a girl child falling between 15 and 18 years\n                            of age.

The legislature has\n                            consistently given sui generic treatment to the institution of marriage and,\n                            therefore, the wisdom of the legislature needs to be respected. Although the\n                            impugned provisions have a colonial legacy, they should be presumed to be\n                            constitutional unless demonstrated otherwise by the challenger.

The petitioners have failed to cite a single document that would\n                            demonstrate that after coming into force of the Constitution, the legislature\n                            has retained MRE by relying upon the Doctrine of Coverture. Therefore, in\n                            the absence of any supporting material, to use patriarchy in the argument\n                            qua MRE vis-a-vis the Indian Legislature as well as the Indian society at\n                            large is to impute &quot;colonial attitudes&quot; on &quot;Bhartiya society&quot;, albeit, without\n                            basis.

A sexual offence committed by a person who is\n                            not a spouse or is a stranger attracts the provisions of Section 375. Likewise,\n                            gang rape attracts the provisions of Section 376D.

Furthermore, sexual offences committed by\n                            a husband after legal separation or de facto separation attract the provisions\n                            of <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 376B</a> of the IPC.

That being said it cannot\n                            be said that there is no remedy available for non-consensual sex or spousal\n                            sexual violence. [See provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_87\">Sections 377</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_88\">498A</a> of IPC.]\n                            (xxiv) The acts referred to in Clauses (a) to (d) of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 375</a> of the IPC are\n                            deemed as sexual acts and, therefore, are not per se illegal and also outside\n                            the remit of unnatural offences within the meaning of Section 377. What\n                            makes the sexual acts illegal is when they fall under any of the seven\n                            circumstances outlined in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 375</a> of the IPC. Therefore, consent is not\n                            the sole deciding factor. What determines whether or not the sexual act is an\n                            offence are the circumstances set forth in Section 375. In other words,\n                            circumstances/context determine the nature of consent or its absence. In\n                            contradiction, the sexual act between a separated husband and wife whether\n                            under a decree of separation or otherwise is premised on the consent of the\n                            wife. This distinction is not based on patriarchal consideration but has\n                            practical connotations since it is next to impossible to establish the absence\n                            of consent given the intimate nature of the relationship between spouses and\n                            possibly the absence of eye-witness accounts. It is for this reason that the\n                            absence of consensual conjugal relationships is easier to presume in the\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                      Page 19 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             event of legal or de facto separation. This is also the reason why preliminary\n                            enquiry is required to be carried out under Section 198B of the Code to\n                            assess if couples live apart while residing under the same roof before\n                            booking the husband for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 376B</a> of the IPC. Given\n                            the age of sexual liberation that we live in, it is not possible to conclude\n                            whether the wife was exposed to sexual cruelty or non-consensual sex. In\n                            other words, even the presence of bruises or injury cannot automatically lead\n                            to an adverse conclusion as they could be merely a manifestation of passion\n                            that may subsist between spouses when they indulge in sexual acts.\n                            Therefore, State&#x27;s intervention through the legislative route is required to\n                            balance individual dignity and prevent the possibility of abuse of legal\n                            remedies which may end up harming an individual&#x27;s dignity/reputation.\n                            (xxv) The argument that consent alone matters and marriage changes\n                            nothing in this regard is legally and practically baseless. The marriage is\n                            accompanied by obligations that the partners have to bear which inter alia\n                            include conjugal expectations, financial obligations and, finally, duty\n                            towards progeny. If these aspects are kept in mind then it cannot be said that\n                            the institution of marriage cannot form the basis of sustaining MRE. A\n                            careful reading of the language employed in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_92\">Sections 375</a> and <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_93\">376B</a> of the\n                            IPC would show that the expression &quot;will&quot; and &quot;consent&quot; although related\n                            are not identical which explains the reason for the use of &quot;without consent&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                            in <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 376B</a> of IPC. In a marital relationship, since conjugal expectation\n                            is a two-way street, partners may choose to accede to, sexual acts for a\n                            variety of reasons and not all of them would necessarily amount to cruelty.\n                            In such circumstances, consent is given as a part of spousal intimacy\n                            although the will to engage may be absent.

This would be a blinkered approach\n                            to consent without having regard for the context.\n                            (xxvi) Besides the remedies available in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_95\">IPC</a>, victims of spousal violence can\n                            also take recourse to the provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_96\">D.V.

Act only provide\n                            for civil remedies is belied if one were to have regard to <a href=\"/doc/2865164/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 19(2)</a> of the\n                            said act. The said provision empowers the magistrate &quot;to pass any other\n                            direction which he may deem reasonably necessary to protect or provide for\n                            the safety of the aggrieved person&quot;. As a matter of practice, the magistrates\n                            routinely issue directions for the registration of FIR under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 498A</a>,\n                            <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_101\">376B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_102\">377</a> of the IPC. Therefore, to claim that there is an absence of\n                            criminal remedies concerning non-consensual sex is incorrect. Sufficiency\n                            and adequacy of remedies fall within the ken of the legislature. The\n                            difference in punishment to be accorded for spousal sexual violence and\n                            other safeguards such as limitation is a conscious legislative call taken\n                            having regard to the special status of marital relationships under the IPC and\n                            D.V.

Illustratively, the\n                            same offence committed by an adult instead of a juvenile results in different\n                            outcomes. Likewise, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_105\">POCSO Act</a> are illustrative of the\n                            fact that the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_106\">IPC</a> is not blind to context, relationships, age or other valid\n                            aspects. Therefore, the legislature has consciously avoided using the word\n                            rape in the context of spousal relationships, not to protect the spouse but\n                            those connected with them, namely, families and the progeny.\n                            (xxvii)         The marital institution is a legitimate concern of the State.

Furthermore, every policy disagreement cannot\n                            be escalated to the threshold of unconstitutionality and courts cannot be used\n                            as instrumentalities to upset policy decisions merely because a certain cross-\n                            section of the society disagrees with them. Although disagreements are\n                            expected in democracy, not all disagreements demonstrate and/or establish\n                            the unconstitutionality of a provision. Critically, the judiciary cannot treat\n                            such disagreements with policy as proof of unconstitutionality. The\n                            decisions of the legislature must be preserved and defended to the extent\n                            possible and wherever necessary through purposive interpretation.\n                            (xxviii)        The petitioner&#x27;s contention that international norms and\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                        Page 22 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             standards should be taken into account while ruling on the issue at hand\n                            ignores the safeguards which are provided, for instance, in the Sexual\n                            Offences Act enacted in 2003 by the United Kingdom. <a href=\"/doc/168582861/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 1</a> of the said\n                            Act allows the accused to raise a defence that he was under a reasonable\n                            belief that sexual intercourse with the alleged victim was consensual.\n                            Likewise, <a href=\"/doc/136777253/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 23</a> of the very same Act exempts spousal and civil\n                            partners from the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/81635226/\" id=\"a_109\">Sections 16</a> to <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_110\">19</a> which relate to abuse of\n                            a position of trust. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"188155617\" id=\"span_52\">The said Act also spells out evidentiary standards and\n                            circumstances in which conclusive presumptions may be drawn. <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_111\">The Act</a>\n                            envisages Standard Operating Procedures for the prosecution of cases\n                            concerning an allegation of rape. <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_112\">The Act</a> is gender-neutral.\n                            (xxix) Likewise, the reliance placed by the petitioners on the judgment of the\n                            European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in <a href=\"/doc/188155617/\" id=\"a_113\">C.R. v.

Nepal has\n                            brought in several procedural safeguards when the law on spousal sexual\n                            violence was finally introduced by the legislature which included\n                            enunciation of legal proceedings within 35 days of the commission of the\n                            alleged offence.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                            (xxxi) Importantly, Nepal&#x27;s legislation is also gender-neutral.

None of the\n                            international instruments cited by the petitioners envisage the creation of\n                            offences by the judiciary and critically they address the issue of sexual\n                            dignity and violence in gender-neutral terms.\n                            (xxxii) In sum, MWT does not oppose the recognition of spousal sexual\n                            violence. Its position is spousal sexual violence stands already criminalised\n                            and, therefore, the grievance concerning inadequacy can only be addressed\n                            by the legislature and not the judiciary. Inadequacy or perceived inadequacy\n                            is a matter which falls within the ken of the legislature and cannot become a\n                            ground for a constitutional challenge.

In the said written submissions,\n                            according to Mr Gonsalves, UOI had taken the position that it was,\n                            therefore, necessary to implead various State Governments to obtain their\n                            opinion and avoid complications that may arise at a later stage.

In this context, it was pointed out that Ms Khushboo Saifi was a\n                            married woman of 27 years of age. She had got into an arranged marriage\n                            with, one, Mr Aizaz Saifi on 04.12.2016 and, at that juncture, she was\n                            pursuing a course in Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from Indira Gandhi National\n                            Open University.

It was emphasized that Ms Saifi was not\n                            provided medical aid either by her husband or by her in-laws and that she\n                            was not allowed to use her mobile phone. The only way that she could\n                            communicate with the outside world was through her husband&#x27;s phone and\n                            even these conversations were recorded. Mr Gonsalves pointed out that it is\n                            in these circumstances that she approached an NGO for shelter, which led to\n                            Ms Saifi filing an FIR with Crime Against Women (CAW) Cell at South-\n                            East District, Srinivas Puri, Delhi, on 12.06.2017.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_52\">                            15.      Besides facts involving Ms Saifi, Mr Gonsalves also made the\n                            following general submissions. Mr Gonsalves prefaced his arguments with\n                            the issues that, according to him, arose for consideration in the instant cases,\n                            which, in effect, were also the broad contours of his submissions.\n                            15.1. Firstly, according to him, MRE was manifestly arbitrary as it sought\n                            to decriminalise a crime as heinous as rape.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">                            15.2. Secondly, <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 376B</a> of the IPC was unconstitutional since it\n                            created a distinction between husbands, who are not separated from their\n                            wives and those who are separated by bringing the latter class of husbands\n                            within the definition of rape in respect of forced sexual intercourse under\n                            Section 375 and, at the same time, assigned lesser punishment for such a\n                            crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">                            15.3. Thirdly, rape is a heinous crime that has multiple consequences\n                            including mental trauma and severe adverse medical effects. It would be\n                            arbitrary to decriminalize marital rape on the ground that by entering into\n                            matrimony, a woman consents to a continued sexual relationship from which\n                            she cannot retract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">                            15.4.

Fifthly, marriage cannot be a relevant consideration in concluding\n                            whether a criminal offence has been committed or not.\n                            15.6. Sixthly, the rape of a woman by her husband was unconstitutional,\n                            right from inception and is being put to test only now.\n                            15.7. Seventhly, in any event, having regard to the passage of time and a\n                            better understanding of gender equality, MRE should not be permitted to\n                            remain on the statute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\">                            15.8. Eighthly, the distinction sought to be drawn between western and\n                            Indian values insofar as marital rape is concerned, is untenable in law. There\n                            is no truth in the submission that Indian society is somehow superior to\n                            western societies and that marital rape is not known in India.\n                            15.9. Ninthly, this court should not desist from examining the\n                            constitutionality of the impugned provisions only because it is impossible to\n                            prove the occurrence of marital rape as at times it happens within the\n                            confines of a household.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">                            15.10. Tenthly, this court should also not desist from examining the\n                            constitutionality of MRE only because some women may file a false\n                            complaint against their husbands.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">                            16.     Elaborating upon the aforementioned submissions, Mr Gonsalves\n                            submitted that the distinction drawn concerning the offence of rape between\n                            those who are married as against those persons who are unmarried, was\n                            unmerited. The classification, according to him, had no rational nexus to the\n                            object sought to be achieved if the legislative policy on rape is to be taken\n                            forward. Insofar as the constitutional courts are concerned, they have to only\n                            examine whether the impugned provisions stand the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_212\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_213\">, 15</a>\n                            and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_214\">21</a> of the Constitution.

The submission that in marriage there is an &quot;expectation of sex&quot; i.e., a\n                            right to have sex absent consent would amount to resurrecting the Ghost of\n                            Lord Hale. Marriage merely gives social sanction to sex between adults.\n                            Procreation that follows such sexual union also receives acceptability from\n                            society. Therefore, a husband may &quot;expect sex&quot; but from there to argue that\n                            he would have the right to demand sex from a woman merely because she is\n                            in marriage with him, bereft of love, for satisfying carnal desire and\n                            procreation, is morally and legally untenable as it institutionalizes violence\n                            within the family. It is, therefore, the duty of a constitutional court to end\n                            such institutional violence against women.

[See Independent Thought at paragraph 75.]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"514077\" id=\"span_127\">52.     &#x27;Fair labelling&#x27; is an important part of criminal law jurisprudence. The\n                            label should give sufficient information to the public at large as regards the\n                            offence that is committed. It plays an educative and declaratory function\n                            and, thus, in a way, reinforces the standards that the society may have set for\n                            itself. It also helps in establishing the principle of proportionality as the\n                            criminal justice system needs to provide for punishment that is proportionate\n                            to the gravity of the offence. A fair label plays an important role in\n                            expressing social disapproval of certain sorts of sexual offences; rape being\n                            one of them. Thus, helps, in a sense, the perpetrator, the victim as also the\n                            prosecution and the defence in grappling with the offence and its\n                            consequences. Fair labelling enables criminal justice professionals, judges\n                            and other stakeholders to make fair and sensible decisions [See Andrew\n                            Ashworth &amp; Jeremy Horder, Principles of Criminal Law, Seventh Edition,\n                            2003 at page 25; Scottish Law Commission&#x27;s Discussion Paper on Rape and\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                       Page 51 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             other Sexual Offences, at paragraph 4.16; also see <a href=\"/doc/514077/\" id=\"a_275\">State of Karnataka v.\n                            Appa Balu Ingale &amp; Ors.</a>, 1995 Supp (4) SCC 469.]\n                            52.1. The attempt of the prosecution to seek conviction for rape in the guise\n                            of grievous hurt or cruelty is like attempting to fit a square peg in a round\n                            hole. The ingredients of offences such as grievous hurt, outraging the\n                            modesty of a woman and cruelty are substantially different from that of rape.\n                            Over the years, rape laws in India have evolved to the extent that victims are\n                            entitled to protection and support from the State. However, because marital\n                            rape is not called out as rape; generally, it enables States to shirk\n                            responsibility and accord the same level of care and protection which is\n                            given to a woman who is raped by a person other than her husband.

Thus, non-consensual sexual intercourse which is not\n                            accompanied by physical violence may disable a victim-wife from\n                            prosecuting her husband for cruelty under Section 498A, for hurt under\n                            Section 323 and 326 or for outraging her modesty under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_280\">Section 354</a> of the\n                            IPC.

Since MRE was on the statute when the said provision was\n                            inserted, the courts would take recourse to the mischief rule or apply the\n                            principles of purposive construction and could thus hold the expression\n                            &quot;relative&quot; would not bring by default a spouse within the ambit of Section\n                            376(2)(f). The courts could also apply the doctrine of noscitur a sociis and\n                            hold that since the expression &quot;relative&quot; appears in the company of\n                            expressions such as &quot;guardian&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; or a person in a position of\n                            &quot;trust&quot; or &quot;authority&quot;, the only relationship which would get covered under\n                            the expression &quot;relative&quot; could be that where the accused is in a position of\n                            power over the complainant akin to fiduciary trust.\n                            68.1.

Besides this, even after cases involving marital rape and assault are\n                            excluded, the data reveals that only 15% of sexual offences committed by\n                            persons other than the current husband of the victim are reported to the\n                            police.

The other argument raised on behalf of the respondents which is that\n                            striking down MRE would expose the husbands to the risk of being awarded\n                            a high mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years punishment is an argument\n                            that deserves to be rejected at the very threshold. This is so as sentencing is\n                            a matter of policy which does not fall within the realm of the court. The\n                            minimum mandatory sentence for an offence such as rape cannot be a\n                            consideration or factor in determining as to whether or not MRE is\n                            constitutionally viable. It is the court&#x27;s bounden duty to strike down a\n                            provision which is unconstitutional notwithstanding the concerns that may\n                            be raised over its perceived (dis)proportionality. That said, it is a matter of\n                            concern for several women that high mandatory minimum sentences even in\n                            the context of non-marital rape do not serve the cause of women but instead\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                      Page 59 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             lead to lesser reporting of the offence and fewer convictions. A study of\n                            judgments concerning the offence of rape rendered by trial courts in Delhi\n                            between 2013 and 2018 revealed that under the old law, the conviction rate\n                            was 16.11% whereas after the <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_315\">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013</a>, the\n                            conviction rate fell to 5.72%. The drop in conviction rate is significant and\n                            of grave concern. The sentencing policy, perhaps, needs a relook, both, by\n                            the government of the day and the parliament. The uptick in the mandatory\n                            minimum sentence has usually followed a heinous crime. The 1983\n                            amendment introduced a mandatory 7 years minimum sentence following\n                            the Mathura rape case22.

The legislative history of MRE would show that it was incorporated\n                            to protect the conjugal rights of the husband and after considerable debate, it\n                            protected wives below 10 years of age from forcible sexual abuse. Thus,\n                            even before the preparation of the draft penal code by Lord Thomas B.\n                            Macaulay in 1837, the common law excluded the wife&#x27;s consent from the\n                            sphere of sexual acts. The common law position is traceable to the Doctrine\n                            of Coverture and implied consent. According to this doctrine, the legal rights\n                            of a woman were effaced after marriage. A woman having entered\n                            matrimony was deemed as her having given irrevocable consent to\n                            participation in sexual acts with her husband.

It disregards the wife&#x27;s right to consent to\n                            sex within marriage. Resultantly, while Section 375 criminalizes sexual acts\n                            committed without the consent of a woman, it exempts husbands from being\n                            prosecuted only on account of their marital relationship with the victim.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">                            (ii)        The MRE infringes the fundamental rights of a married woman. The\n                            validity of MRE has to be tested not with reference to the object of the State\n                            action but based on its effect it has on freedoms guaranteed under the\n                            Constitution.

In this\n                            behalf, reference was also made to the sentencing regime which prevails in\n                            the United Kingdom and is governed by the provisions of the Coroners and\n                            Justice Act, 2009 and the guidelines framed thereunder by the Sentencing\n                            Council constituted under the said act.

This is particularly so because within the same legislation, the same\n                            differential i.e., marital status may be used as the basis for classification in\n                            multiple sections, for example, in <a href=\"/doc/194391/\" id=\"a_387\">Sections 136</a>, <a href=\"/doc/66955/\" id=\"a_388\">212</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1865807/\" id=\"a_389\">216</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1886841/\" id=\"a_390\">216A</a> of the\n                            IPC and, therefore, while the differentia may satisfy the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_391\">Article 14</a> in\n                            one case, it may not satisfy the test in another case such as MRE.

Since the role of an\n                            exception or proviso is to carve out something from the main provision, it\n                            can neither subsist independently nor can it nullify the object of the main\n                            provision. Therefore, the test should be applied to Section 375 as a whole\n                            and if it is so applied, it would come to fore that the differentia sought to be\n                            drawn between married and unmarried couples is both irrelevant and\n                            arbitrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">                            93.     Admittedly, the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_392\">Section 375</a> of the IPC is to punish non-\n                            consensual sexual acts - also it cannot be disputed that marital obligations,\n                            duties, rights or privileges cannot be enforced through violence or any other\n                            non-consensual acts, which would otherwise be an offence. Consequently,\n                            the classification between marital and non-marital relationships in Section\n                            375 is impermissible under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_393\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The factum of\n                            marriage would not bridge the gap between permissible and an\n                            impermissible act by treating the said fact as equivalent to conveying\n                            willingness or consent to engage in a sexual act as described in Clauses (a)\n                            to (d) of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_394\">Section 375</a> of the IPC.        Therefore, the substance of marital\n                            relationship between the offender and the victim is irrelevant for the\n                            purposes of Section 375. If, however, the opposite were true, the exception\n                            ought to have made an explicit alteration in the nature of consent that is\n                            required in a marital relationship (whether deemed or otherwise). In the\n                            absence of such provision, the court should not discover some undisclosed\n                            and unknown reason for classification which otherwise is hostile and\n                            discriminatory vis-à-vis an individual; in this case a married women victim.\n                            93.1.

The classification based on marital status creates an anomalous\n                            situation inasmuch as it gives a married woman lesser protection against\n                            non-consensual sexual intercourse by their husbands than against strangers.\n                            It also results in lesser protection than that which is available to a woman\n                            who is subjected to a non-consensual sexual act by a cohabitee or a live-in\n                            partner.

The argument that the exception needs to be retained to preserve the\n                            institution of marriage is flawed for the following reasons: First, the law\n                            itself recognizes that it cannot force parties to have sexual intercourse even\n                            if they are married. This is evident from the fact that even orders for\n                            restitution of conjugal rights can only be enforced by attaching property.\n                            [See Order XXI Rule 32 of the Code of Civil procedure, 1908 (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_402\">CPC</a>) and\n                            Saroj Rani.] Second, forced sexual intercourse in marriage, far from\n                            preserving the institution of marriage, is a reflection of what the marriage\n                            ought not to be. Marriage denotes a partnership of equals with reasonable\n                            marital privileges for both spouses. However, reasonable expectations or\n                            privileges cannot be equated with willingness or consent by default in all\n                            situations.

To my mind, this argument fails to recognize the fundamental\n                            concepts which are subsumed in our Constitution. The framers of the Indian\n                            Constitution attempted to draw the best from various constitutions and\n                            constituent documents available to them at the cusp of Independence. Some\n                            of the models that were available to the framers of our Constitutions at that\n                            juncture were (i) the United States (US) Constitution; (ii) the Constitution\n                            Acts enacted by the British Parliament establishing Federal Constitutions not\n                            only for India but countries like Canada and Australia; importantly, these\n                            documents drew inspiration from the American experience.

Thus, the framers of the Indian Constitution adopted a system of\n                            Parliamentary Executive in preference to a Presidential system adopted in\n                            the US.

The legislative business is carried out by Congress. The\n                            President is answerable only to the people who elected him. His Cabinet\n                            comprises persons who are referred to as Secretaries. Secretaries are\n                            appointed and removed by the President whereas, in India, the head of a\n                            successful party is, ordinarily, appointed as the Prime Minister whose\n                            Cabinet consists of Ministers, who are members of one or other House of the\n                            Parliament. The only exception to this prescription is when a person, who is\n                            appointed as a Minister in the Union Government and is not a member of\n                            either House of the Parliament, he is required to get elected to one or the\n                            other House of the Parliament within six months as otherwise, he would\n                            cease to be a Minister. [See <a href=\"/doc/206550/\" id=\"a_460\">Article 75(5)</a> of the Constitution.] Although, like\n                            in the US, we have a President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of the\n                            armed forces, the comparison ends there. The President in our country acts\n                            like the sovereign of Great Britain on the advice of his Ministers who are\n                            responsible to the Parliament and, who, wield the real executive power.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_198\">                            119. To appreciate the point at hand, it is important to remember that the\n                            Doctrine of Separation of Powers and the Doctrine that the Legislatures are\n                            Delegates of the People [which is the basic doctrine of the US Constitution]\n                            do not form part of the Constitution of India.

Equality, rule of law, judicial review and separation\n                                               of powers form parts of the basic structure of the\n                                               Constitution. Each of these concepts are intimately\n                                               connected. There can be no rule of law, if there is no\n                                               equality before the law. These would be meaningless if the\n                                               violation was not subject to the judicial review. All these\n                                               would be redundant if the legislative, executive and judicial\n                                               powers are vested in one organ.

The distinction between the\n                                    legislative function and judicial functions is enhanced by the\n                                    basic structure doctrine. The legislature is constitutionally\n                                    entrusted with the power to legislate. Courts are not entrusted\n                                    with the power to enact law. Yet, in a constitutional democracy\n                                    which is founded on the supremacy of the Constitution, it is an\n                                    accepted principle of jurisprudence that the judiciary has the\n                                    authority to test the validity of legislation. Legislation can be\n                                    invalidated where the enacting legislature lacks legislative\n                                    competence or where there is a violation of fundamental rights. A\n                                    law which is constitutionally ultra vires can be declared to be so\n                                    in the exercise of the power of judicial review. Judicial review is\n                                    indeed also a part of the basic features of the Constitution.\n                                    Entrustment to the judiciary of the power to test the validity of law\n                                    is an established constitutional principle which co-exists with the\n                                    separation of powers. ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_205\">                                    ...256. This discussion leads to the conclusion that while the\n                                    separation of powers, as a principle, constitutes the cornerstone\n                                    of our democratic Constitution, its application in the actual\n                                    governance of the polity is nuanced. The nuances of the doctrine\n                                    recognise that while the essential functions of one organ of the\n                                    State cannot be taken over by the other and that a sense of\n                                    institutional comity must guide the work of the legislature,\n                                    executive and judiciary, the practical problems which arise in the\n                                    unfolding of democracy can be resolved through robust\n                                    constitutional cultures and mechanisms. The separation doctrine\n                                    cannot be reduced to its descriptive content, bereft of its\n                                    normative features. Evidently, it has both normative and\n                                    descriptive features. In applying it to the Indian Constitution, the\n                                    significant precept to be borne in mind is that no institution of\n                                    governance lies above the Constitution. No entrustment of power\n                                    is absolute.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_206\">                                                                                    [Emphasis is mine.]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">                            123.

Pertinently, Clauses (a) to (d) do not confine the\n                            scope of sexual acts, described therein, to a situation where the offender\n                            himself commits those acts but also extends the ambit of those very acts\n                            when the victim is made to perform the said acts with &quot;any other person&quot;.\n                            130.1.

With Explanation 2, a proviso is appended. In addition thereto, two\n                            exceptions are carved out i.e., Exceptions 1 and 2. Exception 2 i.e., MRE is\n                            in the crosshair of instant challenge laid before the Court.\n                            130.2. Therefore, the import of the provision i.e., Section 375, at present, is\n                            as follows: That one or more sexual acts referred to in Clauses (a) to (d)\n                            would constitute rape if the victim is a woman aged 18 years and above\n                            finds herself in one or more of the seven circumstances set forth therein.\n                            130.3. The first circumstance alludes to situation when sexual act(s) are\n                            committed against her will, which, to my mind, would mean that while the\n                            woman-victim is in possession of her senses and, therefore, even though\n                            capable of giving her consent, does not give her consent to participation in\n                            the sexual act. In other words, the expression &quot;against her will&quot;, involves an\n                            element of resistance and opposition by the victim.\n                            130.4.

The aforementioned circumstance as also the other circumstances,\n                            adverted to in Section 375, has to be read with Explanation 2 which provides\n                            as to what would constitute consent. According to Explanation 2, consent\n                            means       an     unequivocal         voluntary   agreement   whereby    a    woman\n                            communicates her willingness to participate in a specific sexual act and this\n                            communication can be made via words, gestures or any form of verbal or\n                            non-verbal communication. What is important is that the proviso makes it\n                            amply clear that only because a woman does not physically resist the act of\n                            penetration, shall not, because of this fact alone, be construed that the\n                            woman-victim consented to sexual activity. Thus, mere passivity or lack of\n                            resistance to a sexual act cannot be construed as consent.\n                            131.1. To deduce consent, one would have to look at the forms of\n                            communications alluded to in Explanation 2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_232\">                            131.2.

It appears that Explanation 1 has been incorporated to\n                            dilate and perhaps remove the possibility of a defence being raised that the\n                            sexual activity, described in Clauses (a) to (d) in Section 375, did involve\n                            the concerned female&#x27;s genitalia [i.e., the vagina] and hence did not\n\n\nSignature valid             90 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_488\">IPC</a> amounting to misconception of fact.\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                            Page 102 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             constitute rape.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_233\">                            131.3.

The sub-section (2) of\n                            Section 376 covers cases of aggravated rape which include rape committed\n                            in custody39, by a relative40, guardian or teacher or by a person in a position\n                            of trust or authority, and on women placed in vulnerable circumstances41\n                            accompanied by an element of depravity.

Thus, a careful perusal of the aforementioned provisions, in particular\n                            Section 375, would demonstrate the following.\n                            135.1. Section 375 is concerned with the acts described in Clauses (a) to (d)\n                            which would morph into an offence of rape if committed in the seven\n                            circumstances, alluded to therein. Absent the seven circumstances, the acts,\n                            described in Clauses (a) to (d) of Section 375, do not acquire a criminal hue.\n                            135.2. A close reading of the circumstances would reveal that except for the\n                            sixth circumstance (which concerns a girl-child under 18 years of age),\n                            willingness (as in the first circumstance) and consent (as in the second to\n                            fifth and seventh circumstance)- form the basis of separating acts which are\n                            lawful from those which are construed as unlawful.

Therefore, whether the offender is a stranger or a partner in a live-in\n                            relationship, he would fall within the purview of the offence of rape if he\n                            commits, sexual acts with a woman victim, as described in Clauses (a) to (d)\n                            of Section 375, under the seven circumstances, adverted to hereinabove.\n                            Consequentially, every woman victim, except a married woman, has the\n                            right to trigger criminal proceedings against the offender if she is subjected\n                            to forced sexual activity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_239\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                      Page 104 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             135.3.

To answer the question as to whether a classification based on the\n                            relationship between the offender and victim is constitutionally viable, one\n                            would have to examine whether the classification has an intelligible\n                            differentia with the object which is sought to be achieved. There can be no\n                            doubt that the legislature seeks to punish offenders who are guilty of\n                            committing rape; this principle is the bedrock on which <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_493\">Section 375</a> of the\n                            IPC is founded. It cannot, perhaps, also be doubted that there is a differentia\n                            between married, separated and unmarried couples. However, what needs to\n                            be established once the differentia is accepted is : whether the differentia\n                            between married and unmarried couples has a rational nexus with the object,\n                            which the main provision seeks to achieve, that is, protecting a woman from\n                            being subjected to a sexual act against her will or her consent. MRE does not\n                            meet the nexus test as it grants impunity to an offender based on his\n                            relationship with the victim.

A\n                            &#x27;chaste woman&#x27;43 or a young girl - is more likely to be considered a &#x27;victim&#x27;;\n                            but not a married woman. A prior sexual relationship is regarded as a\n                            reasonable defence because consent is assumed; but in the case of a married\n                            woman, it is not even put to test. Sex- worker has been invested with the\n                            power to say &quot;no&quot;; by the law; but not a married woman. In a gang rape\n                            involving the husband of the victim, the co-accused will face the brunt of the\n                            rape law; but not the offending husband only because of his relationship\n                            with the victim. A married woman&#x27;s ability to say &quot;no&quot; to sexual communion\n                            with her husband when he is infected with a communicable disease or she is\n                            herself unwell finds no space in the present framework of rape law. Thus the\n                            rape law as it stands at present is completely skewed insofar as married\n                            women are concerned. To a woman who is violated by her husband by being\n                            subjected to the vilest form of sexual abuse (i.e., rape) it is no answer to say\n                            that the law provides her other remedies. When marriage is a tyranny, the\n                            State cannot have a plausible legitimate interest in saving it. In every sense,\n                            MRE, in my view, violates the equality clause contained in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_494\">Article 14</a> of the\n                            Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_495\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution not only guarantees that the State\n                            shall not deny to any person equality before the law but also guarantees that\n                            every person within the territory of India will have equal protection of the\n                            laws.

The doctrine of equality may be briefly\n                                           stated as follows: All persons are equal before the law is\n                                           fundamental of every civilised constitution.

Under Section 164A, medical\n                            examination, albeit, with the consent of the woman-victim is to be\n                            conducted by a registered medical practitioner within 24 hours of\n                            information being received with regard to commission of offence of rape,\n                            while under the first proviso appended to Section 309, the inquiry or trial\n                            relating to the offence of rape is ordinarily to be completed within two\n                            months of the date of filing of the chargesheet. Section 327 provides that\n                            inquiry and trial of the offence of rape/aggravated rape shall be conducted in\n                            camera and as far as practicable by a woman judge or magistrate with\n                            leeway to the presiding judge to grant access to a particular person if thought\n                            fit by him/her or upon an application being made by any one party.

This brings me to the argument that there are other provisions in the\n                            <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_519\">IPC</a> which are relationship-centric and, therefore, MRE cannot be struck\n                            down on the ground that it grants impunity to the offender only because he\n                            is in a marital relationship with a woman-victim. The argument is only\n                            partially correct and, therefore, misses the point that Mr Rao and Ms\n                            Rebecca John had proffered in the course of the hearing.\n                            142.1. First and foremost, what is required to be examined in this case, as\n                            noticed above, is the legal tenability of the impugned provision in the\n                            context of the object sought to be achieved. As discussed above, the stated\n                            object of Section 375 amongst others is to punish offenders who are found\n                            guilty of rape. The invidious classification that is brought about by MRE\n                            fails to achieve this object and, therefore, is unable to offer equal protection\n                            of the law to married women-victims who are similarly circumstanced.\n                            Thus, when contrasted with other provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_520\">IPC</a>, which provide for\n                            exceptions on account of the marital relationship- would show that they\n                            firewall offences which are committed outside marriage and not offences\n                            perpetrated by one spouse upon the other. In this context, one may advert to\n                            <a href=\"/doc/194391/\" id=\"a_521\">Sections 136</a>, <a href=\"/doc/66955/\" id=\"a_522\">212</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1865807/\" id=\"a_523\">216</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1886841/\" id=\"a_524\">216A</a> of the IPC which broadly concerns\n                            prosecution for offences for harbouring deserters, offenders, escapees and\n                            robbers/dacoits respectively.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_266\">                            142.2. In all these cases, where the person who is harboured and the one who\n                            harbours are in a spousal relationship, the law excludes such an offender\n                            from the rigours of prosecution. The point which was made and which\n                            emerges upon a plain reading of these provisions is that these are not\n                            provisions where the deserter, escapee, offender or robber/dacoit commits an\n                            offence on the harbourer with whom she or he is in a spousal relationship.\n                            142.3.

The definition of &quot;cruelty&quot;\n                            plainly does not include the offence of rape as defined in Clauses (a) to (d)\n                            of Section 375. The expression &quot;cruelty&quot; as defined in <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_528\">Section 498A</a> of IPC\n                            means wilful conduct which is of such nature that is likely to drive the\n                            woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury to her life, limb or health.\n                            The expression also includes harassment of a woman where such harassment\n                            is directed towards coercing her or any person related to her to meet any\n                            unlawful demand concerning, property and/or valuable security.

Thus, the offence of rape\n                            cannot be brought within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_529\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_269\">                            144.

Thus, the contention that because\n                            there is a possibility of false cases being lodged and, therefore, the courts\n                            should refrain from striking down MRE even if it is unconstitutional, is in\n                            my view, a contention which is completely unmerited.\n                            151.1. Besides the reason articulated hereinabove, this submission, if I may\n                            say so, is suggestive of the fact that the married women in India are\n                            manipulative or capable of being manipulated more than their counterparts\n                            in other jurisdictions. In support of this submission, observations made in\n                            judicial decisions concerning offences such as <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_552\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC have\n                            been cited before us. In my view, the apprehension is, firstly, exaggerated\n                            and, as indicated above, is not backed by empirical data; the data in fact\n                            shows that the contrary is true. Secondly, the courts in India are fully\n                            equipped to deal with false cases. Lodgement of false cases is not confined\n                            to rape, it permeates, to an extent, to other provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_553\">IPC</a> as well. <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_554\">Section\n                            498A</a> of the IPC is a case in point. Despite, noticing oddities in certain cases\n                            and/or false complaints being lodged the legislature has not been spurred\n                            into removing, the provision from the statute; I presume for three reasons:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">                            First, statistically, the number of false cases is minuscule. Second, it is a\n                            beneficial provision which protects a married woman from atrocities that\n                            may be inflicted on her by the husband and/or his family. Third, the Courts\n                            have been able to deal with such cases appropriately.\n                            151.2. Thus, this being the track record of Courts up until now, no one need\n                            entertain doubts that the Courts would not be able to employ the same rigour\n                            qua false allegations of marital rape. The best way forward would be to\n                            create a sieve at every level so that false cases are weeded out.\n                            151.3.

As regards the submission that prosecution of the offending husband\n                            for a rape offence would result in invading the private space of a married\n                            couple- is nothing but an attempt to keep the law at bay even when a\n                            heinous crime such as rape has occurred within what some would refer to as\n                            &quot;sacrosanct&quot; space. The argument to say the least is morally suspect and\n                            legally untenable. The reason for this is not far to see. When an offence of\n                            sexual abuse (short of rape) takes place within the confines of a married\n                            couple&#x27;s private space, the law has unhindered access to the very same space\n                            to bring the guilty to justice. Thus, short of rape, if an offending husband\n                            inflicts hurt or grievous hurt or subjects her to cruelty or even sexual abuse,\n                            the investigators are undoubtedly empowered to enter the concerned\n                            couple&#x27;s private space, which in joyful times is the preserve of a married\n                            couple. The attempt to keep away the law even when a woman is subjected\n                            to forced sex by her husband, by demarcating private and public space is to\n                            deny her the agency and autonomy that the Constitution confers on her. The\n                            distinction between private and public space has no relevance when rights of\n                            the women victim are infringed.

Mr Sai Deepak&#x27;s contention that investigation in private and intimate\n                            space because of fear of accusation of rape would require couples to enter\n                            into a detailed written agreement concerning courtship and/or mating or\n                            propel the persons involved to create evidentiary record concerning every\n                            act of intimacy or have third party witness the act, in my view, trivializes the\n                            sexual abuse inflicted on a woman. This argument, as observed hereinabove,\n                            stems from a pre-conceived notion that married women lack a sense of\n                            proportion or are inherently manipulative. The argument lacks substance\n                            because if this submission were to be accepted then the rape law ought not\n                            to apply also to couples who are in live-in relationships. The logical sequitur\n                            of this line of argument is that rape law should be confined to an offence\n                            committed on a woman by a stranger alone.

As to the first, difficulty of proof, issues of evidence and proof\n                                    in marital rape cases do not in fact appear to be different in kind from\n                                    those arising in many crimes, sexual and non-sexual, where the case\n                                    turns on the word of the accused against that of the alleged victim.\n                                    The courts are well aware of these difficulties, particularly as they\n                                    affect crimes like rape, and of their obligation to ensure that injustice\n                                    does not occur..... We suggest, therefore, that the courts would be able\n                                    to protect the interests of the accused here as in other cases involving\n                                    sexual allegations.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">                                    4.53 The converse fear is that courts would be so concerned to protect\n                                    the interests of the accused that the extension of the law of rape to\n                                    cohabiting married couples would have no practical effect. This\n                                    would not be a problem in cases where the husband used violence; or\n                                    boasted of his exploits; or otherwise created secondary evidence. But\n                                    even in cases where the only evidence was that of the wife, courts\n                                    would be capable of identifying testimony that was in fact credible\n                                    and acting on it.

As the High Court of Justiciary of Scotland\n                                      put it in Stallard v H M Advocate,44\n                                              &quot;We accept, of course, that proof of rape in marriage will, in\n                                              many situations, be difficult, but that is no reason for saying\n                                              that a charge of rape (of his wife) against a husband while the\n                                              parties are still cohabiting, is not relevant for trial.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_278\">                                                                                   [Emphasis is mine.]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_279\">                            155.

There cannot be a greater travesty of justice. In my view, the rules\n                            of evidence as applicable in our country and scores of precedents of our\n                            Courts and of Courts in other jurisdictions can easily provide guidance on\n                            these aspects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_280\">                            V(viii) New offence\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_281\">                            156.

It was also their\n                            submission that what the criminal law punishes is the act of commission or\n                            omission; in this case, subjecting a woman to a forced sexual act, which is,\n                            agnostic to who the perpetrator of the crime is.

The contention is that if MRE is struck down all that it would do is to\n                            bring the offending husband within the fold of the substantive rape law. On\n                            the other hand, Messrs Sai Deepak and Kapoor read passages from the\n                            decision rendered in Independent Thought to demonstrate that the court\n                            was only attempting to correct the anomaly which subsisted vis-à-vis a\n                            child-bride who was subjected to forced sex by her husband. In this behalf,\n                            both, Mr Sai Deepak as well as Mr Kapoor highlighted the fact that the\n                            judges who rendered the decision have made it amply clear that they were\n                            not dealing with marital rape in the context of an adult woman. This\n                            argument was buttressed by relying upon the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_556\">IPC</a> i.e., the sixth\n                            circumstance contained in Section 375 and the provisions of the POCSO Act\n                            and PCM Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_283\">                            157.1.

In my view, the submission that if one were to strike down MRE, it\n                            would create a new offence, is misconceived for the following reasons :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">                            (i)     Firstly, the offence of rape is already defined in the substantive part of\n                            <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_557\">Section 375</a> of IPC. The sexual acts which are described in Clauses (a) to (d)\n                            of Section 375 constitute rape if they fall within any of the seven\n                            circumstances alluded to in the said provision. There are two exceptions\n                            provided in Section 375 and, thus, those who come within the ambit of the\n                            exception cannot be prosecuted for the offence of rape. The first exception\n                            concerns a circumstance where the woman undergoes a medical procedure\n                            or intervention. The second exception (which is the exception under\n                            challenge) concerns the act of sexual intercourse or sexual acts which\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                         Page 127 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             involve a man and his wife who is not under 18 years of age. The exception\n                            clearly subsumes the main provision without providing a determining\n                            principle or rationale as to why husbands who have subjected their wives to\n                            forced sex should not face the full force of the rape law. Since the stated\n                            objective of the rape law is to protect women from sexual abuse of the worst\n                            kind i.e., rape, there is no perceivable rationale for granting impunity to an\n                            offending husband in the context of marital rape. Thus, if MRE is excised,\n                            all that would happen is, it would extend the ambit of Section 375 to even\n                            offending husbands.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">                            (ii)       Secondly, a new offence/new crime would perhaps have been created\n                            if the ingredients of the offence had changed.

The court was called upon to\n                            ascertain whether the word &quot;unlawful&quot; which preceded the expression\n                            &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; was a mere surplusage and not implying, outside\n                            marriage. The House of Lords ruled that the word &quot;unlawful&quot; was redundant\n                            since it was, even otherwise, unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any\n                            woman (married or unmarried) without her consent :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">                                           &quot;The fact is that it is clearly unlawful to have sexual\n                                    intercourse with any woman without her consent, and that the use\n                                    of the word in the subsection adds nothing.

The defendant&#x27;s plea that a husband\n                            cannot be held guilty of raping his wife was based on the Common Law\n                            Doctrine of implied consent given by the wife once she entered matrimony.\n                            This defence was rejected by the trial court as well as the Court of Appeal\n                            (Criminal Division) and, ultimately, found resonance with the House of\n                            Lords.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1353689\" id=\"span_300\">The ratio of the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_577\">R. v.

The court after examining the\n                            provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_581\">IPC</a> and appurtenant statutes, read down Exception 2 and,\n                            in effect, declared that it would not apply if the sexual intercourse or sexual\n                            act was committed by a man with his wife, who was under 18 years of age.\n                            Thus, the age threshold concerning the girl-child was brought in line with\n                            the sixth circumstance outlined in the main part of Section 375. The age\n                            threshold provided in Exception 2 for the wife stands enhanced from &quot;under\n                            fifteen years of age&quot; to &quot;under eighteen years of age&quot;; to that extent, the\n                            impunity granted to the offending husband stands diluted. Therefore, as per\n                            the present state of law, if a husband has forced sex with his wife, who is\n                            under 18 years of age, he is liable to be prosecuted for rape as the principle\n                            of implied consent would not apply in his case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_296\">                            161.2.

Modern-day marriage is a relationship of equals. The woman by\n                            entering into matrimony does not subjugate or subordinate herself to her\n                            spouse or give irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse in all circumstances.\n                            Consensual sex is at the heart of a healthy and joyful marital relationship.\n                            Non-consensual sex in marriage is an antithesis of what matrimony stands\n                            for in modern times i.e., the relationship of equals. The right to withdraw\n                            consent at any given point in time forms the core of the woman&#x27;s right to life\n                            and liberty which encompasses her right to protect her physical and mental\n                            being. Non-consensual sex destroys this core by violating what is dear to\n                            her, which is, her dignity, bodily integrity, autonomy and agency and the\n                            choice to procreate or even not to procreate. While marital rape leaves\n                            physical scars, it inflicts much deeper scars on the psyche of the victim\n                            which remain with her years after the offence has occurred.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_299\">                            164. What makes the continuance of MRE on the statute egregiously\n                            problematic is, while it emasculates the woman&#x27;s right to trigger prosecution\n                            against her husband for non-consensual sex, women, who are sex workers or\n                            are separated from their husbands, are invested with this right. Besides this,\n                            MRE makes no allowance for the circumstances in which a wife may say\n                            &quot;no&quot; to sex. For example, a wife may refuse to engage in sexual activity\n                            with her husband when she is ill or is menstruating or is unable to engage in\n                            sexual activity because of a sick child.

Even in the 19th century when the Common Law Doctrine was in play\n                            (i.e., that a husband could not be held criminally liable for raping his wife),\n                            difficulty was experienced in applying the doctrine, which was noticed in R.\n                            v. Clarence, (1886-1890) All ER Rep 133 : (1888) 22 Q.B.D 23.\n                            165.1. This was a case where the husband was accused of having sexual\n                            intercourse with his wife at a time when, to his knowledge, he was suffering\n                            from gonorrhoea. It was found that the wife was ignorant of this fact. The\n                            argument was, had she known, she would have not consented to the sexual\n                            communion. In this backdrop, the court was called upon to consider whether\n                            the husband&#x27;s conviction could be sustained under <a href=\"/doc/485875/\" id=\"a_584\">Section 20</a> and/or 47 of\n                            the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. <a href=\"/doc/485875/\" id=\"a_585\">Section 20</a> was concerned with\n                            unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm while Section\n                            47, concerned the offence of assault, occasioning actual bodily harm. In this\n                            background, one of the arguments the court was required to consider was\n                            whether the wife&#x27;s implied consent to intercourse stood revoked.\n                            165.2. This case was heard by 13 judges out of which four rendered a\n                            dissenting opinion and, hence, sustained the conviction. The dissenting\n                            opinion of Hawkins, J. brings to fore the discomfort that the judges holding\n                            minority view experienced with the plurality opinion, which ruled against\n                            convicting the offending husband.

The following observations being significant, in my\n                            view, need to be appreciated in the context of the present day MRE found in\n                            the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_586\">IPC</a>:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">                                    &quot;.... I proceed now to consider the question whether there was, in\n                                    fact, an assault by the prisoner on his wife occasioning her either\n                                    grievous or actual bodily harm. I answer this question, also, in\n                                    the affirmative. By the marriage contract a wife no doubt confers\n                                    upon her husband an irrevocable privilege to have sexual\n                                    intercourse with her during such time as the ordinary relations\n                                    created by such contract subsist between them. For this reason it\n                                    is that a husband cannot be convicted of a rape committed by him\n                                    upon the person of his wife. But this marital privilege does not\n                                    justify a husband in endangering his wife&#x27;s health and causing her\n                                    grievous bodily harm, by exercising his marital privilege when he\n                                    is suffering from venereal disorder of such a character that the\n                                    natural consequence of such communion will be to communicate\n                                    the disease to her. Lord Stowell in Popkin v. Popkin (16) said (1\n                                    Hag. Ecc.

It may be said that assuming a man to be\n                                    diseased, still as he cannot have communion with his wife without\n                                    contact, the communication of the disease is the result of a lawful\n                                    act, and, therefore, cannot be criminal. My reply to this argument\n                                    is that if a person having a privilege of which he may avail\n                                    himself or not at his will and pleasure, cannot exercise it without\n                                    at the same time doing something not included in this privilege\n                                    and which is unlawful and dangerous to another, he must either\n                                    forego his privilege or take the consequences of his unlawful\n                                    conduct. ....\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_303\">                                    ....Another argument used for the prisoner was that such cases as\n                                    the present were not contemplated by the statute under which he\n                                    was indicted; and it was also said that if it had been intended that\n                                    the communication of a venereal disease to a woman during an\n                                    act of sexual intercourse consented to by her should be\n                                    punishable as a crime, some special enactment to that effect\n                                    would have been introduced into one or other of the Acts of\n                                    Parliament relating to women and offences against them.

Now, gentlemen, I must begin by asking you carefully to\n                                    distinguish a certain branch of the law which has no connection with\n                                    this case from other branches of the law which may have a connection\n                                    with it. The branch of the law which has no connection with this case\n                                    is the law of rape. It is probably within the knowledge of you all,\n                                    gentlemen, that the crime of rape consists in having sexual\n                                    intercourse with a female either without her consent, or when she is of\n                                    such an age that she cannot in law consent, and that the crime\n                                    consists in the fact of intercourse independently of circumstances, of\n                                    intention, of knowledge, and of consequences. And, in the case of\n                                    married females, as you probably know, the law of rape does not\n                                    apply as between husband and wife after the age of ten years. But it\n                                    by no means follows that because the law of rape does not apply as\n                                    between husband and wife, if the wife has attained the age of ten\n                                    years, that the law regards a wife over ten years of age as a thing\n                                    made over to be the absolute property of her husband, or as a person\n                                    outside the protection of the criminal law. That of course cannot be\n                                    supposed. Under no system of law with which Courts have had to do\n                                    in this country, whether Hindu or Mahomedan, or that framed under\n                                    British rule, has it ever been the law that a husband has the absolute\n                                    right to enjoy the person of his wife without regard to the question of\n                                    safety to her as for instance, if the circumstances be such that it is\n                                    certain death to her, or that it is probably dangerous to her life. The\n                                    law, it is true, is exceedingly jealous of any interference in matters\n                                    marital, and very unwilling to trespass inside the chamber where\n                                    husband and wife live together, and never does so except in cases of\n                                    absolute necessity. But, as I have said, the criminal law is applicable\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                       Page 138 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                                     between husband and wife wherever the facts are such as to bring the\n                                    case within the terms of the Penal Code.

Since I have concluded that granting impunity to offending\n                            husbands under the MRE is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_595\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_596\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_597\">, 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_598\">21</a> of\n                            the Constitution, the class which comprises separated husbands would also\n                            necessarily have to be dealt with as any other rapist. In other words,\n                            separated husbands would suffer the same punishment, as prescribed for any\n                            other rapist under <a href=\"/doc/455161/\" id=\"a_599\">Section 376(1)</a> of the IPC, as that would be the logical\n                            sequitur of striking down MRE. As noticed above, under this provision, the\n                            minimum mandatory sentence is 10 years whereas under Section 376B, for a\n                            separated husband, the minimum mandatory sentence is 2 years which may\n                            extend to 7 years. In both cases, in addition to imprisonment, the concerned\n                            court is also empowered to impose a fine. Furthermore, under Section 198B\n                            of the Code, no court can take cognizance of an offence punishable under\n                            <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_600\">Section 376B</a> of the IPC (i.e., against a separated husband) except upon\n                            prima facie satisfaction of the facts which constitute the offence upon a\n                            complaint having been lodged by the wife against her husband.

A close perusal of the provision would show that while the preceding\n                            clauses (a) to (e) of sub-section (2)(f), deal with a situation where the victim\n                            is confined to a physical space which is under the physical or constructive\n                            control of the offender, succeeding clauses [i.e., clauses (g) to (n)] of the\n                            very same sub-section relate to women placed in vulnerable circumstances.\n                            Clause (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 376 seeks to bring those offenders\n                            within the rape law, who are in a position of trust or have authority over the\n                            woman-victim.

Although the ordinary meaning of the word\n                            &quot;relative&quot; would be a member of the family, whether related by blood or not\n                            or even a distant or close relative, the expression &quot;relative&quot; has not been\n                            defined either in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_603\">IPC</a> or in the Code, which does create an element of\n                            ambiguity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_315\">                            168.2. Therefore, looking at the provision, holistically, in the context and\n                            setting in which the expression &quot;relative&quot; is mentioned, the legislature\n                            intended to include, in my opinion, only those relatives, who are in a\n                            position of trust or authority such as a guardian or a teacher. It appears that\n                            the legislature intended to bring within the fold of clause (f) of sub-section\n                            (2) of Section 376 offenders, who, to begin with, had a platonic relationship\n                            with the victim. In other words, the offender&#x27;s close bond with the victim, to\n                            begin with, was not suffused with sexual or romantic overtones.\n                            168.3. Thus, when the expression &quot;relative&quot; is read contextually, the\n                            offending husband, in my view, would not fall within the ambit of the said\n                            expression and, therefore, the apprehension that the burden of proof would\n                            shift because of the presumption of lack of consent (as provided in <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_604\">Section\n                            114A</a> of the Evidence Act) would not arise in such cases. The principle of\n                            noscitur a sociis would apply to clause (f) to sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_605\">Section 376</a>\n                            of IPC insofar as the expression &quot;relative&quot; is concerned.\n                            168.4. The other argument advanced insofar as clause (h) and (n) of sub-\n                            section (2) of Section 376 are concerned, that they would lead to harsher\n                            punishment as compared to husbands who are separated and covered under\n                            Section 376B and, therefore, MRE should not be struck down, in my\n                            opinion, is misconceived. Section 376(2)(h) and Section 376(2)(n) concern\n                            gross cases and, therefore, fall in the category of aggravated rape.

The relevant para 7 is reproduced hereunder : (SCC pp. 650-51)\n                                      &quot;7. ... <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_618\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution unequivocally indicates that the law declared by the\n                                 Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India. The aforesaid Article\n                                 empowers the Supreme Court to declare the law. It is, therefore, an essential function of the Court to\n                                 interpret a legislation. The statements of the Court on matters other than law like facts may have no\n                                 binding force as the facts of two cases may not be similar. But what is binding is the ratio of the\n                                 decision and not any finding of facts. It is the principle found out upon a reading of a judgment as a\n                                 whole, in the light of the questions before the court that forms the ratio and not any particular word or\n                                 sentence. To determine whether a decision has &#x27;declared law&#x27; it cannot be said to be a law when a\n                                 point is disposed of on concession and what is binding is the principle underlying a decision. A\n                                 judgment of the Court has to be read in the context of questions which arose for consideration in the\n                                 case in which the judgment was delivered. An &#x27;obiter dictum&#x27; as distinguished from a ratio decidendi\n                                 is an observation by the Court on a legal question suggested in a case before it but not arising in such\n                                 manner as to require a decision. Such an obiter may not have a binding precedent as the observation\n                                 was unnecessary for the decision pronounced, but even though an obiter may not have a binding effect\n                                 as a precedent, but it cannot be denied that it is of considerable weight.&quot;\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                                              Page 144 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             Constitution.

The argument\n                            being, having regard to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_631\">Article 7</a> of the Convention, the\n                            ECHR should not consider his conduct in relation to any of the exceptions of\n                            the immunity rule. The ECHR applied the foreseeability test in rejecting the\n                            husband&#x27;s application. According to ECHR, the husband should have\n                            reasonably foreseen that over a period of time the law had dismantled the\n                            immunity which was available at one point of time, against the charge of\n                            martial rape :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">                                    &quot;41.

There was no doubt under the law\n                                    as it stood on 12 November 1989 that a husband who forcibly had\n                                    sexual intercourse with his wife could, in various circumstances, be\n                                    found guilty of rape. Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which\n                                    was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal\n                                    law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct\n                                    generally as within the scope of the offence of rape.

In People v. Liberta, the defendant- husband had raped his wife, while\n                            the temporary protection order passed by the Court was in operation. Under\n                            the provisions of the Statute in force, at the relevant time, in the State of\n                            New York, a husband could be held guilty only if the spouses were living\n                            apart.

The defendant&#x27;s husband, however, took the position that the\n                            temporary protection order in law and on facts, did not constitute living\n                            apart and hence he could not be convicted of rape. Therefore the argument\n                            was that since he remained married to his wife at the time rape was alleged\n                            to have occurred, he came within the ambit of MRE, both vis-à-vis the\n                            charge of rape and sodomy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_337\">                            177.2.

On facts, the Court returned a finding that because of the prohibition\n                            in the temporary protection order the couple were in law living apart and,\n                            therefore, were not married.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_338\">                            177.4.

Forcible sexual assaults\n                                    have historically been treated as serious crimes and certainly remain\n                                    so today..

The exemption for marital rape stems from a long out-dated\n                                    notion of marriage which regarded wives as no more than the\n                                    property of their husbands. According to the common law of\n                                    coverture, a wife was deemed to have consented at the time of the\n                                    marriage to have intercourse with her husband at his whim.\n                                    Moreover, this consent could not be revoked. ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">                                    73. This immunity has now been withdrawn in most major\n                                    jurisdictions. In England and Wales, the House of Lords held in\n                                    1991 that the status of married women had changed beyond all\n                                    recognition since Hale set out his proposition. Most importantly,\n                                    Lord Keith, speaking for the Court, declared, &#x27;marriage is in\n                                    modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer\n                                    one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the\n                                    husband.&#x27;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">                                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139225647\" id=\"span_361\">74. Our view is supported by the judgment of the European\n                                    Commission of Human Rights in <a href=\"/doc/139225647/\" id=\"a_659\">C.R. v UK</a>, which endorsed the\n                                    conclusion that a rapist remains a rapist regardless of his\n                                    relationship with the victim. Importantly, it acknowledged that\n                                    this change in the common law was in accordance with the\n                                    fundamental objectives of the Convention on Human Rights, the\n                                    very essence of which is respect for human rights, dignity and\n                                    freedom.

South\n                                    Africa criminalised marital rape in 1993, reversing the common\n                                    law principle that a husband could not be found guilty of raping\n                                    his wife. Section 5 of the Prevention of Family Violence Act 1993\n                                    provides: &#x27;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in\n                                    any law or in the common law, a husband may be convicted of the\n                                    rape of his wife.&#x27; In Australia, the common law &#x27;marital rape\n                                    immunity&#x27; was legislatively abolished in all jurisdictions from\n                                    1976.88 In 1991, the Australian High Court had no doubt that: &#x27;if\n                                    it was ever the common law that by marriage a wife gave\n                                    irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse by her husband, it is no\n                                    longer the common law.&#x27; According to Justice Brennan (as he\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_362\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                      Page 160 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                                     then was): &#x27;The common law fiction has always been offensive to\n                                    human dignity and incompatible with the legal status of a spouse.&#x27;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\">                                    76.

In South Africa, the 2007 Criminal Law (Sexual\n                                    Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act (&#x27;Sexual Offences\n                                    Act&#x27;) provides, at s. 56 (1), that a marital or other relationship\n                                    between the perpetrator or victim is not a valid defence against\n                                    the crimes of rape or sexual violation.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">                                    77. Even when marital rape is recognised as a crime, there is a\n                                    risk that judges might regard marital rape as less serious than\n                                    other forms of rape, requiring more lenient sentences, as\n                                    happened in South Africa. In response, the South African\n                                    Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act of 2007 now provides that the\n                                    relationship between the victim and the accused may not be\n                                    regarded as a &#x27;substantial and compelling circumstance&#x27;\n                                    justifying a deviation from legislatively required minimum\n                                    sentences for rape.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">                                    78. It is also important that the legal prohibition on marital\n                                    rape is accompanied by changes in the attitudes of prosecutors,\n                                    police officers and those in society more generally. For example,\n                                    in South Africa, despite these legal developments, rates of marital\n                                    rape remain shockingly high. A 2010 study suggests that 18.8% of\n                                    women are raped by their partners on one or more occasion.\n                                    Rates of reporting and conviction also remain low, aggravated by\n                                    the prevalent beliefs that marital rape is acceptable or is less\n                                    serious than other types of rape. Changes in the law therefore\n                                    need to be accompanied by widespread measures raising\n                                    awareness of women&#x27;s rights to autonomy and physical integrity,\n                                    regardless of marriage or other intimate relationship.

Given the foregoing discussion, I am clearly of the view that the\n                            recommendations were in line with the constitutional mores and/or morality\n                            which in the recent past have been captured and reiterated by the Supreme\n                            Court in the judgments rendered in Joseph Shine and Navtej Singh Johar.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_374\">                            186. Thus, for the sake of argument, even if I concur with Messrs Sai\n                            Deepak and Kapoor that the State should define, monitor and sanction what\n                            would be appropriate conduct in the context of sexual activity between\n                            married couples, what needs to be emphasized is that the State, as a\n                            representative of the society, shares the responsibility to deprecate and\n                            punish sexual abuse/violence of every form. This responsibility, cast on the\n                            State, extends beyond interpersonal space ordinarily available to a married\n                            couple where there is no violence. Thus, when the State exempts criminal\n                            acts such as forced sex within marriage, it unwittingly engages in unequal\n                            disbursement of rights conferred by the Constitution.

It was because of this foresight\n                                    that the Founding Fathers of the Constitution in their wisdom\n                                    provided fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution which\n                                    were modelled on the lines of the US Bill of Rights of 1791 and\n                                    the Declaration of the Rights of Man during the Great French\n                                    Revolution of 1789.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">                                    xxx                        xxx                xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">                                    91. It must be understood that while a statute is made by the\n                                    peoples&#x27; elected representatives, the Constitution too is a\n                                    document which has been created by the people (as is evident\n                                    from the Preamble). The courts are guardians of the rights and\n                                    liberties of the citizens, and they will be failing in their\n                                    responsibility if they abdicate this solemn duty towards the\n                                    citizens.

The workmen had been given employment as dependants of\n                            employees who had died in harness. Upon an industrial dispute erupting\n                            between the parties, an award was passed by the Labour Court which held\n                            that workmen were entitled to regularization having regard to the long\n                            period, they had been in service.

These directions which were the subject matter of the\n                            award were assailed by the petitioner company before the High Court. The\n                            High Court while agreeing with the petitioner company that the Labour\n                            Court could not have directed regularization, held that the workmen should\n                            continue in service till they reached the age of superannuation. Besides this\n                            the High Court directed that the workmen shall be paid wages at par with the\n                            regular employees.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_383\">                            190.1.

This was a case where a\n                            challenge was laid to an order passed by the High Court while hearing a\n                            civil revision petition. The petitioner before the Supreme Court had\n                            challenged the appointment of a person who occupied the post of a Mayor\n                            on the ground that he could not have held the post of a Mayor as he was a\n                            sitting member of the Legislative Assembly. However, by the time the\n                            matter reached the Supreme Court, the concerned member&#x27;s tenure as a\n                            Mayor had expired, and therefore, the appeal, apparently, had been rendered\n                            infructuous. Thus, the court while dismissing the appeal made the\n                            observations to the effect that no mandamus could issue for amendment of\n                            the <a href=\"/doc/50153951/\" id=\"a_666\">M.P.

The\n                            custom prevailing amongst persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes restricted\n                            the line of succession to male descendants.

The impediment to such an approach\n                            was <a href=\"/doc/1413588/\" id=\"a_674\">Section 2(2)</a> of the HSA.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">                            192.1. A three-member bench rendered the decision in the matter. The\n                            majority on the bench while reading down <a href=\"/doc/191902485/\" id=\"a_675\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/136186712/\" id=\"a_676\">8</a> of the CNT Act\n                            did not go that far as to strike down the said provisions. The majority\n                            protected the rights of female descendants under <a href=\"/doc/191902485/\" id=\"a_677\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/136186712/\" id=\"a_678\">8</a> of the\n                            CNT Act by suspending the exclusive right of male succession till the\n                            female descendants chose other means of livelihood, manifested by\n                            abandonment and/or release of the holding. On the other hand, the minority\n                            view, in effect, veered around to the reasoning that the general principles\n                            which found a place in HSA could be applied to Scheduled Tribes.\n                            192.2. It is in this context that the observations of the majority contained in\n                            paragraph 559 have to be viewed. It is also to be borne in mind that on a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_376\">                            59</span>\n                               &quot;5. In the face of these divisions and visible barricades put up by the sensitive tribal people valuing their\n                            own customs, traditions and usages, judicially enforcing on them the principles of personal laws applicable\n                            to others, on an elitist approach or on equality principle, by judicial activism, is a difficult and mind-\n                            boggling effort. Brother K. Ramaswamy, J. seems to have taken the view that Indian legislatures (and\n                            Governments too) would not prompt themselves to activate in this direction because of political reasons\n                            and in this situation, an activist court, apolitical as it avowedly is, could get into action and legislate\n                            broadly on the lines as suggested by the petitioners in their written submissions. However laudable,\n                            desirable and attractive the result may seem, it has happily been viewed by our learned brother that an\n                            activist court is not fully equipped to cope with the details and intricacies of the legislative subject and can\n                            at best advise and focus attention on the State polity on the problem and shake it from its slumber, goading\n                            it to awaken, march and reach the goal. For in whatever measure be the concern of the court, it\n                            compulsively needs to apply, somewhere and at sometime, brakes to its self-motion, described in judicial\n                            parlance as self-restraint. We agree therefore with brother K. Ramaswamy, J. as summed up by him in the\n                            paragraph ending on p. 36 (para 46) of his judgment that under the circumstances it is not desirable to\n                            declare the customs of tribal inhabitants as offending <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_679\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_680\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_681\">21</a> of the Constitution and each\nSignature valid             case must be examined when full facts are placed before the court.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_387\">Digitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_377\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                                                Page 168 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             direction issued by the court during the pendency of the proceedings, an\n                            exercise was carried out by the Bihar Tribal Consultative Council which\n                            revealed that if the changes, as suggested, are effected in the HSA, the land\n                            over which tribals had ownership right, could get alienated.\n                            192.3. Clearly, both the plurality and the minority views moved in the\n                            direction of granting relief to the tribal women. The methodology adopted\n                            and the degree of relief granted varied. The majority as well as minority\n                            members on the bench took recourse to judicial tools to alleviate the\n                            suffering of female tribals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_388\">                            192.4. In contrast, in the instant matters, the most recent study, i.e., the\n                            Justice Verma Committee Report, did demonstrate that there was an\n                            imminent need for removing MRE from the statute.

Therefore, the ratio of the judgment in Madhu Kishwar is not what is\n                            sought to be portrayed on behalf of the intervenors i.e., where courts find\n                            that a statute or a provision in the statute is violative of the fundamental\n                            rights, the same cannot be struck down.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_389\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98853113\" id=\"span_378\">193.

First, whether the aforementioned provision should have\n                            had embedded in it leeway for an intending purchaser and/or seller to\n                            demonstrate as to why an order for compulsory purchase ought not to be\n                            passed by the appropriate authority, in a given case. Second, whether the all\n                            encompassing expression &quot;free from all encumbrances&quot; should be struck\n                            down as it had no rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the\n                            legislation, which was, to prevent tax evasion.\n                            193.2. The Court employed, both, tools, inasmuch as, it read into the\n                            provision, the principles of natural justice i.e., the requirement to issue a\n                            show cause notice to the intending purchaser and/or seller as to why the\n                            property ought not to be compulsorily purchased by the Government.\n                            Furthermore, it struck down the expression &quot;free from all encumbrances&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">                            and, while doing so, the court made the following pertinent observations :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">                                    &quot;36. ....We agree that in order to save a statute or a part thereof\n                                    from being struck down it can be suitably read down.

Reading down is not permissible\n                                    in such a manner as would fly in the face of the express terms of\n                                    the statutory provisions. ....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_391\">                                                                                  [Emphasis is mine.]\n\n                            193.3. The Court, thus, excised from the statute the aforementioned\n                            expression &quot;free from all encumbrances&quot; as, according to it, it failed to meet\n                            the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_684\">Article 14</a> and sustained the remaining parts of the provision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_392\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"58962247\" id=\"span_380\">194.

In this case, the court was called upon to consider whether the\n                            direction issued by the High Court to the Census Commissioner that census\n                            should be carried out in a manner that caste-wise enumeration and/or\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_381\">KUMAR RAI                   W.P.(C)No.284/2015 &amp; connected matters                       Page 170 of 193</span>\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:29:14\n                             tabulation get reflected in its report, was warranted, given the fact that no\n                            such direction had been issued by the Central Government under <a href=\"/doc/155231906/\" id=\"a_686\">Section 8</a>\n                            of the Census Act, 1948 (as amended in 1993).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_393\">                            194.1. The Court held that the direction was flawed as the controversy that\n                            arose for adjudication before the High Court was entirely different. Before\n                            the High Court, a challenge was laid to the appointment of a person to a\n                            public office who was appointed solely on the basis that he belonged to a\n                            Scheduled Tribe. The High Court had noted that there were no persons\n                            belonging to a Scheduled Tribe residing in the place concerned (i.e., the\n                            Union Territory of Pondicherry) and that a presidential notification under\n                            <a href=\"/doc/768139/\" id=\"a_687\">Article 342</a> of the Constitution had not been issued. Based on this, the High\n                            Court concluded that no reservations for Scheduled Tribes could be made in\n                            the Union Territory of Pondicherry. Having said that, the High Court did not\n                            stop at this, it went on to issue directions to the Census Commissioner even\n                            though he was not a party to the proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_394\">                            194.2. A close look at the judgment also shows that a second writ petition\n                            was filed which was allowed in terms of the order passed in the first writ\n                            petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_395\">                            194.3. That said, the following observations made by the court shed light on\n                            how one needs to proceed in matters where a policy decision or a provision\n                            in the statute, as in the instant matters, is assailed.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">                                    &quot;25.

The Court also ruled, which is something that\n                            the intervenors lay stress on, as noticed above, that presumption of\n                            constitutionality doctrine should apply to a statute enacted by the Legislature\n                            and that, if the same is assailed, the burden lies upon one who brings the\n                            challenge to the Court. [See paragraph 15 of Mohd. Hanif Quareshi.]\n                            200.1.

This part of the Act was struck down as, according to the\n                            Court, it violated the petitioner&#x27;s fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_710\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>\n                            of the Constitution.

What emerges clearly from the judgment is that unless the differentia,\n                            based on which classification is made, meets the nexus test, such\n                            classification would not pass muster of the fundamental rights provided in\n                            the Constitution.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_407\">                            200.3.

A public interest petition was filed before the Bombay High\n                            Court by persons who claimed to be the residents of Mumbai and who were\n                            desirous of protecting open spaces in the city for preserving ecological\n                            balance and for providing public houses to the needy. The Bombay High\n                            Court while allowing the writ petition had, inter alia, held that amended\n                            DCR 58 which concerned open lands would also apply to the land which\n                            turned into open space after the demolition of the structures that were built\n                            upon such land. It is in this backdrop that the matter reached the Supreme\n                            Court. The Supreme Court made some telling observations, which once\n                            again, in my view, only re-emphasize the principle that constitutional courts\n                            are vested with the power to carry out judicial review of not only legislation\n                            and subordinate legislation but also policy decisions, albeit, with usual\n                            caveats. [See paragraphs 103 to 111 and 114 to 120.]\n                            201.1. It needs to be stated that the Court accepted the dicta enunciated in its\n                            earlier judgment rendered in Anil Kumar Jha v. Union of India &amp; Ors.\n                            (2005) 3 SCC 150 that it could interfere even with a &quot;political decision&quot;,\n                            although, it may amount to entering the &quot;political thicket&quot;. Besides this, the\n                            observations made in paragraph 120 that where issues brought before the\n                            court concerned enforcement of human rights, the Court&#x27;s interpretation and\n                            application of constitutional principles is not limited to the &quot;black letter of\n                            [the] law&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_409\">                            201.2.

Apart from the reiteration of the principle that\n                            the constitutionality of a statute is to be presumed and that the burden lies\n                            upon the one who assails the same because the legislature understands the\n                            need of its own people, there were several other principles which were\n                            alluded to by the Court after examining the whole host of cases. Amongst\n                            others, two important principles the Court adverted to are set forth hereafter:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">                                 &quot;11. xxx                   xxx                xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">                                 (f)    that while good faith and knowledge of the existing\n                                 conditions on the part of a legislature are to be presumed, if\n                                 there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding\n                                 circumstances brought to the notice of the court on which the\n                                 classification may reasonably be regarded as based, the\n                                 presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the extent\n                                 of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and un-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_411\">                                 known reasons for subjecting certain individuals or corporations\n                                 to hostile or discriminating legislation. ...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_412\">                                 12. xxx                    xxx                xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_413\">                                 (ii)    A statute may direct its provisions against one individual\n                                 person or thing or to several individual persons or things but no\n                                 reasonable basis of classification may appear on the face of it or\n                                 be deducible from the surrounding circumstances, or matters of\n                                 common knowledge. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1097199\" id=\"span_403\">In such a case the court will strike down the\n                                 law as an instance of naked discrimination, as it did\n                                 in <a href=\"/doc/1097199/\" id=\"a_712\">Ameerunnissa Begum v.

One of the arguments that is noted by\n                            the Court which was advocated by the Muslim Personal Law Board (and,\n                            those, who supported the said argument) while resisting the petitions filed\n                            before the Court was that because personal laws were beyond the pale of\n                            fundamental rights, they could not be struck down, and therefore, the Court\n                            should &quot;fold its hands&quot; and &quot;send Muslim women and other women&#x27;s\n                            organizations back to the legislature, as according to them, if triple talaq is\n                            to be removed as a measure of social welfare and reform under <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_721\">Article\n                            25(2)</a>, the legislature alone should do so.&quot; Both the petitioner along with the\n                            Union of India opposed this plea.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_420\">                            205.2.

The Court went on to hold that triple talaq [i.e. talaq-e-bidaat] was\n                            violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_722\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Court declared\n                            <a href=\"/doc/1188494/\" id=\"a_723\">Section 2</a> of the Shariat Act void to the extent it recognized and enforced\n                            triple talaq.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_421\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_411\">205.4. The argument advanced by Mr Sai Deepak that the Court only\n                            declared triple talaq as unconstitutional and did not criminalise it and,\n                            therefore, principles <a href=\"/doc/54613/\" id=\"a_724\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_725\">Shayara Bano</a>&#x27;s case will not apply to the\n                            instant matters is completely untenable. The judgment etched out in great\n                            detail the contours of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_726\">Article 14</a> and in that context the court observed that\n                            the &quot;thread of reasonableness runs through the entire fundamental rights\n                            Chapter. What is manifestly arbitrary is obviously unreasonable and being\n                            contrary to the rule of law, would violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_727\">Article 14.</a> .....&quot; [See paragraph</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_422\">                            230.]\n                            205.5. Thus, merely because the consequential steps that should be taken\n                            upon triple talaq being struck down were not up for consideration before the\n                            court, would not have me conclude that the principles enunciated by the\n                            court concerning <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_728\">Article 14</a> cannot be taken recourse to in the instant\n                            matters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_423\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_412\">206.

This was a case where the Supreme Court\n                            was called upon to rule on the issue as to whether mental cruelty could form\n                            the basis for seeking a decree for divorce. The Court, sustained the High\n                            Court judgment in the given set of facts and, thus, established that mental\n                            cruelty could form the basis for seeking a decree for divorce.\n                            210.1. In this case, divorce was sought by the husband.\n                            210.2. Mr Kapoor sought to rely upon the observations made in paragraph 12\n                            of the judgment. The observations made in paragraph 12 allude to the\n                            proposition that denial of sexual intercourse could amount to mental cruelty.\n                            The issue at hand is entirely different. We are dealing with a question as to\n                            whether a husband can seek sexual communion with his wife without her\n                            consent and/or her willingness.

State of Punjab</a>, (1988) 1 SCC 366,\n                            the Supreme Court was called upon to rule whether the judgment of the\n                            High Court ought to be sustained since it had dismissed in limine the\n                            appellant&#x27;s writ petition.

It appears what was assailed before the High Court,\n                            albeit, without setting out material particulars, was the vires of <a href=\"/doc/78227307/\" id=\"a_744\">Section 4</a> of\n                            the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949.\n                            211.1.

A close look at\n                            the observations made in the judgment would show that the appellant had\n                            sought to advert to the Rent Acts of other States i.e., Assam, Tripura and\n                            Haryana. Mr Kapoor has extrapolated this observation to contend that in\n                            examining the viability of the impugned provisions, this Court cannot look\n                            at the judgments and legislations of other jurisdictions on rape laws.\n                            211.2. It is well accepted that Courts, while examining matters, take the aid\n                            of judgments rendered by other Courts only to help them reach a correct\n                            conclusion with regard to the impugned statute and/or provision. It is\n                            important to remind ourselves that our Constitution is based on ideas and\n                            provisions found in the Constitution of other countries such as the United\n                            States, Canada and Australia, and, therefore, to even suggest that one cannot\n                            look at views prevailing in other jurisdiction would be akin to an ostrich\n                            burying its face in sand.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_432\">                            212.

Since the\n                            appellants before the Court already possessed a degree in engineering, they\n                            assailed the action of the respondents as being discriminatory.

These are the next steps in the matter which the legislature\n                            has to take up.

As\n                            and when such steps are taken, I am sure they will attract the public gaze\n                            and attention of all stakeholders and if escalated to the court, may also\n                            require judicial examination.

But before all this is done, a married woman&#x27;s right to bring the\n                            offending husband to justice needs to be recognized. This door needs to be\n                            unlocked; the rest can follow. As a society, we have remained somnolent for\n                            far too long. Deifying women has no meaning if they are not empowered.\n                            They are our equal half; some would delightfully say our better half. It is\n                            time that all stakeholders bite the bullet. It would be tragic if a married\n                            woman&#x27;s call for justice is not heard even after 162 years, since the\n                            enactment of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_755\">IPC</a>. To my mind, self-assured and good men have nothing to\n                            fear if this change is sustained. If I were to hazard a guess, those amongst us\n                            who want status quo to continue would perhaps want to have the MRE\n                            struck down if the victim involved was his/her mother, sister or daughter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_446\">                            223.

As would be evident from above, I have not adverted to the\n                            submissions of the respondents i.e., UOI and GNCTD. Insofar as UOI is\n                            concerned, Mr Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General stated before us in\n                            no uncertain terms that UOI does not wish to take a stand in the matter. In\n                            fact, affidavit(s) were filed to the effect that UOI would like to engage in\n                            consultation before moving further in the matter. On the other hand, while\n                            submissions were made at length by Ms Nandita Rao, who represented the\n                            GNCTD; on the last day, on instructions, she stated that she wished to\n                            withdraw the submissions which were made by her, in the course of the\n                            hearing, on behalf of GNCTD.

The issue at hand is fundamentally simple, as the principles for\n                          invalidating a statutory provision as unconstitutional are trite and\n                          well-recognized. They are, quite clearly, not res integra. All that the\n                          Court has to do is to apply these principles to the impugned\n                          Exception. A simple issue has, however, been made unreasonably\n                          complex, and has occupied weeks of precious Court time, merely\n                          because the issue was debated on the fundamentally erroneous\n                          premise that the husband, in having sex with his wife without her\n                          consent,    commits     rape,    and     the    impugned       Exception\n                          unconstitutionally precludes his wife from prosecuting him therefor.\n                          This presumption, as the discussion hereinafter would reveal,\n                          completely obfuscates the actual issue in controversy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_466\">                          In precis\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_467\">                          6.    I deem it appropriate at the outset, that I am one with the\n                          learned Counsel for the petitioners that there can be no compromise\n                          on sexual autonomy of women, or the right of a woman to sexual and\n                          reproductive choice. Nor is a husband entitled, as of right, to have sex\n                          with his wife, against her will or consent. Conjugal rights, as learned\n                          Counsel for the petitioners correctly assert, end where bodily\n                          autonomy begins.

Sexual activities between man and\n                          woman, within or outside marriage, require, in legalspeak, consensus\n                          ad idem.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_468\">                          7.    Where I differ with learned Counsel for the petitioners and\n                          learned amici curiae, is in the sequitur that they perceive as naturally\n                          flowing from the wife&#x27;s right to sexual and bodily autonomy. They\n                          would submit that the only logical consequence of grant of complete\n                          sexual autonomy to a woman, whether she be a wife or not, is\n                          outlawing of the impugned Exception. On that, I am unable to agree.\n                          The impugned Exception chooses to treat sex, and sexual acts, within\n                          a surviving and subsisting marriage differently from sex and sexual\n                          acts between a man and woman who are unmarried. It extends this\n                          distinction to holding that, within marital sexual relations, no &quot;rape&quot;,\n                          as statutorily envisioned by Section 375, can be said to occur. I am\n                          firmly of the view that, in thus treating sexual acts between a husband\n                          and wife, whether consensual or non-consensual, differently from\n                          non-consensual sexual acts between a man and woman not bound to\n                          each other by marriage, the legislature cannot be said to have acted\n                          unconstitutionally. The distinction in my view, is founded on an\n                          intelligible differentia having a rational nexus to the object sought to\n                          be achieved by the impugned Exception, which fulfils not only a legal\n                          but also a laudatory object, and does not compromise any fundamental\n                          rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_469\">                          8.

The\n                          written submissions filed by Ms Karuna Nundy, in fact, acknowledge\n                          as much, by submitting that &quot;an offence that should be rape, is\n                          undermined by being treated it as cruelty, grievous hurt or any other\n                          lesser offence ...&quot; This single submission, in itself, indicates that the\n                          petitioners are, proverbially, barking up the wrong legal tree. Other\n                          learned Counsel, too, including Ms Rebecca John, with her enviable\n                          knowledge of criminal law, have submitted that, while spousal sexual\n                          violence is punishable under various other statutory provisions, they\n                          are insufficient to punish what the petitioners feel is rape by the\n                          husband of his wife. There is, however, not one iota of material to\n                          which learned Counsel for the petitioners allude, to the effect that an\n                          act of sex by a husband with his wife, against her consent is, legally,\n                          rape. Nor is there any judicial pronouncement to the effect that every\n                          act of non-consensual sex by man with woman is rape. Given this\n                          position, I find it, frankly, astonishing that learned Counsel for the\n                          petitioners, almost in one voice, castigated the impugned Exception as\n                          unconstitutional because it &quot;prevents a wife from prosecuting her\n                          husband for committing rape&quot;. The closest learned Counsel for the\n                          petitioners reach, in so seeking to contend, is in Ms Nundy&#x27;s\n                          submission that, post-Constitution, &quot;the object of rape law (is that) no\n                          man should be able to force a woman to have sex with him without\n                          her consent&quot;. The submissions of Ms Nundy do not, however,\n                          enlighten on the source of this &quot;object of rape law&quot;, as she would seek\n                          to submit. Equally may the object of rape law be stated as &quot;non-\n                          consensual sex by a woman, at the instance of a man who is not her\n                          husband, should be punishable as rape&quot;.

Thus the exception in favour\n                                of true imputations on character (clause 470) is an exception\n                                which belongs wholly to the law of defamation, and does not\n                                affect any other part of the Code.

The\n                                         punishment for statutory rape by the husband is the\n                                         same when the wife is under 12 years of age, but when\n                                         she is between 12 and 15 years of age, the punishment\n                                         is mind, being imprisonment up to 2 years, or fine, or\n                                         both.

Para 5.9.1 of the Report read as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_310\">                                &quot;While discussing about Section 375, some Members felt that\n                                the word &#x27;rape&#x27; should be kept within the scope of sexual\n                                assault. The Home Secretary clarified that there is a change of\n                                terminology and the offence of &#x27;rape&#x27; has been made wider.\n                                Some Members also suggested that somewhere there should\n                                be some room for wife to take up the issue of marital rape. It\n                                was also felt that no one takes marriage so simple that she\n                                will just go and complain blindly. Consent in marriage cannot\n                                be consent for ever. However, several Members felt that the\n                                marital rape has the potential of destroying the institution of\n                                marriage. The Committee felt that if a woman is aggrieved by\n                                the acts of a husband, there are other means of approaching\n                                the court. In India, for ages, the family system has evolved\n                                and it is moving forward. Family is able to resolve the\n                                problems and there is also a provision under the law for\n                                cruelty against women. It was, therefore, felt that if the\n                                marital rape is brought under the law, the entire family\n                                system will be under great stress and the Committee may\n                                perhaps be doing more injustice.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_491\">                                                                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_463\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                         Page 18 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_492\">                           18.

Arguments\n                          in support of retention of the impugned Exception, according to her,\n                          &quot;crib, cabin and confine&quot; the true meaning and scope of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_796\">Article 14.</a>\n                          The mere existence of an intelligible differentia is not sufficient to\n                          sustain the scrutiny of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_797\">Article 14</a>, she submits; the intelligible\n                          differentia is also required to have a rational nexus to the object of the\n                          statute, which itself must be legitimate. Furthering the argument of\n                          arbitrariness, Ms Nundy submits that, as the impugned Exception\n                          &quot;provides immunity from prosecution for rape to a man for forcibly\n                          having sex with his wife, but not to a man forcibly having sex with a\n                          woman who is not his wife (but may, for instance be his live-in\n                          partner)&quot;, it is irrational and manifestly arbitrary.

Any such prominence, if accorded,\n                          would also reflect arbitrariness. She submits that, as the purported\n                          rationale of the impugned Exception has outlived its purpose, and\n                          does not square with constitutional morality as it exists, it is\n                          manifestly arbitrary. She relies, in this context, on para 102 of the\n                          report in Joseph Shine6. Referring to paras 168, 169 and 181 of the\n                          said decision, Ms. Nundy submits that any provision of law that\n                          postulates a notion of marriage that subverts equality is manifestly\n                          arbitrary and bad in law. She points out that, in para 181 of the said\n                          decision, the Supreme Court had rejected the notion that, by marriage,\n                          a woman consents in advance to sexual relations with her husband,\n                          terming such a notion to be offensive to liberty and dignity, and\n                          having no place in the constitutional order. She submits that the\n                          impugned Exception traces its origin to Lord Hale&#x27;s anachronistic\n                          notion that, by marriage, a woman surrenders her sexual autonomy.\n                          She submits that &quot;it is difficult to discern any argument in relation to\n                          marriage that does not have its basis in the said dictum&quot;. &quot;Protecting\n                          the institution of marriage&quot;, she submits, is not an adequate\n                          determining principle and had, in fact, been specifically rejected by\n                          the Supreme Court in para 74 of Independent Thought1 and para 212\n                          of Joseph Shine6.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_506\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"183165917\" id=\"span_477\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"337342\" id=\"span_478\">25.

The pre-Constitutional object, she submits, as\n                          per the notes of Lord Macaulay in the 1838, was the creation of an\n                          exception in favour of the conjugal rights of the husband. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49064693\" id=\"span_480\">In this\n                          context, she draws attention to para 36 of the report in <a href=\"/doc/49064693/\" id=\"a_803\">John\n                          Vallamattom v.

The post-Constitutional amendments\n                          to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_804\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, points out Ms. Nundy, indicate the object of\n                          rape laws to be protection of women from violence and preservation\n                          of their bodily integrity and sexual autonomy. &quot;Inherent in this\n                          object&quot;, she submits, &quot;is the foregrounding of the entire law on\n                          consent&quot;. Based on this premise, Ms. Nundy contends that the object\n                          of rape laws, post-Constitution, is that &quot;no man should be able to force\n                          a woman to have sex with him without her consent&quot;. Proceeding from\n                          this submission, Ms. Nundy contends that the impugned Exception is\n                          unconstitutional as (i) it nullifies the object of the main provision, i.e.,\n                          the object of rape laws, (ii) it places the privacy of marriage as an\n                          object above the privacy of the individual in the marriage and (iii)\n                          protection of conjugal rights, by not penalising as rape the forced sex\n                          of a wife, is not a legitimate object post Constitution, as it does not\n                          align with our post-Constitutional understanding of conjugal rights.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_508\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"327850\" id=\"span_484\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"969224\" id=\"span_485\">27.        Ms. Nundy then proceeds to elaborate on each of these\n                          submissions. Regarding the first submission, i.e., that the impugned\n                          Exception nullifies the object of rape laws, she relies on the principle\n                          that an exception or a proviso cannot nullify or set at naught the real\n                          object of the main enactment, for which she relies on <a href=\"/doc/969224/\" id=\"a_805\">S.

The impugned Exception, she submits, is\n                          unconstitutional as it &quot;places the &#x27;institution of marriage&#x27; as an object\n                          above the privacy and other <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_807\">Article 21</a> rights of an &#x27;individual in the\n                          marriage&#x27; &quot;. Protection of the &#x27;institution of marriage&#x27;, submits Ms.\n                          Nundy, cannot be a legitimate object to sustain the impugned\n                          Exception, such a contention having been specifically rejected by the\n                          Supreme Court in para 92 of the report in Independent Thought1. The\n                          institution of marriage cannot, according to her, be accorded pre-\n                          eminence over the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_808\">Article 21</a> rights of the wife. Even on facts, she\n                          submits, a marriage could be damaged or destroyed by rape, but not\n                          by a complaint of rape. According to her submissions, &quot;an\n                          individual&#x27;s right not to be raped cannot be held hostage to an\n                          imposed conception of marriage&quot;. Ms. Nundy relies on para 192 of\n                          the report in Joseph Shine6 to contend that privacy accorded to the\n                          &#x27;institution&#x27; of marriage cannot override the privacy and other <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_809\">Article\n                          21</a> rights of the individuals involved.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_509\">                          28.   Protection of the conjugal rights of the husband, contends Ms.\n                          Nundy, is not a legitimate object to justify the impugned Exception in\n                          our post-Constitution era, as it does not align with our understanding\n                          of conjugal rights at present. Forced sexual intercourse, she submits,\n                          is not a conjugal right, as is apparent from the fact that a Court, when\n                          enforcing a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, can only direct the\n                          husband and wife to cohabit, and cannot forcibly direct them to have\n                          sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is not, therefore, a &quot;conjugal\n                          right&quot; of the husband. Conjugal rights, in her submission, begin and\n                          end at cohabitation and consortium, and anything beyond this is\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_489\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 26 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           merely a conjugal expectation, the remedy for denial of which is only\n                          divorce.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_510\">                          29.      Further exemplifying the submission, Ms. Nundy contends that\n                          &quot;by no means can insertion of an object, against the woman&#x27;s will, or\n                          facilitating the rape of his wife by other persons, be a &#x27;conjugal right&#x27;\n                          throwing in sharp relief the illegitimacy of the object&quot;. Husbands who\n                          indulge in such acts, she points out, stand exempted from the\n                          application of Section 375 by the impugned Exception. According to\n                          Ms. Nundy, &quot;if a wife refuses to consent to sexual intercourse with her\n                          husband, the (impugned Exception) sanctions and indeed encourages\n                          the husband to have forced sexual intercourse with his wife&quot;. Such\n                          forced sexual intercourse by the husband becomes punishable only if\n                          the ingredients of lesser offences such as Section 35415, or of related\n                          but distinct offences such as <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_810\">Section 498-A16</a> of the IPC are fulfilled.\n                          By virtue of the &quot;marital rape exception&quot;, therefore, &quot;a husband can\n                          enforce his conjugal right (as he understands it) without going to a\n                          court of law.&quot; This, in her submission &quot;encourages some husbands to\n                          do illegally that which cannot be done legally, on the purport that they\n                          are exercising their conjugal right&quot;.

She has\n                          attempted to deal with the issue from the point of view of the\n                          &quot;perpetrator&quot;, the &quot;victim&quot; and &quot;the act&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_318\">                          31.   Apropos the &quot;perpetrator&quot;, Ms. Nundy concedes, frankly, that\n                          &quot;there may be an expectation of, and even an in-principle arrangement\n                          to, sex in marriage, and indeed an intelligible differentia on this basis\n                          between a husband and non-husband&quot;. &quot;However&quot;, she submits, &quot;what\n                          the (impugned Exception) in fact protects, is not this expectation of\n                          sex, but elevates this to a husband&#x27;s rights to forcible sexual\n                          intercourse with his wife at any given time, under any circumstances,\n                          irrespective of her consent to it&quot;. This, she submits, &quot;has no rational\n                          nexus to any of the objects examined above&quot;. She has highlighted, in\n                          this context, para 75 of the report in Independent Thought1,\n                          especially the observation, in the said para, that &quot;a rapist remains a\n                          rapist and marriage with the victim does not convert him into a non-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_531\">                          rapist&quot; and &quot;rape is rape whether it is described as such or is described\n                          as penetrative sexual assault or aggravated penetrative sexual assault&quot;.\n                          Thus, submits Ms. Nundy, &quot;the Marital Rape Exception privileges a\n                          man&#x27;s right to exercise his sexual desire and nullifies his wife&#x27;s right\n                          to not engage in sexual acts&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_532\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_494\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 29 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_533\">                           32.   Ms. Nundy further submits that, &quot;in rape, the spectrum of harm\n                          caused may vary, and is independent of the relationship between the\n                          parties&quot;. She has sought to exemplify this by contradistinguishing a\n                          situation in which the live-in partner of a woman has sex with her\n                          while she is sleeping, presuming consent, with a case in which the\n                          husband of a woman, with his friends, gang rapes her. The inequity in\n                          the impugned Exception, submits Mr. Nundy, is underscored by the\n                          fact that, in the former case, the live-in partner of the woman could be\n                          prosecuted for rape, whereas the husband, in the latter case, cannot.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_534\">                          33.   Ms. Nundy further submits that the impugned Exception gives\n                          husbands a blanket immunity for any of the sexual acts enumerated in\n                          clauses (a) to (d) of Section 375, including the gross acts envisaged in\n                          clauses (c) and (d) thereof. Even in a case in which the rape would\n                          result in the victim being reduced to a permanent vegetative state, or\n                          where the act involves gang rape, she submits that the impugned\n                          Exception immunizes the husband from being prosecuted for rape.\n                          She submits that, therefore, &quot;the Marital Rape Exception effectively\n                          nullifies consent to the specific act(s) of sexual intercourse including\n                          forced sex with another person, forced anal sex, and bundles such\n                          forced sexual acts with other, lesser offences such as cruelty, simple\n                          assault or grievous assault&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_535\">                          34.   The impugned Exception, submits Ms. Nundy, &quot;gives a license\n                          to husbands to force sex&quot; and, &quot;at the very least, condones a situation\n                          where a man forces his wife to have sex by calling it &#x27;not rape&#x27;.&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">                          &quot;This&quot;, in her submission, &quot;is nothing more than a license for a\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_495\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 30 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           husband to force his wife into sexual intercourse without penal\n                          consequences for rape (whether or not there are penal consequences\n                          for the lesser, cognate offences).&quot; Ms. Nundy emphasises that\n                          marriage requires equality of partnership and love, and is inherently\n                          inimical to the concept of forced, non-consensual sexual relations.\n                          Even within the expectation or broad agreement of sexual relations\n                          and marriage, therefore, she submits that specific consent for sexual\n                          acts cannot be done away with. She seeks to exemplify this\n                          submission, and to highlight the perceived inequity in the impugned\n                          Exception, thus:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">                                &quot;Currently, without specific consent for sexual acts there is\n                                sanction to situations where despite sickness, disease and\n                                injury, a wife is still forced to have sexual intercourse. She\n                                may object to having sex in public. Indeed, if the husband\n                                suffers from gonorrhoea, or if the wife is on her period, is\n                                busy at work, or just not in the mood, the Exception overrides\n                                that non-consent and says such forced sex will not be &#x27;rape&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_536\">                          In this backdrop, Mr. Nundy emphasises that, even where consent was\n                          not specifically to be found in the provision, the Supreme Court has\n                          made consent central and indispensable to criminal provisions\n                          concerning sexual relations, for which purpose she relies on Navtej\n                          Johar7 and Joseph Shine6. Specifically, Ms. Nundy cites para 232 of\n                          the report in Navtej Johar7 and para 169 of the report in Joseph\n                          Shine6.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_537\">                          35.   The necessity of fair labelling of the offence is, according to\n                          Ms. Nundy, the core of the case that the petitioners seek to espouse. It\n                          is no argument, according to Ms. Nundy, to contend that, when sexual\n                          acts, offensive to the wife, are perpetrated by the husband, he can be\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_496\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                     Page 31 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           prosecuted for grievous hurt, or for outraging her modesty. These\n                          offences, along with their gravamen and ingredients, she submits, are\n                          substantially different from rape. It would be impermissible to label an\n                          act of rape as an act of cruelty or grievous hurt. The need to call a rape\n                          a rape, she submits, is paramount. &quot;The label of the offence,&quot;, she\n                          submits, &quot;should represent the nature of the law-breaking by the\n                          offender&quot;. This, she submits, &quot;is further represented in the defences,\n                          punishments and consequences of being convicted of the offence&quot;.\n                          Ms. Nundy relies on para 592 of the report in Navtej Johar7, in which\n                          the Supreme Court observed that the effect of conviction under\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_812\">Section 37718</a> of the IPC was typecasting consensual sex of\n                          LGBTQIA+ persons on par with sexual offences like rape. Per\n                          corollary, she submits, an offence which should be rape cannot be\n                          permitted to be undermined by treating it as cruelty, grievous hurt or\n                          any other lesser offence. She contends that &quot;not calling a rape within\n                          marriage, a rape, also has far-reaching consequences for the protection\n                          of the victims&quot;. According to her, &quot;when it comes to married women,\n                          the State shirks responsibility and does not afford her the same level\n                          of care and protection that a woman raped by someone other than her\n                          husband is entitled to receive&quot;. &quot;Women raped by their husbands do\n                          not&quot;, in her submission, &quot;get protections under the law available to\n                          other rape victims&quot; such as Section 357A (which provides for victim\n                          compensation), 357C (which provides for treatment of rape victims),\n                          154 (relating to providing of information in cognizable cases), 164\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_497\">                          18</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_538\">                            377.

Adverting, once again, to her understanding of &quot;fair\n                          labelling&quot;, Ms. Nundy submits that &quot;the label &#x27;rape&#x27; has an important\n                          role in expressing social disapproval of a certain sort of sexual\n                          wrong&quot;. Further, on the point of punishability under other provisions,\n                          of the act of a husband in compelling his wife into sexual intercourse\n                          without her consent, Ms. Nundy submits that the said provisions\n                          would apply only if their ingredients are fulfilled.     The resultant\n                          anomaly, according to her, is that the specific act committed by the\n                          husband, the harm to his wife and indeed the mens rea to commit\n                          forced sexual intercourse remain unpunished. The husband, who has\n                          committed an act of forced sexual intercourse, she submits, ends up\n                          being prosecuted under provisions that do not seek to regulate forced\n                          sexual intercourse in the first place. On individual facts, she submits,\n                          where the specific ingredients of other offences do not exist, the\n                          victim-wife of an act of non-consensual sexual intercourse by the\n                          husband may not be able to prosecute him at all, if the impugned\n                          Exception is allowed to stay. At the end of the day, she submits, &quot;it is\n                          not about punishing the husband, but is about punishing the act&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_540\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_499\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 33 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_541\">                           36.

She submits that\n                          &quot;the bodily integrity of women and indeed all humans, deserves the\n                          highest threshold of protection under Constitutional and criminal\n                          law&quot;.

This right to physical integrity, she submits, flows\n                          from the woman&#x27;s right to life, dignity and bodily privacy under\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_817\">Article 21.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_542\">                          37.   Ms. Nundy submits that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_818\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution obligates\n                          the Court to strike down the impugned Exception, &quot;which is founded\n                          on a stereotypical understanding of ascribed gender roles in a\n                          marriage&quot;, and &quot;is coupled with an ex facie infringement of\n                          fundamental rights&quot;. She submits that &quot;there is no compelling state\n                          interest in &#x27;protecting the institution of marriage&#x27;&quot;, as the State would\n                          seek to contend. &quot;Protecting husbands who facilitate the gang rape of\n                          their wives, or rape their wives by insertion of objects, or indeed have\n                          forced penile vaginal intercourse with their wives cannot be a way to\n                          further the institution of marriage or be called the &#x27;conjugal rights&#x27; of\n                          a husband.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_543\">                          38.

The expression of one&#x27;s\n                          sexual desire, submits Ms. Nundy, is part of self-expression protected\n                          under the said sub-Article.

In her words,\n                                   &quot;The impugned provisions of law do not recognise the right of\n                                   a married woman to say no to sexual intercourse with her\n                                   husband. As a corollary, the impugned provisions also take\n                                   away a married woman&#x27;s ability to say a joyful &#x27;Yes&#x27; to\n                                   sexual intercourse, both aspects of Exception 2 to Section 375\n                                   being contra <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_820\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and limiting a married woman&#x27;s\n                                   right to freedom of sexual expression and behaviour&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_544\">                          In Ms. Nundy&#x27;s submission, the offshoot of the impugned Exception\n                          is that &quot;the wives sexual desire and consent is reduced to nullity&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_545\">                          39.      Addressing, thereafter, a substantially important issue, Ms.\n                          Nundy submits that, by striking down the impugned Exception, the\n                          Court would not be creating a new offence. Adverting to <a href=\"/doc/886402/\" id=\"a_821\">Section 40</a> of\n                          the IPC19, <a href=\"/doc/1144228/\" id=\"a_822\">Section 2(n)</a> of the Cr PC20 and Section 3(38) of the\n                          General Clauses Act, 189721, Ms. Nundy submits that an &#x27;offence&#x27;\n                          pivots on the act or omission, and not on the offender per se. What is\n                          punishable by the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_823\">IPC</a>, she submits, is &quot;the act or thing done&quot;, though\n                          &quot;the parts of an offence may include a perpetrator, victim and the act&quot;.\n                          In her submission, &quot;the &#x27;offence&#x27; of rape under the IPC is the act of\n                          forcible/non-consensual intercourse (as described in sub-clauses (a) to\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_546\">                          (d) and Clauses firstly to sixthly), by a man upon a woman, which is\n\n                          19 40.     &quot;Offence&quot; - Except in the Chapters and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this section, the\n                          word &quot;offence&quot; denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_501\">                          20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_547\">                            2.

The Marital Rape Exception, she submits, &quot;grants immunity\n                          from prosecution to a particular class of offenders - i.e. husbands ...\n                          which is rooted in the fiction of consent that India inherited from its\n                          colonial masters&quot;. Thus, according to Ms. Nundy, striking down the\n                          impugned Exception would not create a new offence, though a new\n                          class of offenders may be brought into the ambit of an existing\n                          offence. The impugned Exception, according to her, only provides an\n                          immunity from being prosecuted for the act of rape, which is already\n                          an offence in terms of <a href=\"/doc/886402/\" id=\"a_825\">Section 40</a> of the IPC.

Addressing, next, a submission, advanced in favour of retaining\n                          the impugned Exception, that, were the impugned Exception to be\n                          struck down, a husband would qualify as a &quot;relative&quot; for the purposes\n                          of Section 376(2)(f) and would, therefore, result in the burden of proof\n                          shifting to him to disprove the allegation of rape in view of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_834\">Section\n                          114-A27</a> of the Evidence Act, Ms. Nundy seeks to allay the\n                          apprehension by contending that, in interpreting Section 376(2)(f), the\n                          &quot;mischief&quot; rule of statutory interpretation should be applied. One of\n                          the considerations, in applying the &quot;mischief rule&quot; is, according to her,\n                          the position in law prior to the enactment of the said provision. As\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_835\">Section 114A</a> of the Evidence Act concerns only aggravated rape,\n                          absent such aggravating factors, an offender under Section 375 would\n                          not be subject to the rigour of the provisions of Section 376 which\n                          deal with aggravated rape. Another reason why Section 376(2)(f)\n                          would not apply to the husband, according to her, is because the word\n                          &quot;relative&quot;, in the said provision, courts accompany with the words\n                          &quot;guardian&quot;, &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;a person in a position of trust or\n                          authority&quot;. It is only, therefore, where the accused is in a position of\n                          power over the complainant, akin to a fiduciary trust, she submits, that\n                          Section 376(2)(f) would apply.

Concerns about the possibility of misuse of Section 375, were\n                          the impugned Exception to be struck down, submits Ms. Nundy,\n                          besides being unfounded, are irrelevant to the issue of its\n                          constitutionality.

By doing so, he submits that &quot;what\n                          comes into force is the right to punish, not a new crime&quot;.

A sex worker, too, he submits, is\n                          entitled to decline consent for sex and, if sex is forced on her without\n                          her consent, to prosecute for rape. Denying such a right to a wife,\n                          amounts to rendering the issue &quot;of her consent, to sex, immaterial\n                          inasmuch as she cannot prosecute a husband for having non-\n                          consensual sexual intercourse with her, i.e., for the act of &#x27;rape&#x27;.&quot; He\n                          submits that &quot;There can be no greater indignity that the law can heap\n                          upon a woman than to deny her the right to prosecute for the violation\n                          of her bodily integrity, privacy and dignity and that too at the hands of\n                          her husband, who she would legitimately expect to receive love and\n                          affection from and who would be expected to safeguard her interest&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_577\">                          56.

The impugned Exception, he submits, is based on the archaic\n                          belief that the very act of marriage implies &#x27;consent&#x27; by the wife for\n                          sexual intercourse with the husband during the entire subsistence of\n                          the marital bond, i.e. the Hale dictum, or at least till the parties\n                          continue to cohabit. This notion, he submits, is outdated and obsolete,\n                          insofar as it understands the concept of marriage, and the role of a\n                          wife in it. Any such &quot;presumption of consent&quot;, submits Mr. Rao, is\n                          inconsistent with applicable law, which guarantees equal protection of\n                          the law to married women, for which purpose he cites paras 73 to 75,\n                          84 and 88 of Independent Thought1 and paras 62 to 63, 68 to 71 and\n                          82 of ShayaraBano v.

This also results in lesser protection for them than\n                          is available to persons who are merely cohabiting or live-in partners.\n                          This discrepancy is particularly stark when one considers that <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_850\">Sections\n                          376(2)(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1553346/\" id=\"a_851\">376C</a> of the IPC recognises that the act, if perpetrated\n                          by a person in a position of trust, or in a fiduciary capacity, is more\n                          egregious than if done by a stranger.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_579\">                          58.

Non-consensual marital\n                          intercourse reflects, he submits, what a marriage ought not to be.\n                          While a marriage entails reasonable marital privileges for both\n                          spouses, these reasonable expectations or privileges cannot be equated\n                          with willingness or consent to sex, by default, in all situations. Mr.\n                          Rao advances, in this context, a somewhat radical submission that\n                          &quot;marriage is no longer as sacred or sacrosanct as it was traditionally\n                          considered to be and legislative provisions for divorce and judicial\n                          separation support this conclusion&quot;. Procreation, he submits, is not\n                          the only purpose of marital sexual intercourse, which is why a\n                          marriage becomes voidable only in the event of impotence, rather than\n                          sterility. The wife, he submits, also has an expectation of a healthy\n                          sexual relationship from her spouse.          Implicit in this is the\n                          presumption of the consensual nature of the relationship. He submits\n                          that the institution of marriage cannot be regarded as imperilled, even\n                          were the impugned Exception to be struck down, as the husband is, in\n                          the event of non-consensual sexual intercourse with his wife, liable to\n                          be prosecuted for several other offences in relation to the said act, for\n                          which purpose he cites para 92 of the report in Independent\n                          Thought1.

Mr. Rao has referred us to decisions rendered by courts abroad,\n                          which have removed the &quot;marital exception to rape&quot;. He has provided\n                          a tabular chart of such decisions. While acknowledging that the\n                          applicable statutes, in the jurisdictions in the UK and in Nepal, did not\n                          contain a provision akin to the impugned Exception, Mr Rao submits\n                          that the statutory position applicable in the US, at the time of rendition\n                          of the decision in People v. Liberta41contained a specific exception,\n                          from the offence of rape, where the victim was one&#x27;s wife. The view,\n                          in the said decisions, that the marital rape exception was &quot;repugnant\n                          and illogical&quot;, &quot;an abuse of human rights&quot; and &quot;simply unable to\n                          withstand even the slightest scrutiny&quot;, he submits, applies, mutatis\n                          mutandis, to the impugned Exception.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_542\">                          39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_589\">                             (1983) 2 SCC 277\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_543\">                          40</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_590\">                             32.

Ms Rebecca John submitted, with even greater fervour than Mr.\n                          Rao, that the impugned Exception could not sustain for an instant. Ms\n                          John acknowledged, at the outset, that the foundational basis for the\n                          impugned Exception is marriage. She points out that Note B in the\n                          Notes on Clauses in the chapter of General Exceptions in the draft\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_869\">IPC</a>, per Lord Macaulay, clarified that the impugned Exception was\n                          &quot;to protect the conjugal rights of the husband&quot;. Even prior to this\n                          statement, Ms. John submits that &quot;the common law position excluded\n                          a wife&#x27;s consent from the purview of the penal provision and its origin\n                          is traceable to the common law doctrines of Coverture and Implied\n                          Consent, under which the legal rights of a woman were subsumed by\n                          her husband after marriage.&quot; These doctrines declared that, by\n                          entering into marriage, a wife had granted irrevocable sexual consent\n                          to her husband. Ms John has also taken us to the history of the\n                          Marital Rape Exception.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_594\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_546\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 53 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_595\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_547\">66.      The impugned Exception, submits Ms. John, &quot;necessarily\n                          results in a complete and unequivocal disregard of the wife&#x27;s right to\n                          consent to sex within a marriage&quot;, and its &quot;consequence ... is\n                          therefore that a provision which otherwise criminalises sex without\n                          the consent of the woman, exempts a husband from being prosecuted\n                          simply because he is married to her&quot;. She relies on the judgement of\n                          the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_870\">Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v.

The impugned Exception, submits\n                          Ms. John, leaves married woman remediless for an offence of rape\n                          committed by her husband.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_596\">                          67.      Ms John seeks to analogise the present case with Joseph\n                          Shine6. In that case, she points out, the Supreme Court struck down\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_871\">Section 49743</a> of the IPC and decriminalized adultery. The said\n                          decision, she points out, holds that the proposition &quot;that a woman, by\n                          marriage consents in advance to sexual relations with her husband or\n                          to refrain from sexual relations outside marriage without the\n                          permission of her husband is offensive to liberty and dignity&quot;. As\n                          such, she submits that the impugned Exception represents an\n                          antiquated notion of marriage between unequals, contrary to the\n                          modern concept of marriage, as elucidated in Joseph Shine6.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_597\">                          42(2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_548\">                          43</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_598\">                            497.

Supporting her colleagues, Ms. John also submits that the\n                          removal of the impugned Exception would not lead to creation of a\n                          new offence. She relies, for the purpose, on paras 190 and 194 of the\n                          report in Independent Thought1 which, in turn, relied on the\n                          judgement of the House of Lords in <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_872\">R v.

For the purpose of argument, even assuming that\n                                    there may be an intelligible differentia that the law recognises\n                                    between the class of married and unmarried persons, there\n                                    must be a rational nexus to that differentia.

Emphasising the fact that, in other common law jurisdictions,\n                          the marital rape exception stands removed from the law, Ms John\n                          submits that the continuance of the exception in India is an\n                          anachronism. She seeks to deconstruct Section 375 by submitting that,\n                          by including the impugned Exception therein, the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_888\">IPC</a> creates a fiction\n                          that the acts and circumstances described in Section 375 do not\n                          amount to rape where the parties are married. She also submits that\n                          Section 375 is required to be read along with clauses (n)20 and (wa)52\n                          of <a href=\"/doc/760919/\" id=\"a_889\">Section 2</a> of the CrPC and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_890\">Sections 3353</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_891\">4454</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_610\">                          73.       Ms John reiterates that &quot;the woman&#x27;s consent is central to\n                          making the act an offence&quot;. Consent, she submits, underlies the\n                          immunity contained in Exception 1 in Section 375. As against this,\n                          Exception 2, which is also couched in absolute terms, states that\n                          sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife is not\n                          rape.

Addressing, next, the aspect of &quot;conjugal rights&quot;, Ms John\n                          submits that, undisputedly, &quot;a marriage comes with reciprocal\n                          obligations and expectations of the spouses, including of sex&quot;.\n                          Thereafter, she proceeds to submit thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_330\">                                     &quot;Marriage must be based upon mutual trust and respect.\n                                     Exception 2 violates marital trust and the sexual decisional\n                                     autonomy of the wife based on Macaulay&#x27;s object of\n                                     protecting a husband&#x27;s conjugal rights alone. A wife&#x27;s right\n                                     to bodily autonomy will stand violated if the expectation (not\n                                     a right) of sex by her husband translates into a physical act of\n                                     forcible sex. The Exception, in effect, accords immunity to a\n                                     husband disregarding his wife&#x27;s non-consent, which cannot be\n                                     the object of any provision, and therefore, it fails the test of\n                                     constitutionality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_614\">                          75.

She also relies, for this purpose, on the observations\n                          contained in the judgement of the House of Lords in <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_893\">R v R44</a>.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_617\">                          Submissions of learned Counsel who supported the impugned\n                          Exception\n\n                          Submissions of Mr J Sai Deepak, Counsel for the Men&#x27;s Welfare\n                          Trust\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_561\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                      Page 60 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_618\">                           78.   Mr. J Sai Deepak, who argued on behalf of the Men&#x27;s Welfare\n                          Trust, commenced his submissions by clarifying that his client was\n                          not opposed to criminalisation of spousal sexual offences, including\n                          non-consensual sexual relationship. However, he submits, there\n                          already exists a legal/penal framework to deal with such offences. He\n                          submits that the issue at hand is not merely about consent, but also\n                          about context, which learned Counsel for the petitioners refuse to\n                          acknowledge.      It would be erroneous, in Mr. Sai Deepak&#x27;s\n                          submission, to reduce the ambit of the discussion merely to the aspect\n                          of &quot;consent&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_619\">                          79.   Mr. Sai Deepak seriously questions the jurisdiction and\n                          authority of this Court to grant the reliefs sought by the petitioners.\n                          Grant of such reliefs, he submits, would invariably result in creation\n                          of a new class/species of offence, which is outside the boundaries of\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_894\">Article 226</a> jurisdiction. It would also infract the doctrine of\n                          separation of powers, and that too, in the matter of criminalisation.\n                          Expanding on the aspect of separation of powers, Mr. Sai Deepak\n                          submits that the doctrine is intended to preserve the right of the people\n                          to participate in law and policy making. Grant of the reliefs sought in\n                          the petitions, he submits, would keep the people outside the pale of\n                          participation in law and policy making on such a sensitive social\n                          issue, which would invariably truncate fundamental rights and\n                          empower an unelected body, i.e. this Court, to undertake an exercise\n                          beyond its constitutional mandate and expertise.        Creation of an\n                          offence, he points out, requires considerations of social impact, and\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_562\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 61 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           the creation of an entire ecosystem, involving a definition, process,\n                          safeguards, evidentiary standards and the forum which is to deal with\n                          the offence thus created, none of which are open to legislation by a\n                          Court of law. A Court of law, he submits, is ill-equipped to examine\n                          such issues, as it is not designed for enabling participation by multiple\n                          stakeholders, which is fundamental to a decision to regard an act is an\n                          offence. Besides, he submits, the consequences of grant of the reliefs\n                          sought in the petition are bound to be social and cultural, which is yet\n                          another reason as to why a judicial forum cannot undertake a policy\n                          decision of the kind that the petitioners seek. Designating an act as an\n                          offence, punishable under the criminal law, he submits, requires wide-\n                          ranging consultation with members of the public as well as subject\n                          matter experts, with an analysis of concrete data based on ground\n                          realities. It cannot be done in a peremptory manner, merely based on\n                          anecdotal evidence.

He also relies on <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_915\">Article 13(1)</a> of the Constitution, which\n                          protects pre-Constitutional laws so long as they pass muster on the\n                          anvil of the Constitution. This, he submits, effectively preserves the\n                          presumption of constitutionality of laws even if they were enacted\n                          prior to coming into force of the Constitution, unless rebutted by a\n                          successful challenger. In such circumstances, he submits that a Court\n                          cannot interfere with legislative wisdom merely because it has a\n                          different, or even a diametrically divergent, point of view, least of all\n                          when, by doing so, a new offence, or a new class of offences, is being\n                          created.

None of the remaining prayers, in any of the petitions,\n                          submits Mr. Sai Deepak, can be granted by the Court, if it is to remain\n                          within its Constitutional boundaries.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_625\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_575\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 65 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_626\">                           83.       Were this Court to grant the prayers of the petitioners, submits\n                          Mr. Sai Deepak, the direct and intended consequence would be\n                          enlargement of the scope of the offence of rape and to recognise the\n                          commission of rape in the context of a marriage. This, he submits, is\n                          beyond the powers and authority of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_917\">Article 226.</a>\n                          Contradistinguishing the present case from Navtej Johar7 and Shreya\n                          Singhal v. U.O.I.63 , Mr. Sai Deepak submits that the present case\n                          does not relate to a constitutional challenge to a criminalizing\n                          provision. Any comparison of the present case with these decisions\n                          would, therefore, in his submission, be misguided. Equally misguided,\n                          according to Mr. Sai Deepak, is the reliance, placed by the petitioners\n                          on Shayara Bano34, in which, even while striking down the practice\n                          of talaq-e-biddat as unconstitutional under <a href=\"/doc/1325952/\" id=\"a_918\">Section 264</a> of the Muslim\n                          Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, the decision                                                  of\n                          whether to criminalise, or otherwise, the said practice was relegated to\n                          the legislature, specifically recognizing that criminalisation, or\n                          creation of an offence was the sole and executive preserve of the\n                          legislature. Despite the judgement of the Supreme Court, therefore, he\n                          submits that the practice of talaq-e-biddat would not be offensive in\n                          law, unless the legislature created an offence in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_627\">                          84.

The\n                          reliance, by the petitioners, on the said decision, as an authority on the\n                          power of the judiciary to create a new species of offence was,\n                          therefore, in his submission, completely misplaced. Mr. Sai Deepak\n                          invites especial attention to para 190 of the decision, which clearly\n                          holds that a Court cannot create an offence. The issue before the\n                          Supreme Court in Independent Thought1, he points out, was whether\n                          the specification, in the impugned Exception in Section 375, making\n                          the Exception applicable where the wife was below the age of 15, was\n                          sustainable, as it was clearly in conflict with the provisions of the\n                          POCSO Act and the Prevention of Child Marriages Act, 2006 (&quot;the\n                          PCMA&quot;). To bring the impugned Exception in harmony with these\n                          statutes, and Section 198(6)65 of the Cr PC, the Supreme Court read\n                          down the impugned Exception as being applicable where the wife was\n                          between 15 and 18 years of age. As the Supreme Court held, thereby,\n                          it was merely bringing in consistency between the impugned\n                          <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_919\">Exception and the POCSO Act</a> and the PCMA. Mr. Sai Deepak also\n                          criticised the attempt, of Ms. Nundy, to treat Independent Thought1\n                          as an authority on the aspect of the legality of the impugned Exception\n                          in toto by applying the inversion test. In his submission, the inversion\n                          test can have no application at all in the present case, as the Supreme\n                          Court clearly held that the issue under consideration, before it, in\n                          Independent Thought1, was the applicability of the impugned\n\n                          65198.

Mr. Sai Deepak also disputes the petitioner&#x27;s contention that\n                          the impugned Exception is a colonial provision which lacks the\n                          presumption of constitutionality. In his submission, <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_921\">Article 13(1)</a>\n                          bridges the gap between pre-Constitutional laws and the Constitution,\n                          by clearly ordaining that pre-Constitutional laws would be void to the\n                          extent they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the\n                          Constitution. Such inconsistency, he submits, cannot be presumed at\n                          the outset, but would have to be demonstrated by the person seeking\n                          to contend that the law is unconstitutional. Mr. Sai Deepak also\n                          submits that the statement of the law, in Navtej Johar7, that\n                          presumption of constitutionality does not attach to pre-Constitutional\n                          laws, is per incuriam, as the earlier decisions in Chiranjitlal\n                          Chowdhuri v.

In any event, submits Mr. Sai Deepak, even after the enactment\n                          of the Indian Constitution, the legislature has not only retained the\n                          impugned Exception, but has also cited the institution of marriage and\n                          the existence of other criminal remedies as a reason for retaining it.\n                          The impugned Exception has received legislative attention several\n                          times after the coming into force of the Constitution, thereby entitling\n                          it to the same degree of presumptive constitutionality as a post-\n                          Constitutional enactment. Apropos the instances when the validity of\n                          the impugned Exception has come up for consideration and been\n                          deliberated upon, Mr. Sai Deepak cites para 5.9.1 of the 167 th\n                          Parliamentary    Standing    Committee     on    the   Criminal    Law\n                          (Amendment) Bill, 2012, para 1.64 of the 19 th Report of the Lok\n                          Sabha&#x27;s Committee on Empowerment of Women and para 3.1.2.1 of\n                          the 172nd Law Commission Report (2000). It would, therefore, in his\n                          submission, be incorrect to contend that the impugned Exception is\n                          still in the nature of a colonial provision which retains the baggage of\n                          the English doctrine of coverture.

Mr. Sai Deepak further submits that, if the impugned Exception\n                          were to be struck down, it would render otiose the &quot;fourthly&quot; clause in\n                          Section 375, which is predicated on natural conjugal relations between\n                          spouses. Husbands, he submits, have not been given a free pass with\n                          respect to unnatural offences under Section 37716 or sexual cruelty\n                          under Section 498A, which encompasses non-consensual sex and\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_584\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 69 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           spousal sexual violence. It is, therefore, not correct to contend that the\n                          legal framework as it stands today does not recognise the need for\n                          consent in spousal sex. While recognising this necessity, Mr. Sai\n                          Deepak points out that the legislature has also recognised the need for\n                          differential treatment owing to the nature of the relationship between\n                          the parties and the difficulty in establishing lack of consent where\n                          there is no legal or effective separation within the meaning of Section\n                          376B.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_634\">                          88.     Rationalising the impugned provisions, Mr. Sai Deepak submits\n                          that the acts envisaged by clauses (a) to (d) of Section 375 become\n                          illegal, and amount to &quot;rape&quot; only in the event of satisfaction of any\n                          one of the seven circumstances enumerated in &quot;firstly&quot; to &quot;seventhly&quot;\n                          in the said provision and in the absence of consent between a\n                          separated couple in the case of Section 376B. Consent, therefore, he\n                          submits, is not the sole deciding factor, and is to be examined in the\n                          backdrop of the circumstances in which it is refused. It is practically\n                          impossible to establish the absence of consent if the issue arises within\n                          the peripheries of a marital relationship, given the nature of intimacy\n                          associated with the institution of marriage and the absence of\n                          eyewitness accounts. It is for this reason, submits Mr. Sai Deepak, that\n                          absence of consensual conjugal relations is easier to presume in the\n                          event of legal or de facto separation under Section 376B. This is also\n                          the reason, according to him, that a preliminary enquiry of sorts under\n                          Section 198B of the Cr PC is undertaken, to assess whether the couple\n                          is living apart although living under the same roof.

Mr. Sai\n                          Deepak points out that the factum of marriage results in serious\n                          obligations on the part of the partners, from conjugal expectations and\n                          rights to financial obligations, mental health obligations and a duty\n                          towards progeny.

A victim of spousal sexual violence, submits Mr. Sai Deepak,\n                          can invoke the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_924\">DV Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/406908/\" id=\"a_925\">Section 3</a> of which includes any conduct of a\n                          sexual nature which abuses, humiliates, degrades or otherwise violates\n                          the dignity of the wife within the ambit of the expression &quot;sexual\n                          abuse&quot;. This expression would, therefore, also embrace non-\n                          consensual sex. Mr. Sai Deepak also submits that the contention, of\n                          learned Counsel for the petitioners, that the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_926\">DV Act</a> provides only for\n                          civil remedies is misplaced in view of <a href=\"/doc/1004557/\" id=\"a_927\">Section 19(2)</a>69 thereof.

The\n                          difference between the impugned Exception and the rest of Section\n                          375, he submits, is in the &quot;offence&quot;, and not in the &quot;offender&quot;. In the\n                          light of the legislative reticence to employ the expression &quot;rape&quot; in the\n                          context of spousal relations, Mr. Sai Deepak contends that the\n                          petitioner&#x27;s argument that the prayers in the petition merely seek\n                          enlargement of the class of offenders is baseless.

In fact, in his submission, the reluctance of the\n                          legislature to use the expression &quot;rape&quot; in the context of a spousal\n                          relationship is not merely intended to protect the spouse, but also their\n                          families and the products/issues from the marriage, i.e. their progeny.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_639\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13922091\" id=\"span_587\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1780305\" id=\"span_588\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_589\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"93885\" id=\"span_590\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"856631\" id=\"span_591\">91.        Protection of the marital institution, submits Mr. Sai Deepak, is\n                          a legitimate State interest in our society, and the mores and values of\n                          other societies or countries cannot be foisted on us.

Mr. Sai Deepak has, finally, distinguished the position as it\n                          obtains in India with that which obtains in overseas jurisdictions. In\n                          the Sexual Offences Act of 2003, in the UK, for example, he points\n                          out that <a href=\"/doc/369435/\" id=\"a_936\">Section 1</a> entitles the accused to defend himself on the ground\n                          that he was under the reasonable belief that sexual intercourse with the\n                          alleged victim was consensual. This, he submits, constituted an inbuilt\n                          safeguard to the accused. Further, Section 23 of the Sexual Offences\n                          Act exempted spouses and civil partners from the benefit of <a href=\"/doc/1425182/\" id=\"a_937\">Sections\n                          16</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1130386/\" id=\"a_938\">19</a>, which dealt with abuse of a position of trust. The evidentiary\n                          standards and circumstances in which presumptions could be drawn\n                          are also exhaustively set out in the said Act, which also lays out the\n                          standard operating procedure for prosecution of such cases.\n                          Moreover, he submits, the Sexual Offences Act was a product of\n                          legislative, and not judicial, intervention, and was also gender neutral.\n                          The judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in <a href=\"/doc/188155617/\" id=\"a_939\">C.R. v. the\n                          United Kingdom75</a> was rendered in the context of a separated couple,\n                          in which the estranged husband imposed himself on his former wife\n                          which situation, in India, would be covered by Section 376B.

Further, in Nepal, too,\n                          the law was gender neutral. In the US, he points out that different\n                          States have adopted different positions and, in each of the said States,\n                          the legislation was introduced by the legislature and not by the\n                          judiciary.

Mr. Kapoor submits that the correctness\n                          of this view is not amenable to judicial review, as it had been reached\n                          after wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders - an exercise that\n                          the Court is ill-equipped to undertake. Reliance has been placed, by\n                          Mr. Kapoor, in this context, on para 409 of the report in Raja Ram\n                          Pal v. Hon&#x27;ble Speaker76.       He submits that Courts cannot go into\n                          the sufficiency of the object sought to be achieved, or the motive of\n                          the legislature in passing a statute or retain a provision, so long as\n                          there was an object in existence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_643\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1803657\" id=\"span_599\">94.        Mr. Kapoor also seeks to underscore the pernicious\n                          consequences that could result, were the impugned Exception to be\n                          struck down. He submits that cohabiting husbands would, in such a\n                          circumstance, be worse off than separated spouses under Section\n                          376B, as they would be liable, in the case of conviction, to be\n                          imprisoned for 10 years, extendable to life, whereas Section 376B\n                          envisages punishment of not less than two years, extendable to seven\n                          years. Further, the husband would be subjected to the presumptive\n                          rigour of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_940\">Section 114A</a> of the Evidence Act, which does not apply to\n                          Section 376B. As a matter of fact, he submits, Section 376B is in the\n                          nature of an exception to Exception 2 to Section 375, setting out a\n                          separate and distinct class. This, too, in his submission, indicates that\n                          the legislature, in its wisdom consciously retained the impugned\n                          Exception, despite making spousal sexual violence an offence in a\n                          case where the spouses were judicially separated.

Mr. Kapoor points out that the issue under consideration is not\n                          whether spousal sexual violence is, or is not, to be punished as a\n                          criminal act, as Parliament has not condoned spousal sexual violence.\n                          It has merely stated that spousal sexual violence cannot be punished as\n                          &quot;rape&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_945\">Section 376</a> of the IPC. Other remedies have been\n                          provided to deal with such situations, including <a href=\"/doc/406908/\" id=\"a_946\">Section 3</a> of the DV\n                          Act. The sufficiency of such other remedies, as a panacea to spousal\n                          sexual violence, he submits, is not judicially reviewable, and\n                          Exception 2 to Section 375 cannot be struck down on the ground that\n                          the remedies otherwise available to deal with cases of spousal sexual\n                          violence are insufficient. Denial of sex by the wife, in particular\n                          circumstances, he submits, also amounts to cruelty, which is a ground\n                          for divorce.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_645\">                          96.

The discussions at the bar, in the present case, meandered into\n                          so many dusky pathways, into which the provision under challenge\n                          does not even pretend to venture, that, in the heat of the debate, the\n                          actual issue before the Court suffered obfuscation to a considerable\n                          degree. Meaningful art needs a clean canvas. It is necessary, therefore,\n                          to know what we are dealing with.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_648\">                          98.   Sexual autonomy of women is non-compromisable. Women are\n                          morally, legally, spiritually, and in every other way that matters, equal\n                          to men. The chance chromosomal circumstance that makes one a man\n                          and the other woman has, with the passage of time, ceased to have any\n                          significance worth the name. The Hale dictum of 15 th century vintage\n                          which might, when originally propounded, have reflected the mores\n                          and morals of the day has, with the passage of time, become almost\n                          bewilderingly anachronistic. Our attention was drawn, by learned\n                          Counsel, to the dictum, time and time again, to emphasise how\n                          outlandish it is. We - for, on this, I am at one with my eminent\n                          Brother - entirely agree. What I, personally, fail to understand,\n                          however, is as to why such emphasis was placed on the Hale dictum.\n                          There is nothing, whatsoever, to indicate that the impugned Exception,\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_607\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 77 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           either at the time of its original conception, or later when it came up\n                          for discussion on various occasions, was ever sought to be justified on\n                          the Hale dictum. To all intents and purposes, therefore, the Hale\n                          dictum is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand. Equally, I may\n                          note, there is nothing to indicate that the impugned Exception, or its\n                          continuance, is being sought to be justified on the basis of the\n                          doctrines of coverture or implied consent.          Reference to these\n                          doctrines, which reflect the mores and morals of an age long past (and\n                          hopefully never to return) is, therefore, in my view, unjustified.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_649\">                          99.   When one is dealing with a statutory provision of considerable\n                          vintage - as in the present case - the compulsions that might\n                          originally have prompted its enactment, or even retention, might, with\n                          the passage of time and changing social and societal perceptions,\n                          change.   The Court cannot, in my view, test the constitutionality of\n                          such provisions solely by regarding their object to be what the original\n                          framers of the provisions deemed it to be.       Where, especially, the\n                          issue of continuance, on the statute book, of the provision, has come\n                          in for constitutional deliberation even post enactment of the\n                          Constitution, the Court has to be alive to the issue of whether the\n                          retention, or scrapping, of the provision would be advisable given the\n                          present socio-legal realities and perceptions, and the justifiability for\n                          retention of the provision as the legislature now perceives, even if it\n                          be different from that which originally provoked its enactment.\n                          There may be provisions which were enacted for a specific object and\n                          purpose which have, with the march of time, become unjustifiable.

If this premise were to be accepted, i.e., of\n                          every act of non-consensual sex by a man with a woman were, in law\n                          and without exception, to be regarded as &quot;rape&quot;, there would indeed\n                          be nothing left to examine. The petitioners appear, in so urging, to\n                          have failed to notice the distinction between the etymological and the\n                          legal. To urge that rape, per definition, is non- consensual sex by a\n                          man with a woman, is just as simplistic as the contention that murder,\n                          per definition, is the taking of the life of one man by another. Just as\n                          every incident of taking of the life by one, of another, is not murder,\n                          every incident of non-consensual sex of a man with a woman is not\n                          rape, howsoever much learned Counsel for the petitioners might want\n                          it to be. The foundation of the petitioners&#x27; case is, therefore, with all\n                          due respect to learned Counsel, fundamentally flimsy. A castle cannot\n                          be built on reeds. As most of the submissions proceeded on the\n                          premise that any and every act of sex by a man with a woman against\n                          her will is necessarily rape, irrespective of the circumstances in which\n                          they were situated, and the relationship between them, and then\n                          condemn the impugned Exception as ordaining otherwise, the main\n                          issue of whether, because it excepts sex and sexual acts within\n                          marriage from the ambit of &quot;rape&quot;, the impugned Exception is\n                          unconstitutional, was lost in the clamour. The question of whether the\n                          unique demographics of marriage, which unquestionably extend to the\n                          sexual sphere as well, would, or would not, justify a differential\n                          treatment being extended to sexual acts within marriage, even if non-\n                          consensual, was not, I am constrained to observe, debated with the\n                          seriousness it deserves.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_661\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_613\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 83 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_662\">                           105.

Of course, Ms Nundy also submits, in the same breath, that\n                          this &quot;intelligible differentia&quot; cannot justify the impugned Exception;\n                          that, however, is a matter which I would discuss at greater length later\n                          in this judgement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_663\">                          106.

By virtue of the impugned Exception, while the latter is\n                          rape, the former is not.

Myriad are the examples of male-female relationship;\n                          they may be mother and son, sister and brother or, less platonically,\n                          girlfriend and boyfriend, or fiancée and fiancé.

To ignore, or even to seek to undermine, this,\n                          is to ignore plain reality.

This aspect of the matter has been correctly emphasised by Mr.\n                          Sai Deepak, and I find myself entirely in agreement with him. The\n                          petitioners, in my view, have completely failed to note the uniqueness\n                          of marriage as an institution, its peculiar demographics and incidents,\n                          and the emotional, psychological, social and other complex equations\n                          that exist between a wife and a husband.        As Ms Nundy herself\n                          acknowledges, there are several legislations which recognise the\n                          inherent differences that arise in the context of a marital relationship.\n                          The submissions of the petitioners effectively consign all unique\n                          incidents of a marital relationship to obscurity. This is particularly\n                          evident from a somewhat surprising submission that Mr. Rao, learned\n                          amicus, sought to advance.        Mr. Rao sought to visualise four\n                          situations; the first in which the man and woman are strangers, the\n                          second in which the man and woman are not yet married, but are five\n                          minutes away from marriage, the third in which the man and woman\n                          have been married five minutes earlier and the fourth in which the\n                          man and woman, though married, are separated. Mr. Rao sought to\n                          contend that the incongruity in the impugned Exception was manifest\n                          from the fact that while, in the first, the second and the fourth\n                          instance, non-consensual sex by the man with the woman would\n                          amount to rape, it would not, in the third instance. What was rape ten\n                          minutes earlier, therefore, submits Mr. Rao, is not treated as rape ten\n                          minutes later, though the act is the same and there is want of consent\n                          on both occasions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_676\">                          115.

It is this fundamental error\n                          of perception that colours nearly all the submissions advanced by\n                          those who seek to oppose the continuance of the impugned Exception\n                          on the statute book.    Learned Counsel for the petitioners, I am\n                          constrained to observe, have, in their submissions, regarded the\n                          existence of a marital relationship between the man and the woman as\n                          just another incident, which does not really amount to anything much.\n                          Ms Nundy has, in her submissions, in fact, referred to it as an\n                          &quot;imposed conception of marriage&quot;. She submits that &quot;an individual&#x27;s\n                          right not to be raped cannot be held hostage to an imposed conception\n                          of marriage&quot;.   In the first place, I do not understand as to how\n                          marriage can be treated as an &quot;imposed conception&quot;, or even a\n                          &quot;conception&quot; at all. It is a real and salutary institution, which, in a\n                          healthy instance, reflects complete emotional and psychological unity\n                          between the man and the woman. In a similar vein, Ms. John has\n                          submitted that the consequence of the impugned Exception is\n                          therefore &quot;that a provision which otherwise criminalises sex without\n                          the consent of the woman, exempts a husband from being prosecuted\n                          simply because he is married to her&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_677\">                          116.

In our country, marital vows\n                          are still regarded as inviolable, and marital fidelity is, fortunately, still\n                          the norm, profligacy being the exception (even if adultery is no longer\n                          a criminal offence). The sexual aspect is but one of the many facets of\n                          the relationship between husband and wife, on which the bedrock of\n                          their marriage rests. Care, consideration, and an understanding of one\n                          other&#x27;s likes and dislikes, hopes and aspirations, are fundamental to\n                          the sustenance of a marriage that is to abide.           There can be no\n                          comparison, whatsoever, between the relationship between a husband\n                          and a wife, with any other relationship between man and woman. It is\n                          for this reason that there is an enforceable legal right - which even Ms\n                          Nundy acknowledges - of each party in a marriage, to cohabit with,\n                          and for the consortium of, the other. Fostering the sustenance of a\n                          marriage is, in the law as it exists in this country, not just advisable; it\n                          is, even for courts, a binding legal obligation. A court hearing a\n                          petition for divorce, even by mutual consent is, in our legal system,\n                          not entitled to grant divorce straightaway, even if both parties appear\n                          to be irreconciliably at odds.

Though the child has been born out of\n                          wedlock, and out of a perfectly legitimate sexual act between her\n                          parents, she would be the child of a rapist because her mother was, on\n                          the occasion when she had sex with her father, been unwilling. Her\n                          father, as a rapist, would be liable to suffer the punishment stipulated\n                          in Section 376, were her mother to prosecute.

Marriage, as\n                          already noted, is not a brick and mortar institution. The &quot;institution&quot; of\n                          marriage represents the cohesive and sanctified union of the\n                          individuals in the marriage.

Moreover, in advancing this submission, learned Counsel\n                          seem to overlook the fact that, in a marriage, there are two individuals\n                          involved. Sustenance of the marital institution, therefore, involves\n                          sustenance of the rights of every husband and every wife in the\n                          country, united by a bond of marriage. Protection of the institution of\n                          marriage is, therefore, a sanctified constitutional and social goal.\n                          Preservation of the marital institution being the avowed object of\n                          retaining the impugned Exception on the statute book, the submission,\n                          of learned Counsel for the petitioners, that it has outlived its use is\n                          also completely bereft of substance.

The     proposition       is\n                          unexceptionable. It is in presuming the sequitur to this proposition to\n                          be that the impugned Exception is unconstitutional, that learned\n                          Counsel for the petitioners, in my considered opinion, err.

Marriage, unquestionably, does not entitle a husband to coerce\n                          his wife into sex, if she is not inclined. The impugned Exception does\n                          not, however, either expressly or by necessary implication, confer, on\n                          the husband in a marriage, an entitlement to insist on sex with his\n                          wife, against her willingness or consent (This aspect would be\n                          examined, in somewhat greater detail, a little later.) All that it says is\n                          that sexual intercourse and sexual acts - which one may, for the\n                          purposes of convenience, refer to, generally, as &quot;sex&quot; - by a husband\n                          with his wife, is not rape.

One of the\n                          grassroots justifications for marriage is, unquestionably, the right to\n                          engage in sexual activity without societal disapprobation.

That what he is doing is wrong, no one can deny. The\n                          distinction between the two situations is that, where the parties are\n                          married, the woman has consciously and willingly entered into a\n                          relationship with the man in which sex is an integral part. She may\n                          not, therefore, as Lord Hale thought, have cleaved unto the man for\n                          life, or surrendered her sexual autonomy to the will of the man. She\n                          has, nonetheless, by her decision to marry the man, given, to him, the\n                          right to expect meaningful conjugal relations with her. If, therefore,\n                          the man, in such a situation, requests her, on a particular occasion, to\n                          have sex, he is exercising a right that vests in him by marriage, and\n                          requests his wife to discharge an obligation which, too, devolves on\n                          her by marriage.    If the wife refuses, and the husband, nonetheless,\n                          has sex with her, howsoever one may disapprove the act, it cannot be\n                          equated with the act of ravishing by a stranger.     Nor can the impact\n                          on the wife, in such a situation, be equated with the impact of a\n                          woman who is raped by a stranger. Any assumption that a wife, who\n                          is forced to have sex with her husband on a particular occasion when\n                          she does not want to, feels the same degree of outrage as a woman\n                          raped by a stranger, in my view, is not only unjustified, but is ex facie\n                          unrealistic.

These\n                          disagreements could also extend to the bedroom. A husband may, on\n                          occasion, compel his wife to have sex with him, though she may not\n                          be inclined. Can it be said, with even a modicum of propriety, that her\n                          experience is the same as that of a woman who is ravaged by a\n                          stranger? Equally, can it be said, reasonably, that a wife, in a\n                          subsisting and surviving marriage with her husband with whom she\n                          cohabits who, on one or even more, occasions, has had to have sex\n                          with her husband despite her reluctance and unwillingness, would\n                          want to drag her husband to court for rape, seeking his incarceration\n                          under Section 376? The petitioners may contend in the affirmative; in\n                          my opinion, though there is no basis for such a contention. It cannot\n                          even be assumed, in my view, that the perceptions of the petitioners\n                          reflect the views of the majority of Indian women.          Any such\n                          contention would, at the very least, be purely presumptive in nature.\n                          This aspect is important.

The legislature feels that it does. In arriving at this conclusion,\n                          the legislature has, at its command, the vast arsenal of State resources.\n                          Legislation is not an overnight exercise, least of all when it involves\n                          the decision to define an act as an offence. If, therefore, the\n                          legislature, after interaction with stakeholders and after conscious\n                          deliberation and debate, forms the opinion that introduction of the\n                          concept of &#x27;rape&#x27; into the marital sphere may imperil the institution of\n                          marriage, this Court, at the instance of arguments of Counsel,\n                          howsoever gifted, would, in my opinion, be thoroughly ill-equipped to\n                          hold otherwise. Even if the legislature were merely to decide not to\n                          &#x27;take chances&#x27;, that, too, in my view, would not be an illegitimate\n                          consideration.   This Court cannot, therefore, substitute its view for\n                          that of the legislature, and hold, definitively, that treating non-\n                          consensual sex by a husband with his wife would not imperil, or\n                          threaten, the marital institution. Neither do we have the wherewithal,\n                          or the resources, to undertake an incursive study into the issue, nor,\n                          for that matter, can we legitimately do so. The consideration and the\n                          concern of the legislature are legitimate. The legislation must, ergo, be\n                          upheld.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_705\">                          132.

Our task is to adjudicate on\n                          whether, in desisting from treating him as a rapist, who has committed\n                          &quot;rape&quot; within the meaning of Section 375, punishable under Section\n                          376, the legislature can be said to have acted arbitrarily or\n                          unconstitutionally.

This, according to her, is unconstitutional, and\n                          violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_973\">Article 14.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_709\">                          135. The contention, to my mind, is completely bereft of substance.\n                          There is no principle, in law, that the same act, when committed by\n                          different persons, or by perpetrators differently situated vis-à-vis the\n                          victim, or in different circumstances, cannot be differently treated.\n                          Legally, there is no infirmity in treating the act as a crime in one\n                          circumstance, and perfectly condonable in another. A father slapping a\n                          son is not a criminal offence, whereas a stranger who slaps a child\n                          may well be committing a crime.

Even within the definition of rape, if\n                          the act is committed in one of the circumstances envisaged by Section\n                          376(2), it is treated as &quot;aggravated&quot; rape, entailing a higher punitive\n                          sentence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_710\">                          135 A Every offence has, essentially, four indicia; the perpetrator, the\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_654\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 105 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           victim, the act and the punishment. The four, together, assimilate into\n                          what a statute regards as a particular offence. It is not possible to\n                          vivisect the offence, as a statutory conception of the legislature, and\n                          start viewing these four indicia as individual components, unrelated to\n                          each other. An &quot;act&quot; cannot be divorced from its actor. Offences are\n                          not committed by insubstantial phantasms. An act of non-consensual\n                          sex, as committed by a complete stranger, cannot, therefore, be\n                          equated with an act of non-consensual sex by a husband. The extent of\n                          outrage felt by the wife, in the two cases, is also distinct and different.\n                          It would be artificial to assume that the degree of outrage felt by a\n                          wife who is compelled to have sex on a particular occasion with her\n                          husband, despite her unwillingness, is the same as the degree of\n                          outrage felt by a woman who is ravaged by a stranger against her will.\n                          Even when viewed from the point of view of the perpetrator, who is,\n                          after all, the statutory offender, and who has to suffer the punishment\n                          prescribed for the act, the legitimate expectation of sex, that the\n                          husband has, is, in my view, a factor which may legitimately be\n                          regarded as mitigating the culpability, as the perpetrator of the act of\n                          non-consensual sex, vis-à-vis a stranger who has no such legitimate\n                          expectation, much less a right. There is, therefore, an intelligible\n                          differentia in the two cases. From the point of view of the victim, it\n                          would be equally unrealistic to presume that a wife, on whom a\n                          husband forces sex, against her will on a particular occasion, would\n                          suffer the same degree of violation as a woman who is ravaged by a\n                          stranger. From the point of view of the victim, too, there is, therefore,\n                          an intelligible differentia.

As Ms. Nundy felicitously puts it,\n                          conjugal rights end where bodily autonomy begins. I am entirely in\n                          agreement with the submission. Where, however, I cannot agree with\n                          learned Counsel for the petitioners is in their further submission that,\n                          for this reason, the impugned Exception deserves to be struck down.\n                          The impugned Exception does not, either directly or by necessary\n                          implication, state that, by reason of marriage, a husband has a right to\n                          have sex with the wife against her will or consent. All that it says is\n                          that, if he does so, he, unlike a stranger committing such an act, cannot\n                          be treated as a rapist. There is a clear intelligible differentia between\n                          the two situations, viewed from the point of view of the act, the\n                          perpetrator, the victim, the degree of culpability and the degree of\n                          outrage that the victim would feel once the act is perpetrated. At the\n                          very least, if the legislature has chosen to treat the two situations\n                          differently, there is no justification, whatsoever, in my view, for a\n                          Constitutional court, exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_975\">Article 226</a> of the\n                          Constitution, to interfere with the view of the legislature, even if its\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_656\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 107 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           sensitivities impel it to think otherwise.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_713\">                          137. For this reason, the emphasis, placed by learned Counsel for the\n                          petitioners, on the fact that a decree for restitution of conjugal rights\n                          can merely restitute consortium and cohabitation, and cannot include\n                          any direction to the parties to have sex, is completely off the point.\n                          The impugned Exception does not seek, directly or indirectly, to\n                          enforce a non-enforceable conjugal right, or even a conjugal\n                          expectation. The existence of such a conjugal expectation, to normal\n                          sexual relations, read with the unique relationship of marriage,\n                          however, provides an intelligible differentia, having a rational nexus\n                          to the object of the impugned Exception, as well as to the object of\n                          Section 375 itself. The extent to which a decree for restitution of\n                          conjugal rights can extend, or can be enforced is not, therefore, a\n                          legitimate consideration, in assessing the constitutionality of the\n                          impugned Exception.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_714\">                          Is the impugned Exception arbitrary?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_715\">                          138.

The classification must not be arbitrary but must\n                                       be rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on\n                                       some qualities or characteristics which are to be found\n                                       in all the persons grouped together and not in others\n                                       who are left out but those qualities or characteristics\n                                       must have a reasonable relation to the object of the\n                                       legislation.

It is for this reason that, in In re.\n                          Natural Resources Allocation94 and State of M.P. v.

Else, the concept of &quot;arbitrariness&quot; may\n                          lead to a perplexing degree of subjectivity.

In this, the Court is also required to keep in mind the distinction\n                          between the object sought to be achieved by the statutory provision\n                          and the rationale for the object.     With respect to the impugned\n                          Exception, this distinction is important.    The object sought to be\n                          achieved by the impugned Exception is transparently obvious even\n                          from the Exception itself. It is to treat sex and sexual acts, between a\n                          husband and wife, differently from such acts committed between\n                          strangers, insofar as Section 375 is concerned. The rationale for this\n                          object which, as originally envisaged by Macaulay, may have been\n                          protection of the &quot;conjugal rights of the husband&quot; has evolved over a\n                          period of time and, today, if the legislature hesitates from it,\n                          admittedly, is to preserve the marital institution. The contention, of\n                          Ms. Nundy, that such an object is illegal is, to my mind, with respect,\n                          absurd, and merits outright rejection. She has, in this context, cited\n                          para 74 of the report in Independent Thought1 and para 212 of the\n                          report in Joseph Shine6. I cannot agree. Independent Thought1,\n                          expressly (as would be discussed at greater length later in this\n                          judgement) was examining the issue of whether preservation of the\n                          marital institution was a justification in the case of marriage with a\n                          girl child who, statutorily, was even incapable of giving meaningful\n                          consent.   It was in the backdrop of the unique dynamics of the\n                          constitutional duty to preserve and protect the girl child that the\n                          observations in Independent Thought1 were returned.

The decisions of the Supreme Court that expound on\n                          marriage, cited supra, bear testimony to this legal position.

Although the\n                                              doctrine of separation of powers has not been\n                                              recognised under the Constitution in its absolute\n                                              rigidity but the Constitution makers have meticulously\n                                              defined the functions of various organs of the State.\n                                              Legislature, executive and judiciary have to function\n                                              within their own spheres demarcated under the\n                                              Constitution. No organ can usurp the functions\n                                              assigned to another. The Constitution trusts to the\n                                              judgment of these organs to function and exercise their\n                                              discretion by strictly following the procedure\n                                              prescribed therein.

Judicial restraint is consistent with and complementary\n                                to the balance of power among the three independent branches\n                                of the State. It accomplishes this in two ways. First, judicial\n                                restraint not only recognises the equality of the other two\n                                branches with the judiciary, it also fosters that equality by\n                                minimising inter-branch interference by the judiciary. In this\n                                analysis, judicial restraint may also be called judicial respect,\n                                that is, respect by the judiciary for the other coequal branches.\n                                In contrast, judicial activism&#x27;s unpredictable results make the\n                                judiciary a moving target and thus decreases the ability to\n                                maintain equality with the co-branches. Restraint stabilises\n                                the judiciary so that it may better function in a system of\n                                inter-branch equality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_735\">                                                             *****\n\n\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_683\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                       Page 119 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_736\">                                      35.    The constitutional trade-off for independence is that\n                                     judges must restrain themselves from the areas reserved to the\n                                     other separate branches. Thus, judicial restraint complements\n                                     the twin, overarching values of the independence of the\n                                     judiciary and the separation of powers.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_737\">                          144.

The varying needs of\n                                     different classes of persons often require separate treatment\n                                     and it is, therefore, established by judicial decisions that the\n                                     equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the\n                                     American Constitution does not take away from the State the\n                                     power to classify persons for legislative purposes. This\n                                     classification may be on different bases. It may be\n                                     geographical or according to objects or occupations or the\n                                     like. If law deals equally with all of a certain well-defined\n                                     class it is not obnoxious and it is not open to the charge of a\n                                     denial of equal protection on the ground that it has no\n                                     application to other persons, for the class for whom the law\n                                     has been made is different from other persons and, therefore,\n                                     there is no discrimination amongst equals.

It was also pointed out in that\n                                   case that the burden was upon him who attacked a law for\n                                   unconstitutionality. In Lindsley v.

If there is a classification, the Court will\n                                   not hold it invalid merely because the law might have been\n                                   extended to other persons who in some respects might\n                                   resemble the class for which the law was made, for the\n                                   legislature is the best judge of the needs of the particular\n                                   classes and to estimate the degree of evil so as to adjust its\n                                   legislation according to the exigency found to exist. If,\n                                   however, there is, on the face of the statute, no classification\n                                   at all or none on the basis of any apparent difference\n                                   specially peculiar to any particular individual or class and\n                                   not applicable to any other person or class of persons and yet\n                                   the law hits only the particular individual or class it is\n                                   nothing but an attempt to arbitrarily single out an individual\n                                   or class for discriminating and hostile legislation.

As there is no infringement of the equal\n                                     protection rule, if the law deals alike with all of a certain\n                                     class, the legislature has the undoubted right of classifying\n                                     persons and placing those whose conditions are substantially\n                                     similar under the same rule of law, while applying different\n                                     rules to persons differently situated. It is said that the entire\n                                     problem under the equal protection clause is one of\n                                     classification or of drawing lines [ Vide Dowling - Cases on\n                                     Constitution Law, 4th edn. 1139]. In making the classification\n                                     the legislature cannot certainly be expected to provide\n                                     &quot;abstract symmetry&quot;. It can make and set apart the classes\n                                     according to the needs and exigencies of the society and as\n                                     suggested by experience.

It says, in significantly omnibus terms and without\n                          any caveat or condition attached, that sexual acts and sexual\n                          intercourse, by a man with his wife, are not rape. It does not refer to\n                          consent, or the lack of consent. It does not refer to force, pressure or\n                          injury.        It refers, plainly and simply, to &quot;sexual acts and sexual\n                          intercourse&quot;. Unlike judgments, every word used in a statute is to be\n                          treated as deliberately and consciously used. The manner in which a\n                          statutory provision is structured is of pre-eminent importance in\n                          understanding the scope and ambit of the provision. Just as tautology,\n                          and superfluity, can never be attributed to a legislative provision113,\n                          equally, the omission, on the part of the legislature, to use a particular\n                          expression which, otherwise, might have been expected to form part\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_698\">                          113</span>\n                                (1975) 1 SCC 76\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_699\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                            Page 125 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           of the provision, has also to be taken note of, as reflective of the\n                          legislative intent. Where, therefore, the legislature has not used the\n                          expression &quot;non-consensual&quot;, &quot;forced&quot;, or any other expression\n                          indicating absence of willingness or consent, in the impugned\n                          Exception, that omission has to be accorded its due significance. The\n                          obvious intent of the legislature, in using the omnibus expression\n                          &quot;sexual intercourse and sexual acts&quot;, without referring to presence,\n                          or absence, of consent, is to exclude, from the marital sphere, any\n                          allegation of rape. Expressed otherwise, what the legislature intends,\n                          quite clearly, is that an allegation of rape should find no place in a\n                          relationship of marriage. The taint of rape, in other words, according\n                          to the legislature, should never discolour a marital relationship\n                          between man and woman.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_745\">                          147.

The moment\n                          learned Counsel proceed on this premise, the controversy in issue in\n                          the case before us, and the challenge laid in the petition is immediately\n                          brushed aside, for the simple reason that, if non-consensual, or forced,\n                          sex between a man and woman is rape, the impugned Exception,\n                          which says that it is not, is already regarded as illegal. The issue in\n                          controversy before us, then, does not survive for consideration, and\n                          the dialogue takes off on a tangent which has nothing to do with the\n                          lis. By proceeding on this fundamentally erroneous premise, learned\n                          Counsel for the petitioners conveniently avoid the issue which actually\n                          falls for decision, viz., whether, in treating sex and sexual acts by a\n                          husband with his wife is not rape, the legislature has acted illegally or\n                          arbitrarily.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_748\">                          150.

There\n                          was, I must state, scant discussion on the precise issue before us,\n                          which is whether, in carving out an exception, from the offence of\n                          rape, to sexual acts committed within marriage, the legislature has, or\n                          has not, acted unconstitutionally. I also attempted to point out that\n                          there was, clearly, an intelligible differentia in the sexual relations,\n                          and the sexual equation, between a man and a woman who are not\n                          married, and between a man and woman who are married, and sought\n                          to elicit submissions from Counsel as to how, in view of the existence\n                          of such intelligible differentia - the existence of which Ms. Nundy\n                          has, in her written submissions, belatedly conceded - the legislature\n                          could be said to have acted unconstitutionally in treating non-\n                          consensual sexual acts committed within marriage differently from\n                          non-consensual sexual acts committed outside marriage.

The contention is obviously incorrect. Once\n                          again, it proceeds on the erroneous premise that a husband, in having\n                          sex with his wife without her consent, has committed rape; ergo,\n                          contend learned Counsel, in exempting the husband from prosecution\n                          for rape - which he has committed - the impugned Exception is\n                          unconstitutional.

It glosses over the\n                          fact that the impugned Exception is precisely that, i.e. an exception to\n                          Section 375. It, therefore, excepts the applicability of the main part of\n                          Section 375, in the situation envisaged by the Exception. It is futile to\n                          contend that, as it is contrary to the main provision, an Exception is\n                          unconstitutional, for every Exception is intended to refer to a situation\n                          in which the main provision would not apply. It is only, therefore,\n                          where the Exception, when applied, operates against the object of the\n                          main provision, or nullifies the applicability of the main provision\n                          altogether, that the Exception can be treated as unconstitutional on that\n                          ground. The impugned Exception 2 to Section 375 states that sexual\n                          intercourse and sexual acts by a husband with his wife are not rape.\n                          Its validity cannot be tested, therefore, by presuming that the act is\n                          rape, which appears to be the fundamental premise on which learned\n                          Counsel for the petitioners substantially rest their case. What has to\n                          be seen is as to whether, in excepting sexual intercourse and sexual\n                          acts by a husband with his wife from Section 375, the impugned\n                          Exception is unconstitutional. It is completely illogical, therefore, to\n                          contend that the impugned Exception defeats the object of the main\n                          part of Section 375, which seeks to criminalise rape, for the simple\n                          reason that the impugned Exception states that the acts envisaged\n                          therein are not rape.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_750\">                          152.

Read in conjunction, Section 375 and 376 provide for\n                          punishment of persons who commit rape.           &#x27;Rape&#x27; relates to non-\n                          consensual sexual acts, of the kind referred to in Section 375. I have\n                          already opined, earlier, that there is an intelligible differentia between\n                          sexual acts committed within the confines of marriage, vis-à-vis\n                          sexual acts committed between strangers. This differentia does not\n                          stand diluted merely because the act is non-consensual. Once such a\n                          differentia is found to exist, and the differentia is predicated on the sui\n                          generis nature of the relationship between the wife and the husband, in\n                          excepting acts done within such a relationship from the rigour of rape,\n                          the impugned Exception actually fosters and furthers the object of\n                          Section 375, which is to punish a grossly criminal act, that\n                          compromises the sexual autonomy and integrity of a woman.                It\n                          cannot be forgotten that a fixation of the label of &#x27;rapist&#x27; attaches, to a\n                          man, a stigma that lasts to his dying day. Where the man is the\n                          husband of the woman concerned, and the two are in a subsisting\n                          marital relationship, staying together, excepting the man from the\n                          possibility of being so labelled, in fact, subserves the object and\n                          intendment of Section 375.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_751\">                          153.

A Court may\n                          differ in its view; that cannot, however, be a basis to overturn the\n                          legislative perception, which represents the perception of the entire\n                          national populace.

Yet another ground on which it is sought to be contended that\n                          the impugned Exception is arbitrary is that it exempts husbands who\n                          commit gross acts of sexual violence against their wives. Ms. Nundy\n                          submits, in this regard, that exempting such acts from the ambit of\n                          &#x27;rape&#x27; cannot ever be regarded as subserving the object either of the\n                          impugned Exception or of Section 375. Nor, she submits, can it be\n                          said to foster the &#x27;conjugal rights&#x27; of the husband.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_753\">                          155. This argument, too, is fallacious.         The impugned Exception\n                          operates in an omnibus fashion, to all acts covered by Section 375. It\n                          does not condone such acts.         It merely states that such acts, if\n                          committed within marriage, would not be &#x27;rape&#x27;. The submission, in\n                          fact, overlooks the main concept behind Section 375. At the cost of\n                          repetition, Section 375 covers all acts, from a single act of unwilling\n                          sex to gross perversion. They are all covered under one umbrella.\n                          Even the grossest of acts envisaged by the first part of Section 375,\n                          would not amount to &#x27;rape&#x27;, if it does not fall within one of the\n                          circumstances stipulated in clauses &quot;firstly&quot; to &quot;seventhly&quot; in the\n                          provision; broadly, if it were consensual.          Ms. Nundy refers to\n                          insertion of objects in the body of the woman, and requiring the\n                          woman to have sex with third persons. Viewed any which way, these\n                          are, undoubtedly, acts of gross perversion.

The subjective view\n                          of a Court that an act bears criminal character, and ought to be\n                          criminally punished, is no ground for it to strike down the legislative\n                          provision, by operation of which the act is not so punishable.

At the highest, all that the Court can\n                          do in such a situation, is to recommend, to the legislature, to take a\n                          view in the matter, setting out what, in the perception of the Court, is\n                          the right approach. The legislature would not be bound to agree with\n                          the Court, or to follow the view suggested, for the simple reason that\n                          the legislature is a microcosm of the 130 crores that constitute the\n                          populace of the country, and represents their collective will and\n                          wisdom. It is not permissible for one person, or even a number of\n                          persons, clothed in silken robes, to superimpose their will and wisdom\n                          over the will and wisdom of the proletariat, as represented by the\n                          members of the legislature.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_758\">                          Consent and the &#x27;effect doctrine&#x27;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_759\">                          158.

To bring this point home,\n                          learned Counsel have emphasised the fact that, while assessing the\n                          constitutionality of a statutory provision, the Court is required to\n                          examine not just the provision as empirically worded, but the effect of\n                          the provision in practical application. If the effect of the provision is\n                          to violate the fundamental rights of individuals, learned Counsel\n                          submitted that the provision becomes unconstitutional.

If, therefore, a statutory provision operates\n                          unconstitutionally, or, in its operation, derogates from the fundamental\n                          rights of citizens, it would be unconstitutional.

The real\n                                     difficulty, however, in the way of the petitioners is that neither\n                                     the intention nor the effect and operation of the impugned Act\n                                     is to take away or abridge the right of freedom of speech and\n                                     expression enjoyed by the petitioners&quot;.

However, it was only R.C.

It may be pointed out that this doctrine is in\n                                     substance and reality nothing else than the test of pith and\n                                     substance which is applied for determining the\n                                     constitutionality of legislation where there is conflict of\n                                     legislative powers conferred on Federal and State Legislatures\n                                     with reference to legislative lists. The question which is asked\n                                     in such cases is: what is the pith and substance of the\n                                     legislations; if it &quot;is within the express powers, then it is not\n                                     invalidated if incidentally it effects matters which are outside\n                                     the authorised field&quot;. Here also, on the application of this\n                                     doctrine, the question that is required to be considered is :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_385\">                                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_738\">what is the pith and substance of the action of the State, or in\n                                     other words, what is its true nature and character; if it is in\n                                     respect of the subject covered by any particular fundamental\n                                     right, its validity must be judged only by reference to that\n                                     fundamental right and it is immaterial that it incidentally\n                                     affects another fundamental right.

Ms. John submits that &quot;the consequence of\n                          Exception 2 to Section 375 necessarily results in a complete and\n                          unequivocal disregard of the wife&#x27;s right to consent to sex within a\n                          marriage&quot;. Further, in her submissions, she states that the impugned\n                          Exception, &quot;in effect, accords immunity to a husband disregarding his\n                          wife&#x27;s non-consent&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_773\">                          164.

That, however, does not answer the issue, according to learned\n                          Counsel for the petitioners. Examine the effect of a wife&#x27;s refusing\n                          consent, they exhort the court.         Does the impugned Exception\n                          &quot;condone&quot;, in any manner, a husband forcing sex on his wife without\n                          her consent? Does it say that a husband has a right to have sex with\n                          his wife, whenever he desires, irrespective of whether she consents, or\n                          does not consent, to the act? Does the impugned Exception control\n                          the wife&#x27;s decisional autonomy, in such a situation? Clearly, the\n                          answer to all these questions has necessarily to be in the negative.\n                          What the learned Counsel for the petitioners seek to urge is that,\n                          somehow, by not regarding the act of the husband having sex with his\n                          wife, without her will or consent, as &#x27;rape&#x27; within the meaning of\n                          Section 375, thereby making it punishable as rape under Section 376,\n                          the impugned Exception condones the act and compromises on the\n                          wife&#x27;s right to grant, or refuse, consent. This contention, if it were to\n                          be accepted, would require acceptance of the premise that, in the first\n                          instance, the act of the husband in having sex with his wife against her\n                          will or consent is rape, or should be regarded as rape, and, in the\n                          second, that the impugned Exception restraints the victim-wife from\n                          prosecuting her husband for having committed rape upon her. In\n                          other words, the inability of the wife to prosecute her husband for rape\n                          is treated, by learned Counsel for the petitioners, as compromising on\n                          the wife&#x27;s right to grant, or refuse, consent to a request for sex, when\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_758\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 146 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           made by the husband. Learned Counsel for the petitioners would,\n                          therefore, seek to contend that there is an inherent right in the wife, in\n                          such a situation, to prosecute her husband for rape and nothing short\n                          of rape, and that, in compromising this right, her decisional autonomy,\n                          regarding whether to grant, or refuse, consent, also stands\n                          compromised.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_776\">                          167. To my mind, that is stretching the impugned Exception to a\n                          vanishing point. Every perceived consequence of the applicability of\n                          a statutory provision cannot be regarded as its direct and inevitable\n                          effect. What the petitioners seek to urge, in principle, is that, because\n                          the wife, in the event of the husband&#x27;s compelling her to have sex\n                          against her consent, cannot prosecute him for rape, therefore the wife\n                          would be compelled to consent to the act. The conclusion does not\n                          flow from the premise. The mere fact that, if the wife, on a particular\n                          occasion, were not to grant consent for sex with her husband, and if,\n                          nonetheless, the husband were to compel her to have sex, the act\n                          committed by him would not qualify as &#x27;rape&#x27; within the meaning of\n                          Section 375 cannot, in my view, be regarded as disregarding,\n                          altogether, the wife&#x27;s right to grant, or refuse, consent. It does not\n                          follow as a direct and inevitable effect of the operation of the\n                          impugned Exception.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_777\">                          168. In this context, the submissions of Ms. Nundy, reproduced in\n                          para 103 supra, are more cautious. She submits that the impugned\n                          Exception &quot;encourages a husband to have forced sexual intercourse\n                          with his wife&quot; and &quot;encourages some husbands to do illegally that\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_759\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 147 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           which cannot be done legally, on the purport that they are exercising\n                          their conjugal right&quot;. To my mind, the impugned Exception cannot be\n                          said to do the former and, if it does the latter, would not invalidate it.\n                          The impugned Exception does not encourage any husband to force sex\n                          on his wife, unmindful of her consent. If some husbands do feel so\n                          encouraged, that would be attributable solely to their own perverse\n                          predilections, and is certainly not the direct and inevitable effect of\n                          operation of the impugned Exception.           All that the impugned\n                          Exception does, at the cost of repetition many times over, is not to\n                          label, as &#x27;rape&#x27;, sexual activities between a husband and wife. To\n                          contend that, by extreme extrapolation, the effect of this provision\n                          would be that a wife would never be able to refuse consent to sex,\n                          when her husband demands it, is to visualise an eventuality which\n                          even the legislature, at the time of enacting the provision or even in\n                          the post-Constitutional period, could not legitimately be said to have\n                          envisaged.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_778\">                          169. There is another, and more important, infirmity in the &quot;consent&quot;\n                          argument advanced by the petitioners, and why it, essentially,\n                          obfuscates the main issue in controversy. Grant, or refusal, of consent\n                          by anyone, to any act, is a physical fact. If a man seeks sexual\n                          relations with a woman, and the woman refuses consent, that refusal,\n                          as a physical fact, is independent of any relationship between the man\n                          and woman. By emphasising on this physical fact, which remains the\n                          same irrespective of whether the man and woman are married, or\n                          unmarried, what the petitioners seek to do, effectively, is to obfuscate\n                          all other distinguishing features between the two situations.

At the same time, these obligations,\n                          expectations and considerations, which are completely absent in the\n                          case of a stranger who seeks sexual congress, do constitute a\n                          sufficient basis for the legislature to distinguish qualitatively\n                          between an incident of non-consensual sex within the marital\n                          sphere and without it. In view of these several distinguishing features\n                          that mark out the relationship between a husband and wife, and its\n                          dynamics both within and outside the confines of the bedroom, as sui\n                          generis, if the legislature has desired not to characterize husbands as\n                          rapists, I completely fail to see how the Court can hold otherwise.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_781\">                          172.

The submission, according to me, merits\n                          rejection outright. As learned Counsel for the petitioners stated, the\n                          aspect of want of consent is one of the necessary ingredients of the\n                          offence of &#x27;rape&#x27;, as defined in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_1061\">Section 375</a>, IPC. It is not possible,\n                          therefore, for a Court to deal with the provision, without\n                          understanding the concept of &#x27;consent&#x27;. Having said that, as I have\n                          already expressed, foregrounding of the concept of consent is really\n                          not justified in the backdrop of the controversy in issue, as consent is\n                          a static fact, irrespective of the other differentiating factors that exist\n                          in non-consensual sex between strangers, vis-à-vis non-consensual sex\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_766\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                     Page 152 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           between husband and wife, and what the Court is required to examine\n                          is whether these differentiating factors are sufficient to validate,\n                          constitutionally, the different treatment to non-consensual sex\n                          between husband and wife, as envisioned by the impugned Exception.\n                          The common factor of non-consent, therefore, really does not aid the\n                          discussion.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_785\">                          In the proverbial &#x27;nutshell&#x27;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_786\">                          176. The impugned Exception retains, intact, the wife&#x27;s decisional\n                          autonomy in the matter. She still has the right to either say no, or, as\n                          Ms. Nundy chooses to express it, &quot;a joyful yes&quot;.        The impugned\n                          Exception does not compromise her right, to do so, in any manner. In\n                          fact, the impugned Exception does not even come in for application, at\n                          that stage. It applies only if, despite the wife&#x27;s &quot;no&quot;, her husband\n                          nonetheless compels her to have sex.         In such a situation, the\n                          impugned Exception, for reasons which are perfectly valid and in sync\n                          with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1062\">Article 14</a>, holds that the husband cannot be convicted for rape.\n                          There is no inherent fundamental right, in the wife, to have her\n                          husband convicted for rape, relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1063\">Article 21</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1064\">Article 19</a>, or to\n                          any other Article in the Constitution.

What may make, or mar, a marriage, cannot be predicted\n                          by us. We cannot return a value judgement that, in regarding the\n                          removal, from the marital demographic, any suggestion of &#x27;rape&#x27;, as\n                          necessary for preservation and protection of the institution of\n                          marriage, and is in its best interests, the legislature has erred. That, in\n                          my view, would amount to no less than our sitting in appeal over the\n                          wisdom of the democratically elected legislature, which is completely\n                          and irrevocably proscribed by law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_788\">                          178.

Section\n                          375 is widely worded. It covers all manners of sexual acts, committed\n                          under one or more of the seven enumerated circumstances envisaged\n                          by clause as &quot;Firstly&quot; to &quot;Seventhly&quot;. The decision not to apply, to\n                          sexual acts committed within marriage, the concept of &#x27;rape&#x27; would,\n                          but of necessity, cover all the acts envisaged by Section 375. The fact\n                          that, in so doing, acts of gross perversion would also stand covered,\n                          cannot operate to invalidate the impugned Exception. There are other\n                          provisions that criminally penalise, to an equal if not greater degree,\n                          such acts, especially where they result in physical injury to the\n                          woman. These provisions, therefore, serve to differentiate gross acts,\n                          among those contemplated by Section 375, with &quot;milder&quot; offences. If\n                          the case of the petitioners - which appears to be one of the lines of\n                          argument advanced by Ms Rebecca John - is that these provisions\n                          only cater to specific circumstances, such as cruelty, attempted to\n                          commit suicide, grievous hurt, and the like, and do not cover simple\n                          cases of a husband compelling his wife to have sex without her\n                          willingness or consent, that, then, would be a case which they would\n                          have to take up before the Parliament, seeking enactment of a law to\n                          cover all cases of non-consensual sexual intercourse or sexual acts\n                          between husband and wife. The Parliament is empowered to legislate\n                          and frame a new law for the said purpose. Equally, the Parliament\n                          may also deem it appropriate to do away with the impugned\n                          Exception.     We, however, cannot do so, unless the impugned\n                          Exception is constitutionally vulnerable.    That, in my considered\n                          opinion, it is not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_789\">Signature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_772\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                  Page 157 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           &#x27;Fair labelling&#x27;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_790\">                          179.

No perceptible foundation, for this\n                          submission, is forthcoming, save and except the personal perception\n                          of Ms Nundy (and of other learned counsel espousing the same\n                          cause).   This submission is predicated, in turn, on the essentially\n                          faulty premise that every act of non-consensual sex by a man with a\n                          woman, irrespective of the relationship between them, the\n                          circumstances in which they are situated, and every other\n                          distinguishing feature, is necessarily to be regarded as rape.

The plea of &quot;fair labelling&quot;, advanced by Ms Nundy\n                          has, therefore, in my view, to be rejected\n\n\n                          Article 19(1)(a)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_791\">                          180.

Upon going through the submissions advanced by\n                          learned Counsel, as well as learned amici, there is, really nothing\n                          more, which could be said to be substantial, with respect to the\n                          submission that the impugned Exception violates the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1077\">Article 21</a> rights\n                          of women. Ms. Nundy submits that any restraint, on a woman&#x27;s right\n                          to refuse participation in sexual activity, compromises her bodily\n                          integrity and, resultantly, her rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1078\">Article 21.</a> I have already\n                          opined that the impugned Exception does not, directly or indirectly,\n                          affect the woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual activity. I\n                          have also pointed out that there is no fundamental right, either in\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1079\">Article 21</a> or in any other article of the Constitution, to a woman to\n                          prosecute a man, who has sex with her without her consent, for rape.\n                          Such a right does exist, if the act falls within Section 375, and is not\n                          covered by either of the Exceptions thereto.

If one were to apply, practically, what has been said by Mr. Rao\n                          of the crime of &quot;rape&quot;, the entire raison d&#x27;etre of the impugned\n                          Exception becomes apparent.              As Mr. Rao correctly states, rape\n                          inflicts, on the woman, a &quot;deep sense of some deathless shame&quot;, and\n                          results in deep psychological, physical and emotional trauma,\n                          degrading the very soul of the victim. When one examines these\n                          aspects, in the backdrop of sexual assault by a stranger, vis-à-vis non-\n                          consensual sex between husband and wife, the distinction in the two\n                          situations becomes starkly apparent. A woman who is waylaid by a\n                          stranger, and suffers sexual assault - even if it were to fall short of\n                          actual rape - sustains much more physical, emotional and\n                          psychological trauma than a wife who has, on one, or even more than\n                          one, occasion, to have sex with her husband despite her unwillingness.\n                          It would be grossly unrealistic, in my considered opinion, to treat\n                          these two situations as even remotely proximate.

The gross effects, on the physical and emotional\n                          psyche of a woman who is forced into non-consensual sex, against her\n                          will, by a stranger, cannot be said to visit a wife placed in the same\n                          situation vis-à-vis her husband.

If, therefore, the legislature does not\n                          choose to attach, to the latter situation, the appellation of &#x27;rape&#x27;, which\n                          would apply in the former, the distinction is founded on an intelligible\n                          differentia, and does not call for judicial censure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_798\">                          185.

Learned counsel for the petitioners emphatically contend\n                          otherwise. According to them, the &quot;offence of rape&quot; already exists, in\n                          Section 375, and all that striking down of the impugned Exception\n                          would achieve is removal of an unconstitutional restraint on the\n                          operation of the main Section. According to them, while removal of\n                          the impugned Exception may enlarge the class of offenders liable to\n                          be prosecuted for an offence under Section 375, it would not create a\n                          new offence. Ms. Nundy has sought to draw a distinction between\n                          creation of an offence and enlargement of the class of persons who\n                          would be regarded as offenders.

The only jarring note in this scheme of\n                                the pro-child legislations is to be found in Exception 2 to\n                                <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_1116\">Section 375</a> IPC which provides that sexual intercourse with\n                                a girl child between 15 and 18 years of age is not rape if the\n                                sexual intercourse is between the girl child and her husband.\n                                Therefore, the question of punishing the husband simply does\n                                not arise.

Therefore such a girl child\n                                has no recourse to law under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1125\">IPC</a>\n                                notwithstanding that the marital rape could degrade and\n                                humiliate her, destroy her entire psychology pushing her into\n                                a deep emotional crisis and dwarf and destroy her whole\n                                personality and degrade her very soul.

There can be no dispute that a law can be set aside if it\n                                is discriminatory. Some elements of discrimination have\n                                already been dealt with while dealing with the issue of\n                                arbitrariness. However, there are certain other aspects which\n                                make Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_1157\">Section 375</a> IPC insofar as it deals with\n                                the girl child totally discriminatory. The law discriminates\n                                between a girl child aged less than 18 years, who may be\n                                educated and has sexual intercourse with her consent and a\n                                girl child who may be married even before the age of 15\n                                years, but her marriage has been consummated after 15 years\n                                even against her consent. This is invidious discrimination\n                                which is writ large. The discrimination is between a\n                                consenting girl child, who is almost an adult and non-\n                                consenting child bride. To give an example, if a girl aged 15\n                                years is married off by her parents without her consent and\n                                the marriage is consummated against her consent, then also\n                                this girl child cannot file a criminal case against her husband.\n                                The State is talking of the reality of the child marriages. What\n                                about the reality of the rights of the girl child? Can this\n                                helpless, underprivileged girl be deprived of her rights to say\n                                &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to marriage? Can she be deprived of her right to\n                                say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to having sex with her husband, even if she\n                                has consented for the marriage? In my view, there is only one\n                                answer to this and the answer must be a resounding &quot;NO&quot;.\n                                While interpreting such a law the interpretation which must\n                                be preferred is the one which protects the human rights of the\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_798\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                         Page 174 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                                 child, which protects the fundamental rights of the child, the\n                                one which ensures the good health of the child and not the\n                                one which tries to say that though the practice is &quot;evil&quot; but\n                                since it is going on for a long time, such &quot;criminal&quot; acts\n                                should be decriminalised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_845\">                                185. The State is entitled and empowered to fix the age of\n                                consent. The State can make reasonable classification but\n                                while making any classification it must show that the\n                                classification has been made with the object of achieving a\n                                certain end. The classification must have a reasonable nexus\n                                with the object sought to be achieved. In this case the\n                                justification given by the State is only that it does not want to\n                                punish those who consummate their marriage. The stand of\n                                the State is that keeping in view the sanctity attached to the\n                                institution of marriage, it has decided to make a provision in\n                                the nature of Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_1158\">Section 375</a> IPC. This begs the\n                                question as to why in this Exception the age has been fixed as\n                                15 years and not 18 years. As pointed out earlier, a girl can\n                                legally consent to have sex only after she attains the age of 18\n                                years. She can legally enter into marriage only after attaining\n                                the age of 18 years. When a girl gets married below the age of\n                                18 years, the persons who contract such a marriage or abet in\n                                contracting such child marriage, commit a criminal offence\n                                and are liable for punishment under the PCMA. In view of\n                                this position there is no rationale for fixing the age at 15\n                                years. This age has no nexus with the object sought to be\n                                achieved viz. maintaining the sanctity of marriage because by\n                                law such a marriage is not legal. It may be true that this\n                                marriage is voidable and not void ab initio (except in the State\n                                of Karnataka) but the fact remains that if the girl has got\n                                married before the age of 18 years, she has the right to get her\n                                marriage annulled. Irrespective of the fact that the right of the\n                                girl child to get her marriage annulled, it is indisputable that a\n                                criminal offence has been committed and other than the girl\n                                child, all other persons including her husband, and those\n                                persons who were involved in getting her married are guilty\n                                of having committed a criminal act. In my opinion, when the\n                                State on the one hand, has, by legislation, laid down that\n                                abetting child marriage is a criminal offence, it cannot, on the\n                                other hand defend this classification of girls below 18 years\n                                on the ground of sanctity of marriage because such\n                                classification has no nexus with the object sought to be\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_799\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                        Page 175 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                                 achieved.

The husband is not immune from prosecution as far\n                                as other offences are concerned. Therefore, if the husband\n                                beats a girl child and has forcible sexual intercourse with her,\n                                he may be charged for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_1161\">Sections 323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_1162\">324</a>,\n                                <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_1163\">325</a> IPC, etc. but he cannot be charged with rape. This leads\n                                to an anomalous and astounding situation where the husband\n                                can be charged with lesser offences, but not with the more\n                                serious offence of rape. As far as sexual crimes against\n                                women are concerned, these are covered by <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_1164\">Sections 354</a>,\n                                <a href=\"/doc/106760949/\" id=\"a_1165\">354-A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/166765731/\" id=\"a_1166\">354-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/26970281/\" id=\"a_1167\">354-C</a>, <a href=\"/doc/27280854/\" id=\"a_1168\">354-D</a> IPC.

There\n                                is no exception clause giving immunity to the husband for\n                                such offences. <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_1169\">The Domestic Violence Act</a> will also apply in\n                                such cases and the husband does not get immunity.

In its judgement in Independent Thought1, the\n                          Supreme Court went to the extent of cautioning and clarifying, not\n                          once but four times, that it was not dealing with the issue of marital\n                          rape, i.e. non-consensual sex between adults who were married and\n                          that the judgement was not to be treated as an expression of opinion\n                          on the said issue, even collaterally. To my mind, any attempt to treat\n                          the decision as an authority, even collaterally, on the issue of\n                          constitutionality of the impugned Exception to the extent it applies to\n                          a marriage between adults, whether directly or        by    employing\n                          interpretative calisthenics predicated on the &quot;inversion test&quot; or any\n                          other test, for that matter, would not only be thoroughly misguided,\n                          but would also amount to a conscious disregard of the words of\n                          caution and clarification used by the Supreme Court itself. I am also\n                          not inclined, obviously, to agree with Mr. Gonsalves&#x27; submission that\n                          the Supreme Court could not, in its judgement, have indicated the\n                          scope of its application. I am unaware of any legal principle that\n                          would support this somewhat extreme contention. Mr. Gonsalves has\n                          cited some decisions dealing with cases in which judgements\n                          contained a caveat that they were not to be construed as precedents.\n                          The extent to which one may rely on an earlier pronouncement by a\n                          superior court, where the pronouncement contains an omnibus caveat\n                          that it is not to be considered as a precedent, is somewhat nuanced\n                          and, in my view, open to debate. Perhaps, if the facts of a particular\n                          case are identical to those in the precedent concerned, a court, lower\n                          in the judicial hierarchy, may deem it advisable not to chart a course\n                          opposed to that charted by the Supreme Court.          We need not,\n                          however, enter into that debate, for the simple reason that the caveat,\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_805\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                  Page 178 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           to be found in Independent Thought1, is not that it is not to be treated\n                          as a precedent, but that the Supreme Court was not, in the said\n                          decision, concerned with the constitutionality of the impugned\n                          Exception, to the extent it applied to a marriage between adults, and\n                          had not expressed any opinion, even collaterally, regarding that issue.\n                          The Supreme Court was, in fact, merely harmonising the stipulation of\n                          the age of the wife, in the impugned Exception, as 15 years and above,\n                          with the main part of Section 375, as well as the provisions of the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_1182\">POCSO Act</a> and the PCMA, which envisaged the act to be an offence\n                          when committed with the woman of 18 years of age and below.

There is a presumption that the legislation\n                          is constitutional.    Though Puttaswamy42 seems to restrict the\n                          applicability of this principle in the case of pre-Constitutional\n                          legislations, there is substance in Mr. Sai Deepak&#x27;s contention that,\n                          where the validity, and the need for continuance, of the legislation has,\n                          been considered for discussion and debate on the floor of Parliament\n                          and otherwise, in the post-Constitutional era, a vestige of\n                          constitutionality would certainly attach to the legislation.

Even while, thus, affirming the power of a Court to strike\n                          down the statutory provision as unconstitutional for valid grounds, the\n                          Supreme Court, nonetheless, went on to enter a caveat to this\n                          proposition, by clarifying that there could be &quot;no cavil of doubt that\n                          the courts cannot create an offence&quot;. Having so clarified, the Supreme\n                          Court, applying the principle to the case before it, held that it was not\n                          creating an offence as the age of 18, for the woman, already found\n                          place in the main part of Section 375, and was punishable under the\n                          PCMA as well as the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_1199\">POCSO Act</a>, in the latter case as penetrative\n                          sexual assault which, held the Supreme Court, was merely another\n                          expression for rape.

In other\n                          words, if a provision is found to be unconstitutional, the Court may\n                          strike it down provided, by doing so, it is not creating an offence. If,\n                          by its judgement, the Court creates an offence, there is an absolute\n                          proscription, even if the provision is otherwise unconstitutional. If\n                          this were not the legal position, there was no occasion, at all, for the\n                          Supreme Court, having held that a case for reading down the\n                          impugned Exception existed, to examine whether, by doing so, it was\n                          creating an offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_865\">                          197. While the proscription on creation of an offence by judicial\n                          action is, in a way, a mere extrapolation of the principle that Courts\n                          cannot legislate, or take over the function of the legislature, the\n                          principle, even otherwise, accords with common sense, as well as the\n                          realities of the legislative process. Legislation is a complex exercise,\n                          especially where it involves designation of an act as an offence.\n                          Inasmuch as the decision would have nationwide repercussions, it\n                          cannot be undertaken by a body which is possessed neither of the\n                          wherewithal, nor the resources, to undertake it. Judges sitting in\n                          courts cannot, on the basis of arguments of Counsel, howsoever\n                          persuasive, create offences, or pass judgements which would result in\n                          an act, otherwise not an offence, being rendered an offence. The effect\n                          of designating an act as a criminal offence, on all who may commit\n                          that act, cannot be forgotten. For that reason, extensive consultation\n                          with all stakeholders, especially given the fact that India is a country\n                          of diverse cultures, religions, beliefs and social and societal realities,\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_821\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 185 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           is absolutely necessary.

Yet another reason why the Court cannot create an offence, is\n                          because a Court cannot legislatively stipulate the punishment for the\n                          offence. In the present case, for example, there is no stipulated\n                          punishment for an act of non-consensual sex, by a husband with his\n                          wife, as it is does not amount to &#x27;rape&#x27; and, consequently, Section 376\n                          would not apply to it. If the impugned Exception was to be struck\n                          down, we would make, ipso facto, the punishments envisaged by\n                          Section 376, applicable to such a husband, where the legislature never\n                          intended these punishments to apply to him. We, therefore, would be\n                          doing something which was never within the contemplation of the\n                          legislature, which may be even worse, jurisprudentially, than judicial\n                          legislation itself. If the Court is not empowered to prescribe\n                          punishments, equally, the Court cannot, by its order, convert an act\n                          which, prior thereto, was not an offence, into an offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_867\">                          199. To this, learned Counsel submit that the Court should strike\n                          down the impugned Exception as unconstitutional and recommend, to\n                          the legislature, to consider modulating or reducing the punishments\n                          prescribed in Section 376 to cater to cases of non-consensual sex\n                          within marriage which would, thereby, qualify as &#x27;rape&#x27;.        To my\n                          mind, the suggestion bears rejection, outright. That, in fact, is one of\n                          the reasons why Courts cannot, by judicial fiat, create offences.\n                          Creation of an offence would entail, in its wake, prescribing of a\n                          punishment, and that, most definitively, the Court cannot do.

Any allegation of rape by a husband of his wife\n                          is, therefore, anathema to the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1201\">IPC</a>, and directly contrary to the\n                          impugned Exception.

The contention, of Ms Nundy, that the Court would not be\n                          creating an offence, but would be merely enlarging the class of\n                          offenders, is obviously fallacious. This contention is predicated on\n                          the premise that the specification, in the impugned Exception,\n                          excepting husbands, vis-à-vis their wives, from the scope of an\n                          allegation of &#x27;rape&#x27; is something apart from the main Section 375. I\n                          am unable to agree. To my mind, as I have already observed earlier,\n                          every offence consists of four ingredients, i.e., the act, the perpetrator,\n                          the victim and the punishment. Offences may legitimately be made\n                          perpetrator-specific or victim-specific. In the present case, Section\n                          375, read as a whole, makes the act of &#x27;rape&#x27; perpetrator-specific, by\n                          excepting, from its scope, sexual acts by a husband with his wife.\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_825\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                     Page 188 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           Though this stipulation finds its place in the impugned Exception, it\n                          might, just as well, have figured in the main part of Section 375.

The submission of Ms Nundy - and other learned Counsel - is,\n                          in fact, essentially yet anoher fallout of their fundamentally fallacious\n                          premise that every act of non-consensual sex by a man with a woman\n                          is, of necessity, &quot;rape&quot;. This erroneous premise is extrapolated to\n                          treating the impugned Exception as merely exempting a class of\n                          offenders from the rigour of Section 375. This, as I have held, is a\n                          clear misreading of the impugned Exception.             The impugned\n                          Exception does not say that husbands would be exempted, or excepted,\n                          from being prosecuted for rape; it says, rather, that, sexual acts\n                          between a husbanad and wife are not rape. The offence of rape,\n                          therefore, does not exist, where the man and woman are married.\n                          Where there is no offence, there can, axiomatically, be no offender.\n                          The impugned Exception does not, therefore, exempt a category of\n                          offenders from the purview of Section 375 who, by eviscerating the\n                          Exception, we would be bringing within the four corners of the\n                          provision.    Rather, by striking down the impugned Exception, we\n                          would be pronouncing that an act of non-consensual sex between a\n                          husband and a wife is rape, where, as the statutory position stands\n                          now, it is not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_875\">                          206.

Clearly, therefore, even in stipulating the punishments for rape,\n                          in Section 376, the legislature, consciously, does not intend to extend\n                          its ambit to husbands, vis-à-vis their wives.                                             The stipulated\n                          punishments have factored in the impugned Exception.

To my mind, the concern, predicated on <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_1207\">Section 114A</a> of the\n                          Evidence Act, is legitimate. Section 114A presumes want of consent\n                          on the part of the prosecutrix, in every case of prosecution for rape. If\n                          &quot;rape&quot; is to apply even to non-consensual sex within marriage, and a\n                          wife is to allege want of consent, it may conceivably become\n                          extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the husband to discharge the\n                          onus cast on him, by Section 114A, to prove existence of consent, as\n                          the act has taken place within the confines of the bedroom.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_888\">                          215. I do not propose to express any final opinion on this aspect as it\n                          would be a matter for the concerned Court, seized with prosecution\n                          proceedings alleging the Marital Rape (if the impugned Exception is\n                          ultimately to perish) to deliberate upon a case-to-case basis. Suffice it\n                          to state that the manner in which the effect of Section 114A, if non-\n                          consensual sex within marriage is to be treated as rape, would operate,\n                          is a valid consideration and, if it has also weighed with the legislature\n                          in its decision not to remove the impugned Exception, the concern is\n                          legitimate. This would operate as yet another reason why the Court\n                          cannot, in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1208\">Article 226</a> of the\n                          Constitution of India, trump the legislative wisdom and strike down\n                          the impugned Exception.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_889\">                          216.

An\n                          offence does not exist in isolation or in vacuo. A provision creating\n                          an offence carries, with it, its entrails and its viscerae.           If,\n                          hypothetically, the legislature were, on the persuasion of the\n                          opponents of the impugned Exception, to do away with it, that would\n                          also necessitate, in its wake, other legislative changes. Quite possibly,\n                          the punishments provided in Section 376 may have to be duly\n                          modified in order to deal with the newly created offence of &quot;marital\n                          rape&quot;. Equally, changes may also be required to be incorporated in\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_1209\">Section 114A</a> of the Evidence Act. These are all imponderables.\n                          What is being sought of this Court is that, oblivious of all the other\n                          statutory changes which removal of the impugned Exception would\n                          necessarily entail, the Court should telescope its view merely to\n                          concentrate on the impugned exception and strike it down.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_890\">                          217.   In my view, this is not permissible. This Court does not have\n                          the competence or the authority to envision or carry out all other\n                          concomitant legislative changes which removal of the impugned\n                          Exception would necessitate. This is yet another reason why, if a case\n                          for removal of the impugned Exception is to be pleaded, that has to be\n                          pleaded before the legislature which, if it is convinced with the plea,\n                          would not only remove the impugned Exception but would also\n                          deliberate on other resultant legislative changes which have to be\n                          undertaken. In my view, it would be a complete misadventure for the\n                          Court to strike down the impugned Exception and, thereafter, leave it\n                          to the legislature to effect other necessary legislative amendments\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_832\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                   Page 194 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           consequent to the verdict of the Court, allowing a situation of chaos to\n                          prevail in the interregnum.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_891\">                          Other submissions\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_892\">                          218.

We are concerned, here, with the issue\n                          of   whether    to   strike   down   the   impugned     Exception     as\n                          unconstitutional.

It is\n                          important to note that Section 376B does not characterise the act of\n                          non-consensual sexual intercourse by the man with the woman, in\n                          such a situation, as &#x27;rape&#x27;. It treats it as a distinct and different\n                          offence altogether, with a different punishment stipulated for its\n                          commission. Where marital ties have severed, even if short of an\n                          actual divorce, then, absent consent, the husband has no reasonable\n                          conjugal expectation of sex with his wife. The unique indicia that\n                          apply to a healthy, subsisting and surviving marriage, therefore, have\n                          ceased to apply. This, again, is a situation which is qualitatively\n                          distinct from a situation of sex between strangers, as also from one of\n                          sex between a husband and wife who are cohabiting with one another.\nSignature valid\nDigitally Signed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_839\">                          WP (C) No 284/2015 &amp; connected matters                    Page 198 of 200</span>\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:11.05.2022\n18:14:04\n                           While, therefore, it cannot be equated with sex between strangers, it\n                          is, nonetheless, also not alike to sex between a couple who stay and\n                          cohabit together.       An advisable middle path has, therefore, been\n                          carved out by the legislature to cater to such cases, and I see no reason\n                          to interfere with the dispensation. Of course, it would be for the court\n                          to see, in every case, as to whether the couple is, in fact, &quot;living\n                          separately&quot;. As the marriage is, nonetheless, subsisting, though the\n                          couple is not together, the legislature has chosen to prescribe a\n                          suitable lesser punishment for the offence. The exercise of legislative\n                          discretion is entirely in order, and, to my mind, the challenge to the\n                          vires of the provision has no legs, whatsoever, to stand on.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_907\">                          223.
