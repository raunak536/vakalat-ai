In case of default of payment of fine, the appellants have been further sentenced to undergo  rigorous imprisonment for six months. All the sentences were directed to run concurrently.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.\tThe prosecution story reveals that on 15.11.1993 when at about 2.00 P.M., the complainant was going to his house from market and reached near Bakshipura, Kailash Nagar, Indira Shikhsha Niketan then heard some noise of female. He stopped himself there and inquired from the women gathered there. The ladies present there intimated him that Prem Chand with his friends came with a girl and he is inside the room. Two persons were waiting and standing outside the room keeping watch on the situation. The complainant made a noise, on that, the persons standing outside the room fled away and after chasing them one of them was caught hold. One of the person who was inside the room also fled away from the room. He was also chased and was caught hold. In the mean time Shahid Ali, Abdul Rahman and Maya Ram reached there and when they entered into the room, they saw that the appellant Prem Chand was standing there in a naked position. The victim, a minor girl was crying on the floor. When inquired from the victim, she narrated that the accused appellant Prem Chand allured her by giving Rs.20/- and came here with his friends and committed rape one by one. She had also communicated that Prem Chand, who was caught hold on the spot, allured her and committed bad thing inside the room one by one and two persons were keeping watch standing outside the room. In the mean time the persons gathered there, chased the appellant Magadhu also who was caught hold. The matter was reduced into writing and communicated to the police station with giving custody of the persons, present appellants to the police where a first information report was lodged under these sections and the victim was medically examined by the doctor. She was given to the custody of her guardian and after investigation, a charge sheet was submitted before the court. Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate took the cognizance and committed the case to the court of session where all the accused were summoned and charges under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_9\">sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_10\">366</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1677485/\" id=\"a_11\">376(2)(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_12\">342</a> IPC were framed against them for which they pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.\t In order to prove the prosecution case, PW-1 complainant Vijay Kumar, PW-2 victim , PW-3 Maya Ram , PW-4 SHO Sushil Kumar Singh, PW-5 Dr. Sushma Mishra, PW-6 Constable Mohd. Jalis and PW-7 Constable Ram Awtar were examined. In the statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. the accused-appellants denied from the charges and stated that the complainant and the witnesses were inimical to them. The appellant Prem Chand had stated that he was called from a nearby place. He with his friends were falsely implicated in this case. No defence witness has been examined by the appellants. Learned trial court after examining and assessment of the evidence found all the accused appellants guilty and sentenced them, as above.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.\t During pendency of the appeal, the appellant accused Magadhu died, thus the appeal against Magadhu stands abated. Learned counsel for the appellants had submitted that the offence as contained in <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 363</a> IPC is not made out because there was no kidnapping from lawful guardianship. The story reveals that the girl/victim who was minor was induced by offering an amount of Rs. 20/- and was taken away to one of the room which was in possession of appellant Prem Chand and all the remaining accused-appellants who formed a group to commit sexual offence and with premeditation and pre-consultation followed Prem Chand  and committed rape.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">5. \tSimple offer of Rs.20/- and taking away the victim do not mean that she was consenting party or she was not taken from lawful guardianship. Even if the victim was in the market, she can be deemed to be always in the custody of lawful guardianship and any one who is  inducing to take away with certain allurement can be said to have taken away the victim from lawful guardianship. The explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 361</a> IPC runs to say that the words lawful guardian in this Section include any person lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of said minor or other person.  On the basis of above, the fact that the victim was in the market does not mean that she was not under lawful guardianship. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">6.\tIt has further been contended by learned counsel for the State that in considering the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 361</a> IPC and other cognate Sections of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">Indian Penal Code</a> it was necessary to bear in mind that these provisions were intended more for the protection of the minors and persons of unsound mind themselves that for the rights of the guardians of such persons. <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 361</a>, <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_19\">363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_20\">366</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1629021/\" id=\"a_21\">368</a> IPC are quoted below:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;361. Kidnapping from lawful guardianship.--Whoever takes or entices any minor under 1[sixteen] years of age if a male, or under 2[eighteen] years of age if a female, or any person of unsound mind, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor or person of unsound mind, without the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship. Explanation.--The words &quot;lawful guardian&quot; in this section include any person lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of such minor or other person.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">363. Punishment for kidnapping.--Whoever kidnaps any person from 1[India] or from lawful guardianship, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">366. Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marÂ­riage, etc.--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; 1[and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall be punishable as aforesaid].\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">368. Wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person.--Whoever, knowing that any person has been kidnapped or has been abducted, wrongfully conceals or confines such person, shall be punished in the same manner as if he had kidnapped or abducted such person with the same intention or knowledge, or for the same purpose as that with or for which he conceals or detains such person in confinement.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.\tLearned counsel for appellants has further argued that the victim/prosecutrix was major at the time of occurrence. In the first information report, the age of the victim was not mentioned but the perusal of record reveals that at the time of recording the statement of the witnesses, PW-2 was shown as 10 to 12 years and it was assessment of the court before the parties that certainly the incident was of year 1993 and the statement of the victim was recorded in  January 1995 thus certainly she was below 10 years and was minor. For the assessment of her age, on the basis of fusion of bones and physical development, she was medically examined where the medical officer Dr. Sushma Mishra has narrated that on 16.11.1993 she was posted as Medical Officer, Mahila Hospital, Baharaich and examined the victim and found her to be minor. Since  also stated on oath that there were tear found in her vaginal part fourchette which was due to penetration while committing the sexual intercourse. She has further narrated that the symptom can be found in case there was a penetration whether it was partial or more than partial. She has further stated that the tear was found on the vaginal part was fresh because heeling was not started.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">8.\tNow the question is as to whether in absence of any educational certificate the report submitted by the Medical Officer on the basis of fusion of bones or physical development of the victim and teeth as well can be taken into account.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">9.\tDetermination of age has become very relevant to fix the criminal liability upon a person for the reason that under <a href=\"/doc/1530896/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 82</a> Indian Penal Code (hereinafter called <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">IPC</a>), a child below the age of 7 years is not supposed to commit an offence. If a child between 7 and 12 years commits an offence, his immaturity and understanding of things is to be determined by the court under <a href=\"/doc/1703265/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 83</a> IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 361</a> IPC makes the kidnapping of a boy below 16 years and of a girl below 18 years from lawful guardianship an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1892519/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 363-A</a> IPC- kidnapping of a minor for maiming/begging is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1559723/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 366-A</a> IPC- procuration of a minor girl below 18 years is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1371751/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 366-B</a>- importing a girl below 21 years of age from a foreign land for the purpose of prostitution is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1684623/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 369</a> IPC, kidnapping/ abducting a child under the age of 10 years, with intent to steal from his person, is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1938563/\" id=\"a_30\">Sections 372</a>, <a href=\"/doc/530949/\" id=\"a_31\">373</a> selling and purchasing a minor below 18 years of age for the purpose of prostitution is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 375</a> IPC, rape even with the consent of a girl below 16 years or sexual intercourse with his wife below 15 years is an offence.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">10.\tAttainment of majority under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/80664820/\" id=\"a_33\">Indian Majority Act, 1875</a>, competence for bail a witness, as the law may provide minimum age for being a witness; eligibility for employment etc. one of paramount importance. There may be cases where employee may approach the court for correction of date of birth and in that case also, determination of age may become a relevant factor in this regard. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">11.\tAge of a person can be determined by examination of following parts of the body:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(i) Teeth (Dental age):- First the child has twenty milk teeth (temporary/deciduous teeth), which are replaced by permanent teeth after the age of five/six years, which takes two years to have complete set except the third molar, which erupts at the age of seventeen and above. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(ii) Height:- Generally, according to geographical situation, a person attains the height according to his age, but it does not provide for any general rule and may vary from person to person, depending upon the family conditions, including heredity/mal-nutrition etc. \n \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(iii) Weight:- A person may have a particular weight on attaining a particular age, or he gains weight according to age upto a certain limit. But no general formulae can be treated as weight depends upon race, climate, dietic, hereditary factors and other conditions.   \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(iv) General appearance (Minor signs):- Some idea may be taken regarding the age of a person from his appearance in general. For determining the age etc., the second sex character may also be relevant. The growth of hairs appears first on the pubes and then in the axillae (arm-pits). The first sign of beginning puberty is found with the appearance of hair along labia. In the case of girls, it commences with the appearance of soft and pale coloured browny hair on the pubes at the age of about thirteen years and a few sparse dark hairs appear at about fourteen years. The growth becomes thicker in the course of a year and two when hair commence to grow in the axillae. The development of breasts in girls commences from 13 to 14 years, but it is liable to be affected by loose habits and social environment. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(v) Ossification of bones:- This is a relevant factor for determination of the age. Ossification of bones occur upto the age of 18 years and it is examined seeing the fusion of the bones at the wrist, elbow and pelvis. But this factor becomes irrelevant on attaining the age of 18 years because by that time, fusion may completely take place. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">12.\tIn a child bones are not fully ossified (consolidated). Ossification centres for different bones appear at different ages and fuse or unite with the main bone at different ages. With the help of x-rays, it is possible to determine the extent of ossification and the union of epiphytic bones. This gives a fairly good estimate within a margin of 2 years. Appearance of ossification alter and fusion is at a different stage. For the purpose of  determining the age, study of ossification of bones of wrist, elbow and pelvis is very important. In case of wrist joint, there are about eight small and 2 long bones and completion of the said bones takes place at different age and all of them do not attain the fusion simultaneously. Similarly, for pelvis bone ossification centres, appear around 14 years of age and fuse between 17-20 years. The 3/4 gap appears in pelvis bone which are filled up after a time but generally they are completed by the age of 18 to 20 years. Different bones take different time to gain fusion. Similarly, in the case of elbow, there appears to be a gap in the bones and its completion takes place.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">13.\tIn light of above facts, I have considered the medical report submitted by the Medical Officer on the basis of  fusion of bones and development of physique and the statement of the doctor who had been examined to verify the X-ray report and age, I am of the view that the version of the expert/doctor who had opined the age of the victim about 12 years of age cannot be denied only on the basis of argument of learned counsel for the appellants and thus this Court is of the view that the victim was minor at the time of incident.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">14.\tNow the question raised before the court by the learned counsel for appellant is that offence as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 376</a> IPC has not been committed by the appellants. <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 376</a> IPC reads as under:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;376.

She has also narrated that the appellants committed rape forcefully without her consent and in the mean time one person came outside the room and entered into the room then one of the accused was also present there and another fled away. The person who caught hold the accused-appellant with the victim came to the police station from where she was sent to hospital for medical examination and after that she was taken to court for recording the statement. She had further stated that the appellant-accused induced her by payment of Rs. 20/- and also specifically narrated the fact of penetration by the appellants accused.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134531\" id=\"span_1\">16.\tWhile considering the trial of rape cases, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/134531/\" id=\"a_36\">State of A.P. v. Gangula Satya Murthy</a> (AIR 1997 SC 1588) held that the Courts are expected to show great responsibility. It was held thus:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">&quot;27. Before parting with the case we would like to point out that the Courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader       probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor       contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw out allegations of rape. This is all the more important because of late crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating woman&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection and we must emphasise that the Courts must deal with rape cases in particular with utmost sensitivity and appreciate the evidence in the totality of the background of the entire case and not in isolation.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_2\">One of us (Dr. Anand J.) has observed in <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_37\">State of  Punjab v.

Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase, It is an irony that while we are celebrating women&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violates the victim&#x27;s privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault - it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Court, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. ..... &quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">18.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91149\" id=\"span_4\">In Rameshwar S/o.Kalyan <a href=\"/doc/91149/\" id=\"a_39\">Singh v. The State of Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1952 SC 54), the accused was charged with the offence of raping a girl below eight years of age. The Supreme Court held that the High Court was right in holding that the guilt of the accused was proved by the evidence of the victim which was legally corroborated by the girl&#x27;s statement to her mother. The Supreme Court held thus:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\"> &quot;Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice. If she was ravished she is the  victim of an outrage. If she consented there is no offence unless she is a married woman, in which case questions of adultery may arise. .. That, in my opinion, is exactly the law in India so far as accomplices are concerned and it Is certainly not any higher in the case of sexual offences. The only clarification necessary for purposes of this country is where this class of offence is sometimes tried by a judge without the aid of jury. In these cases, it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had this rule of caution in mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it  unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the  particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corroboration in that particular case. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\t  The nature and extent of the corroboration is required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it. Here, again, the rules are lucidly expounded by Lord Reading in Baskerville&#x27;s case,(1916) 2, K. B. 658 at p. 664 to 669. It would be impossible, indeed it would be dangerous, to formulate the kind of evidence which should, or would, be regarded as corroboration. Its nature and extent must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged. But to this extent the rules are clear.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\t First, it is not necessary that there should be  independent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independent evidence in the case,apart from the testimony of the complainant or the accomplice, should in itself be sufficient to sustain conviction.

It has been held that the prosecutrix cannot be considered to be an accomplice. As a rule of prudence, however, it has been emphasised that Courts should normally look for some corroboration of her testimony in order to satisfy itself that the prosecutrix is telling the truth and that a person, accused of abduction or rape, has not been falsely implicated. The view that, as a matter of law, no conviction without corroboration was possible has not been accepted. The only rule of law is the rule of prudence namely the advisability of corroboration should be present in the mind of the Judge or the Jury, as the case may be. There is no rule of practice that there must in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. As to what type of corroboration may be required when the court is of the opinion that it is not safe to dispense with that requirement, it has also been laid down that the type of corroboration required must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence with which a person is charged.<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1502418\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1420504\" id=\"span_10\">(See <a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_44\">Rameshwar v.

The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_50\">Evidence Act</a> similar to illustration (b) to<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_51\"> S. 114</a> which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend  assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage:\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">&quot;It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the Court   finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">It would have proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex-violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the Western and European countries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the Court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a  person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts     must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity.&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">26.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_52\">State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh and others</a> (AIR 1996 SC 1393), the Supreme Court held:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">&quot;The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases  involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations  which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent    bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in  the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost at par with the evidence of an injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable, Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, is considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a Victim of another person&#x27;s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Inferences have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity least that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a    casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">27.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366037\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/366037/\" id=\"a_53\">Aman Kumar and another v.

In the latter case, there is injury on the physical form, while in the former it is both physical as well as psychological and emotional. However, if the Court of facts finds it difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix on its face value, it may search for evidence, direct or circumstantial, which would lend assurance to her testimony. Assurance, short of corroboration as understood in the context of an accomplice would suffice.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">28.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"519978\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/519978/\" id=\"a_54\">State of Himachal Pradesh v.

The High Court also totally overlooked the prosecution evidence, which inspired confidence and merited acceptance. It is now well settled principle of law that conviction can be founded on the testimony of the prosecutrix alone unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration.

It is further stated that consent supposes three things- a physical power, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained by intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue influence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the mind.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">43.\tStroud&#x27;s Judicial Dictionary (Fourth Edition), Volume 1 (1971) at page 555 explains the expression &#x27;consent&#x27;, inter alia, as under :-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48792753\" id=\"span_30\">&quot;Every &#x27;consent&#x27; to an act, involves a submission; but it by no means follows that a mere submission involves consent,&quot; e.g. the mere submission of a girl to a carnal assault, she being in the power of a strong man,  is not consent (per <a href=\"/doc/48792753/\" id=\"a_76\">Coleridge J., R. v.

It is purely and solely a mental process to be ascertained, in a prosecution for rape, by what the prosecuting witness may have said or done. It being a mental process there is no other manner by which her will can be ascertained, and it must be left to the jury to determine that will by her acts and statements, as disclosed by the evidence. It is but natural, therefore, that in charging the jury upon the subject of rape, or assault with intent to commit rape, the courts should have almost universally, and, in many cases, exclusively, discussed &quot;consent&quot; and resistance. There can be no better evidence of willingness is a condition or state of mind no better evidence of unwillingness than resistance. No lexicographer recognizes &quot;consent&quot; as a synonym of willingness, and it is apparent that they are not synonymous. It is equally apparent, on the other hand, that the true relation between the words is that willingness is a condition or     state of mind and &quot;consent&quot; one of the evidences of that condition. Likewise resistance is not a synonym of unwillingness, though it is an evidence thereof. In all cases, therefore, where the prosecuting witness has an intelligent will, the court should charge upon the elements of &quot;consent&quot; and resistance as being proper elements from which the jury may infer either a favourable or an opposing will. It must, however, be recognized in all cases that the real test is whether the assault was committed against the will of the prosecuting witness. State v.

Even if the victim had lost her virginity earlier, it can certainly not give a licence to any person to rape her. It is the accused who was on trial and not the victim. So as to whether the victim is of a promiscuous character is totally an irrelevant issue altogether in a case of rape.

So, the courts should deal with such cases sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not only an offence against the person of a woman, rather a crime against the entire society. It is a crime against basic human rights and also violates the most cherished fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">61.\tIn view of International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights 1966; United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power 1985, rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not retraumatize them or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. They are also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that respects their right to consent. Medical procedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and health should be of paramount consideration while dealing with gender-based violence.

State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi</a>), (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 240 a 15 years old victim was kidnapped on knife point and raped in a hotel and again in house by two accused persons High Court reduced sentence from seven years to five years. The Supreme Court analyzed that Law of Rape and pointed out that it is a trite law that a woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person&#x27;s lust. The prosecutrix stands at a higher pedestal than an injured witness as she suffers from emotional injury. Therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_105\">The Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under <a href=\"/doc/371095/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 118</a> of Evidence Act and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_107\">Evidence Act</a> similar to illustration (b) to <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 114</a> which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. The court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Rape is not merely a physical assault, rather it often distracts the whole personality of the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the commission of the offence.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732998\" id=\"span_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1974122\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199575\" id=\"span_52\">(Vide: <a href=\"/doc/199575/\" id=\"a_109\">State of Maharashtra v.

Again, if the investigating officer did not conduct the investigation properly or was negligent in not being able to trace out the driver or the car, how car that become a ground to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix? The prosecutrix had no control over the investigating agency and the negligence of an investigating officer could not affect the credibility of the statement of the prosecutrix. The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances&quot;.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">64.\tThe important thing that the court has to bear in mind is that what is lost by a rape victim. The victim loses value as a person. Ours is a conservative society and, therefore, a woman and more so a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault. In examining the evidence of the prosecutrix the courts must be alive to the conditions prevalent in the Indian society and must not be swayed by beliefs in other countries. The courts must be sensitive and responsive to the plight of the female victim of sexual assault. Society&#x27;s belief and value systems need to be kept uppermost in mind as rape is the worst form of woman&#x27;s oppression. A forcible sexual assault brings in humiliation, feeling of disgust, tremendous embarrassment, sense of shame, trauma and lifelong emotional scar to a victim and it is, therefore, most unlikely of a woman, and more so by a young woman, roping in somebody falsely in the crime of rape. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"207774\" id=\"span_54\">The stigma that attaches to the victim of rape in Indian society ordinarily rules out the leveling of false accusations. An Indian woman traditionally will not concoct an untruthful story and bring charges of rape for the purpose of blackmail, hatred, spite or revenge. The Supreme Court has repeatedly laid down the guidelines as to how the evidence of the prosecutrix in the crime of rape should be evaluated by the court. The observations made in the case of <a href=\"/doc/207774/\" id=\"a_113\">Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat</a> (1983) 3 SCC 217 deserve special mention where the Supreme Court observed as follows:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">&quot;In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? To do so is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominated society. We must analyze the argument in support of the need for corroboration and subject it to relentless and remorseless cross-examination. And we must do so with a logical, and not an opiniated, eye in the light of probabilities with our feet firmly planted on the soil of India and with our eyes focussed on the Indian horizon. We must not be swept off the feet by the approach made in the Western World which has its own social mileu, its own social mores, its own permissive values, and its own code of life. Corroboration may be considered essential to establish a sexual offence in the backdrop of the social ecology of the Western World. It is wholly unnecessary to import the said concept on a turn-key basis and to transplate it on the Indian soil regardless of the altogether different atmosphere, attitudes, mores, responses of the Indian Society and its profile. The identities of the two worlds are different. The solution of problems cannot therefore be identical. It is conceivable in the Western Society that a female may level false accusation as regards sexual molestation against a male for several reasons such as: \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">(1) The female may be a &#x27;gold digger&#x27; and may well have an economic motive to extract money by holding out the gun of prosecution or public exposure. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">(2) She may be suffering from psychological neurosis and may seek an escape from the neurotic prison by phantasizing or imagining a situation where she is desired, wanted, and chased by males. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">(3) She may want to wreak vengence on the male for real or imaginary wrongs. She may have a grudge against a particular male, or males in general, and may have the design to square the account. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">(4) She may have been induced to do so in consideration of economic rewards, by a person interested in placing the accused in a compromising or embarassing position, on account of personal or political vendatta. (5) She may do so to gain notoriety or publicity or to appease her own ego or to satisfy her feeling of self-importance in the context of her inferiority complex. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">(6) She may do so on account of jealousy. (7) She may do so to win sympathy of others. (8) She may do so upon being repulsed.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">By and large these factors are not relevant to India, and the Indian conditions. Without the fear of making too wide a statements or of overstating the case, it can be said that rarely will a girl or a woman in India make false allegations of sexual assault on account of any such factor as has been just enlisted. The statement is generally true in the context of the urban as also rural Society. It is also by and large true in the context of the sophisticated, not so sophisticated, and unsophisticated society. Only very rarely can one conceivably come across an exception or two and that too possibly from amongst the urban elites. Because: (1) A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non- permissive Society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. (2) She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracised by the Society or being looked down by the Society including by her own family members, relatives, friends and neighbours. (3) She would have to brave the whole world. (4) She would face the risk of losing the love and respect of her own husband and near relatives, and of her matrimonial home and happiness being shattered. (S) If she is unmarried, she would apprehend that it would be difficult to secure an alliance with a suitable match from a respectable or an acceptable family. (6) It would almost inevitably and almost invariably result in mental torture and suffering to herself. (7) The fear of being taunted by others will always haunt her. (8) She would feel extremely embarrassed in relating the incident to others being over powered by a feeling of shame on account of the upbringing in a tradition bound society where by and large sex is taboo. (9) The natural inclination would be to avoid giving publicity to the incident lest the family name and family honour is brought into controversy. (10) The parents of an unmarried girl as also the husband and members of the husband&#x27;s family of a married woman would also more often than not, want to avoid publicity on account of the fear of social stigma on the family name and family honour. (11) The fear of the victim herself being considered to be promiscuous or in some way responsible for the incident regardless of her innocence. (12) The reluctance to face interrogation by the investigating agency, to face the court, to face the cross examination by Counsel for the culprit, and the risk of being disbelieved, acts as a deterrent&quot; \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">65.\tRape is a heinous crime and once it is established against a person charged of the offence, justice must be done to the victim of crime by awarding suitable punishment to the crime doer. The criminal justice system in not working in our country as it should. The police reforms have not taken place despite directions of this Court in the case of Prakash Singh &amp; amp; Ors. Union of India &amp; amp; Ors. (2006) 8 SCC 1. The investigators hardly have professional orientation; they od not have modern tools. On many occasions impartial investigation suffers because of political interference. The criminal trials are protracted because of non-appearance of official witnesses on time and the non-availability of the facilities for recording evidence by video conferencing. The public prosecutors have their limitation; the defence lawyers do not make themselves available and the court would be routinely informed about their pre-occupation with other matters; the courts remain overburdened with the briefs listed on the day and they do not have adequate infrastructure. The adjournments thus become routine; the casualty is justice. It is imperative that the criminal cases  relating to offences against the State, corruption, dowry death, domestic violence, sexual assault, financial fraud and cyber crimes are fast tracked and decided in a fixed time frame, preferably, of three years including the appeal provisions. It is high time that immediate and urgent steps are taken in amending the procedural and other laws to achieve the above objectives. We must remember that a strong and efficient criminal justice system is a guarantee to the rule of law and vibrant civil society. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">66.\tValue of Medical Evidence: Appreciating Sociological and Psychological Aspect of Rape:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"915673\" id=\"span_55\">Courts used to take the position that if there was no proof of physical assault there would be no rape. The presumption that if no physical injury is evident on the victim, no sexual intercourse has taken place or rape has not been committed, ignores the fact that rape is not only an offence involving physical violence, but also psychological violence. This too when existing laws recognize mental agony and psychological violence as offences against the body. The victim of rape besides being physically ravished is psychologically wounded. It is the feeling of having been exploited and violated more that anything else which leaves lifelong scars on the mind of the victim. Perhaps this trauma has been recognized in a case where it was held that the absence of injuries on private parts of the prosecutrix would not rule out her being subjected to rape  1. Krishna Iyer. J. who is famous for his humanistic approach towards law, observed in <a href=\"/doc/915673/\" id=\"a_114\">Rafiq Vs. State of U.P.</a> (1980) 4 SCC 262:</span> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">&quot;when no woman of honour will accuse another of rape since she sacrifices thereby what is dearest to her, we cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroborative testimony, even if taken as a whole, the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as probable. In this case, the testimony has commanded acceptance from two courts. When a woman is ravished what is inflicted is not merely physical injury. but &#x27;the deep sense of some deathless shame&quot;. Judicial response to human rights cannot be blunted by legal bigotry.\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">67.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"218495\" id=\"span_56\">In a similar spirit the Supreme Court has held in <a href=\"/doc/218495/\" id=\"a_115\">Sheikh Zakir Vs.

Naval Dubey</a>, (1992) 3 SCC 2014, where the question as to what constitutes sexual intercourse and rape was discussed, the Apex Court has put the matter in perspective:-</span>\n</p> \n\n \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">&quot;Sexual intercourse: In law, this term is held to mean the slightest degree of penetration of the vulva by the penis with or without emission of semen. It is therefore quite possible to commit legally the offence of rape without producing any injury to the genitals or leaving any seminal stains.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">69.\tIt was further held:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">&quot;To constitute the offence of rape it is not necessary that there should be complete penetration of penis with emission of semen and rupture of hymen. Partial penetration of the penis within the Labia majora or the vulva or pudenda with or without emission of semen or even an attempt at penetration is quite sufficient for the purpose of the law. It is therefore quite possible to commit legally the offence of rape without producing any injury to the genitals or leaving any seminal stains. In such a case the medical officer should mention the negative facts in his report, but should not give his opinion that no rape had been committed. Rape is crime and not a medical condition. Rape is a legal term and not a diagnosis to be made by the medical officer treating the victim. The only statement that can be made by the medical officer is that there is evidence of recent sexual activity. Whether the rape has occurred or not is a legal conclusion, not a medical one.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">70.\tAbsence of injury to the prosecutrix advanced as a plea to disprove the allegation of rape was dismissed by the Supreme Court thus:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">&quot;The mere fact that no injury was found on the private parts of the prosecutrix or her hymen was found to be intact does not belie the statement of the prosecutrix as she nowhere stated that she bled per vagina as a result of the penetration of the penis in her vagina. She was subjected to sexual intercourse in a standing posture and that itself indicates the absence of any injury on her private pans. To constitute the offence of rape, penetration, however slight, is sufficient. The prosecutrix deposed about the performance of sexual intercourse by the appellant and her statement has remained unchallenged in the cross-examination. Neither the non-rupture of the hymen nor the absence of injuries on her private parts, therefore, belies the testimony of the prosecutrix particularly when we find that in the cross-examination of the prosecutrix, nothing has been brought out to doubt her veracity or to suggest as to why she would falsely implicate the appellant and put her own reputation at stake. The opinion of the doctor that no rape appeared to have been committed was based only on the absence of rupture of the hymen and injuries on the private parts of the prosecutrix. This opinion cannot throw out an otherwise cogent and trustworthy evidence of the prosecutrix. Besides, the opinion of the doctor appears to be based on &quot;no reasons&quot;. \n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">71.\tIn the appeal the counsel of the appellant sought to bring out that, in the absence of corroboration of statement of the prosecutrix by medical evidence, the conviction of the appellant was bad.

The Apex Court asserted:- \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">&quot;The prosecutrix of a sex offence is a victim of a crime and there is no requirement of law which requires that her testimony cannot be accepted unless corroborated&quot;. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">72.\tLearned counsel for appellants had submitted that the statement of PW2, victim being a minor should not be taken into account.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1088258\" id=\"span_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"917041\" id=\"span_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"796356\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1678362\" id=\"span_61\">73.\tEvidence of child witness cannot be rejected out rightly.

It is, therefore, the duty of the court to scrutinise the evidence carefully and, in terms of the felicitous metaphor, separate the grain from the chaff. But, it cannot obviously disbelieve the substratum of the prosecution case or the material parts of the evidence and reconstruct a story of its own out of the rest.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">81. \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"439549\" id=\"span_72\">In <a href=\"/doc/439549/\" id=\"a_133\">Krishna Mochi v.

The court while appreciating the evidence should not lose sight of these realities of life and cannot afford to take an unrealistic approach by sitting in an ivory tower. I find that in recent times the tendency to acquit an accused easily is galloping fast. It is very easy to pass an order of acquittal on the basis of minor points raised in the case by a short judgment so as to achieve the yardstick of disposal. Some discrepancy is bound to be there in each and every case which should not weigh with the court so long it does not materially affect the prosecution case. In case discrepancies pointed out are in the realm of pebbles, the court should tread upon it, but if the same are boulders, the court should not make an attempt to jump over the same. These days when crime is looming large and humanity is suffering and the society is so much affected thereby, duties and responsibilities of the courts have become much more. Now the maxim &quot;let hundred guilty persons be acquitted, but not a single innocent be convicted&quot; is, in practice, changing the world over and courts have been compelled to accept that &quot;society suffers by wrong convictions and it equally suffers by wrong acquittals&quot;. I find that this Court in recent times has conscientiously taken notice of these facts from time to time&quot;.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">82. \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"781166\" id=\"span_73\">In <a href=\"/doc/781166/\" id=\"a_134\">Inder Singh</a> (supra), Krishna Iyer, J. laid down that:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">&quot;Proof beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish and guilty man cannot get away with it because truth suffers some infirmity when projected through human processes.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">83. \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235169\" id=\"span_74\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/235169/\" id=\"a_135\">State of U.P. v.

Sentence is to be imposed regard being had to the nature of the offence and the manner in which the offence has been committed. The fundamental purpose of imposition of sentence is based on the principle that the accused must realize that the crime committed by him has not only created a dent in his life but also a concavity in the social fabric.   The purpose of just punishment is designed so that the individuals in the society which ultimately constitute the collective do not suffer time and again for such crimes, for it serves as a deterrent. The Court observed, true it is, on certain occasions, opportunities may be granted to the convict for reforming himself but it is equally true that the principle of proportionality between an offence committed and the penalty imposed are to be kept in view.
