Paras 25 and 33 of said\n\n      judgment is reproduced hereunder:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          &quot;25.    Rights and freedoms of citizens are set forth\n          in the Constitution in order&#x27; to guarantee that the\n          individual,    his    personality       and      those    things\n          stamped. With his personality shall be free from\n          official interference except where a reasonable basis\n          for intrusion exists. &#x27;Liberty against government&quot; a\n          phrase coined by Professor Corwin expresses this\n          idea   forcefully.    In    this     sense,     many     of   the\n          fundamental rights of citizens can be described as\n          contributing to the right to privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          33.     When there are two interpretations, one wide\n          and unconstitutional, the other narrower but within\n          constitutional bounds, this Court will read down the\n          overflowing expressions to make them valid. So\n          read, the two regulations are more restricted than\n          counsel for the petitioner sought to impress upon\n          us.    Regulation     855,      in   our      view,   empowers\n          surveillance       only    of   persons        against    whom\n          reasonable materials exist to induce the opinion\n          that they show a determination, to lead it life of\n          criminal in this context being confined to such as\n          involve public peace or security only and if they are\n          dangerous security risks. Mere Convictions in\n          criminal cases where nothing gravely imperials\n          safety of society cannot be regarded as warranting\n          surveillance       under     this    Regulation.       Similarly,\n          domiciliary visits and picketing by the police should\n          be reduced to the clearest cases of danger to\n          community security and not routine follow-up at the\n          end of a conviction or release from prison or at the\n          whim of a police officer. In truth, legality apart,\n          these regulations ill-accord with the essence of\n          personal freedoms and the State will do well to\n          revise these old police regulations verging perilously\n          near unconstitutionality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_6\">(b)   In the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/971635/\" id=\"a_3\">Malak Singh Vs State of Punjab and\n\n      Haryana</a>,&quot; 1981 AIR (SC) 760, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                   5                  WP(Crl) No. 30/2024</span>\n\n\n\nCourt of India came to deal with the Punjab Police\n\nrules   related   to   entry   of   persons   named        in\n\nsurveillance register. In paras 8, 9 &amp; 10, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court of India came to deal with the\n\nnuisance of maintenance of surveillance registers.\n\nParas 8, 9 &amp; 10 are reproduced as under:-</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">    &quot;8. The entry in the surveillance register is to be\n    made on the basis of the material provided by the\n    history sheet whose contents, by their very nature\n    have to be confidential. It would be contrary to the\n    public interest to reveal the information in the\n    history sheet, particularly the source of information.\n    Revelation of the source of information may put the\n    informant in jeopardy. The observance of the\n    principle of natural justice apart from not serving\n    the ends of justice may thus lead to undesirable\n    results. We accordingly hold that the rule audi\n    alteram partem is not attracted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">    9. But all this does not mean that the police have a\n    licence to enter the names of whoever they like\n    (dislike?) in the surveillance register; nor can the\n    surveillance be such as to squeeze the fundamental\n    freedoms guaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct\n    the free exercise and enjoyment of those freedoms;\n    nor can the surveillance so intrude as to offend the\n    dignity of the individual. Surveillance of persons\n    who do not fall within the categories mentioned in\n    Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the\n    prevention of crime, or excessive surveillance falling\n    beyond the limits prescribed by the rules, will entitle\n    a citizen to the Court&#x27;s protection which the court\n    will not hesitate to give. The very rules which\n    prescribe the conditions for making entries in the\n    surveillance register and the mode of surveillance\n    appear to recognize the caution and care with which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">               6                      WP(Crl) No. 30/2024</span>\n\n\n\nthe police officers are required to proceed. The note\nfollowing R. 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty\nupon the police officer to construe the rule strictly\nand confine the entries in the surveillance register\nto the class of persons mentioned in the rule.\nSimilarly R. 23.7 demands that there should be no\nillegal interference in the guise of surveillance.\nSurveillance, therefore, has to be unobtrusive and\nwithin bounds.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">10. Ordinarily the names of persons with previous\ncriminal record alone are entered in the surveillance\nregister.   They    must    be      proclaimed    offenders,\nprevious convicts, or persons who have already been\nplaced on security for good behaviour. In addition,\nnames of persons who are reasonably believed to be\nhabitual offenders or receivers of stolen property\nwhether they have been convicted or not may be\nentered. It is only in the case of this category of\npersons that there may be occasion for abuse of the\npower of the police officer to make entries in the\nsurveillance register. But, here, the entry can only\nbe made by the order of the Superintendent of Police\nwho is prohibited from delegating his authority\nunder Rule 23.5. Further it is necessary that the\nSuperintendent      of     Police    must    entertain     a\nreasonable belief that persons whose names are to\nbe entered in Part II are habitual offenders or\nreceivers of stolen property. While it may not be\nnecessary to supply the grounds of belief to the\npersons     whose    names       are    entered     in   the\nsurveillance register it may become necessary in\nsome cases to satisfy the Court when an entry is\nchallenged that there are grounds to entertain such\nreasonable belief. In fact in the present case we sent\nfor the relevant records and we have satisfied\nourselves that there were sufficient grounds for the\nSuperintendent of Police to entertain a reasonable\nbelief. In the result we reject both the appeals\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                          7                  WP(Crl) No. 30/2024</span>\n\n\n\n          subject to our observations regarding the mode of\n          surveillance.
