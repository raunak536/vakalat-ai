This petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India has\n\nbeen filed seeking the following relief(s) :\n\n              It is, therefore, most humbly prayed that the\n       petition filed by the Petitioner may kindly be allowed\n       and respondent no.1 and 2 may kindly be directed to\n       take effective action against the respondent no.3 to 5\n       and pass appropriate order so that the petitioner can\n       take justice.\n              Issue any other suitable writ, order or direction\n       as this Hon&#x27;ble Court may deem fit and proper under\n       the fact and circumstances existing in the present case.\n       Further, compensation be granted to the petitioner\n       from the respondents authorities.\n              Award the cost of this writ petition in favor of\n       the petitioner throughout.\n\n\n2.    The necessary facts in short are that the petitioner is a tenant\n\nin a shop. On 25-7-2020, the landlady of the said shop, made a\n\ncomplaint to the respondent no. 3/S.H.O., Police Station Bahodapur,\n\nDistt. Gwalior, alleging that the petitioner is neither vacating the\n                                   2\n            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n            Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\nshop nor is making payment of rent and has also threatened that he\n\nwould encroach upon the remaining house of the landlady. Thus, it\n\nwas prayed that the shop be got vacated and the arrears of rent be\n\npaid to the landlady.     The respondent no. 3, marked the said\n\ncomplaint to the respondent no. 4 for conducting an enquiry and it is\n\nalleged that thereafter, the respondents no. 4 and 5 forcibly evicted\n\nthe petitioner from the shop on 25-7-2020 itself and was also beaten\n\nby the respondent no.4. The goods including the furniture of the\n\nshop was taken to the police station where the petitioner was\n\ncompelled to give an undertaking that he would vacate the shop and\n\naccordingly, the goods belonging to the petitioner were returned by\n\nthe respondents. Thereafter, on 14-8-2020, the respondent no. 3 and\n\n5 took the petitioner in custody, and got his uncovered face\n\nphotograph published in the newspapers as well as on social media,\n\nby projecting him as a hard core criminal. On a complaint made to\n\nthe Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, an enquiry was conducted and\n\nit was found that the petitioner is an innocent person having no\n\ncriminal antecedents and accordingly, he was released. It is the stand\n\nof the respondents no. 1 and 2 that one person with similar name was\n\nwanted in a criminal case which was registered in the year 2011 and\n\na reward of Rs. 5,000/- was declared by the Superintendent of Police,\n\nGwalior by order dated 13-8-2020 and under mistaken identity, the\n\npetitioner was wrongly taken into custody. The respondent no.3 was\n                                   3\n            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n            Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\nplaced under suspension and the news with regard to his suspension\n\nwas duly published in the news papers.\n\n3.    It appears that thereafter, without conducting any enquiry or\n\nwithout passing any order of punishment, the suspension of the\n\nrespondent no. 3 was revoked by order dated 28-8-2020 and he was\n\ngiven posting in some other police station. However, the order of\n\nrevocation of suspension order of the respondent no.3 and his posting\n\norder have not been placed on record.\n\n4.    Only after the notices of this writ petition were received by the\n\nrespondent no.2, it appears that just 2 days prior to filing of 1 st\n\ncompliance report, a punishment of fine of Rs. 5000/- was imposed\n\non the respondent no. 3 and the respondent no. 5 was saddled with\n\nthe punishment of censure.\n\n5.    With regard to the incident, which took place on 25-7-2020, a\n\npreliminary enquiry was conducted by Add. Superintendent of Police\n\n(Central), Gwalior City, Gwalior and on the basis of the findings\n\nrecorded in the said preliminary enquiry report, a departmental\n\ncharge sheet has been issued against the respondents no. 4 and 5 on\n\nthe allegations, that they were involved in forcible eviction of the\n\npetitioner from the shop in question, as well as the act of bringing\n\nthe belongings of the petitioner to the police station, is a glaring\n\nexample of misconduct.\n\n6.    With regard to the law regulating the disclosure of identity of\n                                    4\n            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n            Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\nan accused/suspect in the news paper, the respondents no.1 and 2\n\nrelied upon the circular dated 2-1-2014 issued by the Director\n\nGeneral of Police.\n\n7.    After finding that the 1 st and 2nd compliance report filed by the\n\npolice is not satisfactory, this Court by its order dated 20-10-2020,\n\nrequested the Advocate General, State of M.P. to appear on behalf of\n\nthe respondents no. 1 and 2 and also requested Shri Naval Kumar\n\nGutpa, Senior Advocate and Shri Prashant Sharma, Advocates to\n\nargue the matter as amicus curiae as important question of law arises\n\nin the present case and accordingly, after considering the judgment\n\npassed by the Supreme Court in the case of Mehmood Nayyar Azam\n\nVs. State of Chhattisgarh reported in (2012) 8 SCC 1 framed the\n\nfollowing issue:\n\n       &quot;Whether the State Govt. by issuing an exeuctive\n       instruction, can violate the Fundamental Rights of an\n       accused as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the\n       Constitution of India, by getting their uncovered faces\n       published in the News paper or in any other form of\n       media or by parading them in Society etc.?&quot;\n\n\n      Apart from the above mentioned legal question, following\n\nissues were also framed :\n\n\n       (I)   Whether gross violation of rights and privacy of\n       an innocent citizen of India and tarnishing his\n       reputation is a minor mistake or serious misconduct?\n       (II) Why due publicity of revocation of suspension\n       of the Sub Inspector was not given in the newspaper\n       thereby informing the general public that even in a\n                                   5\n            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n            Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\n       case of gross violation of rights and privacy of an\n       innocent person, a police officer can get away very\n       easily?\n       (III) Furthermore, once the respondents have already\n       admitted that they have grossly violated the rights and\n       privacy of an innocent person, still then the return is\n       completely silent on the question of payment of\n       compensation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n       India?\n       (IV) Whether any enquiry into the allegations made\n       against the respondents no. 4 and 5 was made or not\n       and if so, its conclusion.\n       (V) It is mentioned in the punishment order dated\n       14-10-2020, that although the petitioner was not\n       arrested, but he was detained in police station.\n       Whether detention of a person in a police station\n       without his formal arrest was permissible, because\n       according to the respondents no. 1 and 2, the petitioner\n       was detained as a person with similar name was\n       wanted in a criminal case which was registered in the\n       year 2011.\n       (VI) It has also been mentioned in the suspension\n       order, that the news pertaining to the detention and\n       photographs of the petitioner were uploaded on Social\n       Media. The respondents no.1 and 2 are further directed\n       to clarify that which law permits them to upload the\n       photographs of an accused on Social Media?\n\nWhether Fundamental Rights of a suspect can be violated by the\nPolice by publishing his photographs in news papers, or on any\ndigital platform as well as by parading him in General Public.\n\n8.    Shri Naval Kumar Gupta, Senior Advocate as well as Shri\n\nPrashant Sharma, amicus curiae submitted that privacy, reputation\n\nand dignity of a person is an integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and cannot be taken away merely for the\n\nreason, that the police has taken him in custody on the allegation of\n\nhaving committed an offence. It is further submitted that violation of\n\nfundamental right of a citizen of India would make the State liable\n                                     6\n             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                     W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n             Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\nfor payment of compensation. It is further submitted that Parading of\n\nan accused in general public, or publication of his personal details\n\nalong with his covered or uncovered face in the News Papers or on\n\nSocial Site or on any digital platform, would be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is further submitted that it is a well\n\nestablished principle of law that unless and until, a person is\n\nconvicted, his innocence has to be presumed, and the police cannot\n\ntarnish the image of any citizen of India by projecting him as a\n\nhardcore criminal. It is further submitted that the act of police in\n\ngetting the photographs of the suspects published in the news papers\n\nor on any digital platform is nothing but an attempt to tap their back.\n\nIt is submitted that if the police is really interested in ensuring the\n\nconviction of a person, then it must not only ensure the safety of the\n\nwitnesses, but must also ensure, that there is no delay in the trial due\n\nto non-appearance of prosecution witnesses, but the ground reality is\n\nthat various trials are being adjourned for years together only because\n\nof the fact that the police witnesses donot appear before the Trial\n\nCourt or the summons/bailable warrants/warrants issued against the\n\nwitnesses are not served by the prosecution. It is further submitted\n\nthat not only the speedy trial is a fundamental right of an accused, but\n\nspeedy trial is also in the interest of society, because there would be\n\nless opportunities to pressurize or win over the witnesses. Further,\n\nan undertial is not entitled for remission, whereas a convicted person\n                                    7\n             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                     W.P.

Shri Purushendra Kaurav, Advocate General, submitted that\n\ndisclosure of identity in any form (either by disclosure of his\n\npersonal details or publication of his photographs, whether covered\n\nor uncovered face, either in news paper or on any digital platform,\n\nwould certainly violate the fundamental right as enshrined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is further submitted that\n\nalthough there is a circular dated 2-1-2014 with regard to the\n\nproduction of acccused persons before the Media, but there is no\n\nexecutive instruction for parading the accused persons/suspect in\n\ngeneral public.\n\n10.   Shri D.P. Singh, Counsel for the respondents no. 4 and 5\n\nsubmitted that since, the respondent no. 4 was asked by the\n\nrespondent no. 3 to enquire the complaint dated 25-7-2020, therefore,\n\nshe acted on the instructions of the respondent no.3. However, it was\n\ndenied that the shop was got forcibly vacated by her.\n\n11.   The respondent no. 3 has neither appeared/represented nor\n                                     9\n             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                     W.P.

Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner, respondents no. 1\n\n&amp;2, Counsel for respondents no. 4&amp;5, as well as amicus curiae on\n\nthe above mentioned issue.\n\n13.   The Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra Vs.\n\nSaeed Sohail Sheikh reported in (2012) 13 SC 192 has held as\n\nunder:\n\n         39. In a country governed by the rule of law police\n         excesses whether inside or outside the jail cannot be\n         countenanced in the name of maintaining discipline or\n         dealing with anti-national elements. Accountability is\n         one of the facets of the rule of law. If anyone is found\n         to have acted in breach of law or abused his position\n         while exercising powers that must be exercised only\n         within the parameters of law, the breach and the abuse\n         can be punished. That is especially so when the abuse\n         is alleged to have been committed under the cover of\n         authority exercised by people in uniform. Any such\n         action is also open to critical scrutiny and examination\n         by the courts.\n         40. Having said that we cannot ignore the fact that the\n         country today faces challenges and threats from\n         extremist elements operating from within and outside\n         India. Those dealing with such elements have at times\n         to pay a heavy price by sacrificing their lives in the\n         discharge of their duties. The glory of the\n         constitutional democracy that we have adopted,\n         however, is that whatever be the challenges posed by\n         such dark forces, the country&#x27;s commitment to the rule\n         of law remains steadfast. Courts in this country have\n         protected and would continue to protect the ideals of\n         the rights of the citizen being inviolable except in\n         accordance with the procedure established by law.\n\n                                          (Underline supplied)\n\n14.   The Supreme Court in the case of Delhi Judicial Service\n                                   10\n            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                    W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n            Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\nAssociation (Supra) has held as under :\n\n       39........The main objective of police is to apprehend\n       offenders, to investigate crimes and to prosecute them\n       before the courts and also to prevent commission of\n       crime and above all to ensure law and order to protect\n       the citizens&#x27; life and property. The law enjoins the\n       police to be scrupulously fair to the offender and the\n       Magistracy is to ensure fair investigation and fair trial\n       to an offender. The purpose and object of Magistracy\n       and police are complementary to each other. It is\n       unfortunate that these objectives have remained\n       unfulfilled even after 40 years of our Constitution.\n       Aberrations of police officers and police excesses in\n       dealing with the law and order situation have been the\n       subject of adverse comments from this Court as well\n       as from other courts but it has failed to have any\n       corrective effect on it. The police has power to arrest a\n       person even without obtaining a warrant of arrest from\n       a court. The amplitude of this power casts an\n       obligation on the police to take maximum care in\n       exercising that power. The police must bear in mind,\n       as held by this Court that if a person is arrested for a\n       crime, his constitutional and fundamental rights must\n       not be violated. See Sunil Batra v. Delhi\n       Administration. In Prem Shankar Shukla case this\n       Court considered the question of placing a prisoner\n       under handcuff by the police. The Court declared that\n       no prisoner shall be handcuffed or fettered routinely or\n       merely for the convenience of custody or escort. The\n       Court emphasised that the police did not enjoy any\n       unrestricted or unlimited power to handcuff an\n       arrested person. If having regard to the circumstances\n       including the conduct, behaviour and character of a\n       prisoner, there is reasonable apprehension of\n       prisoner&#x27;s escape from custody or disturbance of\n       peace by violence, the police may put the prisoner\n       under handcuff. If a prisoner is handcuffed without\n       there being any justification, it would violate\n       prisoner&#x27;s fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_8\">19</a>\n       of the Constitution. To be consistent with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 14</a>\n       and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_10\">19</a> handcuffs must be the last refuge as there are\n       other ways for ensuring security of a prisoner. In Prem\n       Shankar Shukla case, Krishna Iyer, J. observed: (SCC\n       p. 529, para 1)\n                                    11\n             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                     W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n             Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\n          &quot;If today freedom of the forlorn person falls to\n          the police somewhere, tomorrow the freedom of\n          many may fall elsewhere with none to whimper\n          unless the court process invigilates in time and\n          polices the police before it is too late.&quot;\n                                         (emphasis in original)\n\n15.   The Supreme Court in the case of Bhim Singh (Supra) has\n\nheld as under :\n\n       2.......Police officers who are the custodians of law and\n       order should have the greatest respect for the personal\n       liberty of citizens and should not flout the laws by\n       stooping to such bizarre acts of lawlessness.\n       Custodians of law and order should not become\n       depredators of civil liberties. Their duty is to protect\n       and not to abduct.........\n\n\n16.   Thus, where any abuse of power is committed by police, then\n\nsuch an action is open for scrutiny by the Court, as the men in\n\nuniform are the custodians of law and must show great respect for the\n\nliberty and privacy of the citizens. In the present case, in view of the\n\nfindings recorded by the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior in\n\npunishment order dated 14-10-2020, as well as in view of the\n\nobservations regarding preliminary enquiry report by Add. S.P., in the\n\ncharge sheet issued against the respondents no. 4 and 5, this Court is\n\nof the view that the allegations leveled against the respondents no. 3\n\nto 5, are glaring example of police atrocities which cannot be ignored\n\nby this Court, specifically when, not only the police personals are\n\nalleged to have forcibly evicted the petitioner from his shop without\n\nthere being any order of the Court, but also kept him in illegal\n                                    12\n             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                     W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n             Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\ndetention.\n\n17.   The question as to whether the Privacy/Dignity/reputation of a\n\ncitizen of India is an intergral facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India or not, is no more res integra.\n\n18.   The Supreme Court in the case of Mehmood Nayyar Azam\n\n(Supra) has held as under :\n\n       19. We have referred to the aforesaid paragraphs of\n       D.K. Basu case to highlight that this Court has\n       emphasised on the concept of mental agony when a\n       person is confined within the four walls of police\n       station or lock-up. Mental agony stands in\n       contradistinction to infliction of physical pain. In the\n       said case, the two-Judge Bench referred to <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 5</a> of\n       the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948\n       which provides that: &quot;No one shall be subjected to\n       torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\n       punishment.&quot; Thereafter, the Bench adverted to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article\n       21</a> and proceeded to state that the expression &quot;life or\n       personal liberty&quot; has been held to include the right to\n       live with human dignity and thus, it would also include\n       within itself a guarantee against torture and assault by\n       the State or its functionaries. Reference was made to\n       <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution which postulates that\n       a person accused of an offence shall not be compelled\n       to be a witness against himself.\n       20. It is worthy to note that in D.K. Basu, the concern\n       shown by this Court in Joginder Kumar v. State of\n       U.P. was taken note of. In Joginder Kumar case this\n       Court voiced its concern regarding complaints of\n       violation of human rights during and after arrest. It is\n       apt to quote a passage from the same: (Joginder\n       Kumar case, SCC pp. 263-64, paras 8-9)\n       &quot;8. The horizon of human rights is expanding. At the\n       same time, the crime rate is also increasing. Of late,\n       this Court has been receiving complaints about\n       violation of human rights because of indiscriminate\n       arrests. How are we to strike a balance between the\n       two?\n       9. A realistic approach should be made in this\n                           13\n     HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n             W.P. No. 13057 of 2020\n     Arun Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and others\n\ndirection. The law of arrest is one of balancing\nindividual rights, liberties and privileges, on the one\nhand, and individual duties, obligations and\nresponsibilities on the other; of weighing and\nbalancing the rights, liberties and privileges of the\nsingle individual and those of individuals collectively;\nof simply deciding what is wanted and where to put the\nweight and the emphasis; of deciding which comes\nfirst -- the criminal or society, the law violator or the\nlaw abider....&quot;\n21. After referring to Joginder Kumar, A.S. Anand, J.\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1\">(as His Lordship then was), dealing with the various\nfacets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> in D.K.

If the\nfunctionaries of the Government become law-breakers,\nit is bound to breed contempt for law and would\nencourage lawlessness and every man would have the\ntendency to become law unto himself thereby leading\nto anarchy. No civilised nation can permit that to\nhappen, for a citizen does not shed off his fundamental\nright to life, the moment a policeman arrests him. The\nright to life of a citizen cannot be put in abeyance on\nhis arrest. The precious right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a>\nof the Constitution of India cannot be denied to\nconvicts, undertrials, detenus and other prisoners in\ncustody, except according to the procedure established\nby law by placing such reasonable restrictions as are\npermitted by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">                          *     *      *     *\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_1\">25.

The main objective of police is to apprehend\noffenders, to investigate crimes and to prosecute them\nbefore the courts and also to prevent commission of\ncrime and above all to ensure law and order to protect\nthe citizens&#x27; life and property. The law enjoins the\npolice to be scrupulously fair to the offender and the\nMagistracy is to ensure fair investigation and fair trial\nto an offender. The purpose and object of Magistracy\nand police are complementary to each other. It is\nunfortunate that these objectives have remained\nunfulfilled even after 40 years of our Constitution.\nAberrations of police officers and police excesses in\ndealing with the law and order situation have been\nsubject of adverse comments from this Court as well as\nfrom other courts but it has failed to have any\ncorrective effect on it.

We\n       may hasten to add that a balance has to be struck and,\n       in this context, we may fruitfully quote a passage from\n       D.K. Basu: (SCC pp. 434-35, para 33)\n       &quot;33. There can be no gainsaying that freedom of an\n       individual must yield to the security of the State. The\n       right of preventive detention of individuals in the\n       interest of security of the State in various situations\n       prescribed under different statutes has been upheld by\n       the courts. The right to interrogate the detenus, culprits\n       or arrestees in the interest of the nation, must take\n       precedence over an individual&#x27;s right to personal\n       liberty. ... The action of the State, however, must be\n       &#x27;right, just and fair&#x27;. Using any form of torture for\n       extracting any kind of information would neither be\n       &#x27;right nor just nor fair&#x27; and, therefore, would be\n       impermissible, being offensive to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21.</a> Such a\n       crime suspect must be interrogated -- indeed subjected\n       to sustained and scientific interrogation -- determined\n       in accordance with the provisions of law.

Dignity extended to all citizens involves the idea\n       of communitarism. A little earlier in 1798, Friedrich\n       Schiller, a German poet of freedom and philosophy,\n       brought out the connection between dignity and social\n       condition in his work &quot;Wurde des Menschen&quot;. He said\n       &quot;(g)ive him food and shelter; when you have covered\n       his nakedness, dignity will follow by itself&quot;. It was\n       during the period that abolition of slavery became an\n       important political agenda. Slavery was considered as\n       an affront to human dignity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">       143. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n       (UDHR) recorded in the Preamble recognition of the\n       inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights\n       of all members of the human family as the foundation\n       of freedom, justice and peace. It included freedom\n       from fear and want as amongst the highest aspirations\n       of the common people. This is of course subject to\n       resources of each State. But the realisation is\n       contemplated through national effort and international\n       cooperation. Evidently, the UDHR adopts a\n       substantive or communitarian concept of human\n       dignity. The realisation of intrinsic worth of every\n       human being, as a member of society through national\n       efforts as an indispensable condition has been\n       recognised as an important human right. Truly\n       speaking, this is directed towards the deprived,\n       downtrodden and have-nots.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  19</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                    W.P.

We, therefore, have to keep in mind humanistic\n       concept of human dignity which is to be accorded to a\n       particular segment of the society and, in fact, a large\n       segment. Their human dignity is based on the socio-\n       economic rights that are read into the fundamental\n       rights, as already discussed above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">       145. When we read socio-economic rights into human\n       dignity, the community approach also assumes\n       importance along with individualistic approach to\n       human dignity. It has now been well recognised that at\n       its core, human dignity contains three elements,\n       namely, intrinsic value, autonomy and community\n       value. These are known as core values of human\n       dignity. These three elements can assist in structuring\n       legal reasoning and justifying judicial choices in &quot;hard\n       cases&quot;. It has to be borne in mind that human dignity\n       is a constitutional principle, rather than free-standing\n       fundamental rights.

Police atrocities in India had always been a\n       subject-matter of controversy and debate. In view of\n       the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, any\n       form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading\n       treatment is inhibited. Torture is not permissible\n       whether it occurs during investigation, interrogation\n       or otherwise. The wrongdoer is accountable and the\n       State is responsible if a person in custody of the\n       police is deprived of his life except in accordance\n       with the procedure established by law. However,\n       when the matter comes to the court, it has to balance\n       the protection of fundamental rights of an individual\n       and duties of the police. It cannot be gainsaid that\n       freedom of an individual must yield to the security of\n       the State. The Latin maxim salus populi est suprema\n       lex--the safety of the people is the supreme law; and\n       salus reipublicae suprema lex--the safety of the State\n       is the supreme law, coexist.

The right to life has rightly been characterised as\n&quot;&#x27;supreme&#x27; and &#x27;basic&#x27;; it includes both so-called\nnegative and positive obligations for the State&quot;. The\nnegative obligation means the overall prohibition on\narbitrary deprivation of life. In this context, positive\nobligation requires that the State has an overriding\nobligation to protect the right to life of every person\nwithin its territorial jurisdiction. The obligation\nrequires the State to take administrative and all other\nmeasures in order to protect life and investigate all\nsuspicious deaths.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">27.

The problems of acute stress as well\nas a post-traumatic stress disorder and many other\npsychological consequences must be understood in\nthe correct perspective. Therefore, the State must\nensure prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman and\ndegrading treatment to any person, particularly at the\nhands of any State agency/police force.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1102670\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1332816\" id=\"span_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193976885\" id=\"span_30\">28.

Blackstone in his Commentaries\n   classifies and distinguishes those rights which are\n   annexed to the person, jura personarum, and\n   acquired rights in external objects, jura rerum;\n   and in the former he includes personal security,\n   which consists in a person&#x27;s legal and\n   uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his\n   body, his health, and his reputation. And he makes\n   the corresponding classification of remedies. The\n   idea expressed is that a man&#x27;s reputation is a part\n   of himself, as his body and limbs are, and\n   reputation is a sort of right to enjoy the good\n   opinion of others, and it is capable of growth and\n   real existence, as an arm or leg. Reputation is,\n   therefore, a personal right, and the right to\n   reputation is put among those absolute personal\n   rights equal in dignity and importance to security\n   from violence. According to Chancellor Kent as a\n   part of the rights of personal security, the\n   preservation of every person&#x27;s good name from\n   the vile arts of detraction is justly included.

The Supreme Court in the case of Ramlila Maidan Incident,\n\nIn re. reported in (2012) 5 SCC has held as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       30. No person can be divested of his fundamental\n       rights. They are incapable of being taken away or\n       abridged. All that the State can do, by exercise of its\n       legislative power, is to regulate these rights by\n       imposition of reasonable restrictions on them. Upon an\n       analysis of the law, the following tests emerge:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">          (a) The restriction can be imposed only by or\n          under the authority of law. It cannot be imposed\n          by exercise of executive power without any law\n          to back it up.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">          (b) Each restriction must be reasonable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">          (c) A restriction must be related to the purpose\n          mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">29.   Thus, it is clear that privacy/reputation/dignity of a citizen of\n\nIndia, are integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and\n\ncannot be infringed, unless and until a restriction is imposed by or\n\nunder the authority of law and such restriction should be reasonable\n\nhaving nexus with object sought to be achieved.          The Privacy/\n\nreputation/dignity of any person, including a hardcore cirminal\n\ncannot be violated, unless and until the reasonable restriction permits\n\nto do so. Even if a person is a hardcore criminal, but still his\n\ndetails/history sheet/survellience has to be kept discreet and there is\n\nno question of posting the photogrpahs of history sheeters even at\n\npolice stations. Further, the Counsel for the State could not point out\n\nany reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">Publishing of a photograph of a criminal or parading in general\n\npublic, even prior to his conviction, may defame him in the society,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                  27</span>\n            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                    W.P.

Further as held\n\nby Supreme Court in the case of Inhuman Conditions in 1382\n\nPrisons, In re (Supra), retribution and deterrence cannot be an\n\nanswer to the offence and the offender.

Thus, merely because a person has been arrested or taken into\n\ncustody by the police, is not sufficient to project him as a guilty\n\nperson. On the contrary, various bail applications are being filed on\n\nthe ground of delay in trial, because the police witnesses donot\n\nappear before the Trial Court for deposing in the matter. Thus, the\n\npolice, instead of tapping its own back by disclosing the identity of\n\nthe suspected persons in print, social or digital media, must\n\nconcentrate on ensuring the timely appearance of the police witnesses\n\nbefore the Trial Court, so that the guilt of a person can be established.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">Further, the police must not leave the witnesses at the mercy of the\n\nanti-social elements, and must provide adequate security to them, so\n\nthat they can depose before the Trial Court, without fear. Speedy trial\n\nis not only a fundamental right of an accused, but is also in the\n\ninterest of justice dispensation system, because if the witnesses are\n\nexamined at the earliest, then the accused party would also not get\n\nany opportunity to pressurize or win over the witnesses.

It is an established fact that witnesses form the key\n        ingredient in a criminal trial and it is the testimonies of\n        these very witnesses, which establish the guilt of the\n        accused. It is, therefore, imperative that for justice to\n        be done, the protection of witnesses and victims\n        becomes essential, as it is the reliance on their\n        testimony and complaints that the actual perpetrators\n        of heinous crimes during the communal violence can\n        be brought to book. Vide an order dated 8-8-2003 in\n        NHRC v.

It has become routine that case is adjourned\n   till the witness is tired and will stop coming to\n   court. In this process lawyers also play an\n   important role. Sometimes witness is threatened,\n   maimed, or even bribed. There is no protection to\n   the witnesses. By adjourning the case the court\n   also becomes a party to such miscarriage of\n   justice. The witness is not given respect by the\n   court. They are pulled out of the court room by\n   the peon. After waiting for the whole day he sees\n   the matter being adjourned. There is no proper\n   place for him to sit and drink a glass of water.\n   When he appears, he is subjected to prolong\n   stretched examinations and cross-examinations.\n   For these reasons persons avoid becoming a\n   witness and because of this administration of\n   justice is hampered. The witnesses are not paid\n   money within time. The High Courts must be\n   vigilant in these matters and should avoid\n   harassment in these matters by subordinate staff.\n   The witnesses should be paid immediately\n   irrespective of the fact whether he examines or\n   the matter is adjourned. The time has come now\n   that all courts should be linked with each other\n   through computer. The Bar Council of India has\n   to play important role in this process to put the\n   criminal justice system on track. Though the trial\n   Judge is aware that witness is telling lie still he is\n   not ready to file complaint against such witness\n   because he is required to sign the same.

Witness turning hostile is a major disturbing\n   factor faced by the criminal courts in India.\n   Reasons are many for the witnesses turning\n   hostile, but of late, we see, especially in high\n   profile cases, there is a regularity in the witnesses\n   turning hostile, either due to monetary\n   consideration or by other tempting offers which\n   undermine the entire criminal justice system and\n   people carry the impression that the mighty and\n   powerful can always get away from the clutches\n   of law, thereby eroding people&#x27;s faith in the\n   system.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1967037\" id=\"span_87\">100. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1967037/\" id=\"a_87\">State of U.P. v. Ramesh\n   Prasad Misra</a> held that it is equally settled law\n   that the evidence of a hostile witness could not be\n   totally rejected, if spoken in favour of the\n   prosecution or the accused, but it can be\n   subjected to closest scrutiny and that portion of\n   the evidence which is consistent with the case of\n   the prosecution or defence may be accepted.</span> In K.\n   Anbazhagan v.

Threat and intimidation has been one of the\n major causes for the hostility of witnesses.\n Bentham said: &quot;witnesses are the eyes and ears of\n justice&quot;. When the witnesses are not able to\n depose correctly in the court of law, it results in\n low rate of conviction and many times even\n hardened criminals escape the conviction. It\n shakes public confidence in the criminal-justice\n delivery system. It is for this reason there has\n been a lot of discussion on witness protection and\n from various quarters demand is made for the\n State to play a definite role in coming out with\n witness protection programme, at least in\n sensitive cases involving those in power, who\n have political patronage and could wield muscle\n and money power, to avert trial getting tainted\n and derailed and truth becoming a casualty.

It is the case of the respondents no. 1 and 2 themselves, that the\n\npetitioner was not formally arrested (As it is mentioned in\n\npunishment order dated 14-10-2020 passed by Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Gwalior) and he was wrongly taken into custody as some\n\nother person with similar name and details was wanted in a criminal\n\ncase.

Thus, it is clear that for no\n\nreasons, the petitioner was not only kept in illegal detention, but his\n\nreputation was tarnished and his privacy and dignity was violated.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">45.

The above issue is no more res integra. The Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of Anita Thakur v. State of J&amp;K, reported in (2016) 15\n\nSCC 525 has held as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       18*. When we examine the present matter in the\n       aforesaid conspectus, we find that initially it was the\n       petitioners/protestors who took the law into their\n       hands by turning their peaceful agitation into a violent\n       one and in the process becoming unruly and pelting\n       stones at the police. On the other hand, even the police\n       personnel continued the use of force beyond limits\n       after they had controlled the mob. In the process, they\n       continued their lathi-charge. They continued to beat\n       up all the three petitioners even after overpowering\n       them. They had virtually apprehended these\n       petitioners making them immobile. However, their\n       attack on these petitioners continued even thereafter\n       when it was not at all needed. As far as injuries\n       suffered by these petitioners are concerned, such a\n       situation could clearly be avoided. It is apparent that\n       to that extent, the respondents misused their power. To\n       that extent, fundamental right of the petitioners, due to\n       police excess, has been violated. In such\n       circumstances, in exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_98\">Article\n       32</a> of the Constitution, this Court can award\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                    47</span>\n             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                     W.P. No. 13057 of 2020</span>\n             Arun Sharma Vs.

The ratio of these precedents can be\n        explained thus: First, it is clear that a violation of\n        fundamental rights due to police misconduct can give\n        rise to a liability under public law, apart from criminal\n        and tort law. Secondly, that pecuniary compensation\n        can be awarded for such a violation of fundamental\n        rights. Thirdly, it is the State that is held liable and,\n        therefore, the compensation is borne by the State and\n        not the individual police officers found guilty of\n        misconduct. Fourthly, this Court has held that the\n        standard of proof required for proving police\n        misconduct such as brutality, torture and custodial\n        violence and for holding the State accountable for the\n        same, is high. It is only for patent and incontrovertible\n        violation of fundamental rights that such remedy can\n        be made available. Fifthly, the doctrine of sovereign\n        immunity does not apply to cases of fundamental\n        rights violation and hence, cannot be used as a defence\n        in public law.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">47.   In case of illegal detention, this Court can award compensation\n\nto the sufferer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_116\">48.

It is thus now well settled that the award of\n       compensation against the State is an appropriate and\n       effective remedy for redress of an established\n       infringement of a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 21</a>,\n       by a public servant. The quantum of compensation\n       will, however, depend upon the facts and\n       circumstances of each case. Award of such\n       compensation (by way of public law remedy) will not\n       come in the way of the aggrieved person claiming\n       additional compensation in a civil court, in the\n       enforcement of the private law remedy in tort, nor\n       come in the way of the criminal court ordering\n       compensation under <a href=\"/doc/1705664/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 357</a> of the Code of\n       Criminal Procedure.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">50.   Thus, it is clear that violation of Fundamental Right of a person\n\ndue to police misconduct, would not only give rise to a liability under\n\nCriminal, Tort and Public Law but pecuniary compensation can also\n\nbe awarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">Incident of 25-7-2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">51.
