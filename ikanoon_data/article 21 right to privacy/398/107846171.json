The Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR)\ndated 01.10.2024 was registered by the respondent based on\nan FIR filed by the Lokayukta concerning a predicate offence\nrelated to the illegal allotment of sites by MUDA during the\npetitioner&#x27;s tenure as Commissioner of MUDA. Pursuant to\nauthorization by the Joint Director of the respondent agency,\nthe Assistant Director conducted a search of the petitioner&#x27;s\nresidence under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 17</a> of the PMLA, 2002 on 28.10.2024\nand 29.10.2024. During the search, the petitioner&#x27;s mobile\nphone was seized, and its data was transferred to a hard disk.\nFurthermore, the respondent examined the petitioner on oath\nunder <a href=\"/doc/10872913/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 17(1)(f)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">      3.   On 29.10.2024.after the search was completed.,\nthe respondent served summons on the petitioner at 4.00 pm\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA, 2002, directing him to appear\nbefore the Investigating Officer on the same day at 5:30 PM.\nSubsequently, the petitioner was       served with another\nsummons dated 07.11.2024, directing him to appear before\nthe concerned officer on 08.11.2024. On that date, the\npetitioner was interrogated from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      4.   The petitioner further alleges that on 14.11.2024\nand 25.11.2024, the respondent illegally summoned him via\ntelephonic calls, and the petitioner, to show his bona fides,\ncomplied therewith and appeared for further interrogation on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                  -4-</span>\n                                                  NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                            WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\n15.11.2024 and 27.11.2024. Aggrieved by these actions, the\npetitioner has filed the instant writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">      5.      The primary issue for consideration in this petition\nis, whether the impugned search and seizure conducted at the\npetitioner&#x27;s residence, along with the recording of the\npetitioner&#x27;s statement on oath under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 17</a> of the PMLA,\n2002, and the subsequent issuance of summons under\n<a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 50</a> of the Act, based solely on the assumption or\nsuspicion that the petitioner, as the former Commissioner of\nMUDA, might be in possession of records related to the\noffence of money laundering, is violative of statutory\nprocedural safeguards, and can be sustained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">Submissions\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      6.      Shri Sandesh J. Choutha, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing on behalf of the petitioner, advanced the following\nsubmissions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      6.1. The initiation of inquiry or investigation culminating\nin the conduct of search and seizure under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 17</a> of the\nPrevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter\nreferred to as the PMLA, 2002), as well as the subsequent\nissuance of summons under <a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 50</a> of the Act, is devoid of\nlegal authority. The learned Counsel contended that the\nrespondent agency lacked credible evidence to demonstrate\nthat the &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; related to a predicate offence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 -5-</span>\n                                            NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                        WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nwere either concealed or projected as untainted money, as\nrequired under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 3</a> of the Act. Without such credible\nevidence to establish the offence of money laundering, the\nprocedural safeguards under the Act have been violated,\nrendering the entire process unsustainable in law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      6.2. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that, as per\n<a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 17</a> of the PMLA, 2002, the Director is the competent\nauthority to authorize any officer not below the rank of Deputy\nDirector to conduct search and seizure operations. However,\nin the present case, the Joint Director, who does not possess\nthe requisite competence under the Act, authorized the\nAssistant Director to conduct the search and seizure. The\nAssistant Director, being below the rank of Deputy Director,\nwas not legally empowered to carry out the search and\nseizure. Consequently, the entire exercise of search and\nseizure conducted by the respondent agency stands vitiated\ndue to the lack of authority.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      6.3. It was further argued that <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 17</a> of the PMLA,\n2002 mandates that an officer authorized to conduct a search\nand seizure must have &quot;reason to believe,&quot; based on material\nin his possession, that a person is involved in the offence of\nmoney laundering. This reason to believe must be recorded in\nwriting prior to initiating such proceedings. However, in the\ninstant case, the respondent agency conducted the search\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                    -6-</span>\n                                                     NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                               WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nand seizure on the mere assumption that the petitioner, as the\nthen Commissioner of MUDA, had illegally allotted sites. This\nassumption, according to the learned Senior Counsel, does\nnot satisfy the statutory requirement of &quot;reason to believe&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 17</a>, thereby rendering the proceedings invalid\nand illegal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      6.4. He further contended that under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 17</a> of the\nPMLA, 2002, a search and seizure can only be conducted\nsubsequent to the attachment of property involved in money\nlaundering, as provided under <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 5</a> of the Act. In the\npresent case, no such attachment of property has been made\nprior to the initiation of the search and seizure proceedings.\nThis procedural lapse undermines the legality of the search\nand seizure conducted by the respondent agency.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"14485072\" id=\"span_9\">In support, reliance is placed on the following:\n\n        i. <a href=\"/doc/14485072/\" id=\"a_20\">Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v.

The present writ petition, challenging the summons\nissued under <a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA, 2002, is premature and\nwithout merit. He argued that the summons merely calls upon\nthe petitioner to produce records in his possession during the\ncourse of an ongoing investigation. The issuance of summons\nhas not caused any prejudice to the petitioner, as it is\nprocedural in nature and falls within the statutory framework of\nthe Act.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                -8-</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">                                              NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                         WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\n      7.2. The learned ASG emphasized that <a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 50</a> of\nthe Act explicitly empowers the competent authority to\nsummon any person, compel their attendance, and require the\nproduction of records or evidence during the course of an\ninvestigation. Therefore, the summons issued to the petitioner\ncannot be construed as arbitrary, illegal, or outside the scope\nof the powers vested in the respondent Agency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">      7.3. The investigation initiated by the respondent\nAgency pertains to proceeds of crime derived or obtained in\nconnection with a scheduled offence under the PMLA, 2002.\nHe contended that the sites derived by the accused in the\nscheduled offence fall squarely within the ambit of &quot;proceeds\nof crime&quot; as defined under <a href=\"/doc/168552790/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the Act. The\ncompetent authority, having recorded its &quot;reason to believe&quot; in\nwriting, has rightly concluded that the petitioner, as the former\nCommissioner of MUDA, assisted the accused in the illegal\nallotment of sites and may be in possession or control of\nrecords or properties relevant to the investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">     7.4. Addressing the petitioner&#x27;s contention regarding\nthe competence of the authorizing authority, the learned ASG\nsubmitted that the Joint Director is one of the authorities\nenumerated under <a href=\"/doc/17599/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 48</a> of the PMLA, 2002. He argued\nthat <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 17</a> of the Act empowers the Joint Director, who is\nabove the rank of Deputy Director, to authorize an Assistant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                -9-</span>\n                                             NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                         WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nDirector to conduct search and seizure. In the instant case,\nthe Joint Director has validly authorized the Assistant Director\nto act under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 17</a> of the Act, and the authorization is in\naccordance with the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      7.5. In support of the above, he places a reliance on\nthe circular dated 27.09.2011 issued by the Directorate of\nEnforcement, which authorizes Assistant Directors and Deputy\nDirectors to conduct search and seizure operations under\n<a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 17</a> of the Act, subject to the prior approval of the Joint\nDirector. He emphasized that this circular reinforces the\nlegality of the authorization granted in the present case and\nnegates the petitioner&#x27;s contention regarding procedural\nimpropriety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">      7.6. The learned ASG asserted that the Joint Director\nhas duly recorded the &quot;reason to believe&quot; in writing as\nmandated under <a href=\"/doc/1664375/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 17(1)</a> of the PMLA, 2002. The\nrecorded reasons clearly reveal the petitioner&#x27;s role in the\nillegal allotment of sites during his tenure as the Commissioner\nof MUDA. He further contended that the sufficiency or\nadequacy of the &quot;reasons to believe&quot; cannot be examined in a\nwrit petition, as it involves a subjective satisfaction of the\ncompetent authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">     7.7. The learned ASG argued that the recording of\nreasons under <a href=\"/doc/1664375/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 17(1)</a> of the PMLA, 2002, which\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                                 - 10 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">                                                NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                            WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\npertains to the power to conduct search and seizure, cannot\nbe equated with the recording of reasons under <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 19</a> of\nthe Act, which deals with the power to arrest a person guilty of\nan offence under the Act. While <a href=\"/doc/1664375/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 17(1)</a> of PMLA deals\nwith the investigation process to summon records, <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 19</a>\nof the Act deals with punitive action against an accused\nperson.    Therefore,     reasons        recorded    satisfies   the\nrequirements of <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_43\">section 17</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">       7.8. The petitioner has suppressed material facts from\nthe Court. He contended that the petitioner failed to disclose\nhis involvement as the former Commissioner of MUDA, during\nwhich he allegedly allotted fourteen sites that now constitute\nthe proceeds of crime. This deliberate suppression of facts, he\nargued, disentitles the petitioner from any relief in equity or\nlaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">       7.9. In the light of the above submissions, he\ncontended that the petitioner&#x27;s challenge to the summons\nissued under <a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA, 2002, and the search\nand seizure conducted under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 17</a> of the Act, lacks\nmerit. He submitted that the competent authority has acted in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act, and there is no\nprocedural infirmity in the investigation. He, therefore, prayed\nfor the dismissal of the writ petition with costs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">                             - 11 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">                                               NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                         WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nIn support, reliance is placed on the following:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1263711\" id=\"span_29\">(Sufficiency of reasons to believe cannot be gone into)\n\ni.

However, where a person\nunconnected with the scheduled offence provides assistance\nin concealing or utilizing the proceeds of crime after the\ncompletion of the scheduled offence, such a person can still\nbe prosecuted under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA, provided the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">                              - 34 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">                                             NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                        WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nscheduled offence remains established. The Court concluded\nthat it is not a legal requirement for a person accused under\n<a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA to also be an accused in the scheduled\noffence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">     24.9. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"20777541\" id=\"span_89\">In <a href=\"/doc/20777541/\" id=\"a_145\">Manish Sisodia v. CBI</a>, 2023 SCC OnLine\n1393, the Supreme Court, while emphasizing the need for\nspecificity in allegations against an accused in cases of money\nlaundering, rejected the contention of the Directorate of\nEnforcement (DoE) that the generation of proceeds of crime\nalone constitutes possession or use of such proceeds. The\nCourt held that possession of proceeds of crime is established\nonly when the accused has dominion over such proceeds\ncoupled with the intent (animus) to exercise control.

Similarly, in the present case, the alleged predicate\noffence pertains to the illegal allotment of sites during the\npetitioner&#x27;s tenure as the Commissioner of MUDA. However,\nthere is no evidence to demonstrate that any consideration\npassed in relation to the conveyance or relinquishment of such\nsites was received by the petitioner. Consequently, the\npetitioner cannot be attributed any role in possessing,\nconcealing, or using the proceeds of crime to constitute an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA, 2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">      26.   Furthermore, mere possession of a site that was\nallegedly illegally allotted to an accused in connection with a\nscheduled offence does not, by itself, constitute an offence\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_147\">Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002</a> (PMLA),\nunless the essential ingredients of the offence as defined\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 3</a> of the Act are satisfied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">     27.    In light of the above precedents, it can be\nconcluded that the existence of &quot;reason to believe,&quot; as\nrequired under the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_149\">Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002</a>\n(PMLA), mandates the presence of sufficient cause to indicate\nthe commission of the offence of money laundering.\nAdditionally, it necessitates a corresponding justification for\nthe seizure of any records or proceeds of crime discovered\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">                                - 36 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_111\">                                              NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                          WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nduring the search.

To satisfy this threshold, the authorized officer\nmust demonstrate that they arrived at an informed and\nobjective conclusion, based on credible material in their\npossession, that the proceeds of crime or documents related\nto money laundering are likely to be located at the premises\nsought to be searched. This procedural safeguard upholds the\nprinciples of fairness and legality, ensuring that the exercise of\npower under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 17</a> of the PMLA is neither arbitrary nor\nspeculative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">      29.   A review of the recorded &quot;reason to believe&quot; must\nshow that the material available with the Director is sufficient\nto support the conclusion reached.

For possession of proceeds of crime, the &quot;reason to\nbelieve&quot; must specifically show that the person being\nsearched had control over and intent to use or manage the\nproceeds of crime. Simply holding the proceeds by chance or\naccident does not mean the person was involved in generating\nor hiding them as part of money laundering.

The learned ASG contends that where the criminal\nactivity in the predicate offence pertains to &#x27;illegal allotment of\n14 sites&#x27; by MUDA, during the tenure of the petitioner as its\nCommissioner, the said sites/properties, as such, satisfy the\ndefinition of proceeds of crime under <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 2(u)</a> of PMLA,\n2002. Therefore, where the allotted sites are the proceeds, the\nprocess of allotment, presided over by the Commissioner,\nconstitutes &#x27;assisting&#x27; a process or activity connected with the\nproceeds of crime, and hence, constitutes a reasonable cause\nfor the purposes of conduct of search and seizure under\n<a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 17</a> of the Act. The learned ASG clarifies that the\npetitioner, at this stage of investigation, is not an accused and\nthat the impugned search was conducted on the basis of the\nreasonable     belief   that   the       petitioner,    as   the   former\nCommissioner of MUDA, may be in possession of the\nproceeds of crime or any records related money laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">      32.    <a href=\"/doc/1664375/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 17(1)</a> of PMLA, 2002 mandates the\nformation of a reason to believe, on the basis of the\ninformation in possession of the Director, prior to the conduct\nof search and seizure.

The reasons recorded do not in\nany manner, whatsoever, indicate the involvement of the\npetitioner in any act constituting money laundering or to be in\npossession of proceeds of crime involved in money-\nlaundering, or to be in possession of any records or property\nrelated to money laundering or crime, respectively. The\nreasons do not contain any specific allegation/ remark against\nthe petitioner having suspected to either received illegal\ngratification as against the allotment of sites, or having placed\nor layered any proceeds of crime, or having knowingly\nassisted in the same, much less any evidence to substantiate\nthe suspicion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">      34.

Thus, this Court is of the opinion\nthat the impugned search and seizure conducted at the\nresidence of the petitioner was unwarranted and based on\nunfounded suspicion, and is therefore, an abuse of process of\nlaw.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">ISSUE NO. 3</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">       35.

In the present case, summons under <a href=\"/doc/1395568/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 50</a>\nwere issued following the &#x27;illegal&#x27; search and seizure\nconducted under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 17</a> of the PMLA. However, as\nestablished in the preceding paragraphs, the reasons\nrecorded for the search do not satisfy the essential elements\nrequired to establish the commission of an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA. As a result, the search and seizure\nlacked proper authority for there being no proper reason to\nwarrant such a search. The respondent-Agency can summon\nany person to record a statement or produce a document or\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">                                - 49 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">                                             NC: 2025:KHC:3573\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                         WP No. 32956 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\nrecord only in cases where there is credible evidence that an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 3</a> of PMLA has been committed, and in\nsuch circumstances, the person who has been summoned\ncannot raise any grievance against the issuance of summons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">      54.     Thus, in light of the circumstances of this case,\nwhere no prima facie case has been established showing that\nan offence has been committed under the PMLA, and no\nincriminating material has been elicited at the time of search\nand seizure, the issuance of summons to the petitioner lacks\nlegal authority. The petitioners cannot be compelled to appear\nand record their statements or produce documents, as such\nactions would unjustly infringe upon their personal right to\nliberty.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">ISSUE NO. 4</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_170\">      55.

The learned Senior Counsel contended that the same\nis forthcoming from the placement of the sections in the\nenactment.

Furthermore, a\nperusal of the definition of property contained in <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 2(v)</a>\nof PMLA indicates that a movable property, such as currency\nnotes or any other property, etc, is subject to attachment\nunder <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 5</a>, provided the Director is satisfied that such\nproperty is likely to be concealed, dissipated, or dealt with in\nsuch manner so as to frustrate the proceedings of the Act. In\nall practicality, an attachment of such movable property\ntherefore, cannot be conceived without an incidental search.\nAs such, an attachment under <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 5</a> cannot be mandated\nto precede search and seizure under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 17</a>. Furthermore,\nit is appropriate that the exercise of investigative tools under\nthe law is left to the prudent exercise of discretion of the\ninvestigative agency, to be decided in consideration of the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. Therefore, the\nsubmission that attachment must mandatorily precede search\ncannot be countenanced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">          57.

It is apposite at this stage to observe that the\nEnforcement Directorate is a premier investigative agency\nestablished for the purpose of preventing the serious offence\nof money laundering and confiscation of the proceeds of\ncrime, and that it is expected to discharge its duties with\nfairness. The right to liberty and privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_211\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution vests a right against the conduct of arbitrary\nsearches, and therefore, the search conducted on the\npremises of the petitioner under the garb of investigation,\nwhen there is no prima facie evidence to establish the offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 3</a> is but an abuse of process of law.
