The\n\n                foremost among them is the decision by a 7 Judges Bench of the\n\n                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1430396/\" id=\"a_4\">The Commissioner, Hindu Religious\n\n                Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of\n\n                Sri Shirur Mutt</a> , AIR 1954 SC 282. It was held that what has\n\n                been guaranteed was freedom not only to entertain such religious\n\n                belief as may be approved of by one&#x27;s judgment and conscience but\n\n                also to exhibit his belief in such outward acts as he thinks proper.\n\n                Religion is a matter of faith with individuals or communities. It has\n\n                its basis in a system of beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by\n\n                those who profess their religion as conducive to their spiritual well\n\n                being but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else\n\n                but a doctrine or belief. It may not only lay down a code of ethical\n\n                rules for its followers to accept, but also prescribe rituals and\n\n                observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded\n\n                as integral parts of religion. These forms and observances might\n\n                extend even to matters of food and dress.        What constitutes the\n\n                essential part of religion is primarily to be ascertained with\n\n                reference to the doctrines of that religion itself. If the tenets of any\n\n                religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings of food should\n\n                be given to the idol at particular hours of the day, or that periodical\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                5/39</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                   WP(MD)No.10496 of 2024</span>\n\n                ceremonies should be performed in a certain way at certain periods\n\n                of the year or that there should be daily recital of sacred texts or\n\n                oblations to the sacred fire, all these would be regarded as parts of\n\n                religion. The constitutional guarantee also protects acts done in\n\n                pursuance of religion and this is made clear by the use of the\n\n                expression “practice of religion” in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 25.</a>    Restrictions by the\n\n                State upon free exercise of religion are permitted on grounds of\n\n                public order, morality and health.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1307370\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/1307370/\" id=\"a_6\">Ratilal Panachand Gandhi\n\n                v.

After the great war was over, the pandavas performed\n\n                Ashwamedha Yagna. King Yudhistira was being feted by everyone\n\n                that he had done a great charity.            A mongoose with a half-golden\n\n                body arrived and announced that the yagna was nothing compared\n\n                to what it had once witnessed. It narrated the story of a very poor\n\n                brahmin&#x27;s family. It was a time of terrible famine. Once a guest who\n\n                was very hungry entered their hut when they were about to have\n\n                their meal. The brahmin gave away his 1/4th share. The guest was\n\n                not satisfied. The wife parted with her share. The guest was still\n\n                hungry. The son then gave his 1/4th share. Still, the guest wanted\n\n                more.             The young daughter-in-law also willingly relinquished her\n\n                portion.            Even though they were emaciated and starving and had\n\n                nothing else to eat, they willingly gave away their everything to\n\n                their guest. The guest was none other than Dharma who had come\n\n                there to test the Brahmin.            He then blessed the family and sent\n\n                them to heaven in a golden chariot. The mongoose that witnessed\n\n                all this rolled on the ground where there were leftover granules of\n\n                flour. The grains represented great sacrifice and hence half of the\n\n                mongoose’s body turned golden. Since then, the mongoose would\n\n                visit every yagna and roll on the ground to turn its other half into\n\n                gold. The mongoose’s body did not turn golden anywhere, and it\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                21/39</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">\f                                                                  WP(MD)No.10496 of 2024</span>\n\n                declared that the sacrifice by Yudhishthira was not equivalent to\n\n                that of the Brahmin.       From this, I am tempted to infer that even\n\n                during the days of Mahabharata, the practice of rolling over the\n\n                leftover food was considered as conferring spiritual benefit.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">                          25.Annadhanam has been eulogized as a noble act in\n\n                Taittriyopanishad of Krishna Yajur Veda, Bhavishyapurana and in\n\n                the Ashwamedha Parva of Sri Mahabharata.

This is evident from paragraph 8 of the said order.       The facts\n\n                are also not comparable. In the case before the Supreme Court, the\n\n                practice was that after the Brahmins had taken their meals, on the\n\n                left over plantain leaves, persons belonging to other communities\n\n                would roll over.     The prayer in WP(MD)No.7068 of 2015 was for\n\n                directing the respondents to protect the right to dignified life by\n\n                stopping the inhuman practice of rolling over on used plantain\n\n                leaves left by brahmins after their meal, all over the State of Tamil\n\n                Nadu. In this case, even according to the District Administration,\n\n                the devotees irrespective of their community background partake\n\n                the meals and devotees of all communities including the brahmins\n\n                would perform Angapradakshinam.
