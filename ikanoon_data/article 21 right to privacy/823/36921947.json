Undisputedly, certain articles,\n\n        including cash, jewellery and papers were recovered from the\n\n        bank locker jointly held by the Petitioner with his wife.\n\n        Allegedly,      reports     and     documents   recovered   revealed\n\n        undisclosed transactions of considerably high value, running\n\n        into thousands of lakh of rupees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">                3. Petitioner lays a challenge to the warrant of\n\n        authorization dated 27th October, 2008 and consequential\n\n        action of conduct of search and seizure operation on 7th\n\n        November, 2008, to be illegal, unauthorized and ultra vires the\n\n        provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 132</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and\n\n        Rules 112 of the Income Tax Rules framed thereunder.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">                4. On facts, Petitioner does admit that four years before\n\n        the conduct of search, he was Director in M/s Apcon Homes\n\n        Private Limited. However, since his resignation in the year\n\n        2004, Shri Kaushal Kumar Singh and Dhirendra Kumar Singh\n\n        took over its affairs, with the Petitioner having nothing to do\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3792 of 2009 dt.02-12-2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           3/15</span>\n\n\n\n\n        either with the said Company or any one of the persons\n\n        managing the same or other group companies referred to in the\n\n        satisfaction note. To support its case, the Petitioner has placed\n\n        on individual record returns filed under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_3\">Companies Act</a>,\n\n        indicating his intent of change of Directorship.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">                5. On facts, the Revenue has refuted and disputed the\n\n        averments made in the petition. Allegedly, Petitioner and one\n\n        Mr. Kaushal Singh were deeply associated with the affairs of\n\n        M/s Apcon Homes Private Limited. As on the date of issuance\n\n        of search warrants, the Website maintained by the Registrar of\n\n        Companies reflected the Petitioner to be one of its Directors.\n\n        Further, Kaushal Kumar Singh was indulging into severe\n\n        violation of provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_4\">Income Tax Act</a> and as such was\n\n        kept under watch. Investigation reveals that at least seven\n\n        companies, including M/s Aastha Promoters &amp; Developers Pvt.\n\n        Ltd., M/s Kamini Kaushal Kanchan Construction Pvt. Ltd. and\n\n        M/s Apcon Homes Pvt. Ltd. had indulged in large scale\n\n        evasion of tax, apart from defrauding gullible customers.\n\n        Allegedly, 30-40 per cent of the amount, valuing the property,\n\n        was received in cash from them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">                6.

All were falling\n\n        within the territorial limits of the authority conducting search\n\n        and seizure operation.

Before this Court, the Petitioner has not tried to\n\n        explain unaccounted money reflected in the documents seized\n\n        during the search. The challenge, limited in nature, is on the\n\n        legal ground of there being no material germane reflecting\n\n        satisfaction of the authorized person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">                8.
