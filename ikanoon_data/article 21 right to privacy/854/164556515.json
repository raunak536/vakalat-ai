The MLC of the\nprosecutrix &#x27;B&#x27; Ex.PW1/A reveals that the doctor who had\nexamined the prosecutrix had after reporting on the external\ninjuries, state of sexual organs of the victim and the samples\ncollected, conducted the following tests on the prosecutrix &#x27;B&#x27; aged\n\n\nSt. Vs. Umesh Singh &amp; Anr., FIR No.1135/06, PS Uttam Nagar      Page No. 21 of 27\n about 14 years:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">1.    The Hymen Test\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">2.    The PV Test.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">              In so far as the Hymen Test is concerned, it has been\nreported by the doctor on the MLC of the prosecutrix that the\nHymen not intact. Further, with regard to the PV Test it has been\nreported that vaginal introitus admits two fingers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">              This court has come across a number of MLCs of\nvictims of rape where apart from reporting on the signs of violence\nor resistance, state of sexual organs of the victim and details\nregarding collecting of samples and reporting on the condition of\nthe hymen cord the information &quot;PV: two fingers admissible or\ninadmissible&quot; as the case may be is also mentioned.                    In this\ninformation it is also transcribed as &quot;habituated to sex&quot; or &quot;used\nto sex&quot;. The category of habituated is used against raped women\nto suggest they lie about rape and this extends to child sexual\nabuse cases too.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">              It is this test which is the cause of concern. It is being\nroutinely conducted by the doctors on the victims of sexual abuse\nand rape be it a minor, unmarried girl or married woman, without\nhaving any regards to the fact that the opinion of the doctors\nrendered after conducting such a test has no bearing with regard to\nthe guilt or otherwise of the accused.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">St. Vs. Umesh Singh &amp; Anr., FIR No.1135/06, PS Uttam Nagar   Page No. 22 of 27\n               I may observe, that in case of sexual assault the doctor\nis only required to look into signs of violence or resistance if any\nupon the body of the victim for which the doctor would make a\nnote of it by visible external examination. The doctor is further\nrequired to report on the state of sexual organs of the victim to\ninclude information regarding puberty and attaining of sexual\nmaturity of the victim and in case of assault or pregnancy the\nabdominal and vaginal examinations and thereafter to collect the\nsamples from the clothes of the victim and the alleged attacker and\nthe vagina of the victim so as to establishing the nature of assault\nand the identity of the attacker.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">              In case if the victim is unmarried, the Hymen Test is\nconducted to check if the hymen cord is intact and in case of use of\nforce any signs of tearing or bruising off or near the vagina is\nnoted. Having conducted the aforesaid test no further\nexamination is required. Why then the Per Vagina (PV) test\nwhich is normally called the Finger Test is being carried out in\nroutine on victims of sexual offences. This test only establishes\nwhether the vestibule is congested and whether one, two or\nthree fingers can be inserted. It is this PV Test which is being\ncarried out by the doctors in routine upon the rape victims to\nwhich this court has serious reservations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">              The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has Articulated\nand protected the privacy as one of the features of the fundamental\n\nSt. Vs.

Umesh Singh &amp; Anr., FIR No.1135/06, PS Uttam Nagar   Page No. 24 of 27\n               Secondly this test which permits a doctor to state\nwhether a woman is &quot;habituated to sex&quot; or &quot;used to sex&quot; in a\npublic proceedings without having due regards for confidentiality,\nis in itself violative of the Right of Privacy of a woman regarding\nher sexual life in as much as it tends to expose her private sexual\nlife.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">              Thirdly the PV Test/ Two finger test, medically has no\nscientific or conclusive basis and the opinion rendered by the\ndoctor to the extent of congestion of vestibule is subjective. I say\nthis because assuming in a given case where the victim of rape is a\nmarried woman it is only natural that the vestibule would admits\nmore than one finger.            How then, would this be relevant to\nestablish rape. Also, in a case where the victim is an unmarried\ngirl once the Hymen Test is conducted how the aspect of extent of\ncongestion of the vestibule would be relevant. The extension of\nvestibules to various degrees can be on account of various reasons\nincluding medical and not only because of the sexual life of a\nwoman. Even if it is on account of her previous sexual life how\nrelevant or authentic this test would be.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">              Fourthly once the character evidence of a rape victim\nis no longer admissible in evidence, how can this test (PV Test)\nwhich only permits the doctor to state if the woman is habituated\nto sex or not, continue to inform the rape trials. This PV Test/\nFinger Test which is being so conducted in routine upon the\n\n\nSt. Vs. Umesh Singh &amp; Anr., FIR No.1135/06, PS Uttam Nagar   Page No. 25 of 27\n victims of sexual offences allows the character evidence to\ndisqualify the victim&#x27;s testimony. The presumptions under the\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_25\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and the existing statutory provisions in India\nmakes the sexual character of a rape victim irrelevant to sexual\nviolence trials.        Given these circumstances, the PV Test is\nabsolutely unnecessary and irrelevant in trial of rape cases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">              Lastly the PV Test which allows the doctor to state\nwhether the woman is habituated to sex or used to sex is self\nincriminating as it is often used to disqualify the victim&#x27;s\ntestimony. This test shifts the focus of the investigations and\nthe trial in sexual offences cases from the accused to the victim\nwhich is impermissible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">              The humiliation which a rape victim suffers in the court\non account of existing procedures is impermissible. This court is\nof the view that the existing medical and legal procedures which\nare irrelevant to the trial of the rape cases, are required to be\nreviewed and stopped forthwith.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">              This being the background, I hereby hold that the PV\nTest/ Finger Test is irrelevant to sexual violence trials. This test is\nviolative of the Fundamental Right of Privacy an important\nConstitutional Right of the victim. If due to any reason, under the\ngiven circumstances of a case, if the investigating officer is of the\nview that this test would be essential and necessary to collect\nevidence against the accused, then it should only be carried out\n\nSt. Vs. Umesh Singh &amp; Anr., FIR No.1135/06, PS Uttam Nagar   Page No. 26 of 27\n with the consent of the prosecutrix/ her guardians (prosecutrix if\nshe is a major and guardians if she is a minor) and that too after\ntaking due permission from the court and not otherwise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">              State action cannot be a threat to the Constitutional\nRight of an individual. What has shocked my conscious is the fact\nthat this PV Test/ Finger Test is being carried out in routine on\nvictims of sexual offences by the doctors thereby reflecting a\nrampant violation of the Constitutional Rights of such victims. It\nhas therefore become necessary for this court to highlight this fact\nbefore the authorities concerned so that the necessary steps are\ntaken in the direction to ensure the protection of the Right of\nPrivacy of the victims of sexual offence and for this purpose I\ndirect that a copy of this order be placed before the Directorate of\nHealth, NCT of Delhi and Chief Secretary, Government of NCT of\nDelhi and the National Commission for Women for information\nand for information and appropriate action in this regard.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">              File be consigned to Record Room.\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">Announced in the open court                             (Dr. KAMINI LAU)\nDated: 17.8.2010                                        ASJ-II(NW): Rohini\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">St. Vs.
