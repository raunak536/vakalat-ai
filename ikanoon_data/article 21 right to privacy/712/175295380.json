The only question, one of some\nimportance, that is raised in the present petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the\n Constitution is whether an examinee has access to his evaluated answerscript\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>.\n\n\n      The petitioner appears to be a reasonably meritorious student. He obtained\n91.6 per cent in his Madhyamik (Class X) Examinations and 80.8 per cent in his\nHigher Secondary (Class XII) Examinations. He enrolled for the mathematics\nhonours course of the Calcutta University in Presidency College - where\nadmission itself is an acknowledgement of merit. In 2006, the petitioner took his\nPart I Bachelor&#x27;s degree examinations and secured a somewhat modest 52 per\ncent score. In the following year he appeared for his Part II Examinations and\nsecured 208 marks out of a maximum of 400. The petitioner was particularly\naggrieved by his being awarded 28 out of 100 in the fifth paper.\n\n\n\n      The petitioner applied for a post-publication scrutiny, seeking re-evaluation\nof his answerscripts in the fifth and sixth papers in accordance with the rules\nprescribed by the University. On review, the marks awarded to him in the fifth\npaper increased by four and a fresh, corrected mark-sheet was issued to him.\n\n\n\n      The petitioner claims that he was called for an interview for the integrated\nPhD programme in mathematics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,\nBangalore Centre after clearing the written examination therefor. He claims that\nhis poor marks in the second leg of his Bachelor&#x27;s course led to his exclusion\nfrom the final list. The petitioner avers that the poor marks stand in the way of\nhis obtaining admission for the master&#x27;s programme in any of the better\nuniversities. The petitioner cleared the written examination for the integrated\ndoctoral programme in mathematical sciences at the Indian Institute of Science,\nBangalore and following the interview, was placed eighth on the merit list. The\npetitioner&#x27;s provisional application fell through as he failed to obtain a first class\nin his Bachelor&#x27;s course.\n       On August 14, 2007 the petitioner made a request to obtain his University\nanswerscript in appropriate format to the State Public Information Officer under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> (hereinafter referred to as the said Act). Such\nofficer rejected the application by a writing of September 17, 2007 which is the\nsubject matter of the challenge in the present proceedings. The said officer&#x27;s\ncryptic rejection runs as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;Re.:- Your Application dt. 14/8/07 <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">Under R.T.I. Act, 2005</a>.\n      Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n      In response to your above application I am to inform you that it has been\n      decided that henceforth no inspection of any answer script of any\n      examination conducted by the University shall be allowed to any applicant\n      under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>.\n\n      Thus we cannot entertain your application and the same is rejected.\n\n      Thanking you,\n\n                                     Yours faithfully,\n                                           Sd/-\n                             State Public Information Officer\n                                           And\n                                       Registrar.&quot;\n\n\n\n      The letter appears to be on a printed format where there is a blank left for\nthe date at the top; there is a space left for the examinee&#x27;s name and address\nbeing inserted; and, the date of the application is also left open to be filled up.\nThe officer has used his pen to fill up the date of the letter, the name and address\nof the examinee, the date of the application and has inserted the word &quot;been&quot; as\nthere is an obvious mistake in the printed form. The officer acknowledged the\nreceipt of an application under the said Act but did not deal with the application\nin the manner provided by the said Act and it is such action and the stereo-typed\ndecision evident from the letter of rejection that has prompted the writ petition to\n be entertained rather than requiring the petitioner to exhaust the alternative\nremedy ordinarily available under the said Act.\n\n\n\n      The respondent University has mentioned the point of alternative remedy\nin passing without really insisting thereon. The University has, in effect, invited a\ndecision on merits on a matter of public importance and throughout the hearing\nthe matter has been conducted on behalf of the University with commendable\nimpartiality and a degree of desirable dispassion.\n\n\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 7</a> of the said Act lays down the manner of disposal of a request for\nobtaining information received under the said Act. Sub-section (8) of <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 7</a>\nstipulates that where a request has been rejected under sub-section (1), the\nrelevant officer shall communicate to the person making the request, the reasons\nfor such rejection; the period within which an appeal against such rejection may\nbe preferred; and, the particulars of the appellate authority. The letter of rejection\nof September 17, 2007 is lacking on all three counts. It does not convey any\nreason for the rejection. It does not inform the petitioner of his right to appeal\nand the period therefor. It does not furnish the particulars of the appellate\nauthority. In its assertion that, &quot;it has been decided&quot;, the State Public\nInformation Officer appears not to make a decision but merely to convey a fiat\nwhether imposed on him or that he seeks to impose on any examinee seeking to\nobtain his or her answerscript. The rejection is, in the manner that it has been\nmade, wholly without jurisdiction and in not conveying any reasons it is in\ncontravention of the mandate under <a href=\"/doc/16185/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 7(8)</a> of the said Act and per se\ncontrary to the principles of natural justice. When the order is assessed to be of\nsuch poor quality that it fails to comply with the statutory requirements, a\npetition challenging the order may be received under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution.\n       The alternative remedy that would otherwise have been available to the\npetitioner herein is, in the present case, an illusory right. In not furnishing the\nparticulars of the appellate authority, the Public Information Officer has acted in\nderogation of the command of <a href=\"/doc/595881/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 7(8)(iii)</a>. It is not as if in every case that\nthere is a fixed appellate forum that a person aggrieved by the manner of disposal\nof his request may otherwise be aware of. <a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 19(1)</a> of the said Act provides\nthat an appeal will lie to such officer who is senior in rank in the public authority\nto the Public Information Officer who disposed of the request. The appellate\nauthority would vary with each public authority and it is for such purpose that\n<a href=\"/doc/595881/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 7(8)(iii)</a> has been engrafted and assumes more significance than being a\nroutine matter where there is a general appellate forum to receive appeals from\nall disposals of requests.\n\n\n\n      There is a further factor. The expression, &quot;it has been decided&quot;, betrays a\ngeneral acceptance by the public authority (here, the University) of the principle\nthat answerscripts do not fall within the description of information for any\nrequest to obtain them being entertained from an examinee. There is an element\nof intransigent conviction that the refusal conveys: that the matter is closed and\nnot open to any question being entertained. To thereafter subject an examinee to\nthe usual process of appeal and second appeal, however time-bound such steps\nmay have been made under the said Act, would be an exercise in futility in view\nof a decision of the Central Information Commission which, if not binding on the\nultimate appellate forum available to the petitioner, can be seen to be of such\npersuasive value that would render the right of appeal and second appeal,\nmeaningless.\n\n\n\n      The University has referred to the judgments reported at (2007) 2 SCC 112\n(Uttaranchal Forest Development Corporation v. Jabar Singh) and (2003) 6 SCC\n581 (P.K. Rangarajan v. Government of Tamil Nadu) where, according to the\n University, there has been a departure from the Whirlpool principle [(1998) 8 SCC\n1] in the Supreme Court holding that unless exceptional circumstances are made\nout to knock at the High Court doors, without availing the effective alternative\nremedy available a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution should not be\naccepted. In the present case, the petitioner has not even been made aware of the\nappellate authority; he has received an unexceptional order of rejection singularly\nlacking in content, that does not comply with the requirements under <a href=\"/doc/16185/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n7(8)</a> of the Act and, if he is left to work out his alternative remedy, he will, more\nlikely than not, be doomed to fail by reason of the Central Information\nCommission order holding the field. The University has rightly not urged that the\nbar under <a href=\"/doc/1698308/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 23</a> of the said Act would apply to the present proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n      The University has indicated that save the fact that its regulations do not\npermit evaluated answerscripts being opened to examinees, it has no material to\nrely on that would warrant the use of an affidavit. To wit, the University cannot\nsupplement the order of rejection of the request by furnishing reasons that did\nnot find place in the order. The matter has been taken up without any affidavit\nbeing called for, or being insisted upon by the University, to decide the issue in\nprinciple. The fair stand taken by the University in not delaying the matter by\nseeking to unnecessarily use an affidavit should not be taken to be an admission\nof any of the averments in the petition save the matters of record.\n\n\n\n\n      To begin with, the University supports the order of rejection on the ground\nthat the Central Information Commission addressed the same question that falls\nfor consideration here, and by a judgment running into some 24 pages held that\nin regard to public examinations conducted by institutions established by the\nConstitution or institutions established by any enactment which have an\nestablished system and by their own rules prohibit disclosure of evaluated\nanswer-sheets or where such disclosure would result in rendering the system\n unworkable in practice, a citizen cannot seek disclosure of the answer-sheets\nunder the said Act. It is submitted on behalf of the University that it is such\ndecision which has been conveyed to the present examinee by the State Public\nInformation Officer, albeit the letter of rejection not specifically referring thereto\nand the reasons given by the Central Information Commission not being\nforwarded to this examinee. The University asserts that the Central Information\nCommission being a superior authority, its decision is binding on the State\nPublic Information Officer and the letter of rejection did not convey any decision\nimposed on such officer but merely reflected the decision made on contest by the\nCentral Information Commission on April 24, 2007.\n\n\n\n      It is, in effect, the basis of the order made by the Central Information\nCommission that is in question in these proceedings, as to the desirability of\nanswerscripts being made available to examinees upon a request being made for\nobtaining information under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 6</a> of the said Act.\n\n\n\n      The petitioner suggests that there is no jugglery of interpretation that is\ncalled for in the present context. He says that the inclusive definition of\n&quot;information&quot; appearing in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 2(f)</a> of the said Act would accommodate an\nanswerscript within its fold and if the other expressions therein would not admit\nof an answerscript being included, an answerscript would certainly be a record\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/44141683/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 2(i)</a> of the Act. It is urged that the definitions of\nboth &quot;information&quot; and &quot;record&quot; are inclusive and the substantive right in <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\n3</a> of the Act cannot be whittled down by any constrictive reading of what would\namount to information. The relevant provisions need to be noticed to gauge the\nscope of the present exercise:\n       &quot;2.      Definitions. - ...\n\n      (f)   &quot;information&quot; means any material in any form, including records,\n      documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars,\n      orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data\n      material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private\n      body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for\n      the time being in force;&quot;\n            ...\n</pre><pre id=\"pre_2\">      &quot;(i)     &quot;record&quot; includes -\n\n             (i)     any document, manuscript and file;\n\n             (ii)    any microfilm, microfiche and facsimile copy of a document;\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1\">             (iii)   any reproduction of image or images embodied in such\n                     microfilm whether enlarged or not; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">             (iv)    any other material produced by a computer or any other device;&quot;\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;3.    Right to information. - Subject to the provisions of this Act, all\n      citizens shall have the right to information.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">      The petitioner insists that once it is recognised that the definition of\n&quot;information&quot;, which is what is required to be made accessible to a person\nseeking it, is of widest import, no other consideration comes into play. A literal\nconstruction of a provision is the first tool available and only upon such literal\nconstruction running into any difficulty can the other tools of construction and\ninterpretation be brought out.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      More than the petitioner being required to show that he is entitled to\nreceive his answerscript pursuant to a request being made therefor under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n6</a> of the said Act, in keeping with the tenor of the Act it is the public authority\nwhich has been required to justify the denial of the request. Though the provision\nstrictly applies to an appeal, <a href=\"/doc/975984/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 19(5)</a> of the said Act stipulates that in an\n appeal from a decision of the State Public Information Officer, the onus to prove\nthat the denial of the request was justified shall be on the Public Information\nOfficer who denied the request.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">      The University urges that an answerscript of an examinee cannot be\ninformation within the meaning of the Act that the examinee can seek by way of a\nrequest under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 6</a>. The University says that the examinee is expected to be\naware of the paper he wrote and he cannot seek inspection of the document that\nhe submitted as the contents thereof would not be unknown to him. The real\npurpose, the University alleges, is to find out how the paper was evaluated and it\nis beyond question that an examinee cannot be involved in the process of\nevaluation of his examination. At the highest, says the University, an examinee is\nentitled to information as to the marks allotted to the examinee in respect of\nevery question that the examinee had answered; and such information the\nUniversity is agreeable to make over without the University being required to\nfurnish the corrected answerscript. The fundamental basis of the University&#x27;s\nargument is that it accepts that it is liable to give a break-up of the marks\nawarded to an examinee, but it should not be compelled to make over the\ncorrected answerscript to an examinee under the said Act.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">      The University seeks to address the larger question of what it is that the\nexaminee ultimately seeks. According to the University, the petition suggests that\nthe examinee is disappointed with the marks he obtained, whether it be\ndisappointment at the petitioner&#x27;s own shortcoming or a grievance as to the\nmanner of assessment. The University argues that since the petitioner ought to\nbe aware of how he answered each question, he should be satisfied with\ninformation being supplied under the said Act as to the marks allotted to each\nanswer, rather than the entire answerscript being opened to inspection.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">       The point that the University makes is that the additional material that the\nanswerscript takes is the marking and assessment, and as long as the individual\nmarks are disclosed, an examinee can have no need for any further information.\nAs a corollary, it is submitted on behalf of the University that individual\nexaminers have their peculiarities and way of putting pen on the answerscript in\ncourse of evaluation thereof. There cannot be a standard guideline given by a\nBoard or University nor would the individual idiosyncrasies permit such a rigid\nguideline being met. It is equally possible as the University says that one\nexaminer may go through an entire question without betraying any impression\nreflected in any sign, except for assigning the marks therefor, while another may\nunderline here and encircle there, put a tick mark against a point that appeals or\na cross against something that the examiner finds disagreeable. The University\nsays that it would vary from one individual examiner to another even in respect\nof answerscripts relating to the same question paper and, in the absence of any\nacceptable norms in that regard, the possible expression of an examiner&#x27;s\nimpression reflected in his etchings on an answerscript can be of no interest to\nan examinee and will certainly not be information that a citizen can seek under\n<a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 6</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      If a principle is to be decided, the University suggests, then all possible\nsituations that could arise have to be taken into consideration. If it is not\nnecessary that an examiner points out what is correct in one part of an answer\nand what is incorrect in another part; that a particular examiner chooses to\nexpress his process of evaluation when another may not, would not show the one\nexaminer in poor light for being too demanding or the other in equally poor light\nfor his apparent indifference. There is merit in the point. If there are no rules as\nto how an examiner is to put his pen to the paper that he assesses, that one is\ngenerous with his ink and the other is not, is of no consequence. And, in the\nabsence of any rules, the nature of etchings by an examiner on the paper is no\ninformation for want of a sequitur.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">       It is equally true that some answerscripts have to be left unmarked by rule.\nAn example of this kind would be in case of a thesis or dissertation which\nordinarily is evaluated by more than one examiner, and sometimes by an external\nexaminer. The paper is required to be left in the form it is received so that any\netchings left on an evaluated paper - albeit the marks awarded not being\nindicated - do not influence the subsequent assessor. But this discussion is\nslightly removed from the right that the petitioner asserts under a statute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      The University claims that in making answerscripts available to examinees,\nit would be exposing its examiners who the University ought to protect. It is a\npoint which is noticed in the Central Information Commission order of April 24,\n2007 and one that, in the ultimate analysis, did not count with the Commission.\nAgain, the duty to protect that the University asserts has to be tested against the\nright of a citizen that the said Act ordains.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">      It is the next point that the University makes is one that weighed with the\nCentral Information Commission. The University says that it is one of the\nprimary functions of any University or educational institution to conduct\nexaminations and assess answerscripts. It is human nature for every candidate\nto think that his best endeavour reflected in his paper merited more than the\nmarks ultimately allotted, be he the first-placed in the examination or a failed\nstudent. If answerscripts were made available to each examinee, argues the\nUniversity, it would open a floodgate of requests and lead to an unworkable\nsituation and an undesirable lack of finality and timeliness upon the possible\nprotests for half marks being missed out here and there.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">      The last substantial ground urged by the University is one under <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n8(1)(b)</a> of the said Act which provides that there shall be no obligation to furnish\nany information which has been expressly forbidden to be published by any court\n of law or tribunal or the disclosure of which may constitute contempt of court.\nThe University argues that in the many pronouncements of the Supreme Court,\nthere are observations that answerscripts should ordinarily not be made\navailable to examinees and observations to the effect that examinees cannot be\nassociated with the process of evaluation of their answerscripts. The University\nsays that such judgments of the Supreme Court have, in any event, binding\neffect on all courts under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">      The parties have referred to several judgments on propositions ranging\nfrom the need to have an informed citizenry, to the desirability of answerscripts\nbeing called up by courts for assessment and examinees being given the slightest\nsay in the process of the evaluation of their papers.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_1\">While the petitioner refers to the judgment reported at (1995) 2 SCC 161\n(<a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_26\">Secy., Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting v. Cricket Association of Bengal</a>) to\nemphasise the virtues of information percolating to the least privileged citizen\nand the recognition therein of the liberty of circulation and the liberty of\npublication being adjuncts to the freedom of speech and expression, the\nUniversity cautions against the principle being twisted out of context to render\nthe said Act unworkable by making as exacting a demand for all answerscripts to\nbe potentially made available to all examinees.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"245892\" id=\"span_2\">So that the exercise here may remain on track and not fall prey to passion\nor populism or stray into any disagreeable bylane of adventurism, the University\nreminds of the fundamental principles of construction: of the grammatical\nmeaning having necessarily to be harnessed in the context of the purpose of the\nlegislation. AIR 1955 SC 830 (<a href=\"/doc/245892/\" id=\"a_27\">Tirath Singh v. Bachittar Singh</a> &amp; ors.) is placed for\nits enunciation of law in the following passage at paragraph 7 of the report:</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">       &quot;7.    ... It is argued that if the language of the enactment is interpreted in\n      its literal and grammatical sense, there could be no escape from the\n      conclusion that parties to the petition are also entitled to notice under the\n      proviso. But it is a rule of interpretation well-established that, &quot;Where the\n      language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical\n      construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of\n      the enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or\n      injustice, presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it\n      which modifies the meaning of the words, and even the structure of the\n      sentence.&quot; (Maxwell&#x27;s Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed., page 229).\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1031512\" id=\"span_3\">The judgment reported at AIR 1963 SC 1207 (M/s. <a href=\"/doc/1031512/\" id=\"a_28\">New India Sugar Mills\nLtd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar</a>) is relied on to show that in every case it\nis the object of the legislation which has to be assessed and the wider or the\nnarrower, or even the apparently improbable, construction arrived at in harmony\nwith the avowed intent of the enactment. The principle laid down at paragraph 8\nof the report is emphasised:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"311809\" id=\"span_4\">&quot;8.    ... Attributing a literal meaning to the words used would amount to\n      imputing to the Legislature an intention deliberately to transgress the\n      restrictions imposed by the <a href=\"/doc/237570/\" id=\"a_29\">Constitution Act</a> upon the Provincial Legislative\n      authority. It is a recognised rule of interpretation of statutes that the\n      expressions used therein should ordinarily be understood in a sense in\n      which they best harmonise with the object of the statute, and which\n      effectuate the object of the Legislature. If an expression is susceptible of a\n      narrow or technical meaning, as well as a popular meaning the Court\n      would be justified in assuming that the Legislature used the expression in\n      the sense which would carry out its object and reject that which renders\n      the exercise of its powers invalid. If the narrow and technical concept of\n      sale is discarded and it be assumed that the Legislature sought to use the\n      expression sale in a wider sense as including transactions in which\n      property was transferred for consideration from one person to another\n      without any previous contract of sale, it would be attributing to the\n      Legislature an intention to enact legislation beyond its competence. In\n      interpreting a statute the Court cannot ignore its aim and object. ...&quot;\n       In the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/311809/\" id=\"a_30\">State of H.P. v. Kailash Chand Mahajan</a> reported at 1992\nSupp (2) SCC 351, the Supreme Court quoted with approval from Francis\nBennion&#x27;s Statutory Interpretation (1984 Ed.) as to the distinction between the\npurpose or object of an enactment and the legislative intention governing it. The\nformer relates to the mischief to which the enactment is directed and its remedy,\nwhile the latter relates to the legal meaning of the enactment. Paragraph 82 of\nthe report is the essence of the judgment:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      &quot;82. Thus there is a great distinction between the two. While the object of\n      legislation is to provide a remedy for the malady, on the contrary, the\n      legislative intention relates to the meaning from the exposition of the\n      remedy as enacted. For determining the purpose of legislation, indeed, it is\n      permissible to look into the circumstances which were prevalent at that\n      time when the law was enacted and which necessitated the passing of that\n      enactment. For the limited purpose of appreciating the background and the\n      antecedent factual matrix leading to the legislation it is open to the court to\n      look into the statement of &#x27;Objects and Reasons&#x27; of the Bill which\n      accentuated the statement to provide a remedy for the then existing\n      malady. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"603736\" id=\"span_5\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/603736/\" id=\"a_31\">State of W.B. v. Union of India</a>, this Court ruled that\n      the &#x27;Statement of Objects and Reasons&#x27; accompanying a Bill when\n      introduced in Parliament can be used for the limited purpose of\n      understanding the background and state of affairs leading up to the\n      legislation.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1149874\" id=\"span_6\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1149874/\" id=\"a_32\">Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance &amp;\nInvestment Company Limited</a> reported at (1987) 1 SCC 424, the fundamentals of\ncontextual interpretation have been emphasised. It is both the reason for the\nstatute and the text of the statute that have to be seen while assessing its scope.\nAt paragraph 33 of the report, the Supreme Court held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      &quot;33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the\n      bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context\n      is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That\n      interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the\n      contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted.\n       With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then\n      section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If\n      a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of\n      the statute-maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections,\n      clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than\n      when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context.\n      With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what\n      each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and\n      designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a\n      statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes\n      have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its\n      place.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">      The petitioner relies on passages from Maxwell&#x27;s Interpretation of Statutes\n(12th Ed.) to assert that there is no reason why a request for inspection of an\nanswerscript should be declined when a plain reading of the definition of\n&quot;information&quot; and &quot;record&quot; would permit answerscripts to form part of\ninformation and being a record within the meaning of the Act. The petitioner says\nthat to hold that answerscripts would not fall within &quot;information&quot; or &quot;record&quot;\nwould entail a construction which would leave without effect a part of the\nlanguage of the statute and would, thus, be impermissible. The following\npassages from Maxwell have been relied upon:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            &quot;It is a corollary to the general rule of literal construction that\n      nothing is to be added to or taken from a statute unless there are adequate\n      grounds to justify the inference that the legislature intended something\n      which it omitted to express.&quot; (Page 33)\n\n            &quot;In dealing with matters relating to the general public, statutes are\n      presumed to use words in their popular, rather than their narrowly legal or\n      technical sense: &quot;Loquitur ut vulgus, that is, according to the common\n      understanding and acceptation of the terms.&quot; If an &quot;Act is directed to\n      dealing with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used have the\n      meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of language.&quot; &quot;I\n      do not think,&quot; said Diplock L.J., &quot;that anywhere, except in a court of law, it\n      would be argued with gravity that a Dutch barn or grain and fodder stores\n      or any ordinary farm buildings are properly described as repositories. A\n      Gloucestershire farmer would say they were farm buildings and would\n       laugh at their being called &#x27;repositories.&#x27; &quot; In the same spirit, Stamp J.\n      rejected the argument that the carrying on of the business of a\n      crematorium involved the &quot;subjection of goods or materials to any process&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">      within <a href=\"/doc/144487481/\" id=\"a_33\">section 271(1)(c)</a> of the Income Tax Act 1952 as &quot;a distortion of the\n      English language.... I protest against subjecting the English language, and\n      more particularly a simple English phrase, to this kind of process of\n      philology and semasiology.&quot; (Pages 81-82)\n\n\n\n      The decision next relied upon by the University - one closer to home in the\npresent context of examinations - is reported at (1984) 4 SCC 27 (Maharashtra\nState Board of S.H.S.E. v.

The opening lines\nof the judgment catch the spirit of insatiable expectations of a candidate from his\nanswerscript, as if in a dream it would conjure more worthy answers and better\nmarks than what the author scripted. The significance which the University\nattaches to this judgment requires the context of the judgment to be appreciated\nin detail.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">      Two clauses of a regulation of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary\nand Higher Secondary Education fell for consideration. The first clause provided\nthat a candidate who had appeared at the Higher Secondary Certificate\nexamination could apply for verification of marks in any particular subject\nwhereupon the verification would be restricted to checking whether all the\nanswers had been examined and that there was no mistake in totaling the marks\nand transcribing the marks correctly. The clause stipulated that there could be\nno evaluation of the answerbook. The other clause spelt out that no candidate\ncould claim, or be entitled to re-evaluation of his answers or disclosure or\ninspection of the answerbook or other documents as those were treated as most\nconfidential.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">       Before the Bombay High Court the writ petitioner in that case challenged\nthe two clauses on three grounds: that the impugned clauses were violative of the\nprinciples of natural justice; that both clauses were ultra vires and void on the\nground of their being in excess of the regulation-making powers of the Board\nconferred under statute; and, that the provisions were highly unreasonable. The\nBombay High Court did not accept the challenge on the ground of the clauses\nbeing in violation of the principles of natural justice. The related argument that\nevery adverse verification resulted in a condemnation of the examinee behind the\nexaminee&#x27;s back did not also find favour with the High Court. In affirming the\nHigh Court view repelling the challenge on the ground of violation of the\nprinciples of natural justice, the Supreme Court opined at paragraph 12:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"714743\" id=\"span_7\">&quot;12. ... The principles of natural justice cannot be extended beyond\n      reasonable and rational limits and cannot be carried to such absurd\n      lengths as to make it necessary that candidates who have taken a public\n      examination should be allowed to participate in the process of evaluation of\n      their performances or to verify the correctness of the evaluation made by\n      the examiners by themselves conducting an inspection of the answer books\n      and determining whether there has been a proper and fair valuation of the\n      answers by the examiners. As succinctly put by Mathew, J. in his\n      judgment in the <a href=\"/doc/714743/\" id=\"a_36\">Union of India v. Mohan Lal Kapoor</a> it is not expedient to\n      extend the horizon of natural justice involved in the audi alteram partem\n      rule to the twilight zone of mere expectations, however great they might be.\n      [SCC para 56, p. 863: SCC (L&amp;S) p. 31]. The challenge levelled against the\n      validity of clause (3) of Regulation 104 based on the plea of violation of\n      natural justice, was therefore, rightly rejected by the High Court.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">The Supreme Court also rejected the other challenges to the impugned clauses,\nwhich had been accepted by the High Court, for reasons that are not relevant for\nthe present purpose.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"845543\" id=\"span_8\">The University refers to a judgment reported at (2007) 1 SCC 603\n(<a href=\"/doc/845543/\" id=\"a_37\">President, Board of Secondary Education v.

Paritosh Bhupeshkurmar Sheth</a>, it is in the public interest\n      that the results of public examinations when published should have some\n      finality attached to them. If inspection, verification in the presence of the\n      candidates and re-evaluation are to be allowed as of right, it may lead to\n      gross and indefinite uncertainty, particularly in regard to the relative\n      ranking, etc. of the candidates, besides leading to utter confusion on\n      account of the enormity of the labour and time involved in the process. The\n      court should be extremely reluctant to substitute its own views as to what\n      is wise, prudent and proper in relation to academic matters in preference\n      to those formulated by professional men possessing technical expertise and\n      rich experience of actual day-to-day working of educational institutions\n      and the departments controlling them. It would be wholly wrong for the\n      court to make a pedantic and purely idealistic approach to the problems of\n      this nature, isolated from the actual realities and grass root problems\n      involved in the working of the system and unmindful of the consequences\n      which would emanate if a purely idealistic view as opposed to pragmatic\n      one was to be propounded.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1271785\" id=\"span_10\">In a recent judgment reported at (2007) 8 SCC 242 (<a href=\"/doc/1271785/\" id=\"a_39\">Secy., WB Council of\nHigher Secondary Education v.

A student filed a writ petition seeking a direction on the\nHigher Secondary Council to produce his answerscripts in several papers. The\nanswerscripts were required to be produced upon a deposit being made. Counsel\nfor the writ petitioner was permitted to inspect the answerscripts and the council\nwas directed to issue a fresh mark-sheet incorporating additional marks to the\nexaminee. A Single Judge of this Court directed that one of the papers be\n reassessed by another examiner. In appeal the council argued that no specific\nerror in assessment was pointed out by the writ petitioner and there was no\nprovision in any statute permitting inspection of the answerscript. The appeal\nfailed. The Supreme Court granted special leave to appeal and, allowing the\nappeal, held:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      &quot;10.

For example, in certain cases examining body can provide model\n      answers to the questions. In such cases the examinees satisfy the court\n      that model answer is different from what has been adopted by the Board.\n      Then only can the court ask for the production of answer scripts to allow\n      inspection of the answer scripts by the examinee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1271785\" id=\"span_11\"><a href=\"/doc/1271785/\" id=\"a_41\">The Ayan Das</a> case, and the Supreme Court accepting the appellant&#x27;s\nargument therein that there was no provision in any statute permitting an\nexaminee to inspect his answerscripts, is sought to be used by the University as\nits principal ammunition for its submission that the request made by the\npetitioner herein could not be entertained in view of <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 8(1)(b)</a> of the said\nAct.

The petitioner <a href=\"/doc/570038/\" id=\"a_46\">in that case</a>\nsurrendered before the police authorities on May 12, 2006 and was taken in\ncustody.

The Public Information\nOfficer sought opinion from the general administration of the hospital as to the\npropriety of the request made under the said Act. The Public Information Officer\nreceived a reply that since the said Act was a Central Act any clarification on any\ndoubt as to interpretation would have to be sought from the Central Government.\nThe general administration of the hospital addressed a letter to the writ petitioner\nthat information about the petitioner&#x27;s hospitalisation had been sought and\nrequired the petitioner to respond to such notice.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">      As the Public Information Officer did not furnish the necessary information\nwithin the time stipulated, the citizen who made the request preferred an appeal\nwhich was rejected on the technical ground that the appeal papers were not\nsigned by the would-be appellant. The citizen preferred another appeal under\n<a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 19(1)</a> of the Act which was rejected, following which he preferred a\n second appeal. The second appeal was allowed and the Public Information Officer\nof the hospital was directed to furnish the information as sought by the citizen.\nThe writ petitioner thereafter submitted a letter to the Dean of the hospital with a\nrequest that the information relating to his hospitalisation should not be\ndisclosed and sought a copies of the request made by the citizen and the order\npassed in the second appeal.

Paragraphs 10, 13 and 15 of the report are apposite:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;10. The question that we are really called upon to answer is the right of\n      an individual, to keep certain matters confidential on the one hand and the\n      right of the public to be informed on the other, considering the provisions\n      of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_50\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             In the instant case on facts we are dealing with the issue of to (sic, a)\n      person convicted for Contempt of Court. Do (sic, Can) such a person during\n      the period of incarceration, claim privilege or confidentially in respect of the\n      medical records maintained by a public authority. The contention of the\n      respondent No. 5 is that the larger public interest requires that this\n      information be disclosed, as persons in high office or high positions or the\n      like, in order to avoid serving their term in Jail/prison or orders of\n      detention or remand to police custody or judicial remand with the\n      connivance of officials get themselves admitted into hospitals. The public,\n      therefore, it is submitted, has a right to know, as to whether such a person\n      was genuinely admitted or admitted to avoid punishment/custody and\n      thus defeat judicial orders. The public&#x27;s right in such case, it is submitted,\n      must prevail over the private interest of such third person. The Court must\n      bear in mind the object of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_51\">Right to Information Act</a> which is to make\n      the public authorities accountable and their actions open. The contention\n      that the information may be misused is of no consequence, as Parliament\n      wherever it has chosen to deny such information has so specifically\n      provided. As an illustration our attention is invited to <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 8</a> which\n      provides for exemption from disclosure of information.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> &quot;13. The right to privacy now forms a part of right to life. It would,\ntherefore, be apparent on a reading of Regulations 2.2 and 7.14 framed\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_53\">Medical Council of India Act</a> that information about a patient in\nrespect of his ailment normally cannot be disclosed because of the\nRegulations, which is subordinate legislation except where the Regulation\nprovides for. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_54\">The Right to Information Act</a>, is an enactment by Parliament\nand the provisions contained in the enactment must, therefore, prevail over\nan exercise in subordinate legislation, if there be a conflict between the\ntwo. The exception from disclosure of information as contained in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 8</a>\nhas some important aspects. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> provides that personal\ninformation the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public\nactivity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the\nprivacy of the individual shall not be disclosed unless the Central Public\nInformation Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate\nAuthority is satisfied, that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure\nof such information. In other words, if the information be personal or\nwould amount to invasion of privacy of the individual, what the concerned\nPublic Information Officer has to satisfy is whether the larger public\ninterest justifies the disclosure. In our opinion, the Regulations framed\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_57\">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, will have to be read with <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_58\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> of the Right to Information Act. So read it is within the competence of\nthe concerned Public Information Officer to disclose the information in\nlarger public interest or where Parliament or State Legislature could not be\ndenied the information.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;15. The question then is what is the true import of the proviso, which\nsets out that the information which cannot be denied to Parliament or a\nState Legislature shall not be denied to any person. Are the medical\nrecords maintained of a patient in a public hospital covered by the\nprovisions of the Act. Can this information be withheld to either Parliament\nor State Legislature as the case may be on the ground that such\ninformation is confidential. To our mind generally such information\nnormally cannot be denied to Parliament or the State Legislature unless\nthe person who opposes the release of the information makes out a case\nthat such information is not available to Parliament or the State Legislation\nunder the Act. By its very constitution and the plenary powers which the\nLegislature enjoys, such information cannot be denied to Parliament or\nState Legislature by any public authority. As the preamble notes, the Act is\nto provide for setting out a practical regime of right to information for\ncitizens, to secure access to information under the control of public\nauthorities as also to promote transparency and accountability in the\nworking of every public authority. These objects of the legislature are to\nmake our society more open and public authorities more accountable.\nNormally, therefore, all such information must be made readily available to\na citizen subject to right of privacy and that information having no\n       relationship to any public authority or entity. In the instant case the\n      respondent No. 2 while granting the application of respondent No. 5, has\n      given as reasons larger public interest and as that the information could\n      not be withheld from Parliament or State Legislature. The learned Associate\n      Advocate General informed us that the State Assembly has not framed any\n      Rules in the matter of receiving information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">            The test always in such matter is between private rights of a citizen\n      and the right of third person to be informed. The third person need not give\n      any reason for his information. Considering that, we must hold that the\n      object of the Act, leans in favour of making available the records in the\n      custody or control of the public authorities.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">      Despite the acknowledgment that disclosure of information, even to a third\nparty, was the rule, the writ petitioner legislator succeeded in dislodging the\norder passed in the citizen&#x27;s second appeal on the ground that the second\nappellate authority did not afford the recuperating legislator a chance to present\nhis case. A citizen&#x27;s right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution as enlarged by the\nsaid Act came up short against another citizen&#x27;s claim to privacy protected by\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, at least in the recognition that the two had to be\npitted more fairly against each other before a call could be taken. The man in\npublic life was afforded an opportunity to canvass that the state of his health and\nthe reports as to the condition of his heart were matters he was entitled to keep\nclose to his chest without every passing citizen and his neighbour being offered a\npeek into them.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99199\" id=\"span_13\">Though the Bombay judgment was rendered in a different context and the\nright to privacy was recognised as a facet of the right to life, it is the sanctity\nattached to the provisions of the said Act which is of importance. The Bombay\nHigh Court concluded that the object of the said Act is to make public authorities\naccountable and their actions open. That information obtained may be misused\nis considered to be of no consequence. A judgment reported at AIR 2007 Gujarat\n203 (<a href=\"/doc/99199/\" id=\"a_61\">Reliance Industries Ltd. v.

My thesis is that while applying the policy of\n      statutory construction we should not forget the conditions and concepts\n      which moved the judges whose rulings are cited, nor be obsessed by\n      respect at the expense of reason.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"40806\" id=\"span_16\">The petitioner also suggests that the argument made by the University and\none that found favour in the judgment of the Central Information Commission as\nto the opening of a floodgate if answerscripts were found to be liable to be\nproduced under the said Act, should be disregarded. Paragraph 19 of the\njudgment reported at (2007) 9 SCC 625 (<a href=\"/doc/40806/\" id=\"a_69\">Coal India Ltd. v.

In addressing a question whether answerscripts should be furnished\nfollowing a request to obtain information made under the said Act, the\n Commission framed two main questions. The first was as to whether the\ndisclosure of evaluated answerscripts was exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the\nsaid Act; and the second as to whether such disclosure was exempted under\n<a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> exempts the disclosure of any\ninformation available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the\ncompetent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the\ndisclosure of such information. <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> exempts the disclosure of any\ninformation which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or\nidentify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law\nenforcement or security purposes.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">      In dealing with such questions, the Commission noticed the argument\nmade on behalf of the public authorities before it that an examining body is\nobliged to not disclose the identity of the examiners as such disclosure would be\nin breach of the fiduciary duty said to be owed by the examining body to the\nexaminers. The connected argument was also noticed, that upon the identity of\nthe examiners being revealed their lives and physical safety may be at risk. It is\nnot necessary to go into the reasons as to why the Commission found that\nneither <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> exempted disclosure of the evaluated\nanswerscripts as the Commission held that only the disclosure as to the identity\nof the examiners was exempted. It is the argument as to the unworkability of the\nright to inspect answerscripts that ultimately weighed with the Commission. In\nthe words of the Commission,\n\n\n\n            &quot;... it is a matter of common knowledge that the parents and the\n      students are never satisfied with their assessment. Every University and\n      Board has a mechanism for re-evaluation which can be made use of by\n      those who have genuine apprehensions about the fairness of the system.\n      The disclosure, therefore, of the evaluated answer sheets may be taken\n      recourse in rare cases but it cannot have an en-bono application, unless\n      the University or the Board as the case may be introduces a system where\n       the giving back of the evaluated answer sheets becomes or is made a\n      regular practice, which this Commission hereby recommends.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845543\" id=\"span_19\">The Commission thereafter noticed the Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth case,\na Constitution Bench judgment in Fateh Chand Himmatlal v. State of\nMaharashtra reported at (<a href=\"/doc/845543/\" id=\"a_78\">1977) 2 SCC 670 and the Suvankar</a> case to conclude\nthat the Supreme Court pronouncements negating an examinee&#x27;s right to\ndemand disclosure and personal inspection of his answerscript, were based on\nlarger public interest which the Commission also found to be the basis of the\nsaid Act. The Commission thereafter proceeded to make a distinction between\npublic examinations conducted by institutions established by the Constitution or\nby any enactment like the Union Public Service Commission or Universities or\nthe Central Board of Secondary Education and examinations conducted by other\npublic authorities whose principal function is not of conducting examinations but\nwho hold examinations for filling up posts either by promotion or by recruitment.\nThe   Commission    held   that   for   public   authorities   designed   to   conduct\nexaminations, a citizen cannot seek disclosure of the evaluated answerscript\nunder the said Act. But for other public authorities incidentally conducting\nexaminations, &quot;the disclosure of the answer sheets shall be the general rule but\neach case may have to be examined individually to see as to whether disclosure\nof evaluated answer sheets would render the system unworkable in practice.&quot; The\nCommission added a rider to the case of public authorities incidentally\nconducting examinations: the identity of the examiner, supervisor or other\nperson associated with the process of examination should not be disclosed so as\nto endanger their lives or physical safety, and if it was not possible to make over\nthe information without concealing the identities of the connected persons, the\npublic authority could decline the disclosure of the evaluated answerscripts\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the said Act. In case of departmental examinees, the\nCommission took a view that disclosure of proceedings and disclosure of\nanswerscripts, not only of the examinees but also of other candidates, was\n necessary to bring in fairness and neutrality for the system to be more\ntransparent and accountable.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">      In effect, the Commission discovered an exemption not expressly provided\nfor in the statute to deny information despite accepting that the words used in\nthe said Act could not be read to be a bar to the right asserted thereunder. But,\nmore on the Commission&#x27;s opinion later.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">      In its long title the said Act proclaims to set about a practical regime of\nright to information for citizens. The preamble opens with a reference to the\nConstitution having established a democratic republic and the need, therefore,\nfor an informed citizenry. The preamble reveals that the legislature was mindful\nof the likely conflict between revelation of information and efficient operation of\nthe governments; of optimum use of resources; and, most significantly, the need\nto preserve the paramount virtue of the democratic ideal:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">           &quot;Whereas the Constitution of India has established democratic\n      Republic;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">            And whereas democracy requires an informed citizenry and\n      transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to\n      contain corruption and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities\n      accountable to the governed;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">             And whereas revelation of information in actual practice is likely to\n      conflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the\n      Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation\n      of confidentiality of sensitive information;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">            And whereas it is necessary to harmonise these conflicting interests\n      while preserving the paramouncy of the democratic ideal;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">            Now, therefore, it is expedient to provide for furnishing certain\n      information to citizens who desire to have it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">      If it is the preamble that has to be looked into for the reason for, or the\nspirit of, the statute as a key to open the minds of the makers of the Act and the\n mischief they intended to redress, the makers appear to have been alive to the\nlikely difficulties of the executive to live up to the Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">      The said Act is arranged in six chapters containing 31 sections and has\ntwo schedules appended to it. The first, preliminary chapter contains the short\ntitle, extent and commencement section and the definitions. The second chapter\nspells out the right to information and the obligations of public authorities. There\nis the essence of the enactment in its third section. The next eight sections in the\nsecond chapter provide for the duties of public authorities and of Public\nInformation Officers; the procedure for receipt and disposal of requests for\nobtaining information; the limited exemptions from disclosure; the severability of\nthat part of the information that is exempt from disclosure from the other part\nthat is not; and third party information. Chapter III spread over <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_80\">Sections 12</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1718242/\" id=\"a_81\">14</a>\nrelates to the constitution, terms of office and removal of the Central Information\nCommission and its officers. Chapter IV is the mirror-image of the previous\nchapter and governs the State Information Commissions. Chapter V lays down\nthe powers and functions of the Information Commissions, appeal provisions and\npenalties covering <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_82\">Sections 18</a> through 20. The miscellaneous final chapter\ncontains eleven sections, including <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 22</a> that provides that the said Act\nwould have overriding effect; <a href=\"/doc/1698308/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 23</a> that bars jurisdiction of courts; <a href=\"/doc/1767825/\" id=\"a_85\">Section\n24</a> that provides that the Act would not apply to certain organisations; the\ntransitional provision of the power to remove difficulties in <a href=\"/doc/556189/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 30</a>; and the\nrepeal of the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_87\">Freedom of Information Act, 2002</a> in <a href=\"/doc/1443302/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 31</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">      At the heart of the said Act is <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 3</a>, which includes the world that is\napparently left unsaid in it. Every previous word in the statute builds up to an\nabsolute right to know and each word following the section cements the right\namid the sundry exemptions to its exercise, the manner of attainment of the right\n and the body of procedure set up therefor. Through every pore of its 31 sections,\nthe Act celebrates the spirit of knowledge.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">      Knowledge is the plinth on which a polity is built and which it draws from\nfor its sustenance. Access to information is at the foundation of a democracy, for\nwhat is a choice if it is uninformed. Education is part of the process of\nempowerment that the Constitution mandates the State to strive for. The freedom\nof speech and expression that the Constitution guarantees unto all citizens is\nconsiderably larger than the words used in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> The promise held out\nin <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 38</a> is for a social order to be brought in, in which justice, social,\neconomic and political shall inform all the institutions of national life. The State,\nthe Constitution directs, shall strive to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities\nand opportunities.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">      From the first days of its taking upon the burden of balancing, the\nSupreme Court has read a world into what is expressly recognised in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_92\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. Beginning the judgment in the Romesh Thappar case\n(1950 SCR 594), delivered some four months into the constitutional era, the\nSupreme Court found the freedom of discussion to be included in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\nand the freedom of press to be an aspect of the freedom of discussion so that\nmembers of a democratic society should be sufficiently informed to &quot;be able to\nform their own beliefs and communicate them freely, ... the fundamental\nprinciple ... is the people&#x27;s right to know&quot;.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_20\">This right to know has been seen to be at the base of the democratic\nprocess and in the cases of Sakal Papers (P) Ltd.

Be it the case of a magazine being\nbanned in a locality or in quality newsprint being made more difficult to obtain or\n in government advertisements being released in more favoured publications,\ncourts have discerned in several executive actions an attempt to stifle the press;\nand unmuzzled the right of expression on the touchstone of the larger societal\ninterest to inform and to be kept informed. It is now beyond question that the\ncommunity has a right to be supplied with information; and the government has\na duty to educate the people within the limits of its resources (Bennett Coleman).\nSuch right and the corresponding obligation is found in <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 41</a> of the\nConstitution.

Inspection of the rate was refused to one of the\nchurchwardens who was also an inhabitant of the parish. It was held that since\nthe object of the Act was to protect such inhabitants who had previously no\naccess to the rates, the meaning of the term &quot;inhabitants&quot; was limited and not\napplied to the complaining churchwarden as he had previous access to the rates\n(Wethered v. Calcutt, (1842) 4 Man. &amp; G. 566).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">      The word &quot;piracy&quot; was given an unusual meaning in the context of a\nstatute that was passed to give the executive powers for effecting a treaty of 1842\nbetween Britain and the United States, that provided that either state would, on\nthe requisition of the other, deliver up to justice all persons charged with murder,\npiracy or other specified crimes committed within the jurisdiction of either state.\nThe Court of the Queen&#x27;s Bench held that the word &quot;piracy&quot; was confined to\nthose acts which were declared piracy by the municipal law of either country,\nsuch as slave-trading, but did not include such other acts which amounted to\n piracy in the primary sense of the word, that is, jure gentium (Re Ternan, (1864)\n33 L.J.M.C. 201).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      Right to information jure gentium has to be understood on the communis\nopinio, that is the evidence of what the law is, on the basis of how courts have\ninterpreted the right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. As the said Act is of\nrecent vintage, the principle of contemporanea expositio is not available for the\nopinion   of   the   Central   Information   Commission,   to   the   extent   of   its\nunderstanding that there is no express bar in the said Act to answerscripts being\notherwise made available, to be relied upon. Yet such Commission is a body that\ndeals with matters under the said Act and reads the words of the statute on a\nregular basis to direct or refuse the disclosure of information. The Commission\nanswered the two questions directly raised on the provisions of the said Act\nagainst the public authorities and yet found the hardship factor - call it\ninconvenience or unworkability - which is not expressly included in the statute\nas a ground for exemption, to be standing in the way of the answerscripts being\nmade available to their authors. But though the examinees failed before the\nCentral Information Commission there is a pious wish recorded in the order for\ntheir benefit, recommending making over of answerscripts to examinees upon a\nregular procedure being set down in that regard.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      On a plain reading of the right amplified under the said Act, the question\nthat it ought to stimulate upon a request being received is not why, but why not.\nIf information has to be supplied unless it is exempted, the reason for refusal has\nto be found in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 8</a> or not at all.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      Since three of the ten clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 8(1)</a> of the said Act have already\nbeen referred to, the other seven may be seen. Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 8</a> deals with information that would compromise the sovereignty or\n integrity of the country and like matter; clause (c) covers such matters which\nwould cause a breach of privilege of the Parliament or the State Legislatures;\nclause (d) protects information of commercial nature and trade secrets and their\nilk; clause (f) prevents information being disseminated if it is received in\nconfidence from any foreign government; clause (h) bars access to such\ninformation which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or\nprosecution of offenders; clause (i) forbids records and papers relating to\ndeliberations of ministers and officers of the executive being made available,\nsubject to a proviso; and, clause (j) prohibits disclosure of personal information\nunless there is an element of public interest involved. The proviso at the foot of\nclause (j) appears to cover the entirety of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 8(1)</a>, notwithstanding the view\ntaken by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. The manner in which the\nexceptions to the rule have been carved out in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 8</a> and the proviso which\nappears to govern all the cases covered by <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 8(1)</a> of the said Act, makes the\nexemption section exhaustive.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"608874\" id=\"span_26\">Construction of a statute on the grounds of hardship or inconvenience or\ninjustice or absurdity or anomaly arises if the statute presents a choice. The said\nAct does not appear to present one. For the rule of mischief to come into play\nthere have to be material words that are capable of bearing two or more\nconstructions. The rule of purposive construction or the mischief rule as\nenunciated in the Heydon case has been accepted by the Supreme Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/608874/\" id=\"a_119\">Bengal Immunity Co.

What was the common law before the making of the Act.,\n         2nd. What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did\n         not provide.,\n          3rd. What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure\n         the disease of the Commonwealth., and\n         4th. The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the Judges\n         is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief,\n         and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and\n         evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro privato commodo, and\n         to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent\n         of the makers of the Act, pro bona publico.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">      Even if the Heydon questions were to arise in the present case, the answers\nto them would not permit the disclosure of answerscripts being resisted. There is\nno discernible change of law attempted by the said Act, it has fuelled the\nburgeoning aspiration of a people for a transparent governance. If there is any\nmischief that the said Act seeks to address, it is to make the right guaranteed by\nthe Constitution more explicit. The remedy that the Parliament has prescribed is\nto cure the malaise of clandestine, cloak-and-dagger functioning of any public\nauthority. The true reason of the remedy is to ensure a level playing field.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      If then there is hardship in its implementation or in the fructification of the\naspirations recognised therein, it is not for the Court to rein in the desirable\ncuriosity that the Act has unleashed, but for other measures to be adopted to\npave the way for its operation. If the Central Information Commission could have\nrecognised the spirit of the Act to have recommended the return of answerscripts\nto examinees, that there is an immediate hardship or harsh consequence is of no\nrelevance.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">      <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_120\">The Act</a> provides a right to receive information and the consequence of the\nmaking over of such information is immaterial in the matter of construction of its\nprovisions. As to whether an examinee would use the information received on\ninspection of his answerscript to undo the finality of the process of examination\nis not an argument that can be considered to curb the operation of the statute.\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_121\">The Act</a> begins with a citizen&#x27;s right to obtain information and ends with the\n information being made available to him or his request being justly rejected on\nthe grounds recognised by the Act; what happens before and what may be the\nconsequence of the information being made available or rightfully denied is a\nmatter beyond the operation of the Act.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      The University&#x27;s first challenge (and it is, indeed the University&#x27;s challenge\nas the onus is on the rejection being required to be justified) that what an\nexaminee seeks in asking for inspection of his answerscript is not information at\nall, cannot be accepted. In the stricter sense, if such answerscript answers to the\ndescription of information, whether such information is of the examinee&#x27;s\ncreation, counts for little. In the broader perspective, if a document submitted\ntakes on any marking it becomes a new document. The University&#x27;s offer of\nmaking the marks allotted to each individual question available to all candidates\nis fair and laudable, but not if it comes with the rider that the answerscripts\nshould then be exempted from being divulged. Notwithstanding the principle of\nseverability contained in <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 10</a> of the said Act, the answered paper with or\nwithout an examiner&#x27;s etchings thereon is not information exempted under any of\nthe limbs of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 8</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">      As a matter of principle, if answerscripts cannot be opened up for\ninspection it should hold good for all or even most cases. Since the said Act\npermits a request for third party information, subject to the consideration as to\ndesirability in every case, a third party answerscript may, theoretically, be sought\nand obtained. The University&#x27;s first argument would then not hold good for a\nthird party answerscript would be information beyond the knowledge of its\nseeker.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">      There is an understandable attempt on the University&#x27;s part to not so\nmuch as protect the self and property of the examiner, but to keep the examiner&#x27;s\nidentity concealed. The argument made on behalf of the public authorities before\n the Central Information Commission has, thankfully, not been put forward in\nthis case. This University has not cited the fiduciary duty that it may owe to its\nexaminers or the need to keep answerscripts out of bounds for examinees so that\nthe examiners are not threatened. A ground founded on apprehended\nlawlessness may not stultify the natural operation of a statute, but in the\nUniversity&#x27;s eagerness here to not divulge the identity of its examiners there is a\ndesirable and worthy motive - to ensure impartiality in the process. But a\nprocedure may be evolved such that the identity of the examiner is not apparent\non the face of the evaluated answerscript. The severability could be applied by\nthe coversheet that is left blank by an examinee or later attached by the\nUniversity to be detached from the answerscript made over to the examinee\nfollowing a request under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 6</a> of the Act. It will require an effort on the\npublic authority&#x27;s part and for a system to be put in place but the lack of effort or\nthe failure in any workable system being devised will not tell upon the impact of\nthe wide words of the Act or its ubiquitous operation.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">      Whether or not an examiner puts his pen to the answerscript that he\nproceeds to evaluate would not rob the answerscript of retaining its virtue as\ninformation within the meaning of the said Act, even if it is made available for\ninspection in the same form as it was received from the examinee. The etchings\non an answerscript may be additional information for a seeker, but the\nanswerscript all along remains a document liable to be sought and obtained\nfollowing a request under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 6</a> of the Act. That the etchings may be pointless\nor that they may be arbitrary or whimsical in the absence of any guidelines,\nmakes little difference.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">      Education is more than just reading prescribed texts and taking\nexaminations in a given format, it is more than a garnering of degrees,\ncertificates and diplomas. Any real education requires the amassing of knowledge\nthat may or may not be in the prescription for an examination. An educated\n human being may also strive to create a new body of knowledge that is outside\nthe purview of prescriptions. There can be no education if limits are imposed on\nthe amount and type of knowledge an individual may gather or create. A\ndemocracy can only be functional in all its aspects, extents and senses when\nthere is an informed citizenry.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">      The right to information is the most basic empowerment of the individual -\nthe right of an individual to the source of any knowledge required for him to\neducate himself in any area he may choose.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">      An examining authority may not tell a student that he must learn how to\nanswer questions in the format the examining authority desires, yet leave the\nexaminee uninformed of the manner of evaluation. The examining authority\ncannot be exacting in its demand for transparency and clarity in answers to its\nquestions, and yet remain inscrutable and veiled in its methods of evaluation. An\nexamining authority has every right to judge the student&#x27;s knowledge and\nexpression of that knowledge, but it cannot take away the examinee&#x27;s right to\nknow the methodology of and the criteria for its evaluation. But again this is\nstraying into the zone of the consequence of information of the subject kind being\nmade available.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">      An examinee who has written hurried answers and solved problems under\nexamination conditions sometimes several months before he gets the marksheet\ndoes not really &quot;know&quot; his answers. His memory of what he wrote will not be\ncomplete or accurate. He may not even have a clear recollection of what he has\nrecorded in his answers. Alternatively, he may feel that he has written something\nthat he actually has not. His silly mistakes, graphical or grammatical errors and\noversights may not be obvious to him. A look at his evaluated answerscript can\nserve the wonderful purpose of pointing out his mistakes - whether or not the\n evaluated paper marks such mistakes - clarifying his doubts and helping him to\nknow once and for all, what he wrote and what he did not.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">      If inspection of answerscripts is denied to the examinee, the spirit of the\nConstitutional right to expression and information may be lost. The knowledge-\nbuilder&#x27;s - the University&#x27;s - bid to perpetuate the draconian, elitist, one-sided\nright to know and judge and rule without being open to question or accountable\nto the examinee cannot be encouraged. For a system to foster meaningful\nproliferation of knowledge, it must itself be crystal clear to its core.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">      In the University&#x27;s zeal to limit the scope of the request for information\nunder the said Act, one may get a whiff of its inertia: its innate resistance to\nchange, almost a sublime refusal to perceive or acknowledge how all around it\nhas moved along. History and tradition may be cherished and preserved. But\nevolution cannot be impeded as it is a means for survival. If there is no\ninfrastructure to receive the change, the need to change cannot be negated. It is\npossible that public authorities as the University do not desire accountability as\nit is a demanding taskmaster and it is difficult to shrug off old habits. It is\nequally likely that while public examining bodies make an ostensible show of\nconcern for the examiners, there is a realisation that a more open scrutiny of\nevaluated answerscripts will require more care and caution than the low\nremuneration - and that is a notorious fact - to examiners can command.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">      Access to answerscripts may have the desirable side-effect of ensuring that\nthere is no loss of any of the papers. It is not unknown for answerscripts of Board\nand other examinations to have been found in dishonourable places that they\nshould never have reached, and the awareness that there may potentially be a\nrequest for furnishing every answerscript may result in its better preservation. In\n a sense, the despair that has driven many a student to take his life in recent\ntimes may be addressed if students have access to their evaluated answerscripts.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">      The University&#x27;s final shield is, ironically, the Court. It seeks to tuck the\nanswerscripts behind the apparently insurmountable wall of Supreme Court\njudgments. Apart from the fact that <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 8(1)(b)</a> of the said Act has to be read\nin the light of the overriding effect of the said Act sanctioned under <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 22</a>,\nthe argument on such score is as much a show of desperation as the floodgate\ntheory.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1271785\" id=\"span_27\">There are two parts to <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 8(1)(b)</a> of the Act: information that has been\nexpressly forbidden to be published by any court of law or tribunal or the\ndisclosure of which may constitute contempt of court. It is a disjunctive &quot;or&quot; after\nthe word &quot;tribunal&quot;. It is trite that an act may not be expressly forbidden by a\ncourt and yet its commission would amount to contempt of court. In the first\nlimb of the clause, the expression &quot;expressly forbidden&quot; operates on the word\n&quot;information&quot;. It necessarily implies that, that which is sought by way of a\nrequest has to be a matter that is expressly forbidden to be made available. The\njudicial embargo has to be explicit and a general observation may not be cited as\na bar. An express prohibition has to be more specific than what the University\nbrings by way of Supreme Court judgments, even if its best arguable case is\ntaken. It does not appear that the University here has stressed much on the\nsecond arm of the clause. Even the latest <a href=\"/doc/1271785/\" id=\"a_129\">Ayan Das</a> case has not altogether\nforbidden answerscripts being offered for inspection by a court to an examinee.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845543\" id=\"span_28\"><a href=\"/doc/845543/\" id=\"a_130\">The Suvankar</a> case spoke of the ills of court-sanctioned interventions in the\nprocess of evaluation that may rob it of its timely finality.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845543\" id=\"span_29\"><a href=\"/doc/845543/\" id=\"a_131\">The Suvankar</a> case\ndeals with the consequence of information being furnished and cannot be seen as\nan impediment to the information in the form of answerscripts being made\n available. It is a matter that comes into play, as noticed above, in the zone\nbeyond where the said Act operates.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">      The Supreme Court&#x27;s reference in the Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth case\nto the audi alteram partem rule not operating in the twilight zone of expectations\nhas to be read in the background of the immediate lis and the more general rule\nthat was laid down. The challenge in that case was to two clauses of one of the\nregulations of the Secondary and Higher Secondary Council that barred\nreassessment and prohibited inspection of answerscripts. The restrictions were\nfound to be reasonable. The matter was not considered in the light of the\nenactment which is the subject matter of the present proceedings, even if it is\naccepted that the said Act only elucidates on the right originally guaranteed by\nthe Constitution. There is no evil in a right born in the Constitution being\nenlarged by subsequent legislation nor any doubt as to the legislative competence\nto do so. If the right already existed under the Constitution, Parliament may\nwiden its sweep and operation. A privilege granted under Part III of the\nConstitution can be legitimately magnified in keeping with the Constitutional\nvision in Part IV, abreast with the changing times when the said Act&#x27;s avowed\npurpose is to bring about transparency and curb corruption.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">      Judicial discipline demands deference to precedents not only of the\nhierarchical superior but also of a forum of coordinate jurisdiction but it does not\ncommand a fawning obeisance in the deification of any precedent. As society\nprogresses and aspirations rise, it shakes off the shackles that it invented in its\ninfancy or adolescence. Marvels of yesterday become relics of today. If the Central\nInformation Commission can rightfully aspire for a day when answerscripts\nwould accompany the mark sheets, that there is no facility therefor today would\nnot lead to the natural words and import of the said Act to be constricted by any\nconcern for the immediate hardship and inconvenience. The umbra of\n exemptions must be kept confined to the specific provisions in that regard and no\npenumbra of a further body of exceptions may be conjured up by any strained\ndevise of construction. In a constitutional democracy, every limb and digit of\ngovernance is ultimately answerable to the governed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1271785\" id=\"span_30\">Up until the <a href=\"/doc/1271785/\" id=\"a_132\">Ayan Das</a> case and down the ages when the Paritosh\nBhupeshkumar Sheth and Suvankar cases were decided, the issues were not\ntested against the provisions of the said Act. Subject to the legislation being\nwithin the bounds of constitutional propriety, the legislature may bring an\nenactment to undo a view expressed by court, for notwithstanding the\ncontemporary fading demarcations of the functions of the several organs of State,\nthe court may have to yield to the legislature in the business of law-making as it\nis the vocation of the one and the subject of scrutiny and application of the other.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">      The aspirations that the said Act addresses, the hope that it kindles and\nthe direction that it gives to a right ordained under the Constitution, hardly\npermit an answerscript to slip out of its refreshingly agreeable sweep. The sand\nin the hourglass has run out on all forms of feudal practice and the inglorious\nvestiges of its overstaying relics need to be ruthlessly torn down in the land\nbelonging to the Constitution. The old order that the University seeks to preserve\nmust yield to the mores of the times.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">      As much as an examining body may owe an obligation to its set of\nexaminers, it owes a greater fiduciary duty to its examinees. The examinees are\nat the heart of a system to cater to whom is brought the examining body and its\nexaminers. If it is the right of a voter, for the little man to have the curriculum\nvitae of the candidates who seek his insignificant vote, the right of the examinee\nis no less to seek inspection of his answerscript.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">       Whether it is on the anvil of the legal holy trinity of justice, equity and good\nconscience, or on the test of openness and transparency being inherent in\nhuman rights, or by the myriad tools of construction, or even by the Wednesbury\nyardstick of reasonableness, the State Public Information Officer&#x27;s rejection of the\nwrit petitioner&#x27;s request to obtain his answerscript cannot be sustained.
