The instant special appeal (writ) has been preferred by the\n\nState of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. being aggrieved of the Judgment dated\n\n17.10.2019 passed by the learned Single Bench of this Court in\n\nS.B. Civil Writ Petition No.14827/2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.    Brief facts relevant and essential for disposal of the instant\n\nappeal are noted herein below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      The minor respondent No.1- writ petitioner was sexually\n\nassaulted whereby, she unfortunately conceived. The minor moved\n\nan   application   through      her     mother        seeking         permission    for\n\ntermination of her pregnancy before the Special Judge, SC/ST Act\n\nCases, Churu who, vide order dated 16.09.2019, directed the\n\nChief Medical Officer, Ratangarh, District Churu to get medical\n\nexamination of the girl conducted so as to ascertain her physical\n\nand mental status and so also that of the foetus. The Court also\n\nindicated in its order that an assessment be made as to whether,\n\nlooking at the physical condition of the minor victim, she was\n\ncapable of safe child birth or not. A Medical Board was constituted\n\nat the Government Hospital, Churu, which examined the applicant\n\non 16.10.2019 and gave its opinion in the following terms:\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     &quot;In opinion of Medical Board, she is 25 W 3 D pregnancy (by\n     sonography) with single live fetus, her blood investigations\n     are within normal limits and she does not have any\n     complication of pregnancy. At present her condition seems to\n     be suggestive that there is no serious threat to her life in\n     termination    of    pregnancy.          However,           at    the   time   of\n     termination or after termination risk of known medical or\n     surgical complication cannot be denied.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                     (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:34 PM)</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                        (3 of 20)                    [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">3.    The opinion of the Medical Board was put up before the\n\nSpecial Judge who, initially fixed the matter on 25.09.2019 for the\n\npurpose of hearing the victim. Realising that the victim was a\n\nminor, the learned Special Judge, SC/ST Act Cases transferred the\n\nmatter to the Court of the Special Judge, POCSO Act Cases, Churu\n\nwho   passed   an   order      dated      27.09.2019            holding   that   the\n\napplication was not maintainable because the length of gestation\n\nhad gone beyond the threshold of 20 weeks prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_1\">The\n\nMedical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</a> (hereinafter referred\n\nto as &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_2\">The MTP Act</a>&#x27;). The Court observed that the relief, if any,\n\ncould be extended to the applicant by the High Court in its writ\n\njurisdiction. Thereupon, the victim preferred the above referred\n\nwrit petition before this Court through her widowed mother. The\n\nmatter was deferred on a couple of dates for seeking confirmation\n\nof the victim whether she was determined to get the pregnancy\n\nterminated or whether she could contemplate handing over the\n\nchild to be born to some social organization or shelter home.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">Additional opinion was sought from the Medical Board, Churu\n\nwhether the termination of the pregnancy would be conducive to\n\nthe health of the girl or it could pose any serious threat to her life\n\nand body. The Medical Examination Report dated 16.10.2019\n\nissued by the Medial Board comprising of five doctors was\n\npresented before the Court on 17.10.2019 wherein, an opinion\n\nwas expressed that no serious threat to life or body would be\n\nposed if the applicant underwent termination of pregnancy which\n\ncould be recommended by the High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      However, the learned Single Bench, rejected the writ petition\n\nby the order dated 17.10.2019 turning down the prayer of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                    (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:34 PM)</span>\n                                        (4 of 20)                [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\n\ntermination of the child&#x27;s pregnancy holding that the foetus in\n\nwomb had a right to life as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. The medical termination of pregnancy was\n\ndenied and the application filed by an organization named\n\n&#x27;Navjeevan Sansthan&#x27; to take custody of the child was allowed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">The relevant paras of the impugned Judgment are quoted herein\n\nbelow for the sake of ready reference:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     &quot;26. However, the entire scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_4\">Sec. 3</a> applies in two\n     stages, one up to 12 weeks, and second from 12 to 20\n     weeks. In the case at hand, the threshold set by the\n     Legislature has crossed as the pregnancy has crossed the\n     cut-off period of 20 weeks. <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_5\">Sec. 5</a> takes into consideration\n     the eventuality of 20 weeks threshold being crossed, and\n     further limits the discretion available to permit termination of\n     pregnancy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     27. What constitutes an agony is subjective and only the\n     Petitioner can feel the real pain of being a victim of an act as\n     abhorrent as Rape. No words can describe her pain, no\n     expressions can meet her anguish. Given the predicament at\n     hand, this Court feels constrained in applying the judgments\n     cited, and is forced to take up a case-specific evaluation.\n     This balancing exercise is necessitated due to the 20 weeks\n     threshold having been crossed, where the mental agony is a\n     relevant factor for permitting termination of pregnancy. Post\n     the 20 weeks threshold, the mental agony remains, may\n     even become more excruciating, but the Court cannot be\n     unmindful of the voice of the &#x27;yet to be born&#x27; - a fully alive\n     prospective child in the womb.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     28. While doing this balancing exercise, this Court has two\n     very striking factors to reckon - the adoloscent age of &#x27;S&#x27; -\n     17 years; and that the petition has been filed by victim&#x27;s\n     widow mother. She can naturally see the social stigma and\n     feel the turmoil of her daughter, but cannot possibly perceive\n     the feeling of a mother carrying a baby. On the other hand is\n     standing an NGO, which is more than willing to protect\n     unborn life while assuring the dignified life of the petitioner.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                                 [Emphasis supplied]\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     29. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy is statutory in\n     nature, with constitutional underpinnings, on the other hand\n     the right to life is flowing directly from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Art. 21.</a> The Petitioner\n     who is pregnant is carrying a life, and the &quot;compelling State\n     interest&quot; in preserving life has to be balanced vis-à-vis the\n     right of the Petitioner as a rape victim from suffering\n     unnecessary mental agony. In this analysis, relying on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                    (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:34 PM)</span>\n                                  (5 of 20)                [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\njudgments cited above, this Court has to be alive to the\nexcruciating mental agony of the Petitioner and it has to also\nhear the voice of the unheard &quot;foetus in womb&quot;;a human\nbeing which too is alive, though yet to be born.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172163761\" id=\"span_5\">30. Taking strength from the constitutional position, where\n&quot;bodily integrity&quot; is a facet inter alia of the right to life,\nwhereas &quot;being alive&quot; is the right to life; this Court is\nconstrained to hold that the per-se right to life of the\nprospective child needs to be given precedence over the right\nof the Petitioner, particularly in the given situation. The Court\nbeing mindful of what the Petitioner would go through, and\nplacing reliance on the law enunciated in <a href=\"/doc/172163761/\" id=\"a_7\">Z v. State of Bihar</a>,\n(2018) 11 SCC 572 (para 48-57) proposes to pass following\ndirections for ensuring comfortable pregnancy and delivery,\nin a setup that must guarantee utmost privacy and respect\nfor the dignity of the Petitioner.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">31. Hence, right to life of the foetus is also required to be\nconsidered. Right to life guaranteed by the Constitution of\nIndia under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot be\ninvoked for the victim alone. Protection of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> is as\nmuch available to the child to be born, unless protection of\nfoetus poses an eminent threat to the life of mother.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">32. In the facts obtaining in the present case, when the\napplicant society has volunteered, this Court is not inclined\nto permit medical termination of the pregnancy, as prayed by\nthe petitioner &#x27;S&#x27; and instead deems it appropriate in the\ninterest of the &#x27;yet to be born baby&#x27; to allow the application\nfiled by the applicant - Society &#x27; Navjeewan Sansthan&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">33. However, with a view to strike the balance between the\nright to privacy of the victim &#x27;S&#x27; and the right to life of the\n&#x27;child to be born&#x27;, this Court deems it appropriate to pass the\nfollowing directions:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">     (i) To maintain the secrecy of her pregnancy, the State\n     will ensure petitioner&#x27;s admission in Nari Niketan,\n     Jodhpur until her delivery and convalescence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     (ii) State will also permit petitioner&#x27;s mother to live with\n     her to give moral and emotional support.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     (iii) In case &#x27;S&#x27; and her mother wish to live in their own\n     residence, they may do so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     (iv) If the petitioner and her mother move to Nari\n     Niketan, Jodhpur, the State will ensure safe delivery of\n     the child at the place where she resides.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     (v) In case the petitioner refuses to be admitted to Nari\n     Niketan, Jodhpur, the CMHO, Churu-respondent No.5\n     and if she comes to Nari Niketan, Jodhpur then CMHO,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">              (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:34 PM)</span>\n                                       (6 of 20)                [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\n          Jodhpur will ensure requisite pre-natal and post-natal\n          medical care.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">          (vi) After the birth of the child, the custody of the child\n          will be handed over to the applicant &quot;Navjeewan\n          Sansthan&quot;, as soon as feasible, of course after taking\n          consent of &#x27;S&#x27;, her mother and a fitness certificate of\n          paediatrician.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          (vii) This Court has no doubt that the applicant society\n          will take utmost care of the child to be born.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">          (viii) For a period of 12 months, the society (Navjeewan\n          Sansthan) will not give such child in adoption or\n          otherwise. The petitioner shall have liberty to take back\n          the custody of the child within the period interregnum,\n          if she chooses so to do, after becoming major.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">          (ix) Concerned CMHO shall take DNA sample of the\n          child and ensure its handing over to learned AAG so\n          that the same be forwarded to the concerned Court, in\n          case it is required in the trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">          (x) In the entire process, all concerned will ensure that\n          secrecy of the pregnancy, anonymity of the petitioner\n          and the &#x27;child to be born&#x27; is maintained.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">          (xi) It shall equally be the responsibility of the applicant\n          society to ensure that the child does not know about\n          his/her mother, and of course about the order instant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">     The State Government has approached this Court against the\n\nabove Judgment in its capacity as the parens patriae in an\n\nendeavour to protect the rights of the possible victims claiming\n\nthat the impugned Judgment impinges upon the fundamental right\n\nof victims of rape from seeking termination of a forced pregnancy.\n\nHence, this special appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.   Learned Additional Advocate General Shri Pankaj Sharma\n\nrepresenting the State urged that the impugned Judgment is bad\n\nin the eyes of law because the same runs contrary to the letter\n\nand spirit of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_10\">MTP Act</a>. Shri Sharma contended that the concept\n\nof comparative agony which the Single Bench evaluated and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                   (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:34 PM)</span>\n                                       (7 of 20)                [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\n\ndecided in favour of the right of the child to be born over and\n\nabove the agony and Mental Trauma caused to the victim is not\n\nthe only facet of the matter because as per him, scientific\n\nresearch has established beyond the pale of doubt that child birth\n\nat an age below 18 years is not conducive to the mental and\n\nphysical well-being of the mother. The possibility that the girl\n\ngiving birth at such a tender age would suffer numerous future\n\ncomplications is imminent. He urged that in a case where\n\nconception is a result of sexual assault being committed on a\n\nminor girl then, her fundamental right to live as a normal person\n\nwithout undergoing the trauma of giving birth at such a tender\n\nage would have to be given precedence over the fictional\n\nfundamental right of the child yet to be born. He further\n\ncontended that possibility of death or grave harm to the mother\n\nwhile undergoing delivery at such tender age is very high and\n\ntherefore, the comparative analysis of fundamental right to life as\n\nassessed by the learned Single Bench in the impugned Judgment\n\nis lopsided and thus unsustainable. In support of his contentions,\n\nShri Sharma relied upon the following Supreme Court Judgments:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"126166381\" id=\"span_8\">(<a href=\"/doc/126166381/\" id=\"a_11\">i)   Sarmishtha Chakraborty &amp; Anr.

Reproductive choice of a woman has been recognised as a\n\nfundamental right by a three Judges Bench of Hon&#x27;ble the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_17\">Suchita Srivastava</a> (supra)\n\nwherein, it was observed as below:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           &quot;11. A plain reading of the above-quoted provision\n     makes it clear that Indian law allows for abortion only if the\n     specified conditions are met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_18\">When the MTP Act</a> was first\n     enacted in 1971 it was largely modelled on the Abortion Act\n     of 1967 which had been passed in the United Kingdom. The\n     legislative intent was to provide a qualified &#x27;right to abortion&#x27;\n     and the termination of pregnancy has never been recognised\n     as a normal recourse for expecting mothers. There is no\n     doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive\n     choices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as\n     understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n     India. It is important to recognise that reproductive\n     choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to\n     abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is\n     that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily\n     integrity should be respected. This means that there\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                    (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:34 PM)</span>\n                                  (10 of 20)               [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\nshould be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\nreproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse\nparticipation in sexual activity or alternatively the\ninsistence   on   use    of   contraceptive    methods.\nFurthermore, women are also free to choose birth-\ncontrol methods such as undergoing sterilisation\nprocedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\nreproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to\ncarry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\nsubsequently raise children.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      However, in the case of pregnant women there is also a\n&#x27;compelling state interest&#x27; in protecting the life of the\nprospective child. Therefore, the termination of a pregnancy\nis only permitted when the conditions specified in the\napplicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions\nof the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be viewed as reasonable\nrestrictions that have been placed on the exercise of\nreproductive choices.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_16\">12 . A perusal of the above mentioned provision makes it\nclear that ordinarily a pregnancy can be terminated only\nwhen a medical practitioner is satisfied that a &#x27;continuance of\nthe pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant\nwoman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health&#x27;\n[as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3(2)(i)</a>] or when &#x27;there is a substantial risk\nthat if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical\nor mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&#x27; [as\nper <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(2) (ii)</a>]. While the satisfaction of one medical\npractitioner is required for terminating a pregnancy within\ntwelve weeks of the gestation period, two medical\npractitioners must be satisfied about either of these grounds\nin order to terminate a pregnancy between twelve to twenty\nweeks of the gestation period. The explanations to this\nprovision have also contemplated the termination of\npregnancy when the same is the result of a rape or a failure\nof birth-control methods since both of these eventualities\nhave been equated with a &#x27;grave injury to the mental health&#x27;\nof a woman. In all such circumstances, the consent of the\npregnant woman is an essential requirement for proceeding\nwith the termination of pregnancy. This position has been\nunambiguously stated in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3(4)(b)</a> of the MTP Act,\n1971. The exceptions to this rule of consent have been <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_24\">laid\ndown in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> lays\ndown that when the pregnant woman is below eighteen\nyears of age or is a &#x27;mentally ill&#x27; person, the pregnancy can\nbe terminated if the guardian of the pregnant woman gives\nconsent for the same. The only other exception is found in\n<a href=\"/doc/1294807/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 5(1)</a> of the MTP Act which permits a registered\nmedical practitioner to proceed with a termination of\npregnancy when he/she is of an opinion formed in good faith\nthat the same is &#x27;immediately necessary to save the life of\nthe pregnant woman&#x27;.

Indisputably, in the case at hand, the victim conceived\n\nbecause of the offence of sexual assault committed upon her and\n\nthus, the pregnancy was a forced one rather than it being of her\n\nchoice. We firmly feel that as the victim has been virtually forced\n\nto give birth to the child against her desire, she will carry a stigma\n\nfor the remainder of her life that the offspring born as a result of\n\nthe ghastly offence of rape committed upon her, is alive\n\nsomewhere in this world. It may also be possible that having been\n\ndirected to give up the child to the NGO, the victim girl might\n\ncarry a constant feeling of remorse in her mind regarding the fate\n\nof her child.

A pregnant women, even in a normal situation, has a right to\n\ndemand termination of pregnancy upto 20 weeks as recognised by\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_41\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act</a>. Thus, evaluated on the\n\ntouchstone of the observations made by Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_42\">Suchita Srivastava</a> (supra), we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that the right of a child rape victim to make\n\nthe   reproductive   choice       of    terminating         the   foetus   heavily\n\noutweighs the right of the child in womb to be born even where\n\nthe pregnancy is at an advanced stage. Had the question only\n\nbeen of the right of the child in womb to be born then, the same\n\nanalogy would equally apply to a foetus with known abnormalities\n\nbecause such abnormalities would by themselves, not give anyone\n\nthe right to extinguish the life of a foetus.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">14. In wake of the discussion made herein above, we are of the\n\nfirm opinion that the impugned judgment dated 17.10.2019\n\npassed by the learned Single Bench does not lay down the correct\n\nproposition of law. We are conscious of the piquant situation that\n\nthe victim&#x27;s right to seek medical termination of pregnancy been\n\nirretrievably frustrated because of the delays which occurred at\n\nthe initial stages. Apparently, the victim sought termination of her\n\npregnancy well in time but the matter was unnecessarily delayed\n\nbecause of red-tapism and systemic indifference.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">15.   We are also persuaded by the contention of learned AAG Shri\n\nPankaj Sharma that the observations made by the learned Single\n\nJudge at para No.28 of the impugned Judgment were totally\n\nuncalled for. The learned Single Judge observed in the said para\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                     (Downloaded on 01/05/2020 at 08:25:35 PM)</span>\n                                        (18 of 20)               [SAW-1344/2019]\n\n\n\nthat the victim&#x27;s widowed mother who filed the writ petition on her\n\nbehalf could not possibly perceive the feeling of a mother carrying\n\na baby. The observation so made is absolutely off the mark and is\n\nrather stigmatic to the victim&#x27;s mother. Needless to say that it is\n\nthe mother who gave birth to the victim and thus, to say that she\n\ncould not have perceived the feeling of a mother carrying a baby\n\nwas absolutely unwarranted. The said observation is also against\n\nthe letter and spirit of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 3(iv)</a> of the MTP Act as per which,\n\nthe consent of the guardian of a woman below 18 years for\n\ntermination of pregnancy is considered sufficient for the purpose.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">16.
