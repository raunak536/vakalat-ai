The journey of adjudication of this case presented many\n                          challenges as the learned counsel for petitioner drew this Court&#x27;s\n                          attention to the most ancient scriptures of various faiths and his point\n                          of view regarding the concept of pardanashin woman in the said\n                          scriptures, at the same time, praying for the application of the old\n                          concept of pardanashin women to the modern age empowered and\n                          educated woman.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">                          2.           Thus, the challenge before this Court was to adjudicate and\n                          return a finding as to whether the concept of pardanashin woman, as\n                          argued and enumerated by the learned counsel for petitioner, indeed\n                          means and refers to women who by mere virtue of their gender need\n                          to be extended special treatment, as according to the learned counsel,\n                          even today many women are pardanashin out of their own choice or\n                          due to them following their respective religious practices.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                         Page 3 of 64</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Signing Date:01.03.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">18:26:07</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">                           3.

The present case also raised an issue which initially confined\n                          itself to a particular person. However, in the final hearing, the person\n                          oriented prayers were satisfied and withdrawn on behalf of the\n                          petitioner but insistence was laid on adjudication of an issue brought\n                          forth by the present case for the larger societal interest, thus, bringing\n                          to the fore the power of Court to serve the community better by\n                          bringing about changes in the administration of criminal justice by\n                          issuance of directions wherever called for qua the concerned\n                          authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                          RELIEFS SOUGHT BEFORE THIS COURT\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">                          6.

Rehan and Gayasuddin had also reached the same hospital for\n                          treatment. On the same night, at about 1:00 AM, accused Mohd.\n                          Rehan had fled from the hospital and thereafter, at about 1:30 AM, an\n                          information was received at P.S.

Due to the aforesaid acts of the accused persons, there was\n                          grave apprehension of threat to the life of Mohd. Tahir i.e. the\n                          complainant and his other family members, and accordingly, the\n                          police had started patrolling in the area and had stationed themselves\n                          outside the house of complainant as well as the accused. The present\n                          petitioner is the sister of accused persons namely Mohd. Rehan,\n                          Mohd. Irfan and Mohd. Gayasuddin. It is submitted in the Status\n                          Report that when the police had reached the house of petitioner, it\n                          was found locked, but the lights of the house were switched on and\n                          the petitioner was peeping from her balcony, watching the activities\n                          in the street, unveiled. Thereafter, the police officials had enquired\n                          from her about her brothers, but she had denied having any\n                          knowledge of their whereabouts. She had even told that she did not\n                          have the keys of the house to let police search the same. It is the case\n                          of State that, throughout these conversations, the petitioner stood\n                          there without any veil, and it was the petitioner herself who later had\n                          requested the police officials to take her to police station as she\n                          feared any possible retaliation from the side persons who had been\n                          allegedly injured by the brothers of the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">                          9.

Chandni Mahal who had\n                          allegedly engaged in high-handed, illegal, and contemptuous\n                          behaviour. Despite her repeated assertion that her brothers were not\n                          present within the premises, the officers had attempted to forcefully\n                          gain entry in her house.

While searching the house, the police\n                          officials had not found anyone, and then, they had forcefully dragged\n                          the petitioner out of her house.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">                          11.    Thus, the main grievance of the petitioner, which has also\n                          resulted in filing of the present petition, is that the petitioner is a\n                          pardanashin woman, and she was not wearing her pardah when she\n                          was moved out of her house. It is alleged that the petitioner was then\n                          taken to the police station and was wrongfully confined there. It has\n                          also been alleged that prior to her release, she was subjected to\n                          threats and intimidation, warning her against pursuing any formal\n                          complaint regarding the incident, however, no relief or action was\n                          forthcoming, resulting in filing of the present petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">                          12.

Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that the petitioner\n                          herein is a pardanashin Muslim woman, and she has a fundamental\n                          right to wear pardah which is the Islamic dress code for women,\n                          which not only consists of a scarf that covers the head, the neck and\n                          bosom, but it also includes the overall dress that should be long and\n                          loose. It is argued that the petitioner, being a Muslim woman, is well\n                          within her rights to conduct herself in accordance with the tenets of\n                          her religion, including her choice of dress, as protected by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 25</a>\n                          of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to profess,\n                          practice, and propagate religion. This extends to matters of personal\n                          liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a>, encompassing the right to live with dignity\n                          and make choices aligned with individual autonomy. Additionally,\n                          the constitutional safeguard provided by <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 29</a>, which protects\n                          the interests of minorities, further reinforces the right to preserve\n                          distinctive cultural practices, potentially including religious attire.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">                          17.

It is prayed that it is not just desired but also the need of the\n                          hour to sensitise the Delhi Police qua fostering understanding and\n                          respect for women who observe pardah either as a religious belief or\n                          as a part of their personal choice belonging to any religion. It is\n                          submitted that in a diverse and multicultural society like India, it is\n                          imperative that law enforcement agencies understand and respect the\n                          cultural practices of various communities, particularly those\n                          pertaining to women observing pardah. Pardah, representing a\n                          practice deeply rooted in modesty and privacy, requires a nuanced\n                          and sensitive approach from the police to ensure the protection of\n                          women&#x27;s rights while upholding law and order. Thus, with a view to\n                          sensitise the Delhi police, the following quintessential aspects may be\n                          considered, which are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                                 (i) Understanding pardah practices signifying commitment to\n                                 modesty, dignity and privacy by the police and ensure that they\n                                 respect the choice of women adhering to this tradition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                                 (ii) The Delhi Police be sensitised about the constitutional\n                                 guarantees and Indian Laws, guaranteeing freedom of religion\n                                 and observing pardah by women being one of such\n                                 constitutional guarantees to practice religion.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                                 (iii) Delhi Police being sensitised and trained by cultural\n                                 experts, community leaders and women from different\n                                 backgrounds for formulating and preparation of training\n                                 modules which should cover significance of pardah and its\n                                 various manifestations across communities.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                          Page 12 of 64</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signing Date:01.03.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">18:26:07</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                                  (iv) Delhi Police be trained with effective communication\n                                 strategies.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                 (v) Delhi Police be trained about community, policing and\n                                 building trust.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                 (vi) Delhi Police be trained to handle situations by ensuring\n                                 women are treated with dignity during investigations and\n                                 interactions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                                 (vii) Special provisions be made to accommodate pardah\n                                 practices particularly in context of identity verification or\n                                 witness statements.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                 (viii) Monitoring mechanism to evaluate such sensitization\n                                 programmes.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                          19.    While explaining pardah practices, it is argued that Pardah is\n                          a cultural and religious tradition followed by many women across\n                          different communities transcending religious boundaries in India.\n                          Often associated with veiling and seclusion, it signifies a\n                          commitment to modesty, dignity, and privacy. The police force, as\n                          the frontline enforcers of law and order, must familiarise themselves\n                          with the cultural nuances surrounding pardah to ensure respectful\n                          and effective interactions with women adhering to this tradition. It is\n                          argued that Indian laws, including constitutional guarantees of\n                          freedom of religion and protection of women&#x27;s rights, form the\n                          foundation for a balanced approach. The police need to be aware of\n                          these legal safeguards while discharging their duties. Respecting\n                          religious freedom, gender equality, and the right to privacy are\n                          crucial elements that should guide police interactions with women\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Signature Not Verified    W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                         Page 13 of 64</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">By:ZEENAT PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Signing Date:01.03.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">18:26:07</span>\n                           observing pardah.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">                          20.    It is argued that sensitising the police forces involves\n                          comprehensive training initiatives that instil cultural awareness and\n                          understanding. Training modules should cover the significance of\n                          pardah, its various manifestations across communities, and the legal\n                          protections in place for women practising it. Interactive sessions with\n                          cultural experts, community leaders, and women from different\n                          backgrounds can enhance the police force&#x27;s sensitivity. It is argued\n                          that effective communication lies at the heart of building positive\n                          police-community      relations.   Officers   should   be   trained    to\n                          communicate respectfully and courteously with women observing\n                          purdah, taking into account the cultural and religious sensitivities\n                          involved. Clear guidelines on communication, avoiding unnecessary\n                          intrusion into personal spaces, and providing women with a\n                          comfortable environment for interaction should be emphasised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">                          Argument regarding practice of Pardah existing in all religions and\n                          followed by women of all religions\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">                          21.

Avagunthana was a\n                          cloak-like covering of the upper part of body, Uttariya was a\n                          covering till the shoulders, Adhikantha Pata was a covering till the\n                          neck and Sirovastra was a covering simply for the head.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                          24.      It is further mentioned that pardah was prevalent even\n                          during Valmiki‟s Ramayana. The practice, which signifies\n                          ―seclusion of women,‖ ―had assumed the form of a recognized social\n                          custom.‖ When Sita sets out with her husband to the forest,\n                          Valmiki expresses regret that, &quot;a lady, who had so far not been\n                          seen even by the spirits of the sky, should now become an object\n                          of public gaze.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">                          25.      Apart from the Ramayana, the head covering or a veil finds a\n                          mention in many Sanskrit plays. For instance, Sudraka, the author of\n                          Mrichhakatika, mentions that women wore Avagunthana, a thin veil,\n                          to hide their beauty and to enhance their coiffures. Similarly, ancient\n                          Indian      plays-Kalidasa&#x27;s    Abhijnana     Sakuntalam,        Bhasa&#x27;s\n                          Pratimanataka, Sisupalavadha, Dashakumaracharita, etc., among\n                          others indicate that women wore veils to cover their heads.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">                          Argument regarding women wearing pardah/ghoonghat in modern\n                          India\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">                          26.

It is stated that ‗Pardah‟ is\n                          a Persian word translated as curtain, veil, attire worn by women to\n                          mark their social and physical segregation from the rest of society by\n                          covering their bodies and/or faces. Pardah takes different dimensions\n                          depending on the country, place of origin and hence has numerous\n                          variations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">                          27.

In the above context, it is submitted by learned Amicus that\n                          there has been an ongoing global debate about the privacy of a\n                          pardanashin      woman     on   one   hand,     and   the   necessity    of\n                          recognizability and identification of people for the ends of public\n                          order    and    security   concerns    on     the   other   hand.   While\n                          Burqa/Veil/Pardah may be worn by well-meaning women, but the\n                          same can be misused by the offenders of law to disguise themselves.\n                          It is submitted that anything which empowers a person to hide her/his\n                          identity may come in the way of efficient investigation, thus affecting\n                          public order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">                          34.

However, identification of persons is critical to investigation\n                          done by the police. Assertion of remaining inside Burqa/Veil/Pardah\n                          may lead to promotion of anonymity in public; and can be\n                          counterproductive to the investigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1723440\" id=\"span_86\">35.

Under Mughal rule, Hindu upper-class women also\n                          embraced the practice, while women from lower socioe-conomic\n                          strata, tasked with managing households and engaging in agricultural\n                          work, did not adhere to it as rigorously. During the colonial era under\n                          British rule, the practice of pardah gained widespread acceptance and\n                          was enforced with greater stringency. However, in modern times, its\n                          prevalence has declined, coinciding with a shift towards greater\n                          openness and independence among women, as well as matter of\n                          choice. Despite these changes, the legal protections afforded to\n                          pardanashin women remain significant, rooted in principles of equity\n                          and conscience.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">                          42.

The petitioner has broadened the interpretation of „parda‟ to\n                          embrace a multicultural perspective, encompassing women from\n                          various cultural backgrounds and customs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">                          Hinduism\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">                          56.    An example of such a traditional custom given by the\n                          petitioner is ‗ghoonghat&#x27; (also called ghunghat, ghunghta, ghomta,\n                          orhni, odani, laaj, chunari, jhund, kundh), a form of head covering\n                          predominantly worn by Hindu women, even in modern India.\n                          Reference is further made to Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana to submit that\n                          Mata Sita also used to practise pardah. It is further pleaded that many\n                          Sanskrit plays would reveal that Hindu women in ancient India used\n                          to cover their heads/face and hide their beauty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_80\">                          57.    In this regard, this Court notes that presently, the practice of\n                          facial veiling among Hindu women may be prevalent to some extent\n                          in some parts of India. However, the system of ghoonghat or dupatta\n                          or chunni, which the learned counsel for the petitioner has argued as\n                          a form of barrier signifying seclusion, is not correct, as in the modern\n                          times, the system of ghoonghat or dupatta or chunni is viewed as a\n                          symbol of propriety and respect towards others, rather than being a\n                          symbol of barrier or seclusion.

As regards the reference by the learned counsel for petitioner\n                          to Sanskrit plays authored by Sudraka or Kalisada, in order to bring\n                          home his point regarding the women practising pardah/veil in\n                          Hinduism in context with religion, the same is not meritorious since\n                          plays are stories which may refer to an attire but not mandate of the\n                          faith for a woman to follow.

There is no gainsaying that covering of head by women\n                          cannot be equated with covering the face by putting a veil or pardah\n                          and such women cannot be termed as pardanashin.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">                          60.

As regards Sikhism, it has been mentioned in the petition that\n                          &quot;in Sikhism, for instance, the turban, an article of faith, distinguishes\n                          Sikhs from the others. Sikh women who have traditionally worn\n                          headscarves (chuni) are now wearing turbans, much like Sikh men.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">                          70.    In respect of the aforesaid, this Court notes that in Sikhism, it\n                          is customary for women to don a dupatta or chunni for the purpose of\n                          covering their head, while visiting Gurdwaras, which symbolises\n                          reverence for sacred spaces. In fact, when inside a Gurdwara, every\n                          person is required to cover his or her head. Such practice of wearing\n                          a dupatta or chunni is common in Sikhism, but without any formal\n                          imposition by their Gurus, signifying the absence of a concept of\n                          veiling within the religion. The headgears are worn by Sikh men, and\n                          not by Sikh women, barring a few circumstances, however, the\n                          petition mentions that Sikh women are &quot;now wearing turbans much\n                          like Sikh men &#x27;&#x27; which is not true.

While respecting cultural sensitivities and religious\n                          practices, law enforcement agencies must prioritise the common good\n                          and uphold the law without discrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">                          Test of Reasonability and Compelling Public Interest\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">                          78.

For instance, when dealing with individuals from diverse\n                          backgrounds, such as during arrests or interactions with suspects, the\n                          police must assess the circumstances and make decisions that are\n                          proportionate and justifiable. While accommodating reasonable\n                          requests, such as allowing suspects to wear basic clothing and\n                          ensuring their right to dignity as such is not violated, the police must\n                          balance individual rights with the need to maintain public safety and\n                          uphold the law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">                          79.

While\n                          individual rights are supreme, they may need to yield to the\n                          imperatives of public safety and security when necessary.

The increasingly muti-cultural nature of Indian society\n                          definitely has an impact on policing in Delhi or India. The complaint\n                          in the present case is about police officers, about their insensitivity in\n                          protecting the pardanashin women and not giving them enough time\n                          to wear the pardah as per their religion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">                          81.

The Police acts as\n                          watchmen for the community by preventing crime and bringing\n                          criminals to the fold of the criminal justice system. The police have\n                          the role of crime control, maintenance of law and order, and also are\n                          available 24 hours for a wide range of services to the community.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">                          82.       Needless to say, crime prevention and control is the most\n                          vital role they play and the general public holds the image of\n                          police as those who prevent crime, who detect and apprehend\n                          offenders and protect them.

It is the case of petitioner that a woman&#x27;s right to wear pardah\n                          is covered under the ambit of right to dignity, which is enshrined\n                          under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, besides <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 25</a> of the\n                          Constitution, which protects one&#x27;s right to practise or profess his or\n                          her religion. Accordingly, the directions for sensitization of police\n                          officers qua pardanashin women should also be issued since the\n                          officers by their conduct violate the right to dignity of women who\n                          are pardanashin.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">                          103. As far as this argument is concerned, this Court is of the\n                          opinion that the concept of dignity also, as enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21</a>\n                          of the Constitution, extends universally to every citizen,\n                          irrespective of gender or any other characteristic. It is a\n                          fundamental principle that is based on the inherent worth and value\n                          of each individual within society. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21</a> guarantees the protection\n                          of life and personal liberty, recognizing that dignity is a fundamental\n                          aspect of human existence. The protection under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 21</a> is also\n                          not contingent upon adherence to any particular cultural or\n                          religious practice, including the concept of pardah. Instead, it\n                          applies universally to all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or\n                          practices.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">                          104.
