Petitioner, who is a student of the University College,\n\n  Thiruvananthapuram, states that she is a transgender (trans-\n\n  woman). It is stated that she was assigned male gender at the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        4</span>\n\n  time of birth and that at the age of 21, a sex re-assignment\n\n  surgery was performed as is evident from Exhibit P1.                    It is\n\n  stated that further surgery was performed on 27.5.2019 and\n\n  the petitioner&#x27;s name has also been changed as Hina Haneefa.\n\n  Exhibit P3 transgender identity card was also issued to the\n\n  petitioner showing her gender as female. When the petitioner\n\n  was declined admission to the NCC unit by the 5 th respondent\n\n  on the ground that there is no provision for enrollment of\n\n  transgender       students,     she       had   submitted    Exhibit     P4\n\n  representation        seeking   enrollment,       taking    note   of    the\n\n  certificates issued to her.               Further representations were\n\n  submitted before the 5th respondent, but to no avail.                   It is\n\n  submitted that the petitioner was an NCC cadet as would be\n\n  evident from Exhibit P7 and that there is absolutely no\n\n  justification on the part of the respondents in refusing to\n\n  enroll the petitioner in the NCC battalion.                The petitioner\n\n  places reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_5\">National\n\n  Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and others</a>\n\n  [(2014) 5 SCC 438]        as also the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_6\">Transgender\n\n  Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019</a> (hereinafter referred\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      5</span>\n\n  to as the 2019 Act) to contend that the petitioner is entitled\n\n  and eligible for enrollment on the basis of the certificates\n\n  produced by her. It is submitted that after the authoritative\n\n  pronouncement by the Apex Court with regard to the rights of\n\n  transgender persons to a life with human dignity, the\n\n  continued      actions   on   the       part   of   the   respondents   in\n\n  perpetuating discrimination against persons like the petitioner\n\n  only for the reason that she was born with the characteristic of\n\n  a gender which did not match her self-perceived gender\n\n  identity amounts to violation of the petitioner&#x27;s valuable rights\n\n  guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_8\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_9\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">21</a> of the Constitution\n\n  of India. It is stated that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_11\">Transgender\n\n  Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019</a> are also manifestly\n\n  violated by the actions of the respondents. It is submitted that\n\n  any provisions of the National Cadet Crops Act, 1948, or the\n\n  absence of such provisions in so far as enrollment of\n\n  transgenders are concerned, would have to be considered in\n\n  the light of the authoritative pronouncement by the Apex\n\n  Court and the provisions of the 2019 Act, since the enactment\n\n  is clearly intended to do away with the social injustice meted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                      6</span>\n\n     out to persons like the petitioner and to ensure a life with\n\n     human dignity to them. It is, therefore, contended that the\n\n     respondents are duty bound to grant enrollment to the\n\n     petitioner, taking note of Ext.P3 identity cared issued to her in\n\n     accordance with her eligibility.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.     A counsel statement has been placed on record by the\n\nCentral Government Counsel on behalf of respondents 4 to 7. It\n\nis stated that the NCC was raised with an aim to provide a\n\nsuitable environment to train the youth to take up a career in\n\nArmed Forces and that it follows a curriculum and training\n\nmodule following the Armed Forces which is sometimes gender\n\nspecific     due    to   difference       in   physical,   biological   and\n\npsychological aspects. It is stated that the 2019 Act defines a\n\ntransgender person as &#x27;a person whose gender does not match\n\nwith the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes a\n\ntrans-man and trans-woman (whether or not such person has\n\nundergone Sex-Reassignment surgery or hormone therapy or\n\nlaser therapy or such other therapy), persons with intersex\n\nvariations, genderqueer and persons having such socio-cultural\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                             7</span>\n\nidentities as Kinner, Hijra, Arvani and Jogta&quot;. Accordingly to this\n\ndefinition of the Act transgender is an umbrella term for\n\npersons,        which      can     include           transsexual,           transvestite,\n\nGenderqueers and inter-sexual. It is stated at paragraphs 3, 4\n\nand 5 of the counsel statement as follows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      3. The sexual orientation of a transgender may be hetero-sexual,\n      homosexual, bisexual or asexual. In a normal circumstances these\n      biological features and sexual orientation will not have any impact on the\n      society    and    organizations   in       which   they   function.    However,   in\n      organizations like Armed Forces or NCC where close physical contact,\n      confined stay under field conditions, sharing of basic facilities like\n      accommodation, toilets, bathing, sleeping facilities etc. as a routine rather\n      than exception, there is a need for gender specific regulations. While\n      examining the types of transgender we have seen that even a biologically\n      fully developed male or female having potency for sexual activity can\n      choose the identity of transgender/trans-man trans-woman based on the\n      persons gender affinity even without going under medical procedure or\n      sex re-assignment surgery. Simultaneously the sexual orientation of the\n      person can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. Under these\n      circumstances induction of a transvestite (Cross-Dresser) or Genderqueer\n      or intersexual or transsexual not under gone sex-reassignment medical\n      procedure especially if their sexual orientation is heterosexual or bisexual\n      in to boys or girls NCC divisions will have serious undesirable\n      consequences. Further training parameters of Boys and Girls cadets are\n      different , thus trans-women in a girls unit will have an unfair advantage\n      over other girls cadets and trans-men in a boys unit will have an inherent\n      disadvantage.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                           8</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      4. In the case of the petitioner as per records produced by her she has\n      undergone      Sexual-reassignment       surgery.    However,      as   per   the\n      transgender Act the persons who have not undergone Sex-reassignment\n      procedure or Genderqueer or intersexual is also considered as\n      transgender. Thus hypothetically a biological male, who is either\n      Transvestite (Cross-Dresser), Bigender, Demigender or Transsexual not\n      undergone any medical procedure but assumes the gender identity of a\n      female in spite of his sexual orientation as bisexual or heterosexual, is\n      eligible to get enrolled in to a girls NCC unit. Presence of such a person in\n      common bathroom, sleeping area and in close contact physical training\n      activities etc. will be a violation of privacy and dignity of a girl cadet.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      5. On the other hand if the petitioner is admitted in to a girls NCC unit\n      based on her assigned identity of trans-woman any other transgender in\n      spite of their biological features and sexual orientation as discussed above\n      cannot be denied similar opportunity under the right of equality. Thus any\n      decision by the Honourable Court in favour of the petitioner will open a\n      flood gate of unmanageable situation where sexually potent Cross-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">      dresser, Genderqueers etc with bisexual or heterosexual orientation can\n      join NCC units of the opposite gender.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">5.    A prayer is, therefore made that there is requirement for\n\nmore detailed categorization of transgender based on their\n\nbiological features and sexual orientation to assign them male or\n\nfemale gender identity and a need to formulate detailed\n\nguidelines on medical and psychological aspects on assigning\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                     9</span>\n\ngender identity to transgender for induction into gender specific\n\norganizations like the Armed Forces and the NCC. It is\n\ncontended that the said exercise comes within the prerogative of\n\nthe Central Government and till such detailed guidelines are\n\nformed, the enrollment of the petitioner to the NCC girls unit\n\nshould not be considered, since it would have wider adverse\n\nconsequence all over the nation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">6.    A counter affidavit is also placed on record on behalf of\n\nrespondents 4 to 7. It is contended that the petitioner had made\n\nan application to join the senior girls&#x27; wing of the NCC and this\n\napplication had been forwarded to the Commanding Officer to\n\nKerala Battalion NCC seeking clarification. It is stated that\n\nenrollment is to be carried out, taking note of the eligibility\n\ncriteria as stipulated in Section 6 of the NCC Act, 1948 (male\n\nand female gender only). It is stated at paragraphs 11, 12 and 15\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     &quot;11.It is humbly submitted that since the petitioner joined the\n     college identifying and claiming to be a transgender and\n     declaring that the petitioner belongs to transgender category\n     (Female). Being so, the Petitioner cannot tum around and claim that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                       10</span>\n\n     the Petitioner is to be enrolled as a cadet in the Girls Division\n     enrolment for which is open only to female gender. It is humbly\n     submitted that the Petitioner exhausted right to self-perceived gender\n     identity by choosing the same as &quot;Female&quot; and has taken admission\n     under the Transgender category (Female). Hence, she now falls\n     under the third gender category &quot;transgender (Female)&quot; and not the\n     &#x27;female&#x27; sex category, now being claimed by her.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     12. It is humbly submitted that a student can be enrolled in &quot;Girls\n     Division&quot; only if the student is admitted under the Female category in\n     the College. It may be noted that as per <a href=\"/doc/86462591/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 6 (2)</a> any student of\n     the female sex of any University or school may offer herself for\n     enrolment as a cadet in the Girls Division. For getting the benefit of\n     the Section 6(2) of the NCC Act 1948, the candidate has to be\n     enrolled under &#x27;female&#x27; category by the College.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     15.It is humbly submitted that one of the primary aim of NCC is to\n     groom the cadets for a future with the Army Forces whereas, as\n     such, there is no provision existing for entry of transgender\n     (Female/Male) in the Indian Armed Forces. Moreover, in case she is\n     permitted to join the NCC, she would entail herself to appear for\n     Service Selection Board through NCC &#x27;C&#x27; certificate scheme whereas\n     at present, she remains ineligible to join the Armed Forces.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">7.    An impleading petition has been placed on record by an\n\nNCC cadet through his father and guardian contending that the\n\ninterim direction issued by this Court is against the scheme of\n\nthe 2019 Act. It is stated that the right of a transgender person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                    11</span>\n\nas defined in <a href=\"/doc/188957708/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 2(k)</a> is only to a self perceived gender\n\nidentity and the person can be recognized only as a transgender.\n\nIt is stated that the person has no right to be declared as\n\nbelonging to his or her self perceived gender and therefore, the\n\nIdentity Card issued to the petitioner itself is bad. It is further\n\nstated that the NCC Act recognizes only persons belonging to\n\nthe male or female gender and since the petitioner is admittedly\n\na transgender, she cannot be enrolled in the NCC. It is submitted\n\nthat the petitioner has not approached the official respondents\n\nseeking induction of transgender students and that the request\n\nfor enrollment to a unit that only admits girls and boys in terms\n\nof the NCC Act is, therefore, misconceived. The contention that\n\nthe admission as well as the training in NCC units are gender\n\nspecific   is   also    supported   by   the   additionally   impleaded\n\nrespondent and it is contended that it is only after making\n\nprovisions in the NCC Act for inducting transgenders and after\n\nappropriate steps are taken for the induction and training of\n\nsuch transgender persons that the petitioner can be inducted\n\ninto the NCC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">8.    A reply affidavit has also been placed on record by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> W.P.(C).No.23404/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                           12</span>\n\npetitioner. It is submitted that the petitioner has a right to be\n\nrecognized as a transgender person under the Act and a further\n\nright to self perceived gender identity. It is stated that since the\n\npetitioner has undergone sex-reassignment surgery, there is no\n\nfurther impediment to her being treated as a transgender (trans-\n\nwoman) and being enrolled as an NCC cadet recognizing her self\n\nperceived gender identity as a female.

I notice that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1074158/\" id=\"a_32\">National Cadet Corps Act</a>\n\nrecognises NCC units and cadets only from among males and\n\nfemales. <a href=\"/doc/1074158/\" id=\"a_33\">The National Cadet Corps Act</a> is an enactment of the\n\nyear 1948. It originally provided for enrollment of only members\n\nof the male gender as members. Amendments have been effected\n\nto include a senior division for women cadets as well The further\n\nmarch of the times and the change in perceptions and the\n\ndeclarations by the Apex Court as well as the statutory\n\nenactments recognising the rights of the transgender persons as\n\nalso the right to a self-perceived identity have to be taken into\n\naccount by the respondents.     We cannot take recourse to the\n\noutdated provisions of a 1948 enactment to deal with the realities\n\nof life in the year 2021. The situation has to be viewed in the\n\nlight of the 2019 Act which recognises the right of transgender\n\npersons to a life with dignity and prohibits discrimination against\n\nthem.

In view of the specific provisions in the 2019 Act by which a\n\ntransgender person has a right to be recognized not only as a\n\ntransgender but also a right to self perceived gender identity, I\n\nam of the opinion that the petitioner who has opted for the female\n\ngender and has undergone sex reassignment surgeries for aiding\n\nher self perception as a member of the said gender would\n\ndefinitely be entitled to enrollment in the NCC unit reckoning her\n\nas a transgender and further as a member of her self perceived\n\ngender, that is, the female gender. The fact that the provisions of\n\nthe NCC Act do not recognize the third gender or that detailed\n\nguidelines are required to be drawn up for the integration of\n\npersons of the third gender into the Armed Forces or the National\n\nCadet Corps cannot, according to me, be a justification for\n\ndenying admission to the petitioner to the NCC unit on the basis\n\nof the Identity Card obtained by her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">15.
