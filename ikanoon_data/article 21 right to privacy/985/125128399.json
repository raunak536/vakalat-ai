But what is truth, a postmodern skeptic might\n         wonder. &quot;The theory of our Constitution is that the best test\n         of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:26:30 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   8</span>\n\n\n\n\n         the competition of the market.

Those who\n\n\n\n\n\n         hold to the idea that truth is a knowable if not always\n         verifiable concept are even most robust in their claim that\n         free expression in critical to finding truth. Related to truth is\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n         the idea that free expression is necessary to develop moral\n         virtue. In a world of extreme moral relativism this may be but\n         a facet of the &quot;market place of ideas&quot; metaphor, but however\n         our moral campass as calibrated our ability to make moral\n              rt\n         choices - to opt for good and reject evil - requires that we be\n         free to choose.     The process of moral deliberation often\n         involves the expression of views, only to reconsider them\n\n         when others reply or react to the expressed sentiments.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">         19.

Conceivably a\n        campaign   could    be    so    managed        and   so   aimed   at   the\n\n\n\n\n\n        sensibilities of a particular Judge and the matter pending\n        before him as to cross the forbidden line&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">        In the same case, JUSTICE MURPHY, in his concurring\n\n\n\n\n                                        of\n        opinion, said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">        A free press lies at the heart of our democracy and its\n        preservation is essential to the survival of liberty.

The only\n        possible exception is in the rare instance where the attack\n        might    reasonably      cause      a   real    impediment        to   the\n\n\n\n        administration     of    justice.   Unscrupulous          and   vindictive\n        criticism of the judiciary is regrettable. But Judges must not\n        retaliate by a summary suppression of such criticism for they\n\n\n\n\n        are bound by the command of the First Amendment. Any\n        summary suppression of unjust criticism carries with it an\n\n\n\n\n\n        ominous threat of summary suppression of all criticism. It is\n        to avoid that threat that the First Amendment, as I view it,\n        outlaws the summary contempt method of suppression.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">        Silence and a steady devotion to duty are the best answers to\n        irresponsible criticism and those Judges who feel the need for\n        giving a more visible demonstration of their feelings may take\n        advantage of various laws passed for that purpose, which do\n        not impinge upon a free press.

Look\n\n\n\n\n\n        at its newspapers-do they reflect diversity of opinions and\n        views, do they contain expression of dissent and criticism\n        against   governmental      policies    and     actions,   or   do   they\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n        obsequiously sing the praises of the government or lionize or\n        deify the ruler. The newspapers are the index of the true\n        character of the Government-whether if is democratic or\n        authoritarian. It was Mr. Justice Potter Stewart who said :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">             rt\n        &quot;Without an informed and free press, there cannot be an\n        enlightened people&quot;. Thus freedom of the press constitutes\n        one of the pillars of democracy and indeed lies at the\n\n        foundation of democratic Organisation and yet it is not\n        enumerated in so many terms as a fundamental right in\n        <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_16\">Article   19(1)</a>,   though     there    is   a   view   held     by   some\n        constitutional jurists that this freedom is too basic and\n\n\n\n        fundamental not to receive express mention in Part III of the\n        Constitution. But it has been held by this Court in several\n        decisions, of which we may mention only three, namely,\n\n\n\n\n        Express Newspapers&#x27; case, Sakal Newspapers case and Bennett\n        Coleman &amp; Co&#x27;s case, that freedom of the press is part of the\n\n\n\n\n\n        right of free speech and expression and is covered by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_17\">Article\n        19 (1) (a).</a> The, reason is that freedom of the press is nothing\n        but an aspect of freedom of speech and expression. It partakes\n\n\n\n\n\n        of the same basic nature and character and is indeed an\n        integral part of free speech and expression and perhaps it\n        would not be incorrect to say that it is the same right\n        applicable in relation to the press. So also, freedom of\n        circulation is necessarily involved in freedom of speech and\n        expression and is part of it and hence enjoys the protection of\n        <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19(1) (a).</a> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_31\"><a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_19\">Vide Ramesh Thappar v.

It would thus be seen that even if a right is not\n        specifically   named   in     <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_21\">Article    19(1)</a>,   it   may   still   be   a\n        fundamental right covered by some clause of that Article, if it\n\n\n\n\n\n        is an integral part of a named fundamental right or partakes of\n        the same basic nature and character as that fundamental\n        right. It is not enough that a right claimed by the petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n        flows or emanates from a named fwidamental right or that its\n        existence is necessary in order to make the exercise of the\n        named fundamental right meaningful and effective. Every\n        activity which facilitates the exercise of a named fundamental\n               rt\n        right is not necessarily comprehended in that fundamental\n        right nor can it be regarded as such merely because it may not\n        be   possible,    otherwise      to     effectively     exercise,     that\n\n        fundamental right. The contrary construction would lead to\n        incongruous results and the entire scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)</a>\n        which   confers    different    rights     and    sanctions     different\n        restrictions according to different standards depending upon.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">        the nature, of the right will be upset. What is necessary to be\n        seen is, and that is the test which must be applied, whether\n        the right claimed by the petitioner is an integral part of a\n\n\n\n\n        named fundamental right or partakes of the same basic nature\n        and character as the named fundamental right so that the\n\n\n\n\n\n        exercise of such right is in reality and substance nothing but\n        an instance of the exercise of the named fundamental right. If\n        this be the correct test, as we apprehend it is. the right to, go\n\n\n\n\n\n        abroad cannot in all circumstances be regarded as included in\n        freedom of speech and expression. Mr. Justice Douglas said in\n        Kent v. Dulles that &quot;freedom of movement across frontiers in\n        either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part of our\n        heritage. Travel abroad. like travel within the country, ay be\n        necessary for livelihood. It may be as close to the heart of the\n        individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads.\n        Freedom of movement is basic in our Scheme of values.&quot; And\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:26:30 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                  16</span>\n\n\n\n\n        what the learned Judge, said in regard to freedom of\n        movement in his country holds good in our country as well.\n        Freedom of movement has been a part of our ancient tradition\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">        which always upheld the dignity of man and saw in him the\n\n\n\n\n\n        embodiment    of   the   Divine.   The   Vedic   seers    knew    no\n        limitations either in the locomotion of the human body or in\n        the flight of the soul to higher planes of consciousness. Even\n\n\n\n\n\n        in the post-Upnishadic period, followed by the Buddhistic era\n        and the early centuries after Christ, the people of this country\n        went to foreign lands in pursuit of trade and business or in\n\n\n\n\n                                      of\n        search of knowledge or with a view to shedding on others the\n        light of knowledge imparted to them by their ancient sages\n        and seers. India expanded outside her borders: her ships\n        crossed the ocean and the fine superfluity of her wealth\n             rt\n        brimmed over to the East as well as to the West. He cultural\n        messengers and envoys spread her arts and epics in South\n        East Asia and her religious conquered China and Japan and\n\n        other Far Eastern countries and spread westward as far as\n        Palestine and Alexendria. Even at the end of the last and the\n        beginning of the present century, our people sailed across the\n        seas to settle down in the African countries. Freedom of\n\n\n\n        movement at home and abroad is a part of our heritage and, as\n        already pointed out, it is a highly cherished right essential to\n        the growth and development of the human personality and its\n\n\n\n\n        importance cannot be over emphasised. But it cannot be said\n        to be part of the right of free speech and expression. It is not\n\n\n\n\n\n        of the same basic nature and character as freedom of speech\n        and expression. When a person goes abroad, he may do so for a\n        variety of reasons and it may not necessarily and always be for\n\n\n\n\n\n        exercise of freedom of speech and expression. Every travel\n        abroad is not an exercise of right of free speech and\n        expression and it would not be correct to say that whenever\n        there is a restriction on the right to go abroad, ex necessitae\n        it involves violation of freedom of speech and expression. It is\n        no doubt true that going abroad may be necessary in a given\n        case for exercise of freedom of speech and expression, but\n        that does not make it an integral part of the right of free\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                           ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:26:30 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                 17</span>\n\n\n\n\n         speech and expression.

The\n\n\n\n\n\n        foundation of the judiciary is the trust and the confidence of\n        the people in its ability to deliver fearless and impartial\n        justice.

Lord Dening in his Book &quot;Road to\n\n\n\n        Justice&quot; observed that Press is the watchdog to see that every\n        trial is conducted fairly, openly and above board but the\n        watchdog may sometimes break loose and has to be punished\n\n\n\n\n        for misbehaviour.

Loss of confidence in institution of judiciary\n             rt\n        would be end of rule of law. Therefore, any act which has such\n        tendency deserves to be firmly curbed. For rule of law and\n        orderly society, a free responsible press and independent\n\n        judiciary are both indispensable.

Shortly\n        thereafter, as a result of widening of the power of judicial\n        review, the US Supreme Court preferred to test each case on\n\n\n\n\n\n        the touchstone of the rule of &#x27;clear- and-present-danger&#x27;.\n        However, application of this rule was unable to withstand the\n        pace of development of law and, therefore, through its judicial\n\n\n\n\n                                         of\n        pronouncements, the US Supreme Court applied the doctrine\n        of &#x27;balancing of interests&#x27;. The cases relating to speech did not\n        simply involve the rights of the offending speaker but\n        typically they presented a clash of several rights or a conflict\n               rt\n        between individual rights and necessary functions of the\n        Government. Justice Frankfurter often applied the above-\n        mentioned Balancing Formula and concluded that &quot;while the\n\n        court has emphasized the importance of &#x27;free speech&#x27;, it has\n        recognized that free speech is not in itself a touchstone. The\n        Constitution is not unmindful of other important interests,\n        such as public order, if free expression of ideas is not found to\n\n\n\n        be the overbalancing considerations.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">                 [4] The &#x27;balancing of interests&#x27; approach is basically\n        derived from Roscoe Pound&#x27;s theories of social engineering.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">        Pound had insisted that his structure of public, social and\n        individual interests are all, in fact, individual interests looked\n\n\n\n\n\n        at from different points of view for the purpose of clarity.\n        Therefore, in order to make the system work properly, it is\n        essential that when interests are balanced, all claims must be\n\n\n\n\n\n        translated into the same level and carefully labelled. Thus, a\n        social   interest    may   not       be   balanced    against   individual\n        interest, but only against another social interest. The author\n        points out that throughout the heyday of the clear-and-\n        present-danger and preferred position doctrines, the language\n        of   balancing,     weighing    or    accommodating        interests    was\n        employed as an integral part of the libertarian position.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:26:31 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                  42</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">        [Freedom of Speech: The Supreme Court and Judicial Review,\n        by Martin Shapiro, 1966]\n                [5] Even in the United States there is a recurring debate\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">        in modern First Amendment Jurisprudence as to whether\n\n\n\n\n\n        First Amendment rights are &#x27;absolute&#x27; in the sense that the\n        Government may not abridge them at all or whether the First\n        Amendment requires the &#x27;balancing of competing interests&#x27; in\n\n\n\n\n\n        the sense that free speech values and the Government&#x27;s\n        competing justification must be isolated and weighted in each\n        case.

The freedom of speech and expression is\n\n        regarded as the first condition of liberty. It occupies a\n        preferred position in the hierarchy of liberties, giving succour\n        and protection to all other liberties. It has been truly said that\n        it is the mother of all other liberties. Freedom of speech plays\n\n\n\n        a crucial role in the formation of public opinion on social,\n        political and economic matters. It has been described as a\n        &quot;basic human right&quot;, &quot;a natural right&quot; and the like. With the\n\n\n\n\n        development of law in India, the right to freedom of speech\n        and expression has taken within its ambit the right to receive\n\n\n\n\n\n        information as well as the right of press.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">               [12]    In     order     to    effectively   consider    the     rival\n        contentions raised and in the backdrop of the factual matrix,\n\n\n\n\n\n        it will be of some concern for this Court to examine the\n        constitutional scheme and the historical background of the\n        relevant Articles relating to the right to freedom of speech and\n        expression in India. The framers of our Constitution, in\n        unambiguous terms, granted the right to freedom of speech\n        and expression and the right to assemble peaceably and\n        without arms.

Thus, restrictive contempt of court laws are\n\n\n\n\n         generally considered incompatible with the constitutional\n         guarantee of free speech. However, in view of cases, like O.J.\n\n\n\n\n\n         Simpson, Courts have evolved procedural devices aimed at\n         neutralizing the effect of prejudicial publicity like change of\n         venue, ordering re-trial, reversal of conviction on appeal\n\n\n\n\n\n         (which, for the sake of brevity, is hereinafter referred to as\n         &quot;neutralizing devices&quot;). It may be stated that even in US as of\n         date, there is no absolute rule against &quot;prior restraint&quot; and its\n         necessity has been recognized, albeit in exceptional cases [see\n         Near v.

In England, Parliament is supreme. Absent\n        written constitution, Parliament can by law limit the freedom\n\n\n\n        of speech. The view in England, on interpretation, has been\n        and is even today, even after the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_84\">Human Rights Act, 1998</a> that\n        the right of free speech or right to access the courts for the\n\n\n\n\n        determination of legal rights cannot be excluded, except by\n        clear words of the statute. An important aspect needs to be\n\n\n\n\n\n        highlighted. Under <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 4(2)</a> of the 1981 Act, courts are\n        expressly empowered to postpone publication of any report of\n        the proceedings or any part of the proceedings for such period\n\n\n\n\n\n        as the court thinks fit for avoiding a substantial risk of\n        prejudice   to   the     administration   of   justice   in    those\n        proceedings. Why is such a provision made in the Act of\n        1981? One of the reasons is that in <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 2</a> of the 1981 Act,\n        strict liability has been incorporated (except in <a href=\"/doc/1915023/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 6</a>\n        whose scope has led to conflicting decisions on the question\n        of intention). The basis of the strict liability contempt under\n        the 1981 Act is the publication of &quot;prejudicial&quot; material. The\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                           ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:26:31 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                 48</span>\n\n\n\n\n        definition of publication is also very wide. It is true that the\n        1981 Act has restricted the strict liability contempt to a fewer\n        circumstances as compared to cases falling under common\n\n\n\n\n                                                                .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">        law. However, contempt is an offence sui generis. At this\n\n\n\n\n\n        stage, it is important to note that the strict liability rule is\n        the rule of law whereby a conduct or an act may be treated as\n        contempt of court if it tends to interfere with the course of\n\n\n\n\n\n        justice in particular legal proceedings, regardless of intent to\n        do so. Sometimes, fair and accurate reporting of the trial (say\n        a murder trial) would nonetheless give rise to substantial risk\n\n\n\n\n                                     of\n        of prejudice not in the pending trial but in the later or\n        connected trials. In such cases, there is no other practical\n        means short of postponement orders that is capable of\n        avoiding such risk of prejudice to the later or connected trials.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">             rt\n        Thus, postponement order not only safeguards fairness of the\n        later or connected trials, it prevents possible contempt.

According to Borrie &amp; Lowe on\n        the &quot;Law of Contempt&quot;, the extent to which prejudgment by\n        publication of the outcome of a proceedings (referred to by the\n        House of Lords in Sunday Times&#x27;s case) may still apply in\n\n\n\n        certain cases.

Thus,         narrowly\n        focussed prior restraints            are provided for, on either a\n        statutory or judicial basis. It is important to note that in the\n             rt\n        common-law approach the protection of sanctity of legal\n        proceedings     as   a    part      of   administration         of   justice    is\n        guaranteed by institution of contempt proceedings. According\n\n        to <a href=\"/doc/531094/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 6(2)</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights,\n        presumption     of   innocence           needs   to   be    protected.         The\n        European Courts of Human Rights has ruled on several\n        occasions that the presumption of innocence should be\n\n\n\n        employed as a normative parameter in the matter of balancing\n        the right to a fair trial as against freedom of speech. The\n        German Courts have accordingly underlined the need to\n\n\n\n\n        balance the presumption of innocence with freedom of\n        expression based on employment of the above normative\n\n\n\n\n\n        parameter of presumption of innocence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1256541\" id=\"span_122\">France and Australia\n        have taken a similar stance. <a href=\"/doc/531094/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 6(2)</a> of the European\n        Convention of Human Rights imposes a positive obligation on\n\n\n\n\n\n        the State to take action to protect the presumption of\n        innocence from interference by non-State actors.

The\n        traditional common law rule governing publication bans that\n\n\n\n        there be real and substantial risk of interference with the right\n        to a fair trial emphasized the right to a fair trial over the free\n        expressions interests of those affected by the ban.

The Canadian Courts have,\n        thus, shortened the distance between the US legal experience\n\n\n\n\n\n        and the common-law experiences in other countries. It is\n        important to highlight that in Dagenais, the publication ban\n        was sought under common law jurisdiction of the Superior\n        Court and the matter was decided under the common law rule\n        that the Courts of Record have inherent power to defer the\n        publication. In R. v. Mentuck, 2001 3 SCR 442 that Dagenais\n        principle was extended to the presumption of openness and to\n        duty of court to balance the two rights.

In essence, the freedom of expression\n\n\n\n\n\n        embodies the right to know. However, under our Constitution\n        no right in Part III is absolute. Freedom of expression is not\n        an absolute value under our Constitution. It must not be\n\n\n\n\n\n        forgotten that no single value, no matter exalted, can bear the\n        full burden of upholding a democratic system of government.\n        Underlying    our      Constitutional       system     are   a   number    of\n\n\n\n\n                                          of\n        important values, all of which help to guarantee our liberties,\n        but in ways which sometimes conflict. Under our Constitution,\n        probably,    no values      are absolute.         All important values,\n        therefore, must be qualified and balanced against, other\n             rt\n        important, and often competing, values. This process of\n        definition, qualification and balancing is as much required\n        with respect to the value of freedom of expression as it is for\n\n        other values.

One aspect needs to be highlighted. The shadow\n        of the law of contempt hangs over our jurisprudence. The\n        media, in several cases in India, is the only representative of\n        the public to bring to the notice of the court issues of public\n        importance      including       governance        deficit,     corruption,\n        drawbacks in the system. Keeping in mind the important role\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:26:31 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                     57</span>\n\n\n\n\n        of the media, Courts             have evolved several            neutralizing\n        techniques including postponement orders subject to the twin\n        tests of necessity and proportionality to be applied in cases\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">        where there is real and substantial risk of prejudice to the\n\n\n\n\n\n        proper administration of justice or to the fairness of trial.\n        Such orders would also put the Media to notice about possible\n        contempt. However, it would be open to Media to challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n        such orders in appropriate proceedings. Contempt is an\n        offence sui generis. Purpose of Contempt Law is not only to\n        punish. Its object is to preserve the sanctity of administration\n\n\n\n\n                                         of\n        of justice and the integrity of the pending proceeding. Thus,\n        the postponement order is not a punitive measure, but a\n        preventive measure as explained hereinabove. Therefore, in\n        our view, such orders of postponement, in the absence of any\n               rt\n        other alternative measures such as change of venue or\n        postponement of trial, satisfy the requirement of justification\n        under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 19(2)</a> and they also help the Courts to balance\n\n        conflicting societal interests of right to know vis-a-vis another\n        societal interest in fair administration of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">                47.
