While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                     30</span>\n\n\nvictim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless\n\nfemale. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it shakes the\n\nvery core of her life. By no means can a rape victim be called an\n\naccomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the\n\nvictim, and therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher\n\npedestal than an injured witness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">54          Rape is the most hated crime, which tantamounts to\n\na serious blow to the supreme honour of a woman, and offends\n\nboth, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and\n\nphysical harm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks.\n\nGang rape is all the more a serious and heinous offence.\n\n55          The committal of rape is a beastly act and takes out\n\nthe life from the life of victim. The scars of rape always remain\n\nengraved in her mind and she cannot overcome throughout her\n\nlife. Rape leaves physical as well as mental scars on the victim.\n\nPhysical wounds may heal up, but the mental scars, though\n\nless visible are more difficult to treat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">56          Rape is a crime not against an individual but a\n\ncrime which destroys the basic equilibrium of the social\n\natmosphere. &quot;Rape&quot; not only lowers the dignity of a woman but\n\nalso mars her reputation. The plight of the woman and shock\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                    31</span>\n\n\nsuffered by the victim can be well visualized. The victim of rape\n\ngrows with traumatic experience and an unforgettable shame\n\nhaunted by the memory of the disaster forcing her to a state of\n\nterrifying melancholia. The torment on the victim has the\n\npotentiality to corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilized\n\nsociety. It has been rightly said that whereas a murderer\n\ndestroys the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and\n\ndefiles the soul of a helpless female.

Sexual violence, apart from\n           being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the\n           right of privacy and sanctity of a woman.

The consequential\n          death is more horrendous. It is to be kept in mind that an\n          offence against the body of a woman lowers her dignity\n          and mars her reputation.

Keeping the above basic features of the offence alleged\nagainst the appellants in mind, when we make reference\nto the evidence of the so called &#x27;sterling witness&#x27; of the\nprosecution, namely, the prosecutrix, according to her\nversion in the chief examination when the persons who\nknocked at the door, were enquired they claimed that they\nwere from the crime branch which was not mentioned in\nthe FIR.

While in the complaint, the\naccused alleged to have stealthily taken the gold chain\nand wrist watch which were lying near the T.V. It was\nfurther alleged that the appellant in Criminal Appeal\nNo.2486 of 2009 was having a knife in his hand which\nstatement was not found in the complaint.

In our considered opinion, the &#x27;sterling witness&#x27; should\nbe of a very high quality and caliber whose version\nshould, therefore, be unassailable. The Court considering\nthe version of such witness should be in a position to\naccept it for its face value without any hesitation. To test\nthe quality of such a witness, the status of the witness\nwould be immaterial and what would be relevant is the\ntruthfulness of the statement made by such a witness.\nWhat would be more relevant would be the consistency of\nthe statement right from the starting point till the end,\nnamely, at the time when the witness makes the initial\nstatement and ultimately before the Court. It should be\nnatural and consistent with the case of the prosecution\nqua the accused. There should not be any prevarication in\nthe version of such a witness. The witness should be in a\nposition to withstand the cross- examination of any length\nand howsoever strenuous it may be and under no\ncircumstance should give room for any doubt as to the\nfactum of the occurrence, the persons involved, as well as,\nthe sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation\nwith each and everyone of other supporting material such\nas the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of\noffence committed, the scientific evidence and the expert\nopinion. The said version should consistently match with\nthe version of every other witness. It can even be stated\nthat it should be akin to the test applied in the case of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                     39</span>\n\n\n           circumstantial evidence where there should not be any\n           missing link in the chain of circumstances to hold the\n           accused guilty of the offence alleged against him. Only if\n           the version of such a witness qualifies the above test as\n           well as all other similar such tests to be applied, it can be\n           held that such a witness can be called as a &#x27;sterling\n           witness&#x27; whose version can be accepted by the Court\n           without any corroboration and based on which the guilty\n           can be punished. To be more precise, the version of the\n           said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should\n           remain intact while all other attendant materials, namely,\n           oral, documentary and material objects should match the\n           said version in material particulars in order to enable the\n           Court trying the offence to rely on the core version to sieve\n           the other supporting materials for holding the offender\n           guilty of the charge alleged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120726166\" id=\"span_50\">70        The credit worthiness of the testimony of the victim\n\nhas already been discussed in the earlier part of the judgment.\n\nThe victim when put to test as <a href=\"/doc/120726166/\" id=\"a_28\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/120726166/\" id=\"a_29\">Rai Sandeep\n\nDeepu</a> case (supra), fails the test of being sterling witness of a\n\nhigh quality and caliber whose version should therefore be\n\nunassailable and such quality should be in a position to accept\n\nit on face value without any hesitation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">71         Having perused the complete statement of the\n\nprosecutrix, we really do not find the same to be trustworthy\n\nand rather the same does not inspire confidence at all.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                    40</span>\n\n\n72         It is the admitted case of the prosecution, as stated\n\nby the prosecutrix herself, that the wife of the appellant was her\n\n&#x27;kangan&#x27; sister and they had been frequently visiting each\n\nothers&#x27; houses, then why would the appellant enter the house of\n\nthe prosecutrix through the window, that too, of the first floor.\n\n73         Another     question,    which     remains    completely\n\nunanswered, is that why the prosecutrix did not run or make an\n\nendeavour to run when the appellant was taking off his clothes.\n\nAfter all, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant\n\nwas in any way armed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">74         What is still further intriguing is that if the alleged\n\nrape had been witnessed by the daughter of the prosecutrix,\n\nthen why daughter was not examined and further                  why\n\ndaughter was not asked to inform the neighbours or raise hue\n\nand cry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">75         Admittedly,    scene    of   the   alleged   crime   was\n\nvideographed on the next day of the incident and the same has\n\nbeen clearly created by the police so as to give it as resemblance\n\nof resistance on the part of the prosecutrix, whereas in her\n\nmedical examination, no injuries have been found on her person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                    41</span>\n\n\nincluding her throat, which was alleged to have been pressed by\n\nthe appellant resulting in gagging.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">76           What still remains mystery is as to why the\n\nprosecutrix did not raise an alarm and why such alarm was not\n\nheard   by   the   neighbours    when   the   locality,   where   the\n\nprosecutrix was residing, is inhabited one.\n\n77           Apart from the above, it is the specific case of the\n\nprosecutrix that she tried to contact her husband over the\n\ntelephone and having failed to do so, she then contacted\n\nemployer of her husband (PW-2) at around 6.00-6.30 P.M.,\n\nhowever, the phone details produced on record by PW-19\n\nDevinder Verma completely belie the version put forth by the\n\nprosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">78           A perusal of the phone calls details Ex.

It must, further, be borne in mind\n            that the broad principle is that an injured witness was\n            present at the time when the incident happened and that\n            ordinarily such a witness would not tell a lie as to the\n            actual assailants, but there is no presumption or any\n            basis for assuming that the statement of such a witness is\n            always      correct   or   without     any    embellishment   or\n            exaggeration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195453\" id=\"span_58\">87          In <a href=\"/doc/195453/\" id=\"a_32\">Abbas Ahmed Choudhary Vs.
