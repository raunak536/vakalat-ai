Respondent\nNo.4 was required to pay the agreed amount for the high seas sale by\nentering into a written agreement. However, only an oral agreement was\nentered into by and between the petitioner and respondent No.4.\nUnfortunately, without making any payment towards the high seas sale\nbut on the basis of the oral agreement, two bills of entry dated\n10.12.2019 were filed by respondent No.4 in respect of the two imported\nconsignments.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.    It is stated that after filing of the bills of entry, respondent No.4\ndeclined to make the agreed payment and instead requested for\ncancellation of the high seas sale orally agreed upon by and between the\nparties. Respondent No.4 however assured the petitioner that it would\nco-operate in getting no objection certificate (NOC) and for substitution\nof the name of the petitioner in the two bills of entry.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">6.    Following the same, joint request was made by both the petitioner\nand respondent No.4 for amendment to the two bills of entry by\nsubstituting the name of the petitioner in place of respondent No.4. It is\nstated that office of respondent No.2 allowed such amendment and name\nof the petitioner was entered as the importer in the two bills of entry.\nFurther clearance of the imported goods was sought for by the petitioner\non payment of duty on merit without seeking any exemption. Following\nthe same, petitioner approached the office of respondent No.2 for\npermitting clearance of the consignments on payment of customs duty\non merit.

Petitioner has questioned the legality and validity of such seizure\nby contending that the impugned seizure memo does not comply with\nthe requirements of <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_2\">section 110</a> of the Customs Act, 1962 (&#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_3\">Customs\nAct</a>&#x27; hereinafter). Besides, it is contended that such illegal seizure has\ncaused serious prejudice to the petitioner as it is incurring heavy\ndetention and demurrage charges every day since the seizure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">9.    Aggrieved, present writ petition has been filed seeking the relief\nas indicated above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">10.   Respondent Nos.1 and 2 in their affidavit in reply have taken the\nstand that respondent No.4 had filed two bills of entry bearing\nNos.6020098 and 6022801 both dated 10.12.2019 by claiming the\nbenefit of Notification No.25/99-Customs dated 28.02.1999 for import\nof the consignments which were pending for out of charge clearance at\nNhava Sheva Port. The importer through its customs house agent\nrequested vide letter dated 18.12.2019 to amend the said two bills of\nentry enclosing therewith letters of both the buyer and seller regarding\ncancellation of high seas sale. Accordingly, the two bills of entry were\namended on 18.12.2019 by changing the name of the importer from M/s.\nChandrashekhar Industries (respondent No.4) to M/s. Nikom Copper and\nConductors Private Limited (petitioner). The amended bills of entry\nwere filed on merit rate of duty without claiming benefit of Notification\nNo.25/99-Customs dated 28.02.1999.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">10.1. Central Intelligence Unit, Nhava Sheva vide letter dated\n23.12.2019 made a request that any amendment of 15 bills of entry as\nmentioned in the letter should not be considered. These 15 bills of entry\nincluded the two bills of entry of the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">10.2. Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Ahmedabad vide letter\ndated 23.04.2020 informed that a case against respondent No.4 was\nbooked for wrongful availment of benefit under Notification No.25/99-\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                     3/21</span>\n                                                            WPST3834_20.odt\n\nCustoms dated 28.02.1999. As such DRI requested to nullify the\namendments made in the two bills of entry dated 10.12.2019. Request of\nDRI to cancel the amendment was accepted by the department on\n29.04.2020. Following such acceptance of request, the importer in\nrespect of the said two bills of entry became respondent No.4.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">10.3. It is stated that the act of cancellation of high seas sale arose after\n16.12.2019 when the premises of the importer, high seas seller and the\nconcerned customs broker were searched by DRI, Ahmedabad and a\ncase was booked against respondent No.4. When the petitioner came to\nknow about such search, it approached the Nhava Sheva customs\nauthorities on 18.12.2019 for amendment in the two bills of entry.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">10.4. Since the amendments were done in a fraudulent manner and not\nas per law, Joint Director, DRI, Ahmedabad vide letter dated 23.04.2020\nrequested the Joint Commissioner of Customs, Nhava Sheva to nullify\nthe said amendment in the two bills of entry. Accordingly, the Joint\nCommissioner informed vide letter dated 04.06.2020 that the concerned\nCommissioner of Customs had approved to nullify the amendments\nwhereafter respondent No.4 has become the importer in respect of the\ntwo bills of entry dated 10.12.2019.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">10.5. While contesting the prayer of the petitioner for release of the\nseized goods, respondent Nos.1 and 2 have however placed reliance on\n<a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_4\">section 110-A</a> of the Customs Act taking the stand that the goods can be\nreleased provisionally under the aforesaid provision.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">11.   Respondent No.3 in his affidavit in reply has stated that\nintelligence input was gathered by DRI, Sub-Regional Unit, Vapi that 3\nproprietorship firms including respondent No.4 were involved in\ndiversion of the imported materials and which were not used for\nmanufacturing of lead wire for electronic parts as required under\nNotification No.25/99-Customs dated 28.02.1999. Further intelligence\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                         4/21</span>\n                                                          WPST3834_20.odt\n\ninput was gathered that respondent No.4 was working under the control\nof Shri. Jayant Shantilal Mirani, owner of the petitioner. Proprietor of\nanother proprietorship firm M/s. Shine Metal Industries, Shri Kuldeep\nRamesh Kshirsagar admitted in his statement before the DRI authorities\nthat he had never manufactured lead wire for electronic parts in his\nfactory, further admitting that most of the imported copper wire rods\nwere sold in the open market.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">11.2. In the course of search operations, 1607 kg of copper wire having\nvalue of Rs.9,85,000.00 were seized on 16.12.2019 from the factory\npremises of respondent No.4 as it was not eligible to avail the benefit of\nNotification No.25/1999-Customs dated 28.02.1999.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">11.3. The two bills of entry dated 10.12.2019 were filed by respondent\nNo.4 claiming benefit of the said notification. Deputy Director, DRI,\nSurat vide letter dated 17.12.2019 requested the customs authorities at\nNhava Sheva to put on hold the live consignments of respondent No.4\nfor examination. The two bills of entry were amended on 18.12.2019\nwhereby name of the importer was changed from M/s. Chandrashekhar\nIndustries (respondent No.4) to M/s. Nikom Copper and Conductors\nPrivate Limited (petitioner). The amended bills of entry were filed on\nmerit rate of duty without claiming benefit of Notification No.25/99-\nCustoms dated 28.02.1999.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">11.4. The held consignments covered by the two bills of entry were\njointly examined by officials of DRI, Vapi and Nhava Sheva customs\nauthorities on 09.01.2020 whereafter the seizure was made on\n09.01.2020. Claim of the petitioner that it had entered into oral\nagreement with respondent No.4 for high seas sale of the consignments\nhas been disputed and denied. It is submitted that there is no question of\nany oral agreement in high seas sale. It is the contention of respondent\nNo.3 that respondent No.4 was working under the control of Shri. Jayant\nShantilal Mirani who was the actual owner of the high seas seller i.e.,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                      5/21</span>\n                                                           WPST3834_20.odt\n\nthe petitioner. The act of cancellation of high seas sale was done after\n16.12.2019 when the premises of the importer, high seas seller and the\nconcerned customs broker were searched and a case was registered\nagainst respondent No.4. In this connection, reference has been made to\nthe statement of the customs broker who admitted that it was not correct\nto amend the bills of entry on 18.12.2019 when the consignments were\nput on hold by DRI on 17.12.2019.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">12.   An affidavit has been filed on behalf of respondent No.4 by Smt.\nVijaya Surendra Salekar. She has stated that her husband Surendra\nShankar Salekar was the sole proprietor of M/s. Chandrashekhar\nIndustries i.e., respondent No.4 which was engaged in the business\nrelating to copper wires. She has stated that her husband Surendra\nShankar Salekar had committed suicide on 16.12.2019 which has caused\ngreat distress to her from which she has not been able to recover.\nAccording to her, her husband had conducted business activity under the\nsupervision of Shri. Anil Anand Satpute but after the death of her\nhusband, all the business activities have been closed down. Being a\nhouse wife in distress, she has stated that she is unable to understand the\ncomplex issues involved in the case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">13.   In its rejoinder affidavit petitioner has denied all the allegations\nmade against it and has reiterated that the impugned seizure of the\nimported goods is ex-facie illegal and without jurisdiction. It has denied\nthat respondent No.4 and two other firms were working under the\ncontrol of Shri. Jayant Shantilal Mirani, owner of the petitioner.\nPetitioner had commenced business in the year 2017 whereas respondent\nNo.4 was in existence since much before. The only relationship between\npetitioner and respondent No.4 and the two firms was that of high seas\nseller and high seas buyers. Except sale of goods on high seas, petitioner\nhad no other relationship with respondent No.4 and the other two firms.\nRegarding cancellation of the amendment to the bills of entry it is\nsubmitted that the same was done without any notice or hearing. In any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                       6/21</span>\n                                                          WPST3834_20.odt\n\nevent, there is no power or jurisdiction vested in the Commissioner of\nCustoms to nullify an amendment in a bill of entry under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_5\">Customs\nAct</a>. That apart, decision of the Commissioner to cancel the amendment\nwas not his own independent decision after proper application of mind\nbut was taken under the direction of DRI. Therefore, cancellation of the\namendment to the bills of entry is a nullity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">14.   Mr. Shah, learned counsel for the petitioner at the outset submits\nthat the impugned seizure is ex-facie without jurisdiction and therefore,\nper se illegal. Referring to <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_6\">section 110</a> of the Customs Act, he submits\nthat the sine qua non for seizure of goods is reason to believe by the\nproper officer that the imported goods are liable to confiscation. He\nsubmits that the seizure memo does not record any reason to believe that\nthe goods were liable to be confiscated. Referring to <a href=\"/doc/1384041/\" id=\"a_7\">section 111</a> of the\nCustoms Act, he submits that imported goods can be confiscated only\nunder that provision which has a number of clauses but none of the\nclauses of <a href=\"/doc/1384041/\" id=\"a_8\">section 111</a> would be attracted to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. While denying the allegations made against the petitioner in\nthe affidavits filed by respondent Nos.1 and 2 on the one hand and by\nrespondent No.3 on the other hand, he submits that the seizure memo\nmust be capable of standing on its own; its validity must be judged from\nthe reasons mentioned in the seizure memo itself. Furnishing of reasons\nsubsequently to justify the seizure cannot validate an invalid seizure\nthough the grounds given in the affidavit are wholly incorrect and\nuntenable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">14.1. Mr. Shah submits that even if the averments made in the affidavits\nare taken as true, nowhere it is stated therein that the seized goods are\nliable to confiscation. Petitioner has not claimed any exemption or\nconcession in respect of the imported goods. Rather petitioner has\nsought for assessment of the imported goods on payment of full duty as\nper applicable tariff. Therefore, even clause (o) of <a href=\"/doc/1384041/\" id=\"a_9\">section 111</a> which is\nthe only provision having a remote relatability would not be applicable.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                     7/21</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">                                                          WPST3834_20.odt\n\n\n\n14.2. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also strongly argued that\nthe bills of lading in respect of the imported consignments are in the\nname of the petitioner and in its possession. Those were never endorsed\nin favour of respondent No.4. Thus, petitioner clearly had and continues\nto have title over the goods. Therefore, respondent No.4 could not have\nfiled the bills of entry in respect of the said goods. As such those were\nrightly amended on the request of both the parties. Contention of\nrespondent Nos.1 to 3 that after cancellation of the amendment to the\nbills of entry, respondent No.4 has become the owner or importer of the\ngoods has been denied      and disputed. Not only such contention is\nfactually and legally untenable, cancellation of amendment is without\njurisdiction and in gross violation of the principles of natural justice.\nTherefore, such cancellation would be a nullity. In any case, when the\nseizure itself is bad in law, consequential cancellation of amendment to\nthe bills of entry would be of no legal consequence. Besides, mere\nallegation that amendments to the bills of entry were done fraudulently\nwould not suffice which in any event is not correct, he submits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">15.   Mr. J. B. Mishra, learned counsel for respondent Nos.1 and 2 has\nplaced reliance on the affidavit filed by the said respondents and submits\nthat office of respondent No.2 had carried out cancellation of\namendment on the basis of inputs received from DRI authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">16.   Mr. Venegaonkar, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has\nstrongly opposed the submissions of Mr. Shah and contends that the\nseizure was done in view of overwhelming materials gathered by the\nrespondents regarding the illegal activity of petitioner, respondent No.4\nand two other firms in diverting the imported goods to the open market\nafter availing exemption and concession under Notification No.25/99-\nCustoms dated 28.02.1999. Responding to the arguments of Mr. Shah\nthat the impugned seizure does not record any reason to believe that the\ngoods were liable to confiscation, he submits that the seizure memo has\nto be read together with the panchnama which clearly mentioned that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                      8/21</span>\n                                                          WPST3834_20.odt\n\nthere was contravention of the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_10\">Customs Act</a> in which event the goods are\nliable to be confiscated. His further contention is that petitioner had\nresorted to amendment of the two bills of entry after it became aware of\nthe search operations carried out by the DRI in the premises of\nrespondent No.4 and two other firms and after a case was registered\nagainst respondent No.4. Such amendments of the bills of entry were not\nbona fide and were rightly cancelled by the respondents.

The two provisos are not relevant for the present deliberation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">What is relevant here is the parent or main provision of sub-section (1).\nSub-section (1) makes it abundantly clear that if the proper officer has\nreason to believe that any goods are liable to confiscation under the\n<a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_14\">Customs Act</a>, he may seize such goods. Thus, it is the proper officer who\nmust have reason to believe that the goods in question are liable to\nconfiscation under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_15\">Customs Act</a>. Once he forms such a belief then he\ni.e., the proper officer who has formed the belief may seize such goods.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">21.1. Therefore, formation of reason to believe by the proper officer\nthat the goods in question are liable to confiscation under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_16\">Customs\nAct</a> is the condition precedent for invoking the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_17\">section\n110</a> to seize such goods. Having reason to believe by the proper officer\nthat any goods are liable to confiscation is the sine qua non for exercise\nof the power of seizure. The expression &#x27;reason to believe&#x27; is an\nexpression of considerable import and in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_18\">Customs Act</a>,\nconfers jurisdiction upon the proper officer to seize goods. This\nexpression finds place in a number of statutes - fiscal, penal, etc.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                          11/21</span>\n                                                            WPST3834_20.odt\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">22.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1300646\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/1300646/\" id=\"a_19\">Calcutta Discount Company Limited Vs.

As per the said provision,\nif the Income Tax Officer had reason to believe that by reason of the\nomission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his\nincome or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his\nassessment for that year, income chargeable to income tax had escaped\nassessment for that year or had been under-assessed or granted excessive\nrelief, he could serve a notice upon the assessee and proceed to assess or\nre-assess such income but of course within the limitation period\nmentioned therein. It is in that context, Supreme Court held that the\nexpression &#x27;reason to believe&#x27; postulates belief and the existence of\nreasons for that belief. The belief must be held in good faith: it cannot be\nmerely a pretence. The expression does not mean a purely subjective\nsatisfaction of the Income Tax Officer. The above expression\ncontemplates existence of reasons on which the belief is founded and not\nmerely a belief in the existence of reasons inducing the belief. In other\nwords, the Income Tax Officer must on information at his disposal\nbelieve that income had been under-assessed by reason of failure to fully\nand truly disclose all material facts necessary for assessment. Such a\nbelief is not to be based on mere suspicion; it must be founded upon\ninformation.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"537600\" id=\"span_13\">23.

The Income Tax Officer may act on direct or circumstantial\nevidence but not on mere suspicion, gossip or rumour. The Income Tax\nOfficer would be acting without jurisdiction if the reason for his belief\nthat the conditions are satisfied does not exist or is not material or\nrelevant to the belief.

Finally, in <a href=\"/doc/380958/\" id=\"a_26\">Income Tax Officer Vs.

Once there exists reasonable grounds for the Income\nTax Officer to form such belief, that would be sufficient to clothe him\nwith jurisdiction. Sufficiency of the grounds, however, is not justiciable.\nThe expression &#x27;reason to believe&#x27; does not mean a purely subjective\nsatisfaction on the part of the Income Tax Officer. The reason must be\nheld in good faith and cannot be a mere pretence. It is open to a court to\nexamine whether the reasons for the formation of the belief have a\nrational connection with or a relevant bearing on the formation of the\nbelief and are not extraneous or irrelevant. Elaborating further, Supreme\nCourt held that rational connection postulates that there must be a direct\nnexus or live link between the material coming to the notice of the\nIncome Tax Officer and the formation of his belief that there has been\nescapement of income from assessment in that particular year.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/503614/\" id=\"a_27\">Prashant S. Joshi Vs.

As per <a href=\"/doc/511030/\" id=\"a_31\">section 147</a>, if the\nAssessing Officer has reason to believe that any income chargeable to\ntax has escaped assessment for any assessment year, he may assess or re-\nassess such income and also any other income chargeable to tax which\nhas escaped assessment and which comes to his notice subsequently in\nthe course of the re-assessment proceedings. This Court observed that\nthe basic postulate which underlines <a href=\"/doc/511030/\" id=\"a_32\">section 147</a> is formation of the\nbelief by the Assessing Officer that any income chargeable to tax has\nescaped assessment for any assessment year. In other words, the\nAssessing Officer must have reason to believe that income chargeable to\ntax for a particular assessment year has escaped assessment for the said\nyear. The reasons which are recorded by the Assessing Officer for re-\nopening an assessment are the only reasons which can be considered\nwhen the formation of the belief is impugned. Recording of reasons\ndistinguishes an objective from a subjective exercise of power and is a\ncheck against arbitrary exercise of power. The reasons which are\nrecorded cannot be supplemented subsequently by affidavits.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1014484\" id=\"span_20\">27.

Supreme Court has opined that the said\nexpression does not connote the subjective satisfaction of the officer\nconcerned.

Though sufficiency of the\ngrounds is not justiciable, the grounds must be reflected in the order. The\nseizure memo did not indicate that the proper officer was possessed of\nany material to form the opinion that the vessel was liable for\nconfiscation.

Having noticed the above, we may now advert to the panchnama\ndated 09.01.2020. This panchnama was drawn at the premises where the\nseizure memo was made. It was signed by two panchas i.e., Shri. Chetan\nTukaram Mundhe and Shri. Mayur Krushna Patil. It was drawn by Shri.\nAmit Kumar Sharma, Investigating Officer, Central Investigation Unit at\nthe Nhava Sheva Port. After narrating the imports and amendment to the\nbills of entry, it was recorded that the goods which were de-stuffed from\nthe containers were imported under Notification No.25/1999-Customs\ndated 28.02.1999 by the original importer M/s. Chandrashekhar\nIndustries (respondent No.4) though presently the name of importer on\nthe two bills of entry was M/s. Nikom Copper and Conductors Private\nLimited (petitioner). The officer informed the panchas that respondent\nNo.4 had contravened the provisions of the said notification dated\n28.02.1999 by misusing it. Hence, the officer informed that the copper\ncoils were liable to be seized under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_42\">Customs Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">31.   From a conjoint reading of the seizure memo and the panchnama,\nboth dated 09.01.2020, it is apparent that seizure was made by one officer\n(Uma Nath Chaudhary) whereas the panchnama was drawn by another\nofficer (Amit Kumar Sharma). Assuming that both the officers are proper\nofficers in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1635766/\" id=\"a_43\">section 110(1)</a> of the Customs Act, there is no\nrecording or mentioning by Uma Nath Chaudhary in the seizure memo\nthat he had reasons to believe that the goods in question were liable to\nconfiscation and hence may be seized. Similarly, the other officer in the\npanchnama mentioned that the imported goods had contravened\nNotification No.25/99-Customs dated 28.02.1999 and thus were liable to\nbe seized under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_44\">Customs Act</a>. Even here also, there is no mentioning\nor recording by Amit Kumar Sharma that he had reasons to believe that\nthe goods were liable to be confiscated and hence may be seized. Firstly,\nthe belief as above has to be of the proper officer who had made the\nseizure. It cannot be that seizure is made by one officer and the reasons to\nbelieve are recorded by another officer. Secondly, the proper officer who\nmade the seizure must have reasons to believe that the seized goods\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                      16/21</span>\n                                                             WPST3834_20.odt\n\nare liable to confiscation. Seizure of goods is not an end in itself. It is a\ndiscretionary power vested upon the proper officer who has reasons to\nbelieve that the goods to be seized are liable to confiscation.

Exhibit-A is a letter\ndated 17.12.2019 issued by Mr. Madhur D. Singh, Deputy Director,\nDRI, Regional Unit, Surat addressed to Deputy Commissioner, Central\nIntelligence Unit, Nhava Sheva. By this letter, the Deputy Commissioner\nwas informed that a case was booked against respondent No.4 and two\nother firms in connection with misuse of Notification No.25/99-Customs\ndated 28.02.1999. Therefore, a request was made to put on hold the 15\nconsignments mentioned therein which included the two consignments\ncovered by the two bills of entry dated 10.12.2019. It is seen that office\nof Commissioner of Customs, Nhava Sheva had informed the DRI, Sub-\nRegional Unit, Vapi on 10.01.2020 in response to letter dated 08.01.2020\nfor providing documents relating to consignments of respondent No.4\n(Exhibit-B). In that letter, it was mentioned that in both the bills of entry,\nthe name of the original importer was M/s. Nikom Copper and\nConductors Private Limited (petitioner) which has been mentioned in the\nImport General Manifest (IGM) and the bills of lading. The two bills of\nentry dated 10.12.2019 were filed in the name of respondent No.4 on\nhigh seas sale basis but respondent No.4 did not submit any documents\nbefore filing of bills of entry on the basis of high seas sale. Thereafter\nrespondent No.4 through its customs broker requested for amendment in\nthe importer&#x27;s name by submitting NOCs from both the parties. The said\nrequest was allowed and the name of the importer was changed from M/\ns. Chandrashekhar Industries (respondent No.4) to M/s. Nikom Copper\nand Conductors Private Limited (petitioner) as there was no change in\nthe original bills of lading and IGM. The letter further mentioned that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                                        17/21</span>\n                                                              WPST3834_20.odt\n\nthe amendment was allowed on 18.12.2019 and letter from the Central\nIntelligence Unit was received by the Commissionerate on 23.12.2019.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">32.1. DRI, Zonal Unit, Ahmedabad vide letter dated 23.04.2020\n(Exhibit-G) informed the Joint Commissioner of Customs, Nhava\nSheva-II, Group IV referring to the two bills of entry dated 10.12.2019\ninitially filed by respondent No.4 but subsequently amended in the name\nof the petitioner with bills of entry being filed on merit rate of duty\nwithout claiming benefit of Notification No.25/99-Customs dated\n28.02.1999. Reference was made to the telephonic discussions and\nrequest to nullify the amendment. It was mentioned that after the held\nconsignments were jointly examined, those were seized on 09.01.2020.\nHowever, it was mentioned that nullification of amendment in the bills\nof entry had not yet been done and the amendments were still effective.\nTherefore, the Joint Commissioner of Customs was requested to nullify\nthe amendments in the two bills of entry dated 10.12.2019 at the earliest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">33.      Following the same, the Joint Commissioner informed Joint\nDirector, DRI, Zonal Unit, Ahmedabad vide letter dated 04.06.2020 that\nas per his direction, Commissioner of Customs (In-charge of Group IV)\nhad approved to nullify the amendment carried out in the two bills of\nentry.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">34.      From the above, it is apparent that on the date of seizure, the bills\nof entry were in the name of the petitioner and the petitioner had not\n(and still has not) claimed any benefit under the Notification No.25/99-\nCustoms dated 28.02.1999. It may be mentioned that office of the\nCommissioner of Customs had informed DRI authorities that the\namendments were allowed because NOC was submitted by both the\nparties i.e., buyer and seller of the high seas sale. It was also mentioned\nthat amendment was allowed as there was no change in the original bills\nof lading and IGM. At this stage, we may refer to Standing Order No.10\nof 2017 dated 03.05.2017 issued by the Commissioner of Customs,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                         18/21</span>\n                                                            WPST3834_20.odt\n\nNhava Sheva-IV which has been placed on record by respondent No.3 as\nExhibit-E to his affidavit. This Standing Order prescribes the essential\ndocuments necessary for registration of high seas sale contract /\ntransaction. The documents are high seas sales contract, non-negotiable\ncopy of bill of lading, high seas sale invoice and commercial invoice,\nauthority letter for customs broker from high seas sales buyer and copies\nof importer exporter code of both buyer and seller. From the above, it is\nevident that a high seas sale has to be in writing in the form of an\nagreement / contract which has to be signed by both the buyer and the\nseller and duly notarized. Therefore, respondents have rightly contended\nthat the high seas sale entered into by and between the petitioner and\nrespondent No.4 was no sale in the eye of law as it was done orally. If\nthe high seas sale was not a sale in the eye of law then respondent No.4\ncould not have filed the two bills of entry relating to the two import\nconsignments. This is more so when the bills of lading and IGM were in\nthe name of the petitioner. In such circumstances, the customs\nauthorities at Nhava Sheva had rightly allowed the amendments prayed\nfor. As on the date of seizure i.e., 09.01.2020, the two bills of entry were\nin the name of the petitioner and the petitioner had not sought any\nconcession or exemption or benefit under Notification No.25/99-\nCustoms dated 28.02.1999. In such circumstances, there could not have\nbeen any reason to believe that the said imported goods had contravened\nany of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1384041/\" id=\"a_45\">section 111</a> dealing with confiscation and hence\nliable to seizure under <a href=\"/doc/420314/\" id=\"a_46\">section 110</a>. That apart, all the developments\nmentioned above are post seizure developments which could have no\nbearing on the validity or invalidity of the impugned seizure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1008845\" id=\"span_28\">35.   At this stage, we may remind ourselves of the famous\nobservations of Vivian Bose, J. in <a href=\"/doc/1008845/\" id=\"a_47\">Commissioner of Police Vs.\nGordhandas Bhanji</a>, AIR 1952 SC 16. He had said that public orders\npublicly made in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in\nthe light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the\norder of what he meant or of what was in his mind or what he intended\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                       19/21</span>\n                                                           WPST3834_20.odt\n\nto do. Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public\neffect and are intended to affect the acting and conduct of those to whom\nthey are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to\nthe language used in the order itself.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1831036\" id=\"span_30\">This salutary principle was\nreiterated and re-stated with great emphasis by a Constitution Bench of\nthe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_48\">Mohinder Singh Gill Vs. Chief Election\nCommissioner</a>, AIR 1978 SC 851. Supreme Court held that when a\nstatutory functionary makes an order based on certain grounds, its\nvalidity must be judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be\nsupplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise. If\nthat is allowed, an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes\nto the court on account of a challenge, gets validated by additional\ngrounds later brought out. It was succinctly put that &#x27;orders are not like\nold wine becoming better as they grow older&#x27;.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">36.   From an analysis of the above, it is evident from the seizure\nmemo as well as the materials as on that date i.e., 09.01.2020 that there\ncould not have been any reason to believe by the proper officer that the\ngoods seized were liable to confiscation. Therefore, the very action of\nseizure is devoid of jurisdiction and hence illegal. If the very act of\nseizure is illegal, all consequential actions would have no legal sanction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">37.   However, even if we look at the amendments to the two bills of\nentry, it cannot be said that the amendments so carried out were\nundeserving or ought not to have been carried out in view of what we\nhave discussed in paragraph 34 above. Furthermore, the cancellation of\namendment was not carried out by the authority which had allowed the\namendment after due application of mind. It was carried out as per the\ndirection of DRI, Zonal Unit, Ahmedabad. Such cancellation certainly\nresulted in adverse civil consequences upon the petitioner who was the\nbeneficiary of the amendment. Without putting the petitioner to notice\nand without giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, the\namendments which were carried out on 18.12.2019 could not have been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                      20/21</span>\n                                                            WPST3834_20.odt\n\nunilaterally cancelled after 4/5 months. Such cancellation of amendment\nwould, therefore, be a nullity having no legal sanctity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">38.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"475027\" id=\"span_32\">In this connection, we may refer to a Division Bench decision of\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/475027/\" id=\"a_49\">WASP Pump Private Limited Vs. Union of India</a>, 2008\n(230) ELT 405. In that case, when an objection as to availing the writ\njurisdiction was made on the ground of having alternative remedy, this\nCourt declared that it is a well settled proposition of law that if an order\nis a nullity then it is invalid and its invalidity can be set up anywhere and\neverywhere when such order is sought to be executed or enforced.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">39.     Therefore, in our considered opinion, subsequent cancellation of\nthe amendments to the two bills of entry would make no material\ndifference at all to the illegality of the seizure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">40.     That being the position and upon thorough consideration of all\naspects of the matter, we are of the view that the impugned seizure\nmemo dated 09.01.2020 cannot be legally sustained. The same is hereby\nset aside and quashed. As a consequence, the seized goods shall be\nreleased to the petitioner on payment of the requisite duty and\ncompletion of necessary formalities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">41.     Writ petition is accordingly allowed to the above extent. However,\nthere shall be no order as to costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">42.

All concerned will act on production by fax or email of a digitally\nsigned copy of this order.\n</p>\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">(ABHAY AHUJA, J.)
