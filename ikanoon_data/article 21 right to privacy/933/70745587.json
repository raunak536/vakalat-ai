The child herein is a victim of rape. Termination of\n                          pregnancy in cases, like present one, cannot be reduced merely to be\n                          defined as right of a woman sexually assaulted, but also to be\n                          recognized as a human right, as it affects dignified existence of a victim\n                          if the same is not permitted. It is not the privacy of the rape victim\n                          which is invaded by sexual assault, but her body is wounded and her\n                          soul is scared. It would not be appropriate to expect the minor victim\n                          who is a rape victim to take the burden of giving birth and raising a\n                          child, especially in a situation where she herself is passing through the\n                          age of adolescent. Doing so, will amount to asking a child to give birth\n                          and raise another child. Given the social, financial, and other factors\n                          that are immediately associated with the pregnancy, an unwanted\n                          pregnancy would surely have an impact on victim&#x27;s mental health.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">                          15.
