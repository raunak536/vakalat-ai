It may be\n\n     remembered      that   the    petitioner         was    earlier     a\n\n     councilor from the ticket of the Aam Aadmi Party.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     However, subsequently he left the said party and\n\n     was given ticket to contest the Assembly Elections\n\n     by     the   All   India     Majlis-e-Ittehadul             Muslimeen\n\n     (AIMIM). He took the ticket to contest the Assembly\n\n     Elections      fully   knowing       that   he   is    in    jail   in\n\n     connection with several cases in some of which he\n\n     may have been granted bail but continues to languish\n\n     therein and so he has to participate in the election\n\n     remaining behind the bars.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.   The interim bail application moved by the petitioner\n\n     was considered by the High Court and was ultimately\n\n     disallowed by the order impugned dated 14.01.2025\n\n     but he was granted conditional custody parole for\n\n     subscribing oath and to complete formalities in\n\n     respect of filing his nomination papers to contest\n\n     the Assembly Elections. In this way, though the\n\n     petitioner has no fundamental right to contest the\n\n     elections but his statutory right to that effect\n\n     was duly protected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.   The petitioner is not satisfied by the grant of\n\n     custody parole for filing his nomination enabling\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      2</span>\n\f     him to participate in the election and has thus\n\n     preferred this Special Leave Petition contending\n\n     inter alia that permitting filing of nomination is\n\n     meaningless if he is not allowed to campaign and\n\n     canvass.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.   It is important to note here that right to campaign\n\n     or canvass is neither a fundamental right nor a\n\n     constitutional or a human right. It is not even a\n\n     right recognized under any statute. However, the\n\n     petitioner is an Indian citizen and we are conscious\n\n     that his rights as a citizen are to be protected.\n\n     Nonetheless, the involvement of the petitioner in\n\n     as many as eleven cases including the present one,\n\n     one pertaining to PMLA and nine in relation to Delhi\n\n     riots of 2020, dilutes and erodes his position as a\n\n     law-abiding citizen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.   The   allegations   against       the   petitioner   in   the\n\n     present case are not only in connection with the\n\n     rioting but also of the murder of the official of\n\n     the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.\n\n     The allegations made against the petitioner, if\n\n     considered cumulatively along with the chargesheet\n\n     which has been submitted on 02.06.2020 reveals the\n\n     seriousness of the charges levelled against the\n\n     petitioner. The allegations against the petitioner\n\n     are also to the effect that his house/office was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                   3</span>\n\f               being used as the epicenter for the commission of\n\n               the aforesaid offences in which murder of one Ankit\n\n               Sharma is a sequel. On the rooftop of petitioner’s\n\n               house/building objects like stones, bricks, petrol\n\n               bombs, acid drums etc. were recovered which were\n\n               used during the riots, as per material on record.\n\n               It has come on record in the order impugned that\n\n               many material witnesses, especially in connection\n\n               with the present FIR No. 65 of 2020 are yet to be\n\n               examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">    8.         In the aforesaid facts and circumstances and keeping\n\n               in mind the submissions of Sh. Siddharth Aggarwal,\n\n               learned senior counsel for the petitioner, who has\n\n               limited/confined   his   arguments   to   the   grant   of\n\n               interim bail only, as the regular bail remains\n\n               pending for consideration before the High Court, the\n\n               limited issue before this Court is whether a purpose\n\n               based interim bail can be granted to contest the\n\n               election or for canvassing as the petitioner himself\n\n               is one of the candidates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">    9.         There is no provision for interim bail under the\n\n               law but lately it has become an acceptable mode of\n\n               grant of bail in certain special contingencies.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">    10.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77849990\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/77849990/\" id=\"a_1\">Arvind Kejriwal vs. Directorate of Enforcement1</a>\n\n               this Court quoted with approval from Athar Pervez2\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">1</span>\n    (2024) 9 SCC 577\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">2</span>\n    2016 SCC OnLine Del 6662\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          4</span>\n\f      case which reads as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         &quot;20. The expression &quot;interim&quot; bail is not\n         defined in the Code. It is an innovation by\n         legal neologism which has gained acceptance\n         and   recognition.   The   terms,   &quot;interim&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">         bail/&quot;interim&quot; suspension of sentence, have\n         been used and accepted as part of legal\n         vocabulary and are well- known expressions.\n         The said terms are used in contradistinction\n         and to distinguish release on regular bail\n         during pendency of trial or appeal till final\n         adjudication. Applications for &quot;interim&quot;\n         suspension or bail are primarily moved and\n         prayed for, when the accused or convict is\n         not entitled to or cannot be granted regular\n         bail or suspension of sentence, or the\n         application for grant of regular bail is\n         pending consideration and is yet to be\n         decided. &quot;Interim&quot; bail entailing temporary\n         release can be granted under compelling\n         circumstances and grounds, even when regular\n         bail would not be justified. Intolerable\n         grief and suffering in the given facts, may\n         justify temporary release, even when regular\n         bail is not warranted. Such situations are\n         not difficult to recount, though making a\n         catalogue would be an unnecessary exercise.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">11.   The reasons and factors whereunder interim bail may\n\n      be permitted may include cases where there is death\n\n      in the family of the accused and the cremation has\n\n      to take place; to attend the wedding of son/daughter\n\n      or of any close relative of the accused but such a\n\n      right   has   not   been   recognized   on   the   plea   of\n\n      contesting or canvassing for the election.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">12.   In the event interim bail is made permissible on\n\n      the ground of contesting elections, it will open a\n\n      Pandora’s box inasmuch as in this country election\n\n      in some form takes place throughout the year and\n\n      the accused persons in jail may take undue benefit\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                               5</span>\n\f      of it and even if they are not serious in contesting\n\n      elections, they would move interim bail application\n\n      for the purposes of participating in the election\n\n      knowing fully well they are likely to lose or are\n\n      not serious contenders. This will open a flood gate\n\n      of litigation which ought not to be permitted so as\n\n      to widen the scope of grant of interim bail, more\n\n      particularly when the regular bail application is\n\n      pending consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">13.   Secondly, if right to participate, canvassing and\n\n      contesting in election is allowed to be treated as\n\n      a ground for interim bail, then the necessary sequel\n\n      of the same would be that the accused person ought\n\n      to be allowed to vote in the election as well. Such\n\n      a sequel would be in conflict with the provision\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/30249677/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 62(5)</a> of the Representation of People Act,\n\n      1951 which circumscribe the right to vote by laying\n\n      down that no person shall vote in any election, if\n\n      he is confined in a prison or is in lawful custody\n\n      of   the   police.     The   grant    of     interim   bail    for\n\n      contesting      elections    would     mean    permitting      the\n\n      accused    to   cast    his/her      vote,    which    would   be\n\n      antithesis to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/30249677/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 62(5)</a> of the\n\n      Representation of People Act, 1951.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">14.   In the case of Anukul Chandra Pradhan, Advocate\n\n      Supreme Court Vs. Union of India and Ors.: 1997 (6)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                     6</span>\n\f      SCC 1, the three Judges Bench of this Court has\n\n      observed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            “8.     There are other reasons justifying\n            this classification. It is well known that\n            for the conduct of free, fair and orderly\n            elections,   there    is  need    to   deploy\n            considerable police force. Permitting every\n            person in prison also to vote would require\n            the deployment of a much larger police force\n            and much greater security arrangements in\n            the conduct of elections. Apart from the\n            resource crunch, the other constraints\n            relating to availability of more police\n            force and infrastructure facilities are\n            additional    factors    to    justify    the\n            restrictions imposed by sub-section (5) of\n            <a href=\"/doc/5827315/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 62</a>. A person who is in prison as a\n            result of his own conduct and is, therefore,\n            deprived of his liberty during the period of\n            his imprisonment cannot claim equal freedom\n            of movement, speech and expression with the\n            others   who   are   not   in   prison.   The\n            classification of persons in and out of\n            prison     separately     is      reasonable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            Restriction on voting of a person in prison\n            results automatically from his confinement\n            as a logical consequence of imprisonment. A\n            person not subjected to such a restriction\n            is free to vote or not to vote depending on\n            whether he wants to go to vote or not; even\n            he may choose not to go and cast his vote.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">            In view of the restriction on movement of a\n            prisoner, he cannot claim that he should be\n            provided the facility to go and vote.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            Moreover, if the object is to keep persons\n            with criminal background away from the\n            election scene, a provision imposing a\n            restriction on a prisoner to vote cannot be\n            called unreasonable.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">15.   One   of   the   basic   submissions   of   Sh.   Siddharth\n\n      Aggarwal is that permitting filing of nomination\n\n      alone is of no use unless the person is allowed to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   7</span>\n\f      campaign and canvass. The argument appears to be\n\n      attractive, but, has no force.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">16.   Canvassing in an election can be done in many ways\n\n      such as through newspapers, social media, pamphlets,\n\n      writing letters and it is not necessary that it\n\n      should be in the physical form such as by holding\n\n      meetings and by personal contact. Permitting the\n\n      petitioner to be released on interim bail for the\n\n      purpose of canvassing would amount to permitting the\n\n      petitioner to hold meetings and to undertake door\n\n      to door canvassing. This would necessarily involve\n\n      interaction of the petitioner with the people of the\n\n      locality on personal basis. Since, the incident\n\n      mentioned in the FIR took place in the locality from\n\n      where   the   petitioner   is   contesting,   if   the\n\n      petitioner is permitted to move around freely, there\n\n      is a very high possibility of his tampering with the\n\n      witnesses who are or local people living in that\n\n      locality alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">17.   The argument that the petitioner is entitled to\n\n      interim bail on the ground that he has suffered long\n\n      incarceration for around four years and that despite\n\n      submission of chargesheet way back on 20.06.2020\n\n      itself, the trial has not progressed and very few\n\n      witnesses till date have been examined, is of no\n\n      assistance for the petitioner for seeking interim\n\n      bail. The said argument may be appreciated better\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                              8</span>\n\f      while    considering         the       regular         bail,    but    not    an\n\n      interim bail which is limited only to the ground\n\n      whether    he     should          be     allowed         to     be    released\n\n      temporarily       for       the        purpose      of        contesting      or\n\n      participating in the election.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">18.   This apart, the thrust of the argument is that an\n\n      interim    bail       for     canvassing            is        necessary      for\n\n      effectively contesting the election. It is well\n\n      known    that   a     person       contesting           election       has    to\n\n      nurture his constituency for years together and\n\n      canvassing for ten or fifteen days would not suffice\n\n      the purpose. If he has earned a good reputation and\n\n      his   services       are    recognized            by    the     people,      the\n\n      canvassing      in    the    last        days       would      not    be   very\n\n      material. It is also well accepted that a large\n\n      number    of    people        in        the    past       have       contested\n\n      elections sitting behind the bars and they have won\n\n      without    being        released            for        the     purposes       of\n\n      canvassing.          Therefore,             there       is      no    special\n\n      circumstance in the case of the petitioner to grant\n\n      him interim bail for that purpose. Most of the times,\n\n      the campaigning is done by the party or its workers\n\n      and if one person in the party or the leader or even\n\n      the candidate is debarred from canvassing, it does\n\n      not in any way affect the legal right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"77849990\" id=\"span_14\">19.

There\n\n      the   petitioner    was    holding      the    post   of   Chief\n\n      Minister and was the President of a national party\n\n      and therefore, the Court opined that he is one of\n\n      the main campaigners, which is not the situation in\n\n      the case at hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">20.   It may not be out of context to mention that the\n\n      petitioner is in jail not only in connection with\n\n      the case at hand i.e., FIR No. 65 of 2020 but also\n\n      in two other cases, including a PMLA case, and a\n\n      case arising out of FIR No. 59 of 2020. In those two\n\n      cases, the petitioner has not been granted bail. His\n\n      bail application/interim bail application in those\n\n      cases are pending in different courts but the fact\n\n      remains that he is not on bail in those two cases,\n\n      meaning   thereby   that    even   if    the    petitioner    is\n\n      granted interim bail in the present case, he would\n\n      not be out of prison for the purpose of canvassing\n\n      and campaigning. Therefore, the entire exercise in\n\n      this regard will prove to be academic and futile in\n\n      nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">21.   It is high time that the citizens of India deserve\n\n      a clean India, which means clean politics as well\n\n      and for the said purpose, it is necessary that people\n\n      with tainted image, especially those who are in\n\n      custody and had not been granted bail and those who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                               10</span>\n\f      are undertrial, even if out of jail, be restricted\n\n      in some way or the other from participating in the\n\n      election. The people of India should be given a\n\n      choice      to   elect    people        with    clean    image    and\n\n      antecedents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">22.   In the case at hand, as stated earlier, the Court\n\n      is confined as to whether interim bail for the\n\n      purposes of election ought to be allowed or not.\n\n      The petitioner, on the ground of his long custody\n\n      or the trial not being completed for long, may argue\n\n      for regular bail but that is not the subject-matter\n\n      for consideration before this Court today. We do\n\n      not intend to usurp the jurisdiction of the High\n\n      Court, where the regular bail of the petitioner is\n\n      pending consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">23.   In the facts and circumstances of the case, long\n\n      incarceration of the petitioner or the fact that\n\n      some of the other co-accused have been released on\n\n      bail or that upon evidence, the entire case of\n\n      prosecution        will   fall     to     the   ground    are     not\n\n      relevant, and therefore, I am of the opinion that\n\n      the High Court has not committed any error of law\n\n      in exercising its decision in refusing the interim\n\n      bail   to    the   petitioner      and    permitting      him    only\n\n      custodial parole for the purposes of subscribing\n\n      oath and filing of his nomination papers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">24.   In simple words, interim bail is not permissible for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               11</span>\n\f      the purposes of contesting elections, much less for\n\n      campaigning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">25.

The Petitioner is an\n        accused in cases relating to the unfortunate riots that took\n        place in Delhi in February/March, 2020.

Yet, before forming an opinion as to whether the prayer for\n     grant of interim bail, for the purpose presently sought for i.e., to\n     campaign for the Election for which his Nomination Papers\n     stand submitted, can be granted, this Court would have to go\n     into the broader merits of the case, subject to the caveat afore-\n     recorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n     THE PETITIONER’S SUBMISSIONS:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">9.   Mr. Siddharth Aggarwal, learned senior counsel appearing for\n     the Petitioner has submitted that he would be confining\n     himself, at this stage, to attempting to persuade the Court as to\n     whether in the particular facts and circumstances, the\n     Petitioner would, due to the non-grant of interim bail, be\n     seriously prejudiced and his Fundamental Rights as a citizen\n     under the Constitution of India would also be compromised if\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                   5</span>\n\n      he only takes part in the Election as a formality, inasmuch as\n      even after filing his Nomination Papers and being declared fit\n      to contest, he would not be allowed to connect with the people\n      of the constituency concerned, and to satisfy the electorate as\n      to why he should be elected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">10.   The thrust of Mr. Aggarwal’s argument was that the Petitioner\n      has been in custody for almost 5 years now (reckoned from\n      March, 2020) which is a long period and the democratic\n      process requires that a candidate should go before the\n      electorate from whom he seeks votes to represent them in the\n      body for which elections are going to be held.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">11.   It was submitted that the Petitioner had an unblemished record\n      as a Ward Councillor and only because of the unfortunate\n      incidents which took place in February/March, 2020, the\n      Petitioner due to certain circumstances was named as an\n      accused in as many as 11 FIRs, out of which in 8, he has been\n      granted bail. What remains are the instant case and two other\n      cases, including one under the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_18\">Prevention of Money-\n      Laundering Act, 2002</a> (hereinafter referred to as ‘PMLA’). It\n      was submitted that in all the cases, the basic allegation is that\n      the Petitioner was chiefly an instigator and that he may be the\n      person who was also instrumental in logistics for the rioters.\n      However, on identical facts, in the 8 other cases, the Petitioner\n      has been granted bail and in the remaining cases, his\n      applications for interim bail as well as regular bail are still\n      pending, without having been finally considered on merits.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_59\">12.   Learned senior counsel submitted that under law, the right of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                                          6</span>\n\n               an accused to bail is almost crystallized, in the event that the\n               prosecution fails to discharge its onus of facilitating a fair and\n               speedy trial, which is glaring in the present case. He submitted\n               that in the present case, there are five named Chargesheet\n               prosecution eye-witnesses, out of which four have already\n               been examined but the fifth witness is yet to be examined and\n               the ground is that the said witness has been out of Delhi on\n               the various dates fixed in the trial. It was next submitted that\n               the Chargesheet was filed/submitted on 02.07.2020 and now,\n               almost five years have passed. Mr. Aggarwal’s submission was\n               that without blaming anybody for such situation, including a\n               systemic failure, there is no real probability of the trial being\n               concluded in the near future. Asserting that the Petitioner’s\n               rights cannot be curtailed in this way, he urged the Court to\n               consider as to whether the Petitioner deserves to be enlarged\n               on bail even otherwise, albeit without fully going into the\n               merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"77849990\" id=\"span_39\">13.       It was submitted even under specific laws, where there are\n               prohibitions for grant of bail, unless the Court is satisfied that\n               there is no chance of the petitioner being convicted and/or it\n               would not otherwise be against public interest, the Courts have\n               held that the same would not apply in case of granting\n               provisional bail. It was submitted that such proposition has\n               been dealt with at Paragraphs 12 and 13 in <a href=\"/doc/77849990/\" id=\"a_19\">Arvind Kejriwal v\n               Directorate of Enforcement</a>, 2024 (9) SCC 5774.</span> Further, it\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">4</span>\n  ‘12.Athar Pervez v.

However, learned Senior Counsel took the Court through the\n               Chargesheet, the reading whereof would indicate that (i) the\n               Petitioner made repeated calls to the Police Control Room, (ii)\n               the police arrived late at the spot, and; (iii) the Petitioner’s\n               house was the sole house which was not vandalised. He\n               submitted that even as per the materials, some incriminating\n               articles have been recovered from the Petitioner’s house but\n               that would not prove that the Petitioner was the mastermind of\n               the entire plot, as was the version of the prosecution.\n               Otherwise, advanced the learned senior counsel, in a regular\n               case, the Courts have always granted bail to the accused\n               within a few months of incarceration. It was contended that the\n               materials which have been recovered would not disentitle the\n               Petitioner from favourable consideration for release on bail.\n\n1986 SCC (L&amp;S) 429] , and observes : (Athar Pervez case [<a href=\"/doc/101708669/\" id=\"a_21\">Athar Pervez v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>), 2016 SCC OnLine\nDel 6662] , SCC OnLine Del para 20)\n         “20. The expression “interim” bail is not defined in the Code. It is an innovation by legal neologism which has\n    gained acceptance and recognition. The terms, “interim” bail/“interim” suspension of sentence, have been used\n    and accepted as part of legal vocabulary and are well-known expressions. The said terms are used in\n    contradistinction and to distinguish release on regular bail during pendency of trial or appeal till final\n    adjudication. Applications for “interim” suspension or bail are primarily moved and prayed for, when the accused\n    or convict is not entitled to or cannot be granted regular bail or suspension of sentence, or the application for\n    grant of regular bail is pending consideration and is yet to be decided. “Interim” bail entailing temporary release\n    can be granted under compelling circumstances and grounds, even when regular bail would not be justified.\n    Intolerable grief and suffering in the given facts, may justify temporary release, even when regular bail is not\n    warranted. Such situations are not difficult to recount, though making a catalogue would be an unnecessary\n    exercise.”</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">13.

It was submitted that almost five years of incarceration have\n      rendered the Petitioner out of society and there has been no\n      contact with the electorate and thus, it is all the more\n      reasonable and fair that the Petitioner should get a chance for\n      whatever few days remain for the Election, such that he can\n      attempt to convince the electorate to exercise their franchise in\n      his favour. Moreover, it was submitted that the Petitioner’s\n      conduct otherwise, prior to the date of the FIRs has remained\n      unquestioned. There are no indications that he is a hardened\n      criminal, for within a few days of the unfortunate incident(s), he\n      was incarcerated. Learned senior counsel stated that prior in\n      time to the riots, there is no allegation of the Petitioner being a\n      member of or otherwise being involved with any organized\n      gang.

He\n      submits that his case for regular bail is pending before the\n      High Court, wherein the next date for hearing fixed is\n      20.02.2025.

It was submitted that when on a specific prayer\n                 made before the High Court, custody parole was granted only\n                 to fill up and submit his Nomination Papers, the matter should\n                 have attained finality there itself. It was vehemently submitted\n                 that the right to contest elections is not a Fundamental Right\n                 and the fact that the Petitioner has been allowed to fill up his\n                 Nomination Form indicates that the High Court was indulgent\n                 to allow him to participate in the Election, but a right to\n                 campaign would not be a necessary corollary to the\n                 indulgence granted, for the reason that various other modes of\n                 campaigning are available to him apart from physically eg., by\n                 way of pamphlets, etcetera.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       18.

If the Petitioner, at present behind bars, is\n                 allowed to come out, he would have a right to vote which\n                 would be an infringement of the statutory provision under\n                 <a href=\"/doc/320017/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 626</a> of the Representation of the People Act, 1951,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">5</span>\n    Abbreviated to ‘ASG’.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">  ‘62.

Learned ASG stated that the Court should consider the\n               balance of equity between the parties and in the present case,\n               the same is heavily tilted in favour of the prosecution, for the\n               reason that in view of the nature of the allegations levelled\n               against the Petitioner, his coming out on bail would lead to\n               many other complexities inasmuch as he would be getting in\n               touch with the witnesses of the cases and would also be in a\n               position to dominate them under the garb of a Ward Councillor.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">               Moreover, it was submitted that in the larger picture, the Court\n               would also consider as to whether inference in the present\n               case would lead to a precedent where similarly-situated\n               convicts/undertrial prisoners, just to get out of jail, may stand in\n               any election. Learned ASG expressed an apprehension that\n               given the position in our country, where elections are held at\n               regular intervals somewhere or the other, chances of misuse of\n               an order of interim bail in the present case, are real and not\n               imaginary. It was submitted that if the Petitioner is so confident\n               of his work and position in society, he would not be required to\n               physically canvass and if at all, he is the choice of the\n               electorate, the electorate would be wise enough and vote for\n               him, and then the consequences may follow. Learned ASG has\n               also taken us through various judgments in support of the\n               proposition that the statute prohibits the grant of bail in like\n               cases.

The\n                  learned ASG submitted that the Court ought to refrain from\n                  granting interim bail to the Petitioner as the same would be\n                  purely academic, in the background of the Petitioner still being\n                  in custody in two other cases, including one under the PMLA,\n                  in which he is unlikely to be granted relief.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"77849990\" id=\"span_49\">20.

I have examined the allegations and the evidence against the\n                Petitioner. No doubt, they are grave and reprehensible but as\n                of this moment they are exactly that – allegations. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118765506\" id=\"span_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18346623\" id=\"span_69\">It is settled\n                law that magnitude and gravity of the offence alleged are not\n                grounds, in and by themselves, to deny bail [<a href=\"/doc/18346623/\" id=\"a_38\">Para 18 12 of K A\n                Najeeb</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/118765506/\" id=\"a_39\">Jalaluddin Khan v Union of India</a>,\n                (2024) 10 SCC 574], moreso when trial is prolonged.

A constitutional court cannot be restrained from granting bail\nto an accused on account of restrictive statutory provisions in a penal statute if it finds that the right of the accused-</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">undertrial under Article 21of the Constitution of India has been infringed. In that event, such statutory restrictions\nwould not come in the way. Even in the case of interpretation of a penal statute, howsoever stringent it may be, a\nconstitutional court has to lean in favour of constitutionalism and the rule of law of which liberty is an intrinsic part. In\nthe given facts of a particular case, a constitutional court may decline to grant bail. But it would be very wrong to say\nthat under a particular statute, bail cannot be granted. It would run counter to the very grain of our constitutional\njurisprudence. In any view of the matter, K.A. Najeeb [Union of India v. K.A. Najeeb, (2021) 3 SCC 713] being rendered\nby a three-Judge Bench is binding on a Bench of two Judges like us.’\n                                                                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">12</span>\n   ‘18. Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of the fact that the charges levelled against the respondent are\ngrave and a serious threat to societal harmony. Had it been a case at the threshold, we would have outrightly turned\ndown the respondent&#x27;s prayer. However, keeping in mind the length of the period spent by him in custody and the\nunlikelihood of the trial being completed anytime soon, the High Court appears to have been left with no other option\nexcept to grant bail. An attempt has been made to strike a balance between the appellant&#x27;s right to lead evidence of its\nchoice and establish the charges beyond any doubt and simultaneously the respondent&#x27;s rights guaranteed under Part\nIII of our Constitution have been well protected.’\n                                                                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">13</span>\n   ‘14.

Further, I deem it appropriate to advert to the contention urged\n      by the learned ASG, that the Court ought to refrain from\n      granting interim bail to the Petitioner as the same would be\n      purely academic, in the background of the Petitioner still being\n      in custody in two other cases, including one under the PMLA,\n      in which he is unlikely to be granted relief. The said\n      proposition, to my mind, if accepted, would amount to this\n      Court abdicating its responsibility of deciding the lis before it by\n      being influenced by factors not germane inasmuch as the\n      consideration for interim bail in the present case cannot be\n      contingent upon prior grant of similar relief in the two other\n      cases. Moreso, for the reason that the matter relating to the\n      two other cases is pending before courts subordinate to this\n      Court. That said, I am not of the opinion that the lis raised\n      herein is academic or should await the outcome of cases in the\n      courts subordinate to this Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">29.   The Petitioner is in custody since March, 2020. He has\n      secured bail in a majority of the cases. The High Court\n      permitted him to file his Nomination and consequently stand as\n      a candidate. On the short point of period under custody\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">\f                                                           16</span>\n\n               already undergone as also the bail secured in the other cases,\n               I am of the considered view that, subject to appropriate\n               conditions being imposed, the Petitioner can be granted\n               interim bail for a limited period. Ordered accordingly.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">     30.       The Petitioner is, thus, enlarged on interim bail, however, only\n               upto the noon of 04.02.2025, imposing the conditions\n               prescribed in Sections 480(3)(b) <a href=\"/doc/177373/\" id=\"a_43\">15</a> and 482(2)(ii)<a href=\"/doc/712019/\" id=\"a_44\">16</a> of the\n               Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023. It is further\n               directed that the Petitioner shall not, during campaigning,\n               make any reference whatsoever to any of the pending cases\n               and/or the Delhi Riots of 2020. The Petitioner shall, during the\n               period of his release, confine himself to the limits of the\n               Mustafabad Constituency. The Petitioner will deposit his\n               passport, if any, with the Trial Court. The Trial Court may\n               impose additional conditions consistent with the above.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130290692\" id=\"span_77\">31.       The Petitioner shall surrender before the concerned jail\n               authorities at/before the time afore-indicated, failing which\n               coercive steps shall be resorted to by the respondent.

Were any litigant, in futuro, to cite this in a\n      later case, I am sure the Court concerned would examine such\n      case on its merits and on its own factual prism.
