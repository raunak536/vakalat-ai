Plaintiffs claimed that the suit land was inherited by Ramji\n\nLal and Risala from their father Baksha. Baksha had inherited the\n\nsame from his father Masaniya. The land comprised in khewat\n\nNo.48 was purchased by Risala from the funds generated from Joint\n\nHindu Family Property. Baksha son of Masaniya had two sons\n\nnamely Ramji Lal and Risala. Ramji Lal was married to Sarti. Risala\n\nwas married to Bhurli. Defendants were born from the wedlock of\n\nRisala and Bhurli.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">[4].          Plaintiffs-petitioners also asserted that Ramji Lal was in\n\nArmy and he did not come to village from 1940 to 1946. His\n\nwhereabouts could not be known. Thereafter, Sarti wife of Ramji Lal\n\nstarted living with Risala as his wife. Plaintiff No.1-Hawa Singh and\n\nfather of plaintiffs No.3 to 5 Jai Singh took birth from this wedlock of\n\nRisala and Sarti. Ramji Lal who was in I.N.A had returned to village\n\nin the year 1946 and thereafter Sarti again started living with Ramji\n\nLal. Plaintiff No.1 Hawa Singh and father of plaintiffs No.3 to 5\n\nresided with Risala. In nutshell, it was sought to be projected that\n\nHawa Singh and Jai Singh were sons of Risala and Sarti.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">                                        2 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:52:37 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> CR No.4730 of 2016                                                         3</span>\n\n[5].          The suit was contested by the defendants. The factum of\n\nHawa Singh and Jai Singh being sons of Risala was denied, rather\n\nthey were claimed to be sons of Ramji Lal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">[6].          The dispute in respect of paternity of Hawa Singh and Jai\n\nSingh was the core issue between the parties and the same was\n\nsought to be ascertained by means of DNA profile of the parties.\n\nThe dispute is in respect of property of Risala. The paternity of the\n\nplaintiffs was sought to be ascertained by way of DNA profile as the\n\nsame cannot be resolved by means of substantive, oral or\n\ndocumentary evidence. The rights have been claimed by the\n\nplaintiffs in the property of Risala whereas the same have been\n\ndenied. The legitimacy of the child is not in dispute, but the dispute\n\nis with regard to property of Risala which is to be inherited by\n\nsuccessors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">[7].          The application was contested by the defendants on the\n\nground that the DNA profile helps in establishing the paternity when\n\nalleged father is alive. The test is only conducted in rare cases so\n\nthat the person may not be called as Bastard. Generally, this test is\n\nconducted in order to apprehend offenders in the criminal case after\n\nestablishing their identity. As per facts disclosed in the plaint, Sarti\n\nwas married to Ramji Lal who was in Army. Ramji Lal was not heard\n\nfrom 1942 to 1946. Thereafter, Sarti lived with Risala. Bhurli was\n\nalive at that time, so presumably there cannot be a Karewa without\n\nproving civil death of Ramji Lal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">                                        3 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:52:37 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> CR No.4730 of 2016                                                         4</span>\n\n[8].          Risala died on 14.04.1995. Ramji Lal died on 24.08.1972.\n\nSarti died long back and Bhurli also died in the year 1985. Now\n\ncomparison is sought to be made between Hawa Singh, Jai Singh\n\nwith Maiperson and Mai Singh. In the year 1947, Ramji Lal came\n\nback and there was re-union between Ramji Lal and Sarti. From this\n\nre-union, third son namely Manphol and daughter namely Maichandi\n\ntook birth. Now issue would be to see the veracity of test to be\n\nconducted when Risala is already dead. The conclusiveness of test\n\nwould have to be judged in the context of comparison that cannot be\n\nmade with alleged biological father of both the sides i.e. Risala.\n\n[9].          In the application for DNA profile filed by the plaintiff,\n\nprayer has been made that the defendants should be directed for\n\nDNA profile by giving their blood samples to establish paternity with\n\nthe plaintiffs. In view of stand taken by both the sides, paternity of\n\nboth the sides viz-a-viz Risala has to be borne on record. The inter\n\nse status of both the sides in order to establish that both the sides\n\nhad taken birth from the loin of Risala would be a far fetched\n\nproposition when Ramji Lal returned to the matrimonial house in the\n\nyear 1947 and thereafter, Sarti again united with Ramji Lal in the\n\nmatrimonial house. Ramji Lal was never declared to be civilly dead,\n\ntherefore, there was no occasion for Sarti to be treated as Karewa\n\nwife of Risala and <a href=\"/doc/284588/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 16</a> of Hindu Marriage Act would be on\n\nexplanatory note.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">                                        4 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:52:37 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> CR No.4730 of 2016                                                         5</span>\n\n[10].         The inter se comparison of blood samples of both the\n\nparties would not lead to any conclusive fact to establish that\n\nplaintiffs were in fact sons of Risala out of lawful marriage of Risala\n\nwith Sarti. It appears that both the sides have become sluggish in\n\ntheir approach. Birth of Manphol and Maichandi after the year 1947\n\nwould further strengthen the case that the plaintiffs were sons of\n\nRamji Lal and Sarti. Ramji Lal died only on 24.08.1972. The\n\npaternity was not assailed for more than 65 years of age by anyone.\n\nDuring their lifetime, Risala and Ramji Lal never raised any objection\n\nin respect of aforesaid facts. The paternity of Hawa Singh and Jai\n\nSingh is being assailed by the plaintiffs themselves. The property of\n\nRamji Lal is statedly with the plaintiffs. In a way, the filing of\n\napplication is an act of self incrimination inasmuch as that instead of\n\nshowing themselves to be sons of Ramji Lal, plaintiffs have staked\n\nclaim over the property of Risala by claiming themselves to be sons\n\nof Risala and Sarti.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">[11].          It is not in dispute that Sarti was married to Ramji Lal.\n\nThe marriage was never dissolved as Ramji Lal was never declared\n\nto be civilly dead, even though his whereabouts were not known\n\nfrom 1942 to 1946. There was no sufficient period of 7 years during\n\nwhich he was not heard. Even otherwise, Ramji Lal returned to\n\nhouse in the year 1947 and cohabitated with Sarti, resulting in birth\n\nof third son Manphol and daughter Maichandi. In view of aforesaid,\n\nthere was presumption of valid marriage between Ramji Lal and\n\nSarti and there could not be any presumption of Karewa of Sarti with\n\n                                        5 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:52:37 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> CR No.4730 of 2016                                                      6</span>\n\nRisala. DNA profile even if allowed, would not dislodge the\n\npresumption of valid marriage between Ramji Lal and Sarti.\n\n[12].         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_2\">Goutam Kundu Vs. State of West Bengal and\n\nanother</a>, (1993) 3 SCC 418, it was held by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nthat the test cannot be held as a matter of course, nor the same can\n\nbe done in order to have roving inquiry. There must be a strong\n\nprima facie case where the husband must establish non access in\n\norder to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 112</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act The Court must carefully examine as to what would be\n\nthe consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have the\n\neffect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an\n\nunchaste woman. Nobody can be compelled to give sample of blood\n\nfor analysis.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">[13].         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_4\">Sharda Vs.

It,\n\nhaving regard to the future of the child, has, of course, sounded a\n\nnote of caution as regard mechanical passing of such order. If the\n\ndirections are in the interest of the minor, then such directions\n\nordinarily be made. In matrimonial disputes, where divorce is sought\n\non the ground of impotency etc., then without any medical\n\nexamination, it would be very difficult to conclude as to whether\n\nallegation made by the spouse is correct or not. In such situation,\n\n\n\n                                        6 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:52:37 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> CR No.4730 of 2016                                                      7</span>\n\nthe party would always insist on medical examination. The\n\navoidance thereof on the plea of right to privacy or of personal\n\nliberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India would make the\n\nsame impossible for any conclusion. Such a course would make the\n\nground of divorce to be nugatory, therefore, right to privacy having\n\nnot been conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India and its\n\ninterpretation has to be read in consonance with personal liberty.\n\nTherefore, cumulatively, it cannot be treated to be an absolute right\n\nand would be subject to some limitations to be imposed where two\n\ncompeting interests clash. Right to seek divorce on the ground of\n\nimpotency would directly come in conflict with so called right to\n\nprivacy of the respondent. Therefore, the Court has to reconcile by\n\nway of balancing the competing interests of the parties.\n\n[14].</span>         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_17\">In <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_7\">Bhabani Prasad Jena Vs.

One view is that\n\nwhen modern science gives means of ascertaining the paternity of a\n\nchild, then there should not be any hesitation to use the same. The\n\nother view is that the Court must be reluctant to use such scientific\n\nmechanism which may result in invasion of right to privacy of an\n\nindividual and even may devastating effect on the child and may\n\n                                        7 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:52:37 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> CR No.4730 of 2016                                                        8</span>\n\nbastardise an innocent child even though his mother and her spouse\n\nwere living together during the time of conception. The apparent\n\nconflict between the right to privacy of a person not to submit\n\nhimself forcibly to medical examination and duty of the Court to\n\nreach the truth must be coherently decided and the Court must\n\nexercise its discretion only after balancing the interests of the\n\nparties. The Court would consider whether for a just decision, DNA\n\nprofile is eminently needed. DNA profile in a matter relating to\n\npaternity of a child should not be directed as a matter of course or in\n\na routine manner.

DNA evidence has assumed\n\ngreat significance and legally recognized phenomenon. Scientific\n\ninvestigations are need of our. DNA is a scientific test and its\n\naccuracy is 99.99 % and therefore, it can be used as evidence not\n\nonly in sexual assault and criminal cases, but also in civil cases\n\ninvolving question of paternity and succession.\n\n[20].         <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is based on\n\npresumption of public morality and public policy. The law presumes\n\nagainst vices and inmorality in a civilized society where it is\n\nimperative to presume legitimacy of a child born during the\n\ncontinuation of a valid marriage between his mother and any man or\n\nwithin 280 days after its dissolution, if the mother remained\n\nunmarried. Such legitimacy has presumption of conclusiveness,\n\nunless it is shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to\n\neach other at any time when the child could have been begotten.\n\nThis presumption cannot be displaced by mere probability or doubt.\n\nThe presumption can only be rebutted by a strong and conclusive\n\nevidence. Once the validity of marriage is proved, then there is a\n\nstrong presumption about the legitimacy of children born out of that\n\nwedlock. It is also settled proposition of law that the law does not\n\npresume anything odious or dishonourable.

Some of the High Courts have hinted that subjecting the\n\naccused to DNA test is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 20(3)</a> of Constitution of\n\nIndia. Obtaining samples from the accused for DNA profile does not\n\nviolate right against self-incrimination. There is no infringement of\n\nany privacy or right against self-incrimination as it is by now trite that\n\nin course of investigation, DNA test can be conducted. The privilege\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 20(3)</a> of Constitution of India is applicable only in\n\ntestimonial evidence. In a criminal case, obtaining DNA profile will\n\nnot violate right against self incrimination. The privilege applies only\n\nin evidence i.e. testimony in essence taken under duress. The right\n\nagainst self-incrimination is just a prohibition on the use of physical\n\nor moral compulsion to extort testimonial evidence from a person,\n\nnot an exclusion of evidence taken from his body when it may be\n\nmaterial and thus, the Court can compel a person male or female to\n\nsubmit for DNA test after incorporation of Section 53-A in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_32\">Criminal\n\nProcedure Code</a>, DNA test of accused is unavoidable in case of\n\nrape.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">[23].

The admissibility of such a test can be\n\nseen in the light of Ramji Lal being alive after 1947 and gave birth to\n\nthird son Manphol and daughter Maichandi. There was no valid\n\ndivorce between Ramji Lal and Sarti earlier to 1947, nor any Karewa\n\ncan be presumed in the absence of civil death of Ramji Lal from\n\n1942 to 1946.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">[24].         Firstly, there was a valid presumption of lawful marriage\n\nbetween Ramji Lal and Sarti from whose wedlock plaintiffs took\n\nbirth. Secondly, biological kins of Risala are to be established with\n\nthe aid of blood sampling of both the sides. Blood sampling of the\n\nplaintiffs in order to establish plaintiffs being son of Risala would be\n\na far fetched proposition in the light of Ramji Lal being alive upto the\n\nyear 1972. The status of the plaintiffs would be on questionable\n\nnote, if they are found to be not sons of Ramji Lal. The legitimacy of\n\nthe plaintiffs cannot be questioned so long as marriage between\n\nRamji Lal and Sarti subsisted.
