The motive for the crime is alleged\nto be a communal one, so to say, Muslims murdered a Hindu.  The petitioners were\narrested along with a juvenile and taken into custody.  The  police sent the\njuvenile to the Child Welfare Board under the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_5\">Juvenile Justice Act</a>.  The\npetitioners were remanded to judicial custody.  While so, the Investigating\nAgency had thought fit to subject the accused persons to Polygraph Test, Brain\nMapping Test and Narco Analysis Test.  The police approached the learned\nMagistrate and the learned Magistrate also passed orders enabling them to\nsubject the petitioners to such Tests.\n</blockquote>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\t4. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with, the order passed by the\nlearned Magistrate, this Criminal Revision Case is focussed.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">\t5. The bone of contention of the revision petitioners is that such tests\nare violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Indian Constitution and it would amount to\ntestimonial compulsion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t6. The learned Counsel for the petitioners would cite the following\ndecisions of the Honourable Apex Court:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_1\">(<a href=\"/doc/1938988/\" id=\"a_7\">i) Nandini Satpathy vs. P.L.Dhani</a> reported in (1978) 2 Supreme Court\nCases 424.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_2\">(<a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_8\">ii) D.K.Basu Vs.

Whereas the learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would submit\nthat such Tests are not against <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Indian Constitution.  The\npresent case is having wide ranging ramifications as the murder led to chain of\ncommunal clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Tenkasi area.  The police\nsuspected that there might be some big power or big mind behind the murder and\nwith that object in mind, they approached the learned Magistrate and got the\norder so as to subject the petitioners to such Tests.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\t8. The learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would cite the\nfollowing decisions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t(i) Dinesh Dalmia v.

At the outset, I would like to refer to the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1128661/\" id=\"a_10\">Dinesh Dalmia\nv. State</a> reported in 2006 Crl.L.J.2401, which is squarely on this point, so to\nsay, Brain Mapping and Narco Analysis Test are not prohibited under the law and\nthis Court arrived at the categorical conclusion that such  Tests would not\namount to violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Indian Constitution.  I am respectfully\nin agreement with the first decision cited supra.  The Honourable Apex Court,\nwhile laying down the law relating to the D.N.A Test, and other scientific\nTests, mandated that the Court should be averse towards modern technologies in\nfinding out the truth in the course of the investigation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_4\">10. The learned Counsel for the petitioners by placing reliance on the\naforesaid decision in <a href=\"/doc/1938988/\" id=\"a_12\">Nandini Satpathy vs. P.L.Dhani</a> reported in (1978) 2\nSupreme Court Cases 424 would expatiate and demonstrate that the police cannot\ncompel a man to speak against himself.  Certain excerpts from it, would run\nthus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t&quot;61. ... We hold that Section 161 enables the police to examine the\naccused during investigation.  The prohibitive sweep of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 20(3)</a> goes back\nto the stage of police interrogation not, as contended, commencing the Court\nonly.  In our judgement the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 20(3)</a> and Section 161(1)\nsubstantially cover the same area, so far as police investigations are\nconcerned.  The ban on self-accusation and the right to silence, while one\ninvestigation or trial is under way, goes beyond that case and protects the\naccused in regard to other offences pending or imminent, which may deter him\nfrom voluntary disclosure of criminatory matter.  We are disposed to read\n&#x27;compelled testimony&#x27; as evidence procured not merely by physical threats or\nviolence but by psychic torture atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion,\ntiring interrogative polixity, overbearing and intimidatory methods and the like\nnot legal penalty for violation.  So, the legal perils following upon refusal to\nanswer, or answer truthfully, cannot be regarded as compulsion within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 20(3).</a>  The prospect of prosecution may lead to legal tension\nin the  exercise of a constitutional right, but then, a stance of silence is\nrunning a calculated risk.  On the other hand, if there is any mode of pressure,\nsubtle or crude, mental or physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently\nsubstantial, applied by the policeman for obtaining information from an accused\nstrongly suggestive of guilt, it becomes &#x27;compelled testimony&#x27;, violative of\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 20(3).</a>  ....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t63. We have explained elaborately and summed up, in substance, what is\nself-incrimination or tendency to expose oneself to a criminal charge.  It is\nless than &#x27;relevant&#x27; and more than &#x27;confessional&#x27;.  Irrelevance is impermissible\nbut relevance is licit but when relevant questions are loaded with guilty\ninference in the event of an answer being supplied, the tendency to incriminate\nsprings into existence.  We hold further that the accused person can not be\nforced to answer questions merely because the answers thereto are not\nimplicative when viewed in isolation and confined to that particular case.  He\nis entitled to keep his mouth shut if the answer sought has a reasonable\nprospect of exposing him to guilt in some other accusation actual or imminent,\neven though the investigation underway is not with reference to that.  We have\nalready explained that in determining the incriminatory character of an answer\nthe accused is entitled to consider and the Court while adjusting will take note\nof the setting, the totality of circumstances, the equation, personal and\nsocial, which have a bearing on making an answer substantially innocent but in\neffect guilty in import.  However, fanciful claims, unreasonable apprehensions\nand vague possibilities cannot be the hiding ground for an accused person.  He\nis bound to answer where there is no clear tendency to criminate.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\t11. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_5\">In my considered opinion, the law <a href=\"/doc/1938988/\" id=\"a_17\">laid down by</a> the Honourable Apex\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1938988/\" id=\"a_18\">Nandini Satpathy vs. P.L.Dhani</a> reported in (1978) 2 Supreme Court Cases</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_6\">424.  as well as in <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_19\">D.K.Basu Vs. State of West Bengal</a> reported in AIR (1997) SC\n610, would not in any way, enure to the benefit of the petitioners to contend\nthat Polygraph Test,  Brain Mapping Test and Narco Analysis Test are prohibited.\nA man should not be tortured to give evidence consciously as against himself.\nBut, here, by using modern scientific method, the police is trying to cull out\nwhat is there in the sub-conscious mind of the petitioners.  On the one hand,\nthe law prohibits third degree methods being perpetrated on the accused in\nextorting confessions and information and the same law should not shut out the\nmodern technology being adopted by the Investigating Officer which would amount\nto completely putting an embargo in making head way in the investigation.</span>\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\t12. The ratiocination adopted by the Honourable Apex Court in catena of\ndecisions, would support the view that such tests are not violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article\n21</a> of the Indian Constitution and those decisions would squarely applicable in\nholding that other tests can rightly be done including Polygraph Test, Brain\nMapping Test and Narco Analysis Test also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_7\">13. The decision in <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_21\">Mr.&#x27;X&#x27; v. Hospital &#x27;Z</a>&#x27; reported in (1998) 8 S.C.C 296\nlaid down the following propositions:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t&quot;26. As one of the basic Human Rights, the right of privacy is not treated\nas absolute and is subject to such action as may be lawfully taken for the\nprevention of crime or disorder or protection of health or morals or protection\nof rights and freedoms of others.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t27. Right of privacy may, apart from contract, also arise out of a\nparticular specific relationship which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even\npolitical.  As already discussed above, doctor-patient relationship, though\nbasically commercial, is professionally, a matter of confidence and, therefore,\ndoctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality.  In such at\nsituation, public disclosure of even true private facts may amount to an\ninvasion of the right of privacy which may sometimes lead to the clash of one\nperson&#x27;s &quot;right to be let alone&quot; with another person&#x27;s right to be informed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t28. Disclosure of even true private facts has the tendency to disturb a\nperson&#x27;s tranquility.  It may generate many complexes in him and may even lead\nto psychological problems.  He may, thereafter, have disturbed life all through.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_8\">In the face of these potentialities, and as already held by this Court in its\nvarious decisions <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_22\">referred to above</a>, the right of privacy is an essential\ncomponent of the right to life envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Art.21.</a>  The right, however, is not\nabsolute and may be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or\nprotection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of others.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_9\">14. The Honourable Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_24\">Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal</a>\nreported in A.I.R 1993 S.C 2295, has held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t&quot;1) Courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of course;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t2) Whenever applications are made for such prayers in order to have roving\ninquiry the prayer for blood test cannot be entertained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband must\nestablish non-access in order to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\t4) The Court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of\nordering the blood test.

Now, the question arises as to\nwhether such other tests under <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 53</a> Cr.P.C., would include the Narco\nAnalysis Test and other Tests also.  One can take a cue from those words,\nactually what was there in the mind of the legislators.  The legislators, in\ntheir wisdom, thought that apart from the tests specifically contemplated in\nexpress words, the tests which have not expressly specified also, could be\nresorted to for culling out the truth and arriving at a proper conclusion.  No\ndoubt, the application of ejusdem genesis rule, may not permit one to take that\nNarco Analysis Test and such other Tests are contemplated by the words &#x27;such\nother tests&#x27; used in <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 53</a> Cr.P.C.  Still the Court could grasp and infer\nthat law is not averse to scientific tests.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_11\">16. The learned Counsel for the petitioners would argue that the right of\nan Advocate to be present with the accused cannot be denied in view of the\naforesaid decisions, viz., <a href=\"/doc/1938988/\" id=\"a_30\">Nandini Satpathy vs. P.L.Dhani</a> reported in (1978) 2\nSupreme Court <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_31\">Cases 424 and D.K.Basu Vs. State of West Bengal</a> reported in AIR\n(1997) SC 610.  In those decisions, the Honourable Apex Court permitted the\npresence of Advocate to the limited extent duration.  If the  Advocate is\npresent, then the accused will be able to convey his grievance and the\nAdvocate&#x27;s presence itself would prevent any abuse by the police.  So, the same\nformula can be applied here.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t17. The learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would submit that the\nAdvocate cannot be inside the Laboratory when the Narco Analysis Test is going\non.  But, he could be near that room, so that if the accused wants, he could go\nto his rescue.  The Advocate can also have a visit into that Laboratory Test\nroom, but he cannot be there throughout such Tests.  Pithily and precisely,\nconcisely and briefly, it could be laid down that mutatis-mutandis, the mandates\nas laid down in  Nandini Satpathy vs. P.L.Dhani reported in (1978) 2 Supreme\nCourt Cases 424 as well as in D.K.Basu Vs. State of West Bengal reported in AIR\n(1997) SC 610, shall be applicable even while Polygraph Test, Brain Mapping Test\nand Narco Analysis Test are going on.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">\t18. The learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would try to raise a\npoint that this petition itself is not maintainable, because on behalf of the\naccused, a memo was filed to the effect that they were having no objection for\nsuch Tests if the Advocate would be permitted to be present.  The principle\n&quot;Cuilibet licet juri pro se introducto renunciare&quot; would mean that any one may\nwaive or renounce the benefit of a principle or rule of law that exists only for\nhis protection.  The said maxim is subject to the embargo/rider that such\nrenunciation of right is not against the public policy.  It is therefore crystal\nclear that the accused cannot renounce his constitutional right or right which\nis conferred on him.  I do not want to rely on technical plea that there was\nadmission before the learned Magistrate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">\t19. In the result, I would like to hold that Polygraph Test, Brain Mapping\nTest and Narco Analysis Test are not violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the Indian\nConstitution for the  reasons cited supra.  While holding so, I want to add a\nrider to it that the police should not misuse or abuse it.  In this present day\ncontext, if Carte Blanche is given to the Police, then such Tests might be\nmisused for wrecking personal vendetta and in such eventualities, the judiciary\nshould interfere and thwart such attempts and save the innocent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">\t20. Here, having heard both sides, prima facie and ex facie, I could see\nno reason to countenance that such tests are intended for the purpose of\nwrecking personal vendetta or harassing the accused at the basket of any illegal\npower segment, but these tests are only for the purpose of culling out the truth\nin a genuine manner. Accordingly, this Criminal Revision Case is ordered.\nConsequently, connected M.P.(MD)No.1 of 2007 is closed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">rsb\n\nTo\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">1.The Inspector of Police,\n  Tenkasi Police Station,\n  Tenkasi,\n  Tirunelveli District.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">2.The Additional Public Prosecutor,\n  Madurai Bench of Madras High Court,\n  Madurai.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">\u001a</p>","numcites":14,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":1063185,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"narco analysis test","formInput":"narco%20analysis%20test"},{"value":"polygraph test","formInput":"polygraph%20test"},{"value":"narco teste","formInput":"narco%20teste"},{"value":"brain mapping","formInput":"brain%20mapping"},{"value":"narco analysis","formInput":"narco%20analysis"},{"value":"d k basu","formInput":"d%20k%20basu"},{"value":"brain mapping test","formInput":"brain%20mapping%20test"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"nandini satpathy","formInput":"nandini%20satpathy"},{"value":"article 20(3)","formInput":"article%2020%283%29"},{"value":"AIR 1997 SC 610","formInput":"AIR%201997%20SC%20610"},{"value":"article 20","formInput":"article%2020"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"\"polygraph\"","formInput":"%22polygraph%22"},{"value":"brain electrical oscillation signature ORR brain mapping","formInput":"brain%20electrical%20oscillation%20signature%20ORR%20brain%20mapping"},{"value":"juvenile","formInput":"juvenile"},{"value":"narco","formInput":"narco"},{"value":"criminal revision","formInput":"criminal%20revision"},{"value":"madurai","formInput":"madurai"},{"value":"\"article 21\"","formInput":"%22article%2021%22"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
