Respondent No. 2 All Ahmedabad (Chhoti Jamat) Mutton \nMerchant Association is an association of persons who are engaged in the \nsale of mutton in the city of Ahmedabad.  Respondent No.3 is an individual \nwho is doing the business of selling mutton in the city of Ahmedabad.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.\tThe common grievance of the respondents herein (the writ petitioners \nbefore the High Court), is that with a view to appease the Jain community \nthe State Government and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (in short \n\u0011the Corporation\u0012) have, from time to time, taken decisions/passed \nresolutions for closure of the municipal slaughter houses in Ahmedabad \nduring the period of the Paryushan festival (which is an important Jain \nfestival) resulting in serious violation of their fundamental right to trade and \ndo business in meat etc.  They have alleged that in the year 1993, the State \nGovernment accepted the demand of some organizations belonging to the \nJain community for closure of the municipal slaughter houses during the \nperiod of Paryushan and issued directions to the Corporation to take \nappropriate action accordingly.  In subsequent years, the Corporation passed \nresolutions for closure of the municipal slaughter houses for different period \nranging from 8 to 18 days during the Paryushan festival.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">5.\tThey have alleged that the closure of the municipal slaughter houses \ndirectly results in violation of their fundamental rights to do trade and \nbusiness as guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution and it cannot \nbe said to be a reasonable restriction merely because a particular community \nor a section of the society feels that for a particular period there should be \nclosure of the municipal slaughter houses as that will be in consonance with \nthe Jain ideology of Ahinsa (non-violence).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">6.\tThere were two resolutions impugned in the writ petition passed by \nthe Standing Committee of the Municipal Corporation for closure of the \nmunicipal slaughter houses in Ahmedabad during the Paryushan festival.  \nThese resolutions read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\t\u0013Resolution dated 14.8.1998:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Resolved that during the current year from 19.8.1998, \nMhah Paryushan Parv of Jain Religion begins.  Every \nyear during Paryushan Parv, the slaughter houses of this \nMunicipality are closes.  Accordingly, having regard to \nthe sentiments of the citizens of Jain Religion, during the \ncurrent year also, on account of Paryushan Parv from \n19.8.1998 to 26.8.1998, and as per the discussion in the \nCommittee, sanction should be obtained from the \nMunicipal Corporation, to close Municipal slaughter \nhouses every year, for eight days, during Paryushan Parv.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\t\tResolution dated 29.8.1999:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Resolved that as demanded by Shree Arihant Seva Samaj \nand All Gujarat Digambar Jain Samaj, Ahmedabad, in \nanticipation of the sanction of the Municipal Corporation, \nsanction is granted to close the Municipal slaughter \nhouse for the period 27.8.1998 to 5.9.1998 of Digambar \nJain Society Paryushan Parv from 27.8.1998 to 5.9.1998; \nand as per the discussion in the Committee, hereafter \nevery year, to close the municipal slaughter houses, for \nten days of Digambar Jain Samaj Paryushan Parv.\u0014  \n \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.\tThus it appears that the closure of slaughter houses in Ahmedabad \nwas ordered by the Corporation for a period of 18 days, first from 19.8.1998 \nto 26.8.1998 in connection with the festival of the Shvetamber sect of the \nJain community and the other from 27.8.1998 to 5.9.1998 during which the \nDigambar sect of the Jain community celebrates Paryushan festival.  \nHowever, during the course of the arguments, learned senior counsels for the \nappellants Mr. Soli Sorabjee and Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina stated that the \nclosure is only for 9 days and not for 18 days which is evident from \nparagraphs 20 &amp; 23 of the affidavit filed on behalf of Ahmedabad Municipal \nCorporation in the connected Civil Appeals (C.A. Nos. 5479-81/2005).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">8.\tThe impugned resolutions dated 14.8.1998 and 29.8.1999 were passed \nunder <a href=\"/doc/61722966/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 466(1)(D)(b)</a> of the Bombay Provincial Municipal \nCorporation Act, 1949.  The said provision reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\u0013The Commissioner may make standing orders consistent \nwith the provisions of this Act and the rules and by-laws \nin respect of the following matters, namely:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (A)\u0005\u0005\u0005. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t\t\t(B)\u0005\u0005\u0005.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     (C)\u0005\u0005\u0005.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t\t\t(D)\u0005\u0005\u0005.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"> (b)  fixing the days and the hours on and during \nwhich any market, slaughter-house or stock-yard \nmay be held or kept open for use and prohibiting \nthe owner of any private market from keeping it \nclosed without lawful excuse on such days or \nduring such hours\u0014.\n</blockquote>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">9.\tIt may be mentioned that the slaughter houses in Ahmedabad are \nowned and managed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, but the \nanimals which are slaughtered there belong to private persons represented by \nthe respondents herein, who bring their animals to the slaughter house for \nslaughtering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">10.\tThe stand taken by the Municipal Corporation is reflected in the \naffidavit of Dr. Anil, Asstt. Superintendent (Slaughter Houses) filed in \nSpecial Civil Application No. 9031 of 2000. In paragraph 6 and 7 of his \naffidavit, Dr. Anil has stated as under: \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\u0013 6. In reply to para 5 of the petition I state and submit \nthat it is no doubt true that the religions sentiments of the \nJain community are taken into consideration when \nimposing this ban.  I submit that it is not a question of \nJain community imposing its will upon rest of the people, \nbut it is a question of one section of society who believes \nin kindness to animals making a request that during their \nreligious days their sentiments may be respected for these \nfew days, if not for all times. It is considering this \nreligious sentiment that for a few days ban is imposed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">7. In  reply to para 7 of the petition, I state that the \npetitioner is right in saying that the question which arises \nbefore this Hon\u0012ble Court is one of principle and not of \nany specific event which happened during a particular \nyear.  I further state and submit that the Corporation has \nstated earlier what are the reasons which have led it to \nimpose a ban for a few days during the Jain religious \ndays.  In reply to the principles raised as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(i)\tI respectfully state and submit that looking \nto the long term interest of the city and \nharmony with which the citizens are \nexpected to live, the Corporation is well \nwithin its right for closing down the \nslaughter houses for a limited period of time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(ii)\tI state and submit that such a closure is \ncertainly undisputable in public interest and \nthe restriction which it places temporarily \nfor a few days on the slaughter of animals is \nin no way contrary to the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(iii)\tI state and submit that the action of the \nCorporation is well within its power and not \nmalafide and not contrary to law and not \nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(iv)\tI state that the Corporation\u0012s action as stated \nabove is taken not to discriminate between \nthe communities but to see that if \ncommunities respect each others\u0012 feeling \nand that more tolerant society where people \nof different religions can live together \nhappily is brought about.  Such a desire of \nthe Corporation can by no means be \nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of \nIndia.  It is important to appreciate that the \nCorporation is not deciding between the \nJains and other communities.  What the \nCorporation is attempting to do is to see that \nthe religious beliefs of all communities and \nclasses of society are respected placing as \nlittle restriction or curb on the other \ncommunity so that all can live harmoniously \nand peacefully.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(v)\tI state that there is no fundamental right to \nslaughter animals.  I state and submit that \nthe impugned action as stated above is \nabsolutely in public interest and as already \nstated above, it is not to satisfy religious \nsentiments of a particular section but to see \nthat the community as a whole lives \ncordially respecting each other\u0012s religious \nbelief. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(vi)\tI respectfully state and submit that <a href=\"/doc/61722966/\" id=\"a_5\">Section \n466(1)(d)(b)</a> is legal and just and I leave it to \nmy lawyer to raise relevant argument on this \nlegal issue.   \n</blockquote>     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(vii)\tI state and submit that the action of the \ncorporation is legal and valid.  It is an \nabsolutely bonafide exercise of power.  It is \nnot for a collateral purpose viz. to appease \nJains.  I am not going into length on the \nsame issue as the same has been referred to \nin former paragraphs of the affidavit.  I state \nand submit that the power has been \nexercised to see that the citizens of \nAhmedabad can all live cordially together \nrespecting religious sentiments of each \nother\u0014. \n</blockquote>     \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">11.\tThe State Government filed its reply in Special Civil Application No. \n9509 of 1993.  In paragraph 4 of the affidavit filed by Shri M.V. Khalasi, \nUnder Secretary to the Government, Urban Development and urban Housing \nDepartment, reference has been made to the incident involving murder of \nSmt. Gitaben Shah (Activist of Hinsa Nivaran Samiti) and it has been \naverred that keeping in view the representations made by the Jain \norganizations and personal requests made by eminent citizens it was decided \nto close the slaughter houses during the Paryushan days.  Shri Khalasi has \nreferred to the judgment of Supreme Court in Jan Mohammed\u0012s case and \naverred that the petitioners cannot complain of the violation of their \nfundamental rights of trade and business simply because the Municipal \nslaughter houses are closed during the period of the Paryushan.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">12.\tDuring the pendency of the petitions, Hinsa Virodhak Sangh, Satellite \nMurtipujak Jain Sangh, Shree Laxmi Vardak Jain Sangh and Shree \nShahibaug Girdhar Nagar Jain Swetambar Murti Pujak Sangh got \nthemselves impleaded as parties to the writ petitions or were allowed to be \nimpleaded as party respondents.  Thereafter, Dr. K.K. Shah, President of \nHinsa Virodhak Sangh filed affidavit dated 17.8.1998 in Special Civil \nApplication No. 6239 of 1998.  He has referred to the Farman issued by \nMughal Emperor Akbar in the 16th century, notifying 12 days of the month \nof Badharva including 8 days of the Paryushan as the period of abstinence \nduring which no living creature would be slaughtered, and averred that the \npetitioners\u0012 right to trade and business in livestock, meat etc. is not violated \non account of closure of the slaughter houses during the period of the \nParyushan.  Shri Jayesh Manubhai Shah has also filed affidavit 17.8.1998 on \nbehalf of three Jain Sanghs.  In paragraph 4 of his affidavit, Shri Jayesh \nManubhai Shah has averred as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\u0013The Jain religion is a very old religion based mainly on \nthe principles of \u0013Ahinsa\u0014 of the highest order.   In the \ndays of Paryushan Parva all the Jains all over the world \nwill observe various religious activities such as fasting, \nprayers, attending the lectures providing and observing \n\u0013Ahinsa\u0014.  The Jains are believing in not killing or \nhurting even a small insect, therefore, the killing or \ncutting of the animals in the slaughter houses during \nthese days of Paryushan Parva affect and hurt the \nreligious feelings of all Jains.  The respondent Nos. 1 and \n2 have been respecting the religious feeling of Jains since \nlast many years and during the closure of the slaughter \nhouses in Paryushan Parva days there are no complaints \nregarding non-supply of meat or its products by \nconsumers, traders etc. thereof\u0014.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">13.\tIt was submitted by learned counsel for the appellants before the High \nCourt that the closure of the municipal slaughter houses during the period of \nParyushan should be declared as an unreasonable  restriction on the rights of \nthe writ petitioners to carry on trade and business in livestock, mutton etc.   \nIt is alleged that the impugned resolutions were passed by the Corporation in \nview of the demand made by some organizations belong to the Jain \ncommunity and it has nothing to do with the general public interest.  It was \nfurther submitted that the fundamental rights of those engaged in the trade \nand business of slaughtering animals and/or selling meat etc which is \nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution cannot be put to peril \nor jeopardized with a view to assuage the feelings of any particular \ncommunity or a particular section of society, or as a mark of religious \nsentiments of a particular community.

The Division Bench of the High Court held that the \nwrit petitioners\u0012 right to freedom to carry on the trade of slaughtering and \nselling meat cannot be curtailed or abridged merely at the asking of a \nparticular section of society, or organizations belonging to a particular \ncommunity merely because the members of that particular community feel \nthat according to their religion people should not eat non-vegetarian food \nduring a particular festival.  The Division Bench was of the view that \nwhether the people eat vegetarian food or non-vegetarian food is their \nprivate affair and the Court cannot make any pronouncement about it.  \nPeople living in different parts of the country have different eating habits.  \nEven in a particular locality, village or town, there are some who are \nvegetarian and others who are non-vegetarian.  The Division Bench held that \nno restriction can be placed on the slaughtering or eating of meat merely \nbecause it may hurt the sentiments or the religious feelings of a particular \ncommunity or a society. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1849054\" id=\"span_3\">18.\tThe Division Bench of the High Court strongly relied on the decision \nof a Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1849054/\" id=\"a_15\">Mohd.

The Court observed that a bull, bullock or \nbuffalo did not remain useful after it was 15 years old, and whatever little \nuse it may then have was greatly offset by the economic disadvantages of \nfeeding and maintaining unserviceable cattle.  This Court also held that the \nadditional condition that the animal must, apart from being above 20 or 25 \nyears of age, be unfit was a further unreasonable restriction.

In the aforesaid decision the Seven-Judge \nConstitution Bench has referred, inter alia, to the decision in the Five-Judge \nConstitution Bench decision in Md.

In \nparagraph 67 of the Seven-Judge bench judgment it has been observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\u0013The State and every citizen of India must have \ncompassion for living creatures.  Compassion, according \nto the Oxford Advanced Learner\u0012s Dictionary means \u0013a \nstrong feeling of sympathy for those who are suffering \nand a desire to help them\u0014.  According to the Chambers \n20th Century Dictionary, compassion is fellow-feeling, or \nsorrow for the sufferings of another; pity\u0012\u0014.

The concept \nof compassion for living creatures enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1644544/\" id=\"a_19\">Article \n51-A(g)</a> is based on the background of the rich cultural \nheritage of India the land of Mahatma Gandhi, Vinobha, \nMahaveer, Buddha, Nanak and others.

In our opinion, the impugned resolutions of Ahmedabad \nMunicipal Corporation are valid, and there is no violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_21\">, \n19(1)(g)</a> or 21 of the Constitution.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">26.\tHad the impugned resolutions ordered closure of municipal slaughter \nhouses for a considerable period of time we may have held the impugned \nresolutions to be invalid being an excessive restriction on the rights of the \nbutchers of Ahmedabad who practise their profession of meat selling.  After \nall, butchers are practicing a trade and it is their fundamental right under \n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution which is guaranteed to all citizens of \nIndia.  Moreover, it is not a matter of the proprietor of the butchery shop \nalone. There may be also several workmen therein who may become \nunemployed if the slaughter houses are closed for a considerable period of \ntime, because one of the conditions of the licence given to the shop-owners \nis to supply meat regularly in the city of Ahmedabad and this supply comes \nfrom the municipal slaughter houses of Ahmedabad.  Also, a large number \nof people are non-vegetarian and they cannot be compelled to become \nvegetarian for a long period.  What one eats is one\u0012s personal affair and it is \na part of his right to privacy which is included in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of our \nConstitution as held by several decisions of this Court.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_24\">R.

The Jains \nhave a religious festival called Paryushan during which they do penance. \nOut of respect, for their sentiments surely the non-vegetarians can remain \nvegetarians for 9 days in a year.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">29.\tMr. Soli Sorabjee, learned senior counsel for one the appellants \nsubmitted that even non-vegetarians can get meat from other cities of \nGujarat or from other States during these 9 days\u0012 period of Paryushan and \nthey will not be compelled to become vegetarians.  Learned counsel \nsubmitted that it is only the municipal slaughter houses  which are closed for \n9 days, but there is no ban on eating meat during those 9 days which can \neasily be procured from outside. We do not agree.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">30.\tWe have to take a practical view of the matter.  Most people do not \nhave the money to purchase meat from other cities or other States and bring \nit to Ahmedabad.  Almost all meat eaters get their meat from the local \nbutcher shop in the city, usually from a shop which is close to their \nresidence.  Hence, closure of the slaughter house, in substance, means \ncompelling the non-vegetarians to become vegetarians for 9 days. \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">31.\tHowever, we agree with Mr. Sorabjee that the restriction is only a \npartial restriction for a limited period, and it is not disproportionate.

Row</a> 1952 SCR \n597, where this Court observed that while determining the reasonable \nrestriction, the Court should consider not only the factors of the restriction \nsuch as the duration and the extent but also the circumstances and the \nmanner in which the imposition has been authorized.   The Court further \nobserved:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">\u0013It is important in this context to bear in mind that the \ntest of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be \napplied to each individual statute impugned, and no \nabstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness \ncan be laid down as applicable to all cases.  The nature of \nthe right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying \npurpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and \nurgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the \ndisproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions \nat the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict.  In \nevaluating such elusive factors and forming their own \nconception of what is reasonable, in all the circumstances \nof a given case, it is inevitable that the social philosophy \nand the scale of values of the judges participating in the \ndecision should play an important part, and the limit to \ntheir interference with legislative judgment in such cases \ncan only be dictated by their sense of responsibility and \nself-restraint and the sobering reflection that the \nConstitution is meant not only for people of their way of \nthinking but for all, and that the majority of the elected \nrepresentatives of the people have, in authorizing the \nimposition of the restrictions, considered them to be \nreasonable\u0014.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">34.\tThe aforesaid observations have become locus classicus.  In the \npresent case we have noticed that the closure of the slaughter house is only \nfor 9 days and not for a considerable period of time.  This decision indicates \nthat the restriction is reasonable. A period of 9 days is a very short time and \nsurely the non-vegetarians can become vegetarians during those 9 days out \nof respect for the feeling of the Jain community.  Also, the dealers in meat \ncan do their business for 356 days in a year, and they have to abstain from it \nfor only 9 days in a year.

A piece \nof delegated legislation is also statutory in character and the only limitation \non it is that it should not violate the provisions of the parent statute or of the \nConstitution.

In our opinion, \nthe same principle also applies when judging the constitutional validity of \ndelegated legislation and here also there should be judicial restraint.  There \nis a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of statutes as well as \ndelegated legislation, and it is only when there is a clear violation of a \nconstitutional provision (or of the parent statute, in the case of delegated \nlegislation) beyond reasonable doubt that the Court should declare it to be \nunconstitutional.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">40.\tIn the present case, we do not find any clear violation of any \nconstitutional provision by the impugned resolutions.

However, in the present case, the closure is only for \na few days and has been done out of respect for the sentiments of the Jain \ncommunity which has a large population in Gujarat.

There are a large number of religions, castes, \nlanguages, ethnic groups, cultures, etc. in our country.  Somebody is tall, \nsomebody is short, somebody is fair, somebody is brown, somebody is dark \nin complexion, someone has Caucasian features, someone has Mongoloid \nfeatures, someone has Negroid features, etc.  We may compare our country \nwith China which is larger in population and size than India. China has 1.3 \nbillion people while our population is 1.1 billion.  Also, China has more than \ntwice our land area.  However, there is broad homogeneity in China. All \nChinese have Mongoloid features; they have a common written script \n(Mandarin Chinese) and 96% of them belong to one ethnic group called the \nHan Chinese.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">42.\tOn the other hand, India as stated above, has tremendous diversity and \nthis is due to large scale migrations and invasion into India over thousands \nof years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">43.\tPeople migrate from uncomfortable areas to comfortable areas.  \nBefore the coming of modern industry there were agricultural societies and \nIndia was a paradise for these because agriculture requires level land, fertile \nsoil, plenty of water for irrigation etc. which was in abundance in India.  \nWhy would anybody living in India migrate to Afganistan which has a  \nharsh terrain, rocky and mountainous and covered with snow for several \nmonths in a year when one cannot grow any crop?  Hence, almost all \nmigrations and invasions came from outside into India (except in recent \ntimes when some people have gone to other countries for job opportunities).  \nMost of the migrations/invasions came from the North-West, and to a much \nlesser extent from the North-East of India.  Thus, people kept pouring into \nIndia, and it is for this reason that there is so much diversity in India. \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">44.\tAs the great Urdu poet Firaq Gorakhpuri wrote :\n</p>     \n     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">    lj t+ehus fgan ij vdokes vkye ds fQjkd\n    dkfQys xqt+jrs x, fgUnqLrku Ckurk x;k\n       \n\t\tWhich means \u0016 \n\t\t\u0013In the land of Hind, the Caravans of the peoples of \n\t\tThe world kept coming in and India kept getting formed\u0014\n\t\t\n\t\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">45.\tSince India is a country of great diversity, it is absolutely essential if \nwe wish to keep our country united to have tolerance and respect for all \ncommunities and sects.

The Emperor declared his policy of \nSuleh-e-Kul, which means universal tolerance of all religions and \ncommunities.  He abolished Jeziya in 1564 and the pilgrim tax in 1563 on \nHindus and permitted his Hindu wife to continue to practise her own religion \neven after their marriage.  This is evident from the Jodha Bai Palace in \nFatehpur Sikri which is built on Hindu architectural pattern.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">49.\tIn 1578, the Parsi theologian Dastur Mahyarji Rana was invited to the \nEmperor\u0012s court and he had detailed discussions with Emperor Akbar and \nacquainted him about the Parsi religion.  Similarly, the Jesuit Priests Father \nAntonio Monserrate, Father Rodolfo Acquaviva and Father Francisco \nEnriques etc. also came to the Emperor\u0012s court on his request and acquainted \nhim about the Christian religion.  The Emperor also became acquainted with \nSikhism and came into contact with Guru Amar Das and Guru Ram Das (see \n`The Mughal Empire\u0012 by R.C. Majumdar).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">50.\tThus, as stated in the Cambridge History of India (Vol.IV \u0016 The \nMughal Period) Emperor Akbar conceived the idea of becoming the father \nof all his subjects, rather than the leader of only the Muslims, and he was far \nahead of his times.  As mentioned by Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru in `The \nDiscovery of India\u0012, \u0013Akbar\u0012s success is astonishing, for he created a sense \nof oneness among the diverse elements of India.\u0014\n     \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">51.\tIn 1582, the Emperor invited and received a Jain delegation consisting \nof Hiravijaya Suri, Bhanuchandra Upadhyaya and Vijayasena Suri.  Jainism, \nwith its doctrine of non-violence, made a profound impression on him and \ninfluenced his personal life.  He curtailed his food and drink and ultimately \nabstained from flesh diet altogether for several months in the year.  He \nrenounced hunting which was his favourite pastime, restricted the practice of \nfishing and released prisoners and caged birds.  Slaughter of animals was \nprohibited on certain days and ultimately in 1587 for about half the days in \nthe year.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">52.\tAkbar\u0012s contact with Jains began as early as 1568, when Padma \nSunder who belonged to the Nagpuri Tapagaccha was honoured by him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">53.\tAs mentioned in Dr. Ishwari Prasad\u0012s `The Mughal Empire\u0012, the Jains \nhad a great influence on the Emperor.  A disputation was held in Akbar\u0012s \ncourt between the Jain monks Buddhisagar of Tapgaccha and Suddha Kirti \nof Khartargaccha on the subject of Jain religious ceremony called Pansadha \nin which the winner was given the title Jagatguru by Akbar.  Having heard \nof the virtues and learning of Hir Vijaya Suri in 1582 the Emperor sent an \ninvitation to him through the Mughal Viceroy at Ahmedabad.  He accepted it \nin the interests of his religion.  He was offered money by the Viceroy to \ndefray the expenses of the journey but he refused.  The delegation consisting \nof Hir Vijaya Suri, Bhanu Chandra Upadhyaya and Vijaya Sen Suri started \non their journey and walked on foot to Fatehpur Sikri and were received \nwith great honour befitting imperial guests.  Hir Vijaya Suri had discussion \nwith Abul Fazl.  He propounded the doctrine of Karma and an impersonal \nGod.  When he was introduced to the Emperor he defended true religion and \ntold him that the foundation of faith should be daya (compassion) and that \nGod is one though he is differently named by different faiths.  \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">54.\tThe Emperor received instruction in Dharma from Suri who explained \nthe Jain doctrines to him.  He discussed the existence of God and the \nqualities of a true Guru and recommended non-killing (Ahinsa).  The \nEmperor was persuaded to forbid the slaughter of animals for six months in \nGujarat and to abolish the confiscation of the property of deceased persons, \nthe Sujija Tax (Jeziya) and a Sulka (possibly a tax on pilgrims) and to free \ncaged birds and prisoners.  He stayed for four years at Akbar\u0012s court and left \nfor Gujarat in 1586.  He imparted a knowledge of Jainism to Akbar and \nobtained various concessions to his religion.  The Emperor is said to have \ntaken a vow to refrain from hunting and expressed a desire to leave off meat-\neating for ever as it had become repulsive.  The Emperor presented to him \nPadma Sundar scriptures which were preserved in his palace.  He offered \nthem to Suri as a gift and he was pressed by the Emperor to accept them.  \nThe killing of animals was forbidden for certain days.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">55.\tIf the Emperor Akbar could forbid meat eating for six months in a \nyear in Gujarat, is it unreasonable to abstain from meat for nine days in a \nyear in Ahmedabad today?  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">56.\tEmperor Akbar was a propagator of Suleh-i-Kul (universal toleration) \nat a time when Europeans were indulging in religious massacres e.g. the St. \nBartholomew Day massacre in 1572 of Protestants, (called Huguenots) in \nFrance by the Catholics, the burning at the stake of Protestants by Queen \nMary of England, the massacre by the Duke of Alva of millions of people \nfor their resistance to Rome and the burning at the stake of Jews during the \nSpanish Inquisition.  We may also mention the subsequent massacre of the \nCatholics in Ireland by Cromwell, and the mutual massacre of Catholics and \nProtestants in Germany during the thirty year war from 1618 to 1648 in \nwhich the population of Germany was reduced from 18 million to 12 \nmillion.  Thus, Emperor Akbar was far ahead of even the Europeans of his \ntimes. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">57.\tEmperor Akbar himself abstained from eating meat on Fridays and \nSundays and on some other days, as has been mentioned in the Ain-I-Akbari \nby Abul Fazl.   \n</p>       \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">58.\tIt was because of the wise policy of toleration of the Great Emperor \nAkbar that the Mughal empire lasted for so long, and hence the same wise \npolicy of toleration alone can keep our country together despite so much \ndiversity. \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">59.\tWe may give another historical illustration of tolerance in our \ncountry.  In the reign of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of Avadh, in a certain year \nHoli and Muharrum coincidentally fell on the same day.  Holi is a festival of \njoy, whereas Muharrum is an occasion for mourning.  The Hindus of \nLucknow decided that they would not celebrate Holi that year out of respect \nfor the sentiments for their Muslim brethren. On that day, the Nawab joined \nthe Muharrum procession and after burial of the Tazia at Karbala he \nenquired why Holi is not being celebrated.  He was told that it was not being \ncelebrated because the Hindus out of respect for the sentiments of their \nMuslim brethren had decided not to play Holi that year because it was a day \nof mourning for the Muslims. On hearing this, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah \ndeclared that since Hindus have respected the sentiments of their Muslim \nbrothers, it is also the duty of the Muslims to respect the sentiments of their \nHindu brethren.  Hence, he announced that Holi would be celebrated the \nsame day and he himself was the first who started playing Holi on that day \nand thereafter everyone in Lucknow, including the Muslims, played Holi, \nalthough it was Muharrum day also.  It is this kind of sentiment of tolerance \nwhich alone can keep our country united.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">60.\tWe are making these comments because what we are noticing now-a-\ndays is a growing tendency of intolerance in our country. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">61.\t<a href=\"/doc/1200881/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 1(1)</a> of the Constitution states \u0013India i.e Bharat is a Union of \nStates\u0014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">62.\tIt may be mentioned that during the Constituent Assembly debates \nsome members of the Constituent Assembly were of the view that India \nshould be described as a Federation.  However, instead of the word \n&quot;Federation&quot; the word &quot;Union&quot; was deliberately selected by the Drafting \nCommittee of the Constituent Assembly to indicate two things, viz., (a) that \nthe Indian Union is not the result of an agreement by the States, and (b) that \nthe component States have no freedom to secede from it. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">63.\tMoving the Draft Constitution for the consideration of the Constituent \nAssembly on November 4, 1948, Dr. Ambedkar, Chairman of the Drafting \nCommittee explained the significance of the use of the expression &quot;Union&quot; \ninstead of the expression &quot;Federation&quot;:-  \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">&quot;It is true that South Africa which is a unitary State is \ndescribed as a Union.  But Canada which is a Federation \nis also called a Union. Thus the description of India as a \nUnion, though its constitution is federal, does no violence \nto usage.  But what is important is that the use of the \nword &quot;Union&quot; is deliberate.  I do not know why the word \n&quot;Union&quot; was used in the Canadian Constitution.  But I \ncan tell you why the Drafting Committee has used it.  \nThe Drafting Committee wanted to make  it clear that \nthough India was to be a federation, the federation was \nnot the result of an agreement by the States to join in a \nfederation, and that the federation not being the result of \nan agreement, no State has the right to secede from it.  \nThe federation is a Union because it is indestructible.  \nThough the country and the people may be divided into \ndifferent States for convenience of administration, the \ncountry is one integral whole, its people a single people \nliving under a single imperium derived from a single \nsource.  The Americans had to wage a civil war to \nestablish that the States have no right of secession and \nthat their federation was indestructible.  The Drafting \nCommittee thought that it was better to make it clear at \nthe outset rather than to leave it to speculation or to \ndispute&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">64.\tThe Drafting Committee thus clearly attached great importance to the \nuse of the term &quot;Union&quot; as symbolic of the determination of the Assembly to \nmaintain the unity of the country.
