The Defendants in this matter include Defendant No. 1, a\n                          Telugu actor and younger son of Mr. Mohan Babu; Defendant No. 2,\n                          unidentified individuals/media houses; Defendant No. 3, a social\n                          media platform; Defendant No. 4, a video-sharing platform;\n                          Defendant No. 5, a government entity regulating digital content; and\n                          Defendant Nos. 6 to 11, digital media publishers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">                          4.     The dispute arose when Defendant No. 1, embroiled in a family\n                          conflict with his father and brother, made defamatory allegations\n                          against the Plaintiff via tweets dated December 9 and 13, 2024,\n                          accusing him of manipulation and fabrication without substantiating\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">By:AANCHAL TAGGAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Signing Date:24.12.2024   CS(OS) 1008/2024                                               Page 2 of 30</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">21:18:33</span>\n                           the claims.

Media articles and videos on\n                          platforms run by Defendants No. 4 and No. 6 to 11 amplified these\n                          defamatory claims, tarnishing the Plaintiff‟s reputation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">                          5.

Prima facie case is not to be\n                                     confused with prima facie title which has to be established,\n                                     on evidence at the trial. Only prima facie case is a\n                                     substantial question raised, bona fide, which needs\n                                     investigation and a decision on merits. Satisfaction that\n                                     there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant\n                                     injunction. The Court further has to satisfy that non-\n                                     interference by the Court would result in &quot;irreparable\n                                     injury&quot; to the party seeking relief and that there is no other\n                                     remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction\n                                     and he needs protection from the consequences of\n                                     apprehended injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury,\n                                     however, does not mean that there must be no physical\n                                     possibility of repairing the injury, but means only that the\n                                     injury must be a material one, namely one that cannot be\n                                     adequately compensated by way of damages. The third\n                                     condition also is that &quot;the balance of convenience&quot; must be\n                                     in favour of granting injunction. The Court while granting\n                                     or refusing to grant injunction should exercise sound\n                                     judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial\n                                     mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the\n                                     parties, if the injunction is refused and compare it with that\n                                     it is likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is\n                                     granted.

This is for the reason that\n                                     once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the\n                                     right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a\n                                     legitimate subject for comment by press and media\n                                     among others.

In the case of public officials, it is\n                                     obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy\n                                     of action for damages is simply not available with\n                                     respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\n                                     discharge of their official duties. This is so even where\n                                     the publication is based upon facts and statements\n                                     which are not true, unless the official establishes that\n                                     the publication was made (by the defendant) with\n                                     reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be\n                                     enough for the defendant (member of the press or\n                                     media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\n                                     verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\n                                     prove that what he has written is true. Of course,\n                                     where the publication is proved to be false and\n                                     actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n                                     defendant would have no defence and would be liable\n                                     for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not\n                                     relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public\n                                     official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen,\n                                     as explained in (1) and (2) above.

The above acts by the Defendants collectively prima facie\n                          create a sustained and defamatory narrative against the Plaintiff.\n                          These allegations, allegedly unsupported by any evidence, have prima\n                          facie potential of causing irreparable harm to the Plaintiff‟s\n                          professional and personal reputation.

It may lead to widespread public\n                          dissemination and lasting damage to his image. Consequently, the\n                          Plaintiff has a strong prima facie case for the grant of an ad interim\n                          ex-parte injunction to prevent further harm to his reputation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">                          39.    Insofar as Defendant No. 9 is concerned, the learned counsel\n                          for the Defendant no. 9 (Hindustan Times Media) stated that the\n                          contents/articles which are being termed as defamatory by the plaintiff\n                          refer to the content as „alleged‟, „according to reports‟, „according to\n                          sources‟. He, therefore, argued that the content cannot be termed as\n                          defamatory as it was not a categorical assertion or information which\n                          was being published by Defendant no. 9.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">                          40.

The learned counsel for Defendant No. 9 countered this\n                          argument, stating that the article itself mentions that the plaintiff and\n                          the other parties were not available for their comments. However,\n                          during the course of arguments, both the parties were ad idem that the\n                          Defendant No. 9 would contact the Plaintiff and would publish his\n                          side of version or clarification without prejudice to their rights or\n                          contentions. Given the said undertaking by the learned counsel for the\n                          Defendant No. 9, the learned senior counsel for the Plaintiff submitted\n                          that his prayer qua Defendant No. 9, as far as interim relief qua it is\n                          concerned, will stand satisfied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">                          42.
