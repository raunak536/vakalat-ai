Let me first deal with the two applications, seeking\nquashing of the first information report.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.    It appears from the materials on record that the first\ninformant got married with one Nimeshbhai Desai, original\naccused No.1 on 20th May, 2014.             Soon after the marriage,\nmatrimonial disputes cropped up between the husband and\nwife, which ultimately led to the filing of the first information\nreport for the offences enumerated above. It appears that the\nhusband of the first informant is a doctor. The first informant\nis also a doctor (pediatrician). The first information report is\nextracted hereunder;\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      &quot;My name is Nikita, w/o Nimesh Bharatbhai Desai, aged\n      about 28 years, occupation service, residing at Mahadev\n      Vas, Kheralu, Tal.

Sabarkantha. Mobile No. 9428312479.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> I dictate the fact of my complaint that I reside at the\n above address and since 20/3/2017, I am staying at Idar\n with my father Bharatbhai Prabhudas Desai. I work as\n Pediatrician in the Sanjivani Pediatric Private Hospital and\n I commute from Idar to Himmatnagar at the place of my\n service. My marriage was solemnized on 20/5/2014 with\n Nimesh Bharatbhai Desai at Mahadev Vas, Kheralu as per\n customs of our society. Since then, we were living\n together as husband and wife. After marriage, I stayed at\n Kheralu with my husband and mother-in-law and father-\n in-law for one month. Thereafter, as my husband was\n doing internship of M.D. at Vadodara, I stayed with my\n husband for two and a half years at 22, Vrajvihar Duplex,\n Near Vishwamitri Society, Near Gujarat Tact, Vishwamitri,\n Vadodara. I was also doing service at the Dadaji Pediatric\n Hospital, Baranpur, Vadodara and I was drawing monthly\n salary of Rs. 12,000/-. Thereafter, in August 2016, as my\n husband completed M.D., he got a service at Surat as a\n Medical Officer in Unn Corporation. We came to stay at\n Surat from Vadodara and we were staying at 602, Shalin\n Enclave, Near Raj Corner, SUDA Aawas Road, Pal, T.P. 10,\n L.P. Savani Circle, Adajan, Surat. I was doing service as a\n Medical Officer at the Neo Plus Neonatal ICU Hospital,\n Adajan at the salary of Rs. 16,000/- per month. I was\n staying with my husband and as my father-in-law is\n working as Veterinary Officer at Satlasana, he stays there\n and my mother-in-law Nayanaben stays with my Jeth\n (elder brother of husband) at Ahmedabad and commutes\n to Satlasana. I do not have any children. My husband\n loved me very much till about six months from my\n marriage and we consumed all the rights as husband and\n wife. Suddenly after six months of my marriage, I noticed\n that the behaviour of my husband had changed and he\n developed sexual perversion. But as we both were having\n good jobs and as we were husband and wife, I ignored his\n such behaviour of sexual perversion and as I used to\n support my husband in all the works as per his desire and\n as I did not oppose him, he had got a free hand. His\n actions changed as the days passed and his bad\n demands also increased. When I used to stay alone at my\n house at Adajan, Surat after my job, my husband used to\n force me to indulge in oral sex with him and if I would\n oppose, then he sometimes used to allure me with love\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                       Page 4 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n and sometimes, he used to threaten me. But I used to\n bear all these as I was his wife. Thereafter, I realized that\n my husband became more perverted. On holidays, when\n we used to go out to gardens or public places, he used to\n force me to have sexual relations in public and he used\n to often compel me to do oral sex. Thereafter, his mental\n pervertness increased and at times, he used to have\n sexual intercourse with me forcibly against my consent\n without considering whether it was night or day. After\n some time, along with the oral sex, my husband used to\n take off my clothes and used to tell me to have unnatural\n sex with him. When I denied to do it, he started moving\n his fingers on my vagina and started oral sex. Because of\n his such act, I was mentally and physically broken down.\n When I told my husband not to do unnatural sex with me,\n he threatened me saying you are my lawful wife and\n being your husband I have right over all the parts of your\n body and you do not have any child till today and you will\n not have any child in future also. I have made you my\n wife just to fulfill my sexual desires. You can go wherever\n you want. I will get much better girls than you. He used\n to tell me this and if I do not give in to his demands, he\n used to beat me up. Though my father-in-law and\n mother-in-law were aware about this, they used to\n provoke my husband to give me this kind of physical and\n mental torture. However, I used to bear all this\n harassment so that me and my parents are not defamed\n in the society and therefore, I did not inform my parents\n regarding this.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> My husband forcefully made me to remove my clothes\n against my wish and committed oral sex and raped me at\n about half past nine in the night on 19/03/2017. He\n started oral sex by moving fingers over my private part\n i.e. vagina. Therefore, I got frightened by his such act. I\n informed my brother Amar residing in Idar about such\n indecent acts of my husband over phone and silently\n slept in the main room of our house. I and my husband\n woke up in the morning next day. After having breakfast,\n when my husband went for the job, I grabbed the\n opportunity and came to my maternal house in Idar from\n Adajan Surat. I informed my parents and my brother\n about indecent acts of my husband and physical and\n mental harassment being meted out to me. The persons\n from maternal side held talks with in-laws for\n compromise in this regard so that our reputation is not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                        Page 5 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">      R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n      tarnished in the society, but they had been telling me till\n      date that, &quot;You can lodge the complaint anywhere you\n      want. Our son will remain as he is and he will not\n      improve.&quot; Therefore, I have been compelled to lodge the\n      complaint. It is my lawful complaint against my husband\n      and my in-laws. My witnesses are the persons mentioned\n      in the complaint and other persons, who may be found\n      during the investigation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      The facts of my complaint as dictated are true and\n      correct. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.    It also appears from the materials on record that a\nCoordinate Bench of this Court granted anticipatory bail to the\nhusband by an order dated 12th October, 2017 passed in the\nCriminal Misc. Application No.25606 of 2017. The applicants of\nthe Criminal Misc. Application No.24342 of 2017 are the father-\nin-law and the mother-in-law respectively of the first informant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.    On 6th November, 2017, this Court passed the following\norder;\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      &quot;1. This Court is called upon to decide a question of\n      utmost public importance. whether a wife can initiate\n      prosecution against her husband for unnatural sex\n      punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_5\">section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code ?.\n      If the husband forces his wife to indulge in oral sex,\n      whether the same would constitute an offence under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_6\">section 377</a> of the IPC?. If the husband compels his wife\n      to indulge in oral sex, whether the same would constitute\n      an offence of cruelty within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_7\">section 498-A</a>\n      of the IPC. This Court would also like to examine the\n      question whether forcing a wife by the husband to\n      indulge in oral sex would amount to rape punishable\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_8\">section 376</a> of the IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      2. Marital rape is in existence in India, a disgraceful\n      offence that has scarred the trust and confidence in the\n      institution of marriage. A large population of women has\n      faced the brunt of the non-criminalization of the practice.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                            Page 6 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">      R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      3. Marital rape refers to unwanted intercourse by a man\n      with his wife obtained by force, threat of force, or\n      physical violence, or when she is unable to give consent.\n      It is a non-consensual act of violent perversion by a\n      husband against the wife where she is abused physically\n      and sexually.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      4. The following three kinds of marital rape, generally\n      prevalent in the society;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">              * Battering rape: In this type of marital rape,\n              women experience both physical and sexual\n              violence in the relationship and in many ways.\n              Some instances are those where the wife is\n              battered during the sexual violence, or the rape\n              may follow a physical violent episode where the\n              husband wants to make up and coerces his wife to\n              have sex against her will. In most cases, the victims\n              fall under this stated category.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">              * Force only rape: In this type of marital rape,\n              husbands use only that amount of force, as it is\n              necessary to coerce their wives. In such cases,\n              battering may not be a characteristic and women\n              who refuse sexual intercourse usually face such\n              assaults.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">              * Obsessive rape: In obsessive rape, assaults\n              involve brutal torture and/or perverse sexual acts\n              and are most commonly violent in form. This type\n              has also been labeled as sadistic rape.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      5. Mr. Gadhvi, the learned counsel appearing for the\n      applicant and Mr. Devnani, the learned APP appearing for\n      the State are requested to assist the Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      6.

The\n      respondent No.2 be served directly through the\n      Investigating Officer of the concerned police station.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      Let the matter appear on top of th board.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.

Mr. Gadhvi would submit that it is not in dispute that\nNimeshbhai-original accused No.1 and the first informant are\nlawfully wedded husband and wife. In such circumstances, the\nwife cannot file a first information report for the offence of rape\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_11\">section 376</a> of the IPC or even for an\nunnatural offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_12\">section 377</a> of the IPC. The\nlearned counsel would submit that in India, marital rape is not\nrecognized and the same is not an offence.               However, Mr.\nGadhvi very fairly submitted that at the most a prima facie\ncase of cruelty within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_13\">section 498A</a> of the IPC\ncould be said to have been made out.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">8.2     Mr. Gadhvi submitted that in a dispute essentially\nbetween the husband and wife, the parents of the husband\nhave also been dragged in the prosecution. According to the\nlearned counsel,            even otherwise, the allegations levelled by\nthe first informant are far fetched and unpalatable.             In such\ncircumstances, referred to above, the learned counsel prays\nthat there being merit in both the applications filed by the\naccused-applicants, those be allowed and the first information\nreport be quashed so far as the offence punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_14\">sections 376</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_15\">377</a> of the IPC is concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">9.

Mr. Amin submitted that\nno case worth the name for quashing of the first information\nreport is made out at this stage. The plain reading of the first\ninformation report do disclose commission of very serious\ncognizable offence and the police should be permitted to carry\nout the investigation in accordance with law. According to the\nlearned Public Prosecutor, no interference is warranted at the\nend of this Court at this stage.             In such circumstances,        the\nlearned Public Prosecutor prays that there being no merit in\nthe two applications filed by the accused persons, those be\nrejected.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">10.    Submissions on behalf of the victim\n\n\n10.1 Mr. Shah, the learned counsel appearing for the first\ninformant has also vehemently opposed the two applications\nfiled by the accused-applicants.              He would submit that more\nthan a prima facie case is made out having regard to the\nserious nature of the allegations, and in such circumstances,\nthe police should be permitted to complete the investigation in\naccordance with law. According to Mr. Shah, the conduct of\nthe husband could be termed as most disgraceful                            and\ncondemnable. Mr. Shah would submit that the case is one of\nmarital rape. According to him, marital rape means &quot;unwanted\nintercourse by a man with his wife obtained by force, threat\nof force, or physical violence or when she is unable to give\nconsent&quot;.

He\nwas convicted by the trial court on charges of unlawfully\nconflicting grievous bodily harm and of assault but the\nconviction was quashed by a court of thirteen Judges with four\ndissents. Hale&#x27;s proposition was accepted as sound by majority\nJudges. Field and Charles, JJ., however, observed that there\nmight be cases in which a wife might lawfully refuse sexual\nintercourse to her husband.

If he\n       does so, he may make himself liable to the criminal law,\n       not for the offence of rape. but for whatever other\n       offence the facts of the particular case warrant. If he\n       should wound her, he might be charged with wounding or\n       causing actual bodily harm, or he may be liable to be\n       convicted of common assault. The result is that in the\n       present case I am satisfied that the second count is a\n       valid one and must be left to the jury for their decision,\n       Ibid at p. 533 (AER): 291 (QB)&quot; (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1353689\" id=\"span_30\">24.

One of the origins of\nthe concept of a marital exemption from rape laws (a rule that\na husband cannot be charged with the rape of his wife) is the\nidea that by marriage a woman gives irrevocable consent for\nher husband to have sex with her any time he demands it. The\nissue with regard to marital rape shall be discussed by me a\nlittle later and, more particularly,                 when the same has been\nraised by the learned counsel appearing for the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">27.    Let me now deal with <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_34\">section 377</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">28.    The term &#x27;unnatural offence&#x27; comes under Chapter XVI of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_35\">Indian Penal Code</a> which deals with the offences affecting\nhuman body and finds its place as the last offence of the said\nchapter. The title of the offence uses the words &#x27;unnatural\noffences&#x27;. The word &#x27;unnatural&#x27; &#x27;means contrary to nature;\nabnormal;         not      spontaneous.      The       word    &#x27;carnal&#x27;    implies\nsomething relating to the physical, especially sexual needs,\nand activities. When construed in this way an unnatural\noffence means sexual activities contrary to the nature. The\nIndian Penal-Code 1860 defines it as &#x27;carnal intercourse\nagainst the order of nature with any man, woman or animal.&#x27;\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code 1860 makes it an offence\nby declaring that &quot;whoever has carnal Intercourse against the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                    Page 16 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\norder of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be\npunished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years,\nand shall also be liable to fine.&quot; The .section further makes it\nclear that penetration would .be sufficient to constitute the\ncarnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in the\nsection.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">29.    The definition uses the Word &#x27;against the order of nature&#x27;\nwithout any elaboration, and· leaves It for the courts to\ninterpret.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">30.    Unnatural offence      indicates sexual perversion which\ntakes shape in manifold forms going by different names such\nas sodomy, buggery, bestiality, tribadism, sadism, masochism.\nThe term unnatural offence implies sexual perversity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">31.    History of the legislation\n\n\n       The <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_37\">Indian Penal Code</a> was drafted by Lord Macaulay and\nwas introduced in 1861 during the British time. Thus, it has\nbeen largely influenced by the British laws. What was\nconsidered crime in Britain at that time was also been made a\ncrime under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a> to a large extent. &quot;Acts of sodomy were\npenalized by hanging under the Buggery Act of 1533 which\nwas re-enacted in 1563 by Queen Elizabeth I, after which it\nbecame the charter for the subsequent criminalisation of\nsodomy in the British colonies&quot;. Thus, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 377</a> of Indian\nPenal Code derives its origin from the Buggery Act of 1533. It\nis important to note here that this law has not been amended\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                              Page 17 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nby the Parliament ever since its enactment. This law is based\non the Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards which\nconceive of sex on purely functional terms, that is, for\nprocreation and on this basis homosexuality is considered as\nunnatural and against the order of nature.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">       For the purpose of implementation of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 377</a> it\nbecomes important to determine what is natural and what is\nunnatural. Also, it becomes necessary to determine whether\nhomosexuality is against the order of nature or not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">32.    Natural v. unnatural\n\n       The Black&#x27;s law dictionary define natural as (1) &quot;A\nfundamental quality that distinguishes one thing from another;\nthe essence of something. (2) Something pure or true as\ndistinguished from something artificial or contrived. (3) The\nbasic instincts or impulses of someone or something&quot;. To\ndetermine what is natural, functional basis is cited which\nbasically means that every instrument or organ of the body\nhas a particular function to perform, and therefore, using such\nan organ for a purpose inconsistent with its principal function\nis unnatural. As per this logic, every form of sex other than\npenile vaginal will be considered as unnatural. The same logic\nis used to denounce anything other than procreative sex as\nunnatural. This logic though prima facie illogical has been\nendorsed by the courts in various cases. In Khanu v Emperor,\nAIR 1925 Sind 286 it was held that &quot;the natural object of carnal\nintercourse is that there should be the possibility of conception\nof human beings, which in the case of coitus per os is\nimpossible&quot;. The courts in India have interpreted the term\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                              Page 18 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n&quot;carnal intercourse against the order of nature&quot; so broadly that\nit now includes from oral and anal sex to penetration into the\nartificial orifices such as folded palms or between thighs. Such\na wide application of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_41\">section 377</a> where the language itself is\nnot very clear has led to arbitrary application of the law and\nthus questions were raised regarding the constitutional validity\nof this section. Apart from this, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_42\">section 377</a> clearly makes\nhomosexuality illegal on the ground that it is against the order\nof nature. This has also led to various controversies in view of\nthe recognition of right to freedom as a fundamental human\nright., It is considered world over that the criminalization of\nhomosexual acts is a clear violation of right to privacy. In view\nof the arbitrariness of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_43\">section 377</a> and the violation of basic\nfundamental rights the constitutional validity of this section\nwas challenged in the court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"100472805\" id=\"span_39\">33.

In this\ncase it was argued that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_46\">section 377</a> on account of coverning\nconsensual sexual intercourse between the two adults in\nprivate, is violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed in\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_47\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_48\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_49\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">21</a> of the Constitution. It was also\ncontended that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> can be curtailed only in case of\ncompelling state interest which is missing in this case. The\npetitioner also contended that the legislative intent behind\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_52\">section 377</a> is based on stereotypes that are outmoded and\nhave no historical or logical backing. They also argued that the\nexpression &quot;sex&quot; as used in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 15</a> also includes &quot;sexual\norientation&quot; and thus according to <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 15</a> there can be no\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                            Page 19 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Broadly it was\nprayed before the high court that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_55\">section 377</a> of IPC should be\ndeclared ultra vires to the constitution, insofar it criminalizes\nconsensual sexual acts of adults.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">       The two wings of Union of India filed completely counter\naffidavit in this case. The Ministry of Home Affairs sought to\njustify the retention of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_56\">section 377</a> on the grounds of public\nhealth, public disapproval, and social disgust of the act. On the\nother hand, The Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare supported\nthe claim of the petitioners stating that the presence of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_57\">section\n377</a> in the statute book had hampered the HIV/AIDS prevention\nefforts and that its deletion would help in treating the\nhomosexuals suffering from HIV/AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">       The Delhi High Court rejected the contention of Ministry\nof Home Affairs on the ground that popular morality or public\ndisapproval cannot be a valid ground for restricting the right\nunder <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_58\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">21.</a> The court stated that if there is any\ntype of morality that can pass the test of compelling state\ninterest, it must be constitutional morality and not public\nmorality. India is a land of unity in diversity and our\nconstitution drafters recognised this idea and incorporated it in\nour    constitution        in   the    form       of   various   articles   which\nrecognises, protects and celebrates diversity. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 377</a> of\nIPC by criminalising the homosexuals only on account of their\nsexual orientation violates the constitutional morality. In the\nend, the court accepted all the contentions of the petitioners\nand declared the part of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_61\">section 377</a> ultra vires which\ncriminalised consensual sexual acts of adults in private.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                      Page 20 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                      CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">However, the court also ruled that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_62\">section\n377</a> would still continue to govern the non-consensual penile\nnon-vaginal sex involving the minors.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_44\">This judgment and order of the Delhi High Court was\nchallenged before the Supreme Court in the case of Suresh\nKumar koushal and <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_63\">another v Naz Foundation &amp; others</a>, AIR\n2014 SC 563 by groups of religious bodies and individuals\nincluding the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the\nApostolic Churches Alliance and the Utkal Christian Council.\nThey contended that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_64\">section 377</a> was enacted by the\nlegislature to protect the social values and morals. The\nSupreme Court accepted such contention and set aside the\norder of the High court. The Supreme Court took the view that\nevery legislation enacted by the Parliament or State legislature\ncarried with it a presumption of constitutionality. This principal\nalso applies to the pre-constitutional laws. If no amendment is\nmade to a particular law it may suggest that the legislature\ndeems it fit and leave the law as it is. Post-independence\nalmost 30 amendments in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_65\">IPC</a> have been made in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_66\">IPC</a>\nincluding the amendments in the chapter of sexual offences\nunder    which      the   unnatural     offences    fall.   However,       the\nLegislature has chosen not to amend the law or revisit it. This\nshows    that      the    Parliament,     which    is   indisputably       the\nrepresentative body of the people of India, has not thought it\nfit or proper to delete the provision. The Supreme Court\nultimately declared <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_67\">section 377</a> to be constitutionally valid.\nHowever, the court left it open for the Legislature to delete or\namend the law.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                Page 21 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">       The      Naz        foundation      has   filed   a    curative    petition\nchallenging this judgement of the Supreme Court.

Shri Divan referred to the incidents, which took\n place at Lucknow (2002 and 2006), Bangalore (2004 and\n 2006), Delhi (2006), Chennai (2006), Goa (2007), and\n Aligarh (2011) to bring home the point that LGBT persons\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                       Page 25 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n have been targeted by the police with impunity and the\n judiciary at the grass route level has been extremely slow\n to recognize harassment suffered by the victims.

He relied\n upon the statement made by the Attorney General on\n 22.3.2012 that the Government of India does not find any\n legal error in the order of the High Court and accepts the\n same. Shri Divan further argued that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 377</a> IPC\n targets LGBT persons as a class and is, therefore,\n violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_107\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_108\">15</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\"> 19.

He referred to\n medical literature to show that sexuality is a human\n condition and argued that it should not be regarded as a\n depravity or a sin or a crime. Learned senior counsel\n submitted that in view of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 377</a> IPC which\n stigmatized homosexuality, not only homosexuals but\n their families face stigma and discrimination. He referred\n to the recommendations made by 172nd Law\n Commission Report for deleting <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 377</a> IPC, the\n survey conducted by Outlook Magazine giving the\n statistics of the persons who indulged in different sexual\n practices, the support extended by the eminent persons\n including Swami Agnivesh, Soli J.

Learned senior counsel further argued that\n <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 377</a> IPC, which applies to same sex relations\n between consenting adults violates the constitutional\n guarantee of equality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_165\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_166\">15</a> and the\n High Court rightly applied Yogyakarta principles for de-\n criminalisation of the section challenged in the writ\n petition filed by respondent No.1. He supported the High\n Court&#x27;s decision to invoke the principle of severability.\n Shri Ram Jethmalani, Senior Advocate, who did not argue\n the case, but filed written submissions also supported the\n impugned order and argued that the High Court did not\n commit any error by declaring <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 377</a> IPC as\n violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_168\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_169\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_170\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\"> 21.

Learned Additional\n Solicitor General submitted that the legislature, which\n represents the will of the people has decided not to\n delete and it is not for the Court to import the extra-\n ordinary moral values and thrust the same upon the\n society. He emphasized that even after 60 years of\n independence, Parliament has not thought it proper to\n delete or amend <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 377</a> IPC and there is no warrant\n for the High Court to have declared the provision as ultra\n vires Articles 14,15 and 21 of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\"> 23.

However, keeping in mind the importance of\n separation of powers and out of a sense of deference to\n the value of democracy that parliamentary acts embody,\n self restraint has been exercised by the judiciary when\n dealing with challenges to the constitutionality of laws.\n This form of restraint has manifested itself in the\n principle of presumption of constitutionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_110\">27.

Every legislation enacted by Parliament or State\n Legislature    carries    with   it  a   presumption    of\n constitutionality. This is founded on the premise that the\n legislature, being a representative body of the people\n and accountable to them is aware of their needs and acts\n in their best interest within the confines of the\n Constitution. There is nothing to suggest that this\n principle would not apply to pre-Constitutional laws which\n have been adopted by the Parliament and used with or\n without amendment. If no amendment is made to a\n particular law it may represent a decision that the\n Legislature has taken to leave the law as it is and this\n decision is no different from a decision to amend and\n change the law or enact a new law. In light of this, both\n pre and post Constitutional laws are manifestations of the\n will of the people of India through the Parliament and are\n presumed to be constitutional.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\"> 29. The doctrine of severability and the practice of\n reading down a statute both arise out of the principle of\n presumption of constitutionality and are specifically\n recognized in <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 13</a> which renders the law, which is\n pre-Constitutional to be void only to the extent of\n inconsistency    with   the   Constitution.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99090701\" id=\"span_120\">In   <a href=\"/doc/99090701/\" id=\"a_208\">R.M.D.\n Chamarbaugwalla v.

It is the true nature of the subject-matter of\nthe legislation that is the determining factor, and\nwhile a classification made in the statute might go far\nto support a conclusion in favour of severability, the\nabsence of it does not necessarily preclude it.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                       Page 45 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">When a statute is in part void, it will be enforced as\nregards the rest, if that is severable from what is\ninvalid. It is immaterial for the purpose of this rule\nwhether the invalidity of the statute arises by reason\nof its subject-matter being outside the competence of\nthe legislature or by reason of its provisions\ncontravening constitutional prohibitions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99090701\" id=\"span_123\">26. That being the position in law, it is now necessary\nto consider whether the impugned provisions are\nseverable in their application to competitions of a\ngambling character, assuming of course that the\ndefinition of &#x27;prize competition&#x27; in<a href=\"/doc/994266/\" id=\"a_209\"> s. 2(d)</a> is wide\nenough to include also competitions involving skill to\na substantial degree. It will be useful for the\ndetermination of this question to refer to certain rules\nof construction <a href=\"/doc/99090701/\" id=\"a_210\">laid down by</a> the American Courts,\nwhere the question of severability has been the\nsubject of consideration in numerous authorities. They\nmay be summarised as follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">1. In determining whether the valid parts of a statute\nare separable from the invalid parts thereof, it is the\nintention of the legislature that is the determining\nfactor. The test to be applied is whether the\nlegislature would have enacted the valid part if it had\nknown that the rest of the statute was invalid. Vide\nCorpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 82, p. 156; Sutherland on\nStatutory Construction, Vol. 2, pp. 176-177.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">2. If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably\nmixed up that they cannot be separated from one\nanother, then the invalidity of a portion must result in\nthe invalidity of the Act in its entirety. On the other\nhand, if they are so distinct and separate that after\nstriking out what is invalid, what remains is in itself a\ncomplete code independent of the rest, then it will be\nupheld notwithstanding that the rest has become\nunenforceable.       Vide     Cooley&#x27;s      Constitutional\nLimitations, Vol. 1 at pp. 360-361; Crawford on\nStatutory Construction, pp. 217-218.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">3. Even when the provisions which are valid are\ndistinct and separate from those which are invalid, if\nthey all form part of a single scheme which is\nintended to be operative as a whole, then also the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                        Page 46 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\ninvalidity of a part will result in the failure of the\nwhole. Vide Crawford on Statutory Construction, pp.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">218-219.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">4. Likewise, when the valid and invalid parts of a\nstatute are independent and do not form part of a\nscheme but what is left after omitting the invalid\nportion is so thin and truncated as to be in substance\ndifferent from what it was when it emerged out of the\nlegislature, then also it will be rejected in its entirety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">5. The separability of the valid and invalid provisions\nof a statute does not depend on whether the law is\nenacted in the same section or different sections;\n(Vide Cooley&#x27;s Constitutional Limitations, Vol. 1, pp.\n361-362); it is not the form, but the substance of the\nmatter that is material, and that has to be ascertained\non an examination of the Act as a whole and of the\nsetting of the relevant provisions therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">6. If after the invalid portion is expunged from the\nstatute what remains cannot be enforced without\nmaking alterations and modifications therein, then the\nwhole of it must be struck down as void, as otherwise\nit will amount to judicial legislation. Vide Sutherland\non Statutory Construction, Vol. 2, p. 194.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">7. In determining the legislative intent on the question\nof separability, it will be legitimate to take into\naccount the history of the legislation, its object, the\ntitle and the preamble to it. Vide Sutherland on\nStatutory Construction, Vol. 2, pp. 177-178.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\"> 30. Another significant canon of determination of\n constitutionality is that the Courts would be reluctant to\n declare a law invalid or ultra vires on account of\n unconstitutionality. The Courts would accept an\n interpretation,    which    would    be   in    favour    of\n constitutionality rather than the one which would render\n the    law     unconstitutional.   Declaring     the    law\n unconstitutional is one of the last resorts taken by the\n Courts. The Courts would preferably put into service the\n principle of &#x27;reading down&#x27; or &#x27;reading into&#x27; the provision\n to make it effective, workable and ensure the attainment\n of the object of the Act. These are the principles which\n clearly emerge from the consistent view taken by this\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                        Page 47 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n Court in its various pronouncements including the recent\n judgment in Namit Sharma v.

Some of the observations\n made in that judgment are extracted below:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">&quot;66. If from the impugned memoranda the event of\nbeing in service and retiring subsequent to specified\ndate is severed, all pensioners would be governed by\nthe liberalised pension scheme. The pension will have\nto be recomputed in accordance with the provisions of\nthe liberalised pension scheme as salaries were\nrequired to be recomputed in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the Third Pay Commission but\nbecoming operative from the specified date. It does\ntherefore appear that the reading down of impugned\nmemoranda by severing the objectionable portion\nwould not render the liberalised pension scheme\nvague, unenforceable or unworkable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">67. In reading down the memoranda, is this Court\nlegislating? Of course &#x27;not&#x27; When we delete basis of\nclassification as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 14</a>, we merely set\nat naught the unconstitutional portion retaining the\nconstitutional portion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">68. We may now deal with the last submission of the\nlearned Attorney General on the point. Said the\nlearned Attorney-General that principle of severability\ncannot be applied to augment the class and to adopt\nhis words &#x27;severance always cuts down the scope,\nnever enlarges it&#x27;. We are not sure whether there is\nany principle which inhibits the Court from striking\ndown an unconstitutional part of a legislative action\nwhich may have the tendency to enlarge the width\nand coverage of the measure. Whenever classification\nis held to be impermissible and the measure can be\nretained by removing the unconstitutional portion of\nclassification, by striking down words of limitation, the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                       Page 48 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                               CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nresultant effect may be of enlarging the class. In such\na situation, the Court can strike down the words of\nlimitation in an enactment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"758129\" id=\"span_131\">That is what is called reading down the measure. We\n know of no principle that &#x27;severance&#x27; limits the scope of\n legislation and can never enlarge it.&quot; The basis of the\n practice of reading down was succinctly <a href=\"/doc/148308793/\" id=\"a_214\">laid down in</a>\n <a href=\"/doc/758129/\" id=\"a_215\">Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Indore and\n Ors. v.

For sustaining the presumption of\nconstitutionality the Court may take into consideration\nmatters of common knowledge, matters of common\nreport, the history of the times and may assume\nevery state of facts which can be conceived it must\nalways be presumed that the Legislature understands\nand correctly appreciates the need of its own people\nand that discrimination, if any, is based on adequate\ngrounds. It is well settled that courts will be justified in\ngiving a liberal interpretation to the section in order to\navoid constitutional invalidity. These principles have\ngiven rise to rule of reading down the section if it\nbecomes necessary to uphold the validity of the\nsections.&quot; <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1215719\" id=\"span_132\">In <a href=\"/doc/1215719/\" id=\"a_216\">Minerva Mills Ltd. and Ors. v.

From the above noted judgments, the following\n principles can be culled out:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\"> (i) The High Court and Supreme Court of India are\n empowered to declare as void any law, whether enacted\n prior to the enactment of the Constitution or after. Such\n power can be exercised to the extent of inconsistency\n with the Constitution/contravention of Part III.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\"> (ii) There is a presumption of constitutionality in favour of\n all laws, including pre-Constitutional laws as the\n Parliament, in its capacity as the representative of the\n people, is deemed to act for the benefit of the people in\n light of their needs and the constraints of the\n Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\"> iii) The doctrine of severability seeks to ensure that only\n that portion of the law which is unconstitutional is so\n declared and the remainder is saved. This doctrine\n should be applied keeping in mind the scheme and\n purpose of the law and the intention of the Legislature\n and should be avoided where the two portions are\n inextricably mixed with one another.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\"> iv) The court can resort to reading down a law in order to\n save it from being rendered unconstitutional. But while\n doing so, it cannot change the essence of the law and\n create a new law which in its opinion is more desirable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\"> 32. Applying the afore-stated principles to the case in\n hand, we deem it proper to observe that while the High\n Court and this Court are empowered to review the\n constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 377</a> IPC and strike it down to\n the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution, self\n restraint must be exercised and the analysis must be\n guided by the presumption of constitutionality. After the\n adoption of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_223\">IPC</a> in 1950, around 30 amendments\n have been made to the statute, the most recent being in\n 2013 which specifically deals with sexual offences, a\n category to which <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 377</a> IPC belongs. The 172nd\n Law Commission Report specifically recommended\n deletion of that section and the issue has repeatedly\n come up for debate. However, the Legislature has chosen\n not to amend the law or revisit it. This shows that\n Parliament, which is undisputedly the representative\n body of the people of India has not thought it proper to\n delete the provision. Such a conclusion is further\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                        Page 51 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n strengthened by the fact that despite the decision of the\n Union of India to not challenge in appeal the order of the\n Delhi High Court, the Parliament has not made any\n amendment in the law. While this does not make the law\n immune     from    constitutional challenge,     it must\n nonetheless guide our understanding of character, scope,\n ambit and import.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\"> 33. It is, therefore, apposite to say that unless a clear\n constitutional violation is proved, this Court is not\n empowered to strike down a law merely by virtue of its\n falling into disuse or the perception of the society having\n changed as regards the legitimacy of its purpose and its\n need.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\"> 34.

The\n boy began to get a lot of pain and consequently, accused\n 2 could not succeed having that act. He therefore\n voluntarily did the act in question by putting his male\n organ in the mouth of the boy and there was also seminal\n discharge and the boy had to vomit it out.

It could, therefore, be said that the act in\n question amounted to an offence punishable under\n Section 377. What was sought to be conveyed by the\n explanation was that even mere penetration would be\n sufficient to constitute carnal intercourse, necessary to\n the offence referred to in Section 377. Seminal discharge,\n i.e., the full act of intercourse was not the essential\n ingredient to constitute an offence in question.\n It is true that the theory that the sexual intercourse is\n only meant for the purpose of conception is an out-dated\n theory. But, at the same time it could be said without any\n hesitation of contradiction that the orifice of mouth is not,\n according to nature, meant for sexual or carnal\n intercourse. Viewing from that aspect, it could be said\n that this act of putting a male-organ in the mouth of a\n victim for the purposes of satisfying sexual appetite\n would be an act of carnal intercourse against the order of\n nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"910305\" id=\"span_161\">In <a href=\"/doc/910305/\" id=\"a_243\">State of Kerala v.

The word &#x27;penetrate&#x27;\nmeans in the concise Oxford Dictionary &#x27;find access\ninto or through, pass through.&#x27; When the male organ\nis inserted between the thighs kept together and\ntight, is there no penetration? The word &#x27;insert&#x27; means\nplace, fit, thrust.&#x27; Therefore, if the male organ is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                       Page 61 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n&#x27;inserted&#x27; or &#x27;thrust&#x27; between the thighs, there is\n&#x27;penetration&#x27; to constitute unnatural offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">21. Unnatural offence is defined in Section 377 of the\nPenal Code; whoever voluntarily has carnal\nintercourse against the order of nature with any man,\nwoman or animal commits unnatural offence. The act\nof committing intercourse between the thighs is\ncarnal intercourse against the order of nature.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">Therefore committing intercourse by inserting the\nmale organ between the thighs of another is an\nunnatural offence. In this connection, it may be noted\nthat the act in Section 376 is &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and\nthe act in Section 377 is carnal intercourse against\nthe order of nature.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">22. The position in English law on this question has\nbeen brought to my notice. The old decision of Rex v.\nSamuel Jacobs (1817) Russ &amp; Ry 381 CCE lays down\nthat penetration through the mouth does not amount\nto the offence of sodomy under English law. The\ncounsel therefore argues that sexual intercourse\nbetween the thighs cannot also be an offence under\nSection 377 of the Penal Code. In Sirkar v. Gula\nMythien Pillai Chaithu Maho. mathu 1908 TLR Vol XIV\nAppendix 43 a Full Bench of the Travancore High\nCourt held that having connection with a person in the\nmouth was an offence under Section 377 of the Penal\nCode. In a short judgment, the learned Judges held\nthat it was unnecessary to refer to English Statute\nLaw and English text books which proceeded upon an\ninterpretation of the words sodomy, buggery and\nbestiality; and that the words used in the Penal Code\nwere very aim pie and died enough to include all acts\nagainst the order of nature. My view on the question\nis also that the words of Section 377 are simple and\nwide enough to include any carnal intercourse again\ntithe order of nature within its ambit. Committing\nintercourse between the thighs of another is carnal\nintercourse against the order of nature.&quot; <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1880919\" id=\"span_166\">In <a href=\"/doc/1880919/\" id=\"a_244\">Fazal Rab\nChoudhary v.

In Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 81, op. 368-\n370, the following comments have been made.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">&quot;Words used in statutory definitions of the crime of\nSodomy have been frequently construed as more\ncomprehensive and as not depending on, or limited by\nthe common law definition of the crime, at least as\nnot dependent on the narrower definition of sodomy\nafforded by some of the common law authorities and\nare generally interpreted to include within their\nprovisions all acts of unnatural copulation, whether\nwith mankind or beast. Other authorities, however,\nhave taken a contrary view, holding that the words\nused in the statute are limited by the common law\ndefinition of the crime where the words of the statute\nthemselves are not explicit as to what shall be\nincluded.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">It is competent for the legislature to declare that the\ndoing of certain acts shall constitute the crime against\nnature even-though they would not have constituted\nthat crime at common law, and the statutory crime\nagainst nature is not necessarily limited to the\ncommon law crime of sodomy, but in imposing a\npunishment for the common law crime it is not\nnecessary for the legislature to specify in the statute\nthe particular acts which shall constitute the crime.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">                       Page 64 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">Under statutes providing that whoever has carnal\ncopulation with a beast, or in any opening of the body,\nexcept sexual parts, with another being, shall be\nguilty of sodomy, it has been held that the act of\ncunnilingus is not a crime, but that taking the male\nsex organ into the mouth is sodomy. On the other\nhand, under such a statute it has been held that the\ncrime of sodomy cannot be committed unless the\nsexual organ of accused is involved, but there is also\nauthority to the contrary. Under a statute defining\nsodomy as the carnal knowledge and connection\nagainst the order of nature by man with man, or in the\nsame unnatural manner with woman, it has been held\nthat the crime cannot be committed by woman with\nwoman.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">A statute providing that any person who shall commit\nany act or practice of sexual perversity, either with\nmankind or beast on conviction shall be punished, is\nnot limited to instances involving carnal copulation,\nbut is restricted to cases involving the sex organ of at\nleast one of the parties. The term &#x27;sexual perversity&#x27;\ndoes not refer to every physical contact by a male\nwith the body of the female with intent to cause\nsexual satisfaction to the actor, but the condemnation\nof the statute is limited to unnatural conduct\nperformed for the purpose of accomplish; abnormal\nsexual satisfaction for the actor. Under a statute\nproviding that any person participating in the act or\ncopulating the mouth of one person with the sexual\norgan of another is guilty of the offence a person is\nguilty of violating the statute when he has placed his\nmouth on the genital organ of another, and the\noffence may be committed by two persons of opposite\nsex.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">11. Though there is no statutory definition of\n&#x27;sodomy&#x27;, Section 377 is comprehensive to engulf any\nact like the alleged act. View similar to mine was\nexpressed in Lohana Vasantlal Devchand and Ors. v.\nThe State : AIR 1963 Guj 252 and in Khanu&#x27;s case\n(supra). The orifice of the mouth is not, according to\nnature, meant for sexual or carnal intercourse.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">&#x27;Intercourse&#x27; may be defined as mutual frequent\naction by members of independent organisation.\nCommercial intercourse is therefore referred to;\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                       Page 65 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">emphasis is made on the reciprocity. By metaphor the\nword &#x27;intercourse&#x27; like the word &#x27;commerce&#x27; is applied\nto the relations of the sexes. Here also there is the\ntemporary visitation of one organism by a member of\nthe other organisation, for certain clearly defined and\nlimited objects. The primary object of the visiting\norganisation is to obtain euphoria by means of a\ndetent of the nerves consequent on the sexual crisis.\nBut there is no intercourse unless the visiting member\nis enveloped at least partially by the visited organism,\nfor intercourse connotes reciprocity, and in this view it\nwould seem that sin of Gomorrah is no less carnal\nintercourse than the sin of sodomy. These aspects\nhave been illuminatingly highlighted in Khanu&#x27;s case\n(supra).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">12. In Stroud&#x27;s Judicial Dictionary, the word &#x27;buggery&#x27;\nis said to be synonymous with sodomy. In K. J. Ayer&#x27;s\nManual of Law Terms and Phrases (as Judicially\nExpounded), the meaning of the word &#x27;sodomy&#x27; is\nstated to be a carnal knowledge committed against\nthe order of Nature by a man with a man or in the\nsame unnatural manner with a woman, or by a man or\nwoman in any manner with a beast. This is called\nbuggery.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">As observed in Lohan Vasantlal Devchand&#x27;s case\n(supra), sodomy will be a species and unnatural\noffence will be a generis. In that view of the matter,\nthere can be no scope for any doubt that the act\ncomplained of in punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_252\">Sec. 377</a>, IPC.&quot;\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1843411\" id=\"span_177\">Similar views were expressed in State v.

However, from these cases no uniform test\ncan be culled out to classify acts as &quot;carnal\nintercourse against the order of nature&quot;. In our\nopinion the acts which fall within the ambit of the\nsection can only be determined with reference to the\nact itself and the circumstances in which it is\nexecuted. All the aforementioned cases refer to non\nconsensual and markedly coercive situations and the\nkeenness of the court in bringing justice to the victims\nwho were either women or children cannot be\ndiscounted while analyzing the manner in which the\nsection has been interpreted. We are apprehensive of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                       Page 66 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nwhether the Court would rule similarly in a case of\nproved consensual intercourse between adults. Hence\nit is difficult to prepare a list of acts which would be\ncovered by the section. Nonetheless in light of the\nplain meaning and legislative history of the section,\nwe hold that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 377</a> IPC would apply irrespective\nof age and consent. It is relevant to mention here that\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_255\">Section 377</a> IPC does not criminalize a particular\npeople or identity or orientation. It merely identifies\ncertain acts which if committed would constitute an\noffence. Such a prohibition regulates sexual conduct\nregardless of gender identity and orientation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\"> 39.

The question whether a particular classification is\n unconstitutional was considered in Re: Special Courts Bill,\n 1978 (1979) 1 SCC 380. Speaking for majority of the\n Constitution Bench, Chandrachud, CJ, referred to large\n number of precedents relating to the scope of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_264\">Article 14</a>\n and concluded several propositions including the\n following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">&quot;1. The first part of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_265\">Article 14</a>, which was adopted\nfrom the Irish Constitution, is a declaration of equality\nof the civil rights of all persons within the territories of\nIndia. It enshrines a basic principle of republicanism.\nThe second part, which is a corollary of the first and is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                         Page 68 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                               CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nbased on the last clause of the first section of the\nFourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution,\nenjoins that equal protection shall be secured to all\nsuch persons in the enjoyment of their rights and\nliberties without discrimination of favourtism. It is a\npledge of the protection of equal laws, that is, laws\nthat operate alike on all persons under like\ncircumstances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">2. The State, in the exercise of its governmental\npower, has of necessity to make laws operating\ndifferently on different groups or classes of persons\nwithin its territory to attain particular ends in giving\neffect to its policies, and it must possess for that\npurpose large powers of distinguishing and classifying\npersons or things to be subjected to such laws.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">3. The Constitutional command to the State to afford\nequal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable\nby the invention and application of a precise formula.\nTherefore, classification need not be constituted by an\nexact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or\nthings. The Courts should not insist on delusive\nexactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining\nthe validity of classification in any given case.\nClassification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">4. The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_266\">Article 14</a>\nis not that the same rules of law should be applicable\nto all persons within the Indian Territory or that the\nsame remedies should be made available to them\nirrespective of differences of circumstances. It only\nmeans that all persons similarly circumstanced shall\nbe treated alike both in privileges conferred and\nliabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be\napplied to all in the same situation, and there should\nbe no discrimination between one person and another\nif as regards the subject-matter of the legislation their\nposition is substantially the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">5. By the process of classification, the State has the\npower of determining who should be regarded as a\nclass for purposes of legislation and in relation to a\nlaw enacted on a particular subject. This power, no\ndoubt, in some degree is likely to produce some\ninequality; but if a law deals with the liberties of a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                         Page 69 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nnumber of well- defined classes, it is not open to the\ncharge of denial of equal protection on the ground\nthat it has no application to other persons.\nClassification thus means segregation in classes which\nhave a systematic relation, usually found in common\nproperties and characteristics. It postulates a rational\nbasis and does not mean herding together of certain\npersons and classes arbitrarily.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">6. The law can make and set apart the classes\naccording to the needs and exigencies of the society\nand as suggested by experience. It can recognise\neven degree of evil, but the classification should\nnever be arbitrary, artificial or evasive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">7. The classification must not be arbitrary but must be\nrational, that is to say, it must not only be based on\nsome qualities or characteristics which are to be\nfound in all the persons grouped together and not in\nothers who are left out but those qualities or\ncharacteristics must have a reasonable relation to the\nobject of the legislation. In order to pass the test, two\nconditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) that the\nclassification must be founded on an intelligible\ndifferentia which distinguishes those that are grouped\ntogether from others and (2) that differentia must\nhave a rational relation to the object sought to be\nachieved by the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">8. The differentia which is the basis of the\nclassification and the object of the Act are distinct\nthings and what is necessary is that there must be a\nnexus between them. In short, while <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_267\">Article 14</a> forbids\nclass discrimination by conferring privileges or\nimposing liabilities upon persons arbitrarily selected\nout of a large number of other persons similarly\nsituated in relation to the privileges sought to be\nconferred or the liabilities proposed to be imposed, it\ndoes not forbid classification for the purpose of\nlegislation, provided such classification is not arbitrary\nin the sense above mentioned.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">9. If the legislative policy is clear and definite and as\nan effective method of carrying out that policy a\ndiscretion is vested by the statute upon a body of\nadministrators or officers to make selective\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                        Page 70 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\napplication of the law to certain classes or groups of\npersons, the statute itself cannot be condemned as a\npiece of discriminatory legislation. In such cases, the\npower given to the executive body would import a\nduty on it to classify the subject-matter of legislation\nin accordance with the objective indicated in the\nstatute. If the administrative body proceeds to classify\npersons or things on a basis which has no rational\nrelation to the objective of the legislature, its action\ncan be annulled as offending against the equal\nprotection clause. On the other hand, if the statute\nitself does not disclose a definite policy or objective\nand it confers authority on another to make selection\nat its pleasure, the statute would be held on the face\nof it to be discriminatory, irrespective of the way in\nwhich it is applied.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">10.

The vagueness and arbitrariness go to the root of a\n provision and may render it unconstitutional, making its\n implementation a matter of unfettered discretion. This is\n especially so in case of penal statues. However while\n analyzing a provision the vagaries of language must be\n borne in mind and prior application of the law must be\n considered. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50294192\" id=\"span_192\">In <a href=\"/doc/50294192/\" id=\"a_280\">A.K.

The requirement that crimes must be defined\nwith appropriate definiteness is regarded as a\nfundamental concept in criminal law and must now be\nregarded as a pervading theme of our Constitution\nsince the decision in Maneka Gandhi [1978] 2 SCR\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                        Page 72 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n621 . The underlying principle is that every person is\nentitled to be informed as to what the State\ncommands or forbids and that the life and liberty of a\nperson cannot be put in peril on an ambiguity.\nHowever, even in the domain of criminal law, the\nprocesses of which can result in the taking away of\nlife itself, no more than a reasonable degree of\ncertainty has to be accepted as a fact. Neither the\ncriminal law nor the Constitution requires the\napplication of impossible standards and therefore,\nwhat is expected is that the language of the law must\ncontain an adequate warning of the conduct which\nmay fall within the prescribed area, when measured\nby common understanding. In criminal law, the\nlegislature frequently uses vague expressions like\n&#x27;bring into hatred or contempt&#x27;, &#x27;maintenance of\nharmony between different religious groups&#x27; or &#x27;likely\nto cause disharmony or hatred or ill-will&#x27;, or\n&#x27;annoyance to the public&#x27;, (see Sections 124A,\n153A(1)(b), 153B(1)(c), and 268 of the Penal Code).\nThese expressions, though they are difficult to define,\ndo not elude a just application to practical situations.\nThe use of language carries with it the inconvenience\nof the imperfections of language.&quot; In K.A. Abbas v.\nThe Union of India (UOI) and Anr. (1970) 2 SCC 780\nthe Court observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882909\" id=\"span_195\">&quot;46. These observations which are clearly obiter are\napt to be too generally applied and need to be\nexplained. While it is true that the principles evolved\nby the Supreme Court of the United States of America\nin the application of the Fourteenth Amendment were\neschewed in our Constitution and instead the limits of\nrestrictions on each fundamental right were indicated\nin the clauses that follow the first clause of the\nnineteenth Article, it cannot be said as an absolute\nprinciple that no law will be considered bad for sheer\nvagueness. There is ample authority for the\nproposition that a law affecting fundamental rights\nmay be so considered. A very pertinent example is to\nbe found in <a href=\"/doc/882909/\" id=\"a_281\">State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr. v.\nBaldeo Prasad</a> where the Central Provinces and Berar\nGoondas Act 1946 was declared void for uncertainty.\nThe condition for the application of <a href=\"/doc/1911574/\" id=\"a_282\">Sections 4</a> and 4A\nwas that the person sought to be proceeded against\nmust be a goonda but the definition of goonda in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                       Page 73 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nAct indicated no tests for deciding which person fell\nwithin the definition. The provisions were therefore\nheld to be uncertain and vague.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">47. The real rule is that if a law is vague or appears to\nbe so, the court must try to construe it, as far as may\nbe, and language permitting, the construction sought\nto be placed on it, must be in accordance with the\nintention of the legislature. Thus if the law is open to\ndiverse construction, that construction which accords\nbest with the intention of the legislature and advances\nthe purpose of legislation, is to be preferred. Where\nhowever the law admits of no such construction and\nthe persons applying it are in a boundless sea of\nuncertainty and the law prima facie takes away a\nguaranteed freedom, the law must be held to offend\nthe Constitution as was done in the case of the\n<a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_283\">Goonda Act</a>. This is not application of the doctrine of\ndue process. The invalidity arises from the probability\nof the misuse of the law to the detriment of the\nindividual. If possible, the Court instead of striking\ndown the law may itself draw the line of demarcation\nwhere possible but this effort should be sparingly\nmade and only in the clearest of cases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_166\"> 45. We may now deal with the issue of violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_284\">Article\n 21</a> of the Constitution.

A plain reading of the above-quoted provision\nmakes it clear that Indian law allows for abortion only\nif the specified conditions are met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_310\">When the MTP Act</a>\nwas first enacted in 1971 it was largely modelled on\nthe Abortion Act of 1967 which had been passed in\nthe United Kingdom. The legislative intent was to\nprovide a qualified &#x27;right to abortion&#x27; and the\ntermination of pregnancy has never been recognised\nas a normal recourse for expecting mothers. There is\nno doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive\nchoices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as\nunderstood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_311\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia. It is important to recognise that reproductive\nchoices can be exercised to procreate as well as to\nabstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is\nthat a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily\nintegrity should be respected. This means that there\nshould be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\nreproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to\nrefuse participation in sexual activity or alternatively\nthe insistence on use of contraceptive methods.\nFurthermore, women are also free to choose birth-\ncontrol methods such as undergoing sterilisation\nprocedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\nreproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to\ncarry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\nsubsequently raise children. However, in the case of\npregnant women there is also a &#x27;compelling state\ninterest&#x27; in protecting the life of the prospective child.\nTherefore, the termination of a pregnancy is only\npermitted when the conditions specified in the\napplicable statute have been fulfilled.

Right of Privacy may, apart from contract, also\narise out of a particular specific relationship which\nmay be commercial, matrimonial, or even political. As\nalready discussed above, Doctor-patient relationship,\nthough basically commercial, is, professionally, a\nmatter of confidence and, therefore. Doctors are\nmorally     and     ethically   bound      to    maintain\nconfidentiality. In such a situation, public disclosure of\neven true private facts may amount to an invasion of\nthe Right of Privacy which may sometimes lead to the\nclash of person&#x27;s &quot;right to be let alone&quot; with another\nperson&#x27;s right to be informed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">27. Disclosure of even true private facts has the\ntendency to disturb a person&#x27;s tranquility. It may\ngenerate many complexes in him and may even lead\nto psychological problems.

Of course, the\nmagnitude and content of the components of this\nright would depend upon the extent of the economic\ndevelopment of the country, but it must, in any view\nof the matter, include the right to the basic\nnecessities of life and also the right to carry on such\nfunctions and activities as constitute the bare\nminimum expression of the human-self.

In its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT\n persons and to declare that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_329\">Section 377</a> IPC violates the\n right to privacy, autonomy and dignity, the High Court\n has extensively relied upon the judgments of other\n jurisdictions. Though these judgments shed considerable\n light on various aspects of this right and are informative\n in relation to the plight of sexual minorities, we feel that\n they cannot be applied blindfolded for deciding the\n constitutionality of the law enacted by the Indian\n legislature. This view was expressed as early as in 1973\n in <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_330\">Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P.</a> (1973) 1 SCC 20. In\n that case, a Constitutional Bench considered the legality\n of the death sentence imposed by the Sessions Judge,\n Shahjahanpur, which was confirmed by the Allahabad\n High Court. One of the arguments raised by the counsel\n for the appellant was that capital punishment has been\n abolished in U.S. on the ground of violation of the 8th\n Amendment. While considering that argument, this Court\n observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">&quot;13. Reference was made by Mr Garg to several\nstudies made by Western scholars to show the\nineffectiveness of capital punishment either as a\ndetterent or as appropriate retribution. There is large\nvolume of evidence compiled in the West by kindly\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">                        Page 83 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nsocial reformers and research workers to confound\nthose who want to retain the capital punishment. The\ncontroversy is not yet ended and experiments are\nmade by suspending the death sentence where\npossible in order to see its effect. On the other hand\nmost of these studies suffer from one grave defect\nnamely that they consider all murders as stereotypes,\nthe result of sudden passion or the like, disregarding\nmotivation in each individual case. A large number of\nmurders is undoubtedly of the common type. But\nsome at least are diabolical in conception and cruel in\nexecution. In some others where the victim is a\nperson of high standing in the country society is liable\nto be rocked to its very foundation. Such murders\ncannot be simply wished away by finding alibis in the\nsocial maladjustment of the murderer. Prevalence of\nsuch crimes speaks, in the opinion of many, for the\ninevitability of death penalty not only by way of\ndeterrence but as a token of emphatic disapproval by\nthe society.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">14. We have grave doubts about the expediency of\ntransplanting Western experience in our country.\nSocial conditions are different and so also the general\nintellectual level. In the context of our Criminal Law\nwhich punishes murder, one cannot ignore the fact\nthat life imprisonment works out in most cases to a\ndozen years of imprisonment and it may be seriously\nquestioned whether that sole alternative will be an\nadequate substitute for the death penalty. We have\nnot been referred to any large-scale studies of crime\nstatistics compiled in this country with the object of\nestimating the need of protection of the society\nagainst murders. The only authoritative study is that\nof the Law Commission of India published in 1967. It is\nits Thirty-fifth Report. After collecting as much\navailable material as possible and assessing the views\nexpressed in the West both by abolitionists and the\nretentionists the Law Commission has come to its\nconclusion at paras 262 to 264. These paragraphs are\nsummarized by the Commission as follows at p. 354 of\nthe Report:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">&quot;The issue of abolition or retention has to be decided\non a balancing of the various arguments for and\nagainst retention.

In arriving at any\nconclusion on the subject, the need for protecting\nsociety in general and individual human beings must\nbe borne in mind. It is difficult to rule out the validity\nof, or the strength behind, many of the arguments for\nabolition. Nor does the Commission treat lightly the\nargument based on the irrevocability of the sentence\nof death, the need for a modern approach, the\nseverity of capital punishment, and the strong feeling\nshown by certain sections of public opinion in\nstressing deeper questions of human values. Having\nregard, however, to the conditions in India, to the\nvariety of the social upbringing of its inhabitants, to\nthe disparity in the level of morality and education in\nthe country, to the vastness of its area, to the\ndiversity of its population and to the paramount need\nfor maintaining law and order in the country at the\npresent juncture, India cannot risk the experiment of\nabolition of capital punishment. Arguments which\nwould be valid in respect of one area of the world may\nnot hold good in respect of another area, in this\ncontext. Similarly, even if abolition in some parts of\nIndia may not make a material difference, it may be\nfraught with serious consequences in other parts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">On a consideration of all the issues involved, the\nCommission is of the opinion, that capital punishment\nshould be retained in the present state of the\ncountry.&quot; The Court also referred to an earlier\njudgment in State of Madras v.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\"> V.G.

The responsibility\nof Judges in that respect is the greater, since the\nquestion as to whether capital sentence for murder is\nappropriate in modern times has raised serious\ncontroversy the world over, sometimes, with\nemotional overtones.

The afore-stated judgment was relied upon in\n <a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_331\">Surendra Pal v. Saraswati Arora</a> (1974) 2 SCC 600.\n Learned counsel who appeared for the appellant <a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_332\">in that\n case</a> relied upon a passage from Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of\n England on the issue of presumption of undue influence\n in the case of parties engaged to be married. While\n refusing to rely upon the proposition <a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_333\">laid down in</a>\n Halsbury&#x27;s laws of England, this Court observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">&quot;The family law in England has undergone a drastic\nchange, recognised new social relationship between\nman and woman. In our country, however, even today\na marriage is an arranged affair. We do not say that\nthere are no exceptions to this practice or that there\nis no tendency, however imperceptible, for young\npersons to choose their own spouses, but even in\nsuch cases the consent of their parents is one of the\ndesiderata which is sought for. Whether it is obtained\nin any given set of circumstances is another matter. In\nsuch arranged marriages in this country the question\nof two persons being engaged for any appreciable\ntime to enable each other to meet and be in a position\nto exercise undue influence on one another very\nrarely arises. Even in the case of the marriage in the\ninstant case, an advertisement was resorted to by\nBhim Sain. The person who purports to reply is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">                       Page 86 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n      Saraswati&#x27;s mother and the person who replied to her\n      was Bhim Sain&#x27;s Personal Assistant. But the social\n      considerations prevailing in this country and ethos\n      even in such cases persist in determining the\n      respective attitudes. That apart, as we said earlier,\n      the negotiations for marriage held in Saraswati&#x27;s\n      sister&#x27;s house have all the appearance of a business\n      transaction. In these circumstances that portion of the\n      statement of the law in Halsbury which refers to the\n      presumption of the exercise of undue influence in the\n      case of a man to a woman to whom he is engaged to\n      be married would hardly be applicable to conditions in\n      this country. We have had occasion to point out the\n      danger of such statements of law enunciated and\n      propounded for meeting the conditions existing in the\n      countries in which they are applicable from being\n      blindly followed in this country without a critical\n      examination of those principles and their applicability\n      to the conditions, social norms and attitudes existing\n      in this country. Often statements of law applicable to\n      foreign countries as stated in compilations and\n      learned treatises are cited without making a critical\n      examination of those principles in the background of\n      the conditions that existed or exist in those countries.\n      If we are not wakeful and circumspect, there is every\n      likelihood of their being simply applied to cases\n      requiring our adjudication without consideration of the\n      background and various other conditions to which we\n      have referred. On several occasions merely because\n      courts in foreign countries have taken a different view\n      than that taken by our courts or in adjudicating on\n      any particular matter we were asked to reconsider\n      those decisions or to consider them for the first time\n      and to adopt them as the law of this country.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">      No doubt an objective and rational deduction of a\n      principle, if it emerges from a decision of foreign\n      country, rendered on pari materia legislative\n      provisions and which can be applicable to the\n      conditions prevailing in this country will assist the\n      Court in arriving at a proper conclusion.

It merely\nidentifies certain acts which if committed would constitute an\noffence. Such              a prohibition     regulates the sexual conduct\nregardless of the gender identity orientation. What has been\nheld by the Supreme Court is that consent is not the\ndetermining criterion in the case of unnatural offences and\nrather any offence which is against the order of nature and can\nbe described               as carnal penetration would constitute an\noffence       under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_335\">section 377</a> of the IPC thereby making it\nobvious that a wife can initiate proceedings                  against the\nhusband under section 377 for unnatural sex. Thus, when the\nhusband is alleged to have forced his wife for oral sex and\nactually indulges into the same, the same would constitute an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_336\">section 377</a> IPC. To put it in other words, having\nregard to the decision of the Supreme Court<a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_337\">, <a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_338\">referred to above</a></a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_339\">section 377</a> IPC would be applicable in case of heterosexual\ncouples, wherein the husband has compelled the wife into\ncarnal penetration of the orifice of the mouth.

The question was referred\n       to a Full Bench of the Punjab Chief Court as far back as\n       1882 and it was held therein that a husband could be\n       guilty of sodomy on his wife if she was not a consenting\n       party, and that this would afford the wife a valid ground\n       to petition for dissolution of marriage.

Let me now answer the fifth question falling for my\nconsideration as referred to in para-12 as regards <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_373\">section 498-\nA </a>of the IPC. Section 498-A falls within the Chapter- XX-A of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_374\">IPC</a>. This Chapter XX-A came to be introduced in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_375\">IPC</a> in\nthe year 1983. It reflects the anxiety of the Parliament extend\nprotection to the weaker spouse. Life for a woman in the family\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                            Page 100 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nof the husband, at times, is so miserable and intolerable that\nthe drudgery is sometime put to an end by suicide. The object\nof Chapter XX-A is to prevent the torture to a woman by her\nhusband or by the relatives of her husband. The ingredients to\nconstitute the offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_376\">section 498A</a> of the IPC are\nextracted hereunder;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">       &quot;(1) The woman must be married;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">       (2) She must be subjected to cruelty or harassment,\n       and\n       (3) Such cruelty or harassment must have been shown\n       either by husband of the woman or by the relative of her\n       husband.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_216\">53.    Explanation (a) in section 498A gives the meaning of\ncruelty. The meaning of cruelty for the purpose of this section\nhas to be gathered from the language as found in section 498A\nand as per that section &#x27;cruelty&#x27; means &quot;any willful conduct\nwhich is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, etc.\nor harassment to coerce her or any other person related to her\nto meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity or is on account of failure by her or any person related\nto her to meet such demand.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_217\">54.    A new dimension has been given to the concept of\ncruelty. Explanation to section 498A provides that any willful\nconduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive a woman\nto commit suicide would constitute cruelty. Such willful\nconduct which is likely to take grave injury or danger to life,\nlimb or health whether mental or physical of the woman would\nalso amount to cruelty. Harassment of the woman where such\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                           Page 101 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nharassment          is with a view to coercing her or any person\nrelated to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property\nor valuable security would also constitute cruelty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_218\">55.    The perverted sexual practices which the wife has\nalleged and which she herself did not approve would definitely\namount to mental as well as physical cruelty. If between the\ntwo spouses one spouse wants healthy and normal sexual\nrelations and the other is desirous of having perverted sexual\nrelations, such as cunnilingus and fellatio as alleged by the\nwife in the present        case, then the normal sexual relation\nbetween the spouses which forms the basis of a happy marital\nlife, would be floundered on the bed-rocks of sexual aversion\non the part of the spouse who is normal and not deviant, and\nthe insistence of the other spouse who is psychologically so\ndisturbed as not to enjoy the normal sexual relations, would\ntantamount to mental as well as physical cruelty. Some\ninnocuous sado-masochistic practices may at times form an\nintegral part of the marital relations but if they degenerate into\npractices which may cause physical harm or psychological\ntrauma to one of the partners, or if they tend to verge on the\npathological (sic) they would undoubtedly amount to physical\nand mental cruelty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">56.    Thus,        without any hesitation, it can be said that\nwhatever has been alleged by the wife in her first information\nreport, do constitute physical as well as mental cruelty of the\nhighest form and the husband could be said, prima facie, to\nhave committed an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_377\">section 498A</a> of\nthe IPC.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                               Page 102 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">57.    Let me now deal with the sixth question falling for my\nconsideration as regards the husband being guilty of outraging\nthe modesty of his wife.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">58.    If a person assaults or uses criminal force   against any\nwoman intending to outrage, or knowing it to be likely that he\nwill thereby outrage, her modesty, he commits an offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_378\">section 354</a> of IPC. Its essential ingredients are the use\nof criminal force or assault against a woman for the purpose of\noutraging her modesty. A person is said to use force against\nanother if he causes motion or cessation of motion to that\nother by his own bodily power or by inducing any animal to\nchange his motion (<a href=\"/doc/1346144/\" id=\"a_379\">S.349</a>, Indian Penal Code 1860 (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_380\">I.P.C</a>.).\nForce becomes criminal when it is used with criminal intention\nand without that other&#x27;s consent (id. s.350). Whoever makes\nany gesture or preparation to give an apprehension to the\nother that he is about to use criminal force is said to commit\nan assault (id, s.351). It follows that if this is committed or\ncriminal force is used with the intent or knowledge specified in\nthe section, the offender is guilty of outraging the modesty of a\nwoman under section 354. (see Article by Surendra Chaher,\nLecturer in Law, M.D. University, Rohtak titled Outraging the\nModesty of a Woman: Inter-spousal Perspective)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"960519\" id=\"span_292\">59.    The offence created by section 354 is as much in the\ninterest of the woman concerned as in that of public morality\nand indecent behaviour (see, Mudholkar J. in <a href=\"/doc/960519/\" id=\"a_381\">State of Punjab v.\nMajor Sngh</a>, AIR 1967 S.C. 63 at 66).

In Mi Hla So v. Nga Than (1912) 13 Cri. L.J. 53 (Burma),\nthe accused Nga Than was in love with Mi Hla So. He pulled her\nhair and hand in the presence of several persons. The force\nused in the presence of several persons was held to be\ncalculated to outrage the woman&#x27;s modesty under section 354.\nIt was observed that &quot;the assault suggested to Burmese\nonlookers that the man and woman are on conjugal terms.&quot;\nWhat follows is that had the woman been on &quot;conjugal terms&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">the act of the accused in pulling her hair and hand would not\nhave been an outrage of her modesty.

At present, the expression of affection\ntowards one&#x27;s wife or beloved in public like hugging or holding\nof hands may not be treated as an outrage to a woman&#x27;s\nmodesty. But a cruel expression of affection such as pulling of\nhair in public, even if the victim is one&#x27;s wife or beloved may\nstill shock the public morality. Such act of the husband may\namount to an &#x27;indecent act&#x27; because in the present set up with\nthe emphasis on individuals&#x27; equality, personal rights, liberties\nand a flair for women liberation, it would be rather impossible\nto think that a woman will not resent such behaviour.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">62.

Some specific instances are, however, to be\nexamined before arriving at the conclusion that a husband\nmay be held guilty of outraging the modesty of his wife. These\nare:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">(I)     If the husband expresses his affection towards his wife in\npublic in an unkind manner such conduct will (a) amount to an\nindecent behaviour; (b) be against &#x27;public morality&#x27;; and (c )\namount to an outrage under section 354.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">(ii)    In case the husband and wife are alone, it may be\nessential that some liberty be permitted to the spouses with\nregard to certain acts which are a necessary part of the\nconjugal relationship. Certain overtures or acts of affection and\nlove in private by the husband, which may not be acceptable\nto the wife in public, will have to be conceded as not\namounting to outrage under the provision.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">(iii) Highly personal acts of love and affection by the husband\nwhich may or may not be liked by the wife, if done in public,\nmay go against public morality and fall under section 354 as all\nits essential ingredients are present in such a situation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">(iv)    Such personal acts done by the husband as are not\nacceptable to the wife even in private and also not approved\nby society, should also fall under the scope of section 354.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">Today no woman or society would approve of perverted sexual\nacts as being a legitimate part of the spousal relation.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_297\">                               Page 105 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_298\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                   CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">63.

It is conceivable that in case the husband assaults or\nuses criminal force against her wife the act will amount to an\noutrage under section 354, irrespective of the fact whether it\nwas done with or without her consent or in the absence of a\nthird party. The question of husband&#x27;s knowledge, intention or\nher developed sense under the modern set up would become\nirrelevant and a deliberate outrageous conduct of the husband\nis indefensible. It would thus seem to follow that a husband\nmay be held guilty of an offence even under section 354 if the\nvictim is a woman who is his wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">65.    In construing section 354, it is irrelevant to consider the\nage, physical condition or subjective attitude of the wife\nagainst whom the assault has been committed or criminal\nforce is used. The word woman under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_382\">IPC</a> denotes a female\nhuman being of any age (<a href=\"/doc/1980183/\" id=\"a_383\">S. 10</a>, IPC). The earlier interpretation\nin Soka v. Emperor (AIR 1933 Cal. 142) that the protection of\nthe provision is available to women who are old enough to feel\nthe sense of modesty and whose sense of modesty is suffi-\nciently developed, is no longer acceptable. In earlier cases\nwhere assault was committed or criminal force used against\ngirls of tender age, conviction of the accused rested mainly on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_299\">                                 Page 106 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_300\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nbehaviour of the victim. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84463923\" id=\"span_301\">In <a href=\"/doc/84463923/\" id=\"a_384\">Girdhar Gopal v. State</a> (1953) 54\nCri.L.J. 1964 (M.B.) the accused confined the victim, a girl of six\nyears in a room and asked her to remove her clothes. She\nrefused to do so and shouted for help. The act of the applicant\nin confining the girl, making her lie on a bed and then sitting\non her and becoming naked was held as amounting to use of\ncriminal force with the intention or knowledge that the girl&#x27;s\nmodesty would be outraged. The court was apparently of the\nopinion that since the girl shouted for help, she had had her\nsense of modesty developed.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"347944\" id=\"span_302\">In another case, <a href=\"/doc/347944/\" id=\"a_385\">Emperor v. Tatia\nMahadev</a> (1912) 13 Cr. L.J. 858 (Bom.) the accused took a girl,\nsix years old, to his room and made her to lie down and he lay\non her. The girl screamed and ran away. The magistrate took\nthe view that the girl being only six years old was too young to\nhave any sense of modesty developed. The High Court\nnegatived the view in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">  &quot;It seems to us that there are many answers to this view of\n  the learned Magistrate&#x27;s. One sufficient answer may be\n  found in the proved facts of this particular case that the girl\n  screamed and ran away when the accused began his\n  assault upon her. (Ibid)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">  Since the outrage was felt by the victim, and she screamed\nand ran away, the court had seemingly no difficulty in\nconvicting the accused under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_386\">section 354</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"960519\" id=\"span_303\">66.    The question whether any reaction of the victim as also\nher age are decisive or not for determining the guilt under\nsection 354 were resolved by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/960519/\" id=\"a_387\">State of\nPunjab v. Major Singh</a> (supra). In this case the accused caused\ninjury to the vagina of a seven and half months old child by\nfingering. The court held that the provision does not require\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">                            Page 107 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nthat the outrage must be felt by the victim. If such an\ninterpretation is given to the provision as would require that to\npunish a person, the victim must be having a developed sense\nof modesty, &quot;it would leave out of the purview of the section\nassaults not only on the girls of tender age but on even grown\nup woman when such a woman is sleeping and did not wake\nup or is under anaesthesia or stupor or is an idiot.&quot;1 It was held\nthat the legislature did not intend that the outrage to be an\noffence must be felt by the victim. Bachawat J. observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">    &quot;A female of tender age stands on a somewhat different\n    footing. Her body is immature and her sexual powers are\n    dormant. In this case the victim is a baby seven and half\n    months old. She has not yet developed a sense of shame\n    and has not awareness of sex. Nevertheless, from, her very\n    birth she possesses the modesty which is the attribute of\n    her sex. (Id. At 68)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">67.    It would seem to follow that modesty is considered to be\nan attribute of every female since her birth and an outrage\nagainst a wife will be punishable irrespective of the fact that\nshe is of a tender age or developed enough understanding so\nas to appreciate the nature of the act, or to realise that it is\noffensive to her senses. There is no reason for confining the\nprotection afforded by section 354 only to the wives who have\nattained enough understanding to comprehend that the act\ncomplained of was intended to corrupt their morals or\noffensive to propriety of womanly behaviour. The result is that\nunder section 354 age of the wife or her reaction is not a\ndecisive factor in determining the question whether her\nmodesty was outraged or not. This approach would suggest\nthus that women have modesty irrespective of their age and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">1</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">                           Page 108 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nunderstanding of it. Modesty is an inherent characteristic of\nwomanhood independent of any individual&#x27;s personality.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">68.    The next question is, which acts of the husband would\namount to an outrage. To answer this it is necessary that one\nshould look at the concept of a woman&#x27;s modesty in a general\nsense. <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_388\">IPC</a> does not define the term modesty. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"960519\" id=\"span_309\">In <a href=\"/doc/960519/\" id=\"a_389\">Major Singh</a>\n(supra) the Supreme Court appears to have confined &#x27;modesty&#x27;\nto sex as it observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">  &quot;When any act done to or in the presence of a woman is\n  clearly suggestive of sex according to the common notions\n  of mankind that act must fall within the mischief of this\n  section.&quot;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">69.    Bachawat J. also pointed out:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">  &quot;I think that the essence of a woman&#x27;s modesty is her sex.\n  The modesty of an adult female is writ large on her body.\n  Young or old, intelligent or imbecile, awake or sleeping, the\n  woman possesses modesty capable of being outraged.&quot;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"269185\" id=\"span_310\">70.    It follows that anything done by the husband which is\nsuggestive of sex amounts to an outrage. Kissing violently in\npublic, raising her skirt before one&#x27;s own or the wife&#x27;s relatives\n(principle derived from <a href=\"/doc/269185/\" id=\"a_390\">State of Rajasthan vs. Vijairam</a>, (1968)\nCr.

If the dictionary meaning of the word is adhered to, the\nacts which are indecent, unfair, unkind, unreasonable and do\nnot conform to approved social standards would be naturally\ndeemed outrageous to the modesty of a woman. Such acts\nmay assume a variety of forms. It all depends upon the custom\nand habits of the people. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"639309\" id=\"span_315\">For instance, uplifting the veil of a\nwoman&#x27;s pardah in presence of her father-in-law, she being a\nvillage lady, would be justly regarded as an indecent act\noutrageous to her modesty. Pulling of hair or hand, pushing,\nobstructing the way, waylaying, may all come within the\nmischief of the provision. Similarly, hurting her by putting a\nstrong arm-hold around her neck or waist will be covered by\nthe scope and ambit of section 354. Catching hold of a woman\nby her arm and dragging her may also amount to an outrage\nirrespective of the fact that the act is done in the presence of\nothers or not (principle derived from <a href=\"/doc/639309/\" id=\"a_393\">Fakir vs. Emperor</a>, (1928)\nCri. L.J. 749 (Lahore).</span> Throwing her on the ground is\noutrageous (See, Nuna vs. Emperor, (1912) Cri. L.J. 469 (Punj.)\nas the act is unkind and indecent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_237\">72.    It follows that if a person takes indecent liberties with his\nwife in public he will be as much punishable as if he had\noutraged the modesty of another woman. But in case the wife\nis below 18 years of age, then irrespective of the fact that the\nhusband and wife are alone or in public, any assault or use of\nforce against her may amount to an outrage (In case the wife\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_316\">                             Page 110 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                  CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nis below 18 years of age her express or implied consent is not\nmaterial. See, Exception to<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_394\"> S.375</a>, IPC). If they are alone, the\nhusband may be held guilty of outraging the modesty of his\nwife if he does unkind, cruel or perverted sexual acts to her. In\nsubstance, the question whether a person can be held guilty of\noutraging the modesty of his wife must be answered in the\naffirmative, and section 354 should be equally applicable to a\nperson who commits an assault or uses criminal force against\nhis own wife.

As the learned counsel appearing for the victim has\nvociferously submitted a lot with regard to marital rape,                  I\nwould like to say something in this regard. Marital rape is not\nan offence in our country as the belief is that it could become a\npotent tool or weapon in the hands of an unscrupulous wife to\nharass her husband and become a phenomenon which may\ndestabilize        the institution of marriage.       Marital rape is a\nwidespread problem             for a woman that has existed              for\ncenturies throughout the world.               This problem has received\nrelatively little attention from the criminal justice system and\nthe society as a whole. Marital rape is illegal in 50 American\nstates,      3 Australian states, New Zealand, Canada,             Israel,\nFrance, Sweeden, Denmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and\nCzechoslovakia.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\">74.    Marital rape is one of the acts of sexual intercourse with\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">                                 Page 111 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                 CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\none&#x27;s spouse without consent. It is a form of intercourse with\none&#x27;s spouse without consent. It is a form of domestic violence\nand sexual abuse. The controversy over the issue of marital\nrape stems from the failure of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_395\">Indian Penal Code</a> to\ncriminalize it. Marital rape is also known as spousal rape or\ninmate partner rape. According to Morton Hunt, an American\nPsychologist and Science Writer of U.S.A, &quot;the typical marital\nrapist is a man who still believes that husbands are supposed\nto &quot;rule&quot; their wives. This extends, he feels, to sexual matters:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">when he wants her, she should be glad, or at least willing, if\nshe is not , he has the right to force her. But in forcing her, he\ngains far more than a few minutes of sexual pleasure. He\nhumbles her and reasserts, in the most emotionally powerful\nway possible, that he is the ruler and she is the subject.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">75.    In     December     1993,     the       United   Nations     High\nCommissioner for Human Rights published the Declaration on\nthe Elimination of Violence against Women. This establishes\nmarital rape as a human rights violation. This is not fully\nrecognized by all the UN member States. In 1997, UNICEF\nreported that just 17 States had criminalized marital rape. In\n2003, UNIFEM reported that more than 50 states did so. The\ncountries like Poland (1932), Czechoslovakia (1950), Soviet\nUnion (1960) were first to criminalize marital rape.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_241\">76.    U.S.A\n\n       Rape is defined as any nonconsensual sexual intercourse\nbetween non-spouses and it has always been illegal. However,\nuntil 1975, every state had a &quot;marital exemption&quot; that allowed\na husband to rape his wife without fear of legal consequences.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">                             Page 112 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                 CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">By 1993, largely in response to the women&#x27;s rights and\nequality movement, every state and the District of Columbia\nhad passed laws against marital rape. Since 1993, all 50 states\nand DC have enacted laws against marital rape. The only\nmarital exemption that still exists in some states is for\nstatutory rape. All states now recognize rape within the\nmarriage as a crime, and most charge the crime in the same\nway that rape between the strangers, would be charged. The\nlegal history of marital rape laws in the United States is a long\nand complex one, that spans over several decades. Traditional\nrape laws in the US defined rape as forced sexual intercourse\nby a male with a &quot;female not his wife&quot;, making it clear that the\nstatutes did not apply to the married couples. The 1962 Model\nPenal Code stated that &quot;A male who has sexual intercourse\nwith a female not his wife is guilty of rape if: (...)&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">      The criminalization of marital rape in the United States\nstarted in the mid-1970s and by 1993 marital rape was a crime\nin all the 50 states, under at least one section of the sexual\noffense codes. During the 1990s, most states differentiated\nbetween the way marital rape and non-marital rape were\ntreated, through differences such as shorter penalties, or\nexcluding situations where no violence is used, or shorter\nreporting periods. (Bergen, 1996; Russell, 1990). The laws\nhave continued to change and evolve, with most states\nreforming their legislation in the 21st century, in order to bring\nmarital rape laws in line with the non-marital rape, but even\ntoday there remain differences in some states. With the\nremoval, in 2005, of the requirement of a higher level of\nviolence from the law of Tennessee, which now allows for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">                              Page 113 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nmarital rape in Tennessee to be treated like any other type of\nrape, South Carolina remains the only US state with a law\nrequiring excessive force/violence (the force or violence used\nor threatened must be of a &quot;high and aggravated nature&quot;).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\">       In most states the criminalization has occurred by the\nremoval of the exemptions from the general rape law by the\nlegislature; or by the courts striking down the exemptions as\nunconstitutional. In some states, however, the legislature has\ncreated a distinct crime of spousal rape. This is, for example,\nthe case in California, where there are two different criminal\noffenses: Rape (<a href=\"/doc/358206/\" id=\"a_396\">Article 261</a>) and Spousal Rape (<a href=\"/doc/1558821/\" id=\"a_397\">Article 262</a>).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1353689\" id=\"span_324\">77.    U.K.\n\n       The marital rape exemption was abolished in England\nand Wales in 1991 by the Appellate Committee of the House of\nLords, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_398\">R v. R. The</a> exemption had never been a\nrule of statute, having first been promulgated in 1736 in\nMatthew Hale&#x27;s History of the Pleas of the Crown, where Hale\nstated: &quot;But the husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed\nby himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial\nconsent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind\nunto her husband which she cannot retract.&quot; Corresponding\namendment to the statutory law was made through Section\n147 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, 1994.</span> This\njudgment was also affirmed by the European Court of Human\nRights in the decision     of SW v. UK .      Although the issue of\nmarital rape was highlighted by feminists in the 19th century,\nand was also deplored by thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and\nBertrand Russell (see above section &#x27;Feminist critique in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">                            Page 114 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n19th century&#x27;), it was not until the 1970s that this issue was\nraised at a political level. The late 1970s also saw the\nenactment of Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 1976,\nwhich provided the first statutory definition of rape (prior to\nthis rape was an offense at common law). The Criminal Law\nRevision Committee in their 1984 Report on Sexual Offences\nrejected the idea that the offense of rape should be extended\nto marital relations; writing the following:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">    &quot;The majority of us ... believe that rape cannot be\n    considered in the abstract as merely &#x27;sexual intercourse\n    without consent&#x27;. The circumstances of rape may be\n    peculiarly grave. This feature is not present in the case of\n    a husband and wife cohabiting with each other when an\n    act of sexual intercourse occurs without the wife&#x27;s\n    consent. They may well have had sexual intercourse\n    regularly before the act in question and, because a sexual\n    relationship may involve a degree of compromise, she\n    may sometimes have agreed only with some reluctance to\n    such intercourse. Should he go further and force her to\n    have sexual intercourse without her consent, this may\n    evidence a failure of the marital relationship. But it is far\n    from being the &#x27;unique&#x27; and &#x27;grave&#x27; offence described\n    earlier. Where the husband goes so far as to cause injury,\n    there are available a number of offences against the\n    person with which he may be charged, but the gravamen\n    of the husband&#x27;s conduct is the injury he has caused not\n    the sexual intercourse he has forced.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_246\">     The Committee also expressed more general views on\ndomestic violence arguing that &quot;Violence occurs in some\nmarriages but the wives do not always wish the marital tie to\nbe severed&quot; and reiterated the point that domestic incidents\nwithout physical injury would generally be outside the scope of\nthe law: &quot;Some of us consider that the criminal law should be\nkept out of the marital relationships between the cohabiting\npartners especially the marriage bed--except where injury\narises, when there are other offences which can be charged.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">                            Page 115 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_247\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133978540\" id=\"span_329\">Five years later, in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary\ntook a different view, abolishing marital immunity, in <a href=\"/doc/133978540/\" id=\"a_399\">S. v.

Some European Countries-Belgium was one of the\ncountries who criminalized marital rape very early.

Finland outlawed\nmarital rape in 1954. The case of Finland was in limelight\nbecause Finland is a country where women have equal rights\nand opportunities. In 1979, the Brussels Court of Appeal\nrecognized marital rape and found that a husband who used\nserious violence to coerce his wife into having sex against her\nwishes was guilty of the criminal offense of rape. The logic of\nthe court was that, although the husband did have a &#x27;right&#x27; to\nsex with his wife, he could not use violence to claim it, as\nBelgian laws did not allow people to obtain their rights by\nviolence. In 1989 laws were amended, the definition of rape\nwas broadened, and marital rape is treated the same as other\nforms of rape.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_349\">                            Page 120 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_350\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                         CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">79.

Some Australian states left rape to be defined at\ncommon law, but others had statutory definitions, with these\ndefinitions having marital exemptions. The definition of rape in\nQueensland, for instance, was: &quot;Any person who has carnal\nknowledge of a woman or girl, not his wife, without her\nconsent, or with her consent, if the consent is obtained by\nforce, or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">                                     Page 124 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_359\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                   CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nfear of bodily harm, or by means of false and fraudulent\nrepresentations as to the nature of the act, or, in the case of a\nmarried woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of a\ncrime,       which         is   called     rape.&quot;[154]   Discussions        of\ncriminalization of marital rape were already taking place in the\nlate 1970s in Queensland,[154] but it was not until 1989 that it\nwas criminalized.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_271\">       The first Australian state to deal with marital rape was\nSouth Australia. The changes came in 1976, but these were\nonly partly removing the exemption.

Nevertheless, the laws did\nnot go as far as equating marital with non-marital rape; the law\nrequired violence, or other aggravating circumstances, in order\nfor an act of marital intercourse to be rape; which remained\nlaw until 1992. The first Australian jurisdiction to completely\nremove the marital exemption was New South Wales in 1981.\nThe same happened in Western Australia, Victoria, and ACT in\n1985; and Tasmania in 1987. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"22762820\" id=\"span_360\">In 1991, in <a href=\"/doc/22762820/\" id=\"a_414\">R v L</a>, the High Court\nof Australia ruled that if the common law exemption had ever\nbeen part of the Australian law, it no longer was.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_272\">93.    According to the UN Population Fund, more than                     two-\nthird of the married women in India, aged between 15 and 49,\nare severely beaten, or forced to provide sex.

Marital       rape is common but it is only an un-reported\ncrime.

If the             very same husband lays an\nassault and forces his wife to have sexual intercourse, he\nwould be liable for assault but not for an offence of rape only\nbecause there is a valid marriage between the two.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_275\">96.

Marital Rape refers to &quot;unwanted intercourse by a man\nwith his wife obtained by force, threat of force, or physical\nviolence, or when she is unable to give consent. It is a non-\nconsensual act of violent perversion by a husband against the\nwife where she is abused physically and sexually.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_286\">99.     Types of Marital Rape:- Marital rape may be broadly\nclassified into following two categories;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_287\">(I)     Sexual coercion by non-physical means- this form of\ncoercion involves social coercion in which the wife is compelled\nto enter into sexual intercourse by reminding her of her duties\nas a wife. This form of coercion entails applying non-physical\ntechniques and tactics like verbal pressure in order to get into\nsexual contact with a non-consenting female. The most\ncommonly used non-physical techniques include making false\npromises, threatening to end the marital relationship, lies, not\nconforming to the victim&#x27;s protests to stop, etc. Such acts of\nsexual coercion by the use of non-physical stunts though\nconsidered less severe in degree as compared with physically\ncoercive sexual acts are widespread and pose a threat to the\nwomen&#x27; right in the society.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_288\">(II)    Forced Sex:-this involves the use of physical force to\nenter into sexual intercourse with an unwilling woman. It can\nbe further classified into the following three categories;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_289\">(a)     Battering Rape:-this form of rape involves the use of\naggression and force against the wife. The women are either\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_368\">                            Page 128 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_369\">        R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                 CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nbattered during the sexual act itself or face a violent\naggression after the coerced sexual intercourse. The beating\nmay also occur before the sexual assault so as to compel her\ninto sexual intercourse.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_290\">(b)     Force Only Rape:- in this form of rape, the husband does\nnot necessarily batter the wife, but uses as much force as is\nnecessary to enter into sexual intercourse with the unwilling\nwife.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_291\">(c )    Obsessive Rape:- this form of rape involves the use of\nforce in sexual assault compiled with the perverse acts against\nthe wife. It involves a kind of sexual sadistic pleasure enjoyed\nby the husband.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_292\">100. The Justice Verma Committee notes: &quot;Changes in the\nlaw therefore need to be accompanied by widespread\nmeasures raising               awareness of women&#x27;s rights to\nautonomy            and     physical       integrity,   regardless       of\nmarriage or other intimate relationship.&quot; Clearly, rather\nthan the Justice Verma Committee&#x27;s desire to raise awareness\namong women on their right to autonomy and physical\nintegrity, the government is more keen on &quot;moral and social\nawareness&quot; which is a euphemism for appearing to patriarchal\nnotions of honour that tell men to respect women and do the\nright thing.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_293\">101.

The committee was\nasked to look into the possible amendments in the criminal\nlaws related to sexual violence against women. The committee\nwas conscious of the recommendations in respect of the India\nmade     by     the       U.N.     Committee          on   the    Elimination     of\nDiscrimination           against    women.            (CEDAW      Committee)      in\nFebruary, 2007.           The CEDAW Committee recommended that\nthe country should &quot; widen the definition of rape in its Penal\nCode to reflect the realities of sexual abuse experienced by\nwomen and to remove the exception of marital rape from the\ndefinition of rape...&quot; The Verma Committee report points out a\n2010 study suggesting that 18.8% of the women are raped by\ntheir partners on one or more occasion. The rate of reporting\nand conviction also remains low; aggravated by the prevalent\nbeliefs that the marital rape is acceptable or is less serious\nthan the other types of rape. The recommendation of Justice\nVerma Committee regarding deleting exception of marital rape\nwas not included in the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 2013\npassed by the Lok Sabha on 19th March, 2013 and by the Rajya\nSabha on 21st March, 2013.                  The bill received Presidential\nassent on 2nd April, 2013 and deemed to come into force from\n3rd February, 2013.

Family is able to resolve the\n(marital) problems and there is also a provision under the law\nfor cruelty against women. It was, therefore, felt that if marital\nrape is brought under the law, the entire family system will be\nunder great stress and the committee may perhaps be doing\nmore injustice.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_295\">103. Does          the     concept    of    matrimonial          cruelty       vary     in\naccordance with the religious persuasions of individuals? Is a\nspouse bound to suffer greater amount of matrimonial cruelty\nbecause the spouse belong to a religion which considered\nmarriage as indissoluble?

The concept of crime, undoubtedly, keeps on\nchanging with the change in the political, economic and\nsocial     set-up        of   the    country.     The    constitution,\ntherefore, confers powers both on the Central and State\nLegislature        to make laws in this regard. Such               right\nincludes the power to define a crime and provide for\nits punishment. It is high time that the legislature once\nagain intervenes and go into the soul of the issue of\nmarital rape. Marital rape is a serious matter though,\nunfortunately,           it is not attracting serious discussions\nat the end of the Government.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_298\">106. Uptil now, the stance of the Government has been that\nthe term &quot;marital rape&quot; is oxymoron.              The analogy which is\nsought to be applied by the government hinges on the\nstatement that to get married is to give all time consent\nforever to sex with your spouse. To put it differently, though\nwhen you join the army, you only have to join the army once.\nYou don&#x27;t get the choice to consent to obey the orders every\nsingle time an order is given. In certain arrangements, and\nmarriage is one of them, the agreement is a lasting one. What\nis in the mind of the legislature is that marital rape is\ncompletely unprovable. A wife accusing her husband of rape\nand pressing charges only demonstrates that the marriage is\nirrevocably over.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_377\">                                Page 132 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_378\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_299\">107. I am of the view that even if the wife initiates\nproceedings under the provision of the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_423\">Domestic Violence Act</a>,\nthe marriage could be said to be irrevocably over. Therefore,\nthis logic or analogy, which is sought to be applied by the\nGovernment, does not appeal to me in any manner.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_300\">108. In the aforesaid context, I may refer to and rely upon a\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of Independent\nThought vs.          Union of India &amp; Anr., Writ Petition (Civil)\nNo.382 of 2013, decided on 11th October, 2017. His Lordship\nJustice Madan B. Lokur made few very pertinent observations\nas regards the martial rape. The observations are extracted\nhereunder;\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">     &quot;[88] We must not and cannot forget the existence of\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_424\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution which gives a fundamental\n     right to a girl child to live a life of dignity. The\n     documentary material placed before us clearly suggests\n     that an early marriage takes away the self esteem and\n     confidence of a girl child and subjects her, in a sense, to\n     sexual abuse. Under no circumstances can it be said that\n     such a girl child lives a life of dignity. The right of a girl\n     child to maintain her bodily integrity is effectively\n     destroyed by a traditional practice sanctified by the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_425\">IPC</a>.\n     Her husband, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_426\">Section 375</a> of the IPC,\n     effectively has full control over her body and can subject\n     her to sexual intercourse without her consent or without\n     her willingness since such an activity would not be rape.\n     Anomalously, although her husband can rape her but he\n     cannot molest her for if he does so he could be punished\n     under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_427\">IPC</a>. This was recognized by\n     the LCI in its 172nd report but was not commented upon.\n     It appears therefore that different and irrational\n     standards have been laid down for the treatment of the\n     girl child by her husband and it is necessary to harmonize\n     the provisions of various statutes and also harmonize\n     different provisions of the IPC inter-se.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_379\">                               Page 133 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_380\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">     [89] We have also adverted to the issue of reproductive\n     choices that are severely curtailed as far as a married girl\n     child is concerned. There is every possibility that being\n     subjected to sexual intercourse, the girl child might\n     become pregnant and would have to deliver a baby even\n     though her body is not quite ready for procreation. The\n     documentary material shown to us indicates that there\n     are greater chances of a girl child dying during childbirth\n     and there are greater chances of neonatal deaths. The\n     results adverted to in the material also suggest that\n     children born out of early marriages are more likely to be\n     malnourished. In the face of this material, would it be\n     wise to continue with a practice, traditional though it\n     might be, that puts the life of a girl child in danger and\n     also puts the life of the baby of a girl child born from an\n     early marriage at stake? Apart from constitutional and\n     statutory provisions, constitutional morality forbids us\n     from giving an interpretation to Exception 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_428\">Section\n     375</a> of the IPC that sanctifies a tradition or custom that is\n     no longer sustainable.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">     [90] The view that marital rape of a girl child has\n     the potential of destroying the institution of\n     marriage cannot be accepted. Marriage is not\n     institutional but personal nothing can destroy the\n     &#x27;institution&#x27; of marriage except a statute that\n     makes marriage illegal and punishable. A divorce\n     may destroy a marriage but does it have the\n     potential of destroying the &#x27;institution&#x27; of\n     marriage? A judicial separation may dent a marital\n     relationship but does it have the potential of\n     destroying the &#x27;institution&#x27; of marriage or even the\n     marriage? Can it be said that no divorce should be\n     permitted or that judicial separation should be\n     prohibited? The answer is quite obvious. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_301\">109.

A woman is no longer the chattel-antiquated practices\nlabeled her to be. A husband who has sexual intercourse with\nhis wife is not merely using a property, he is fulfilling a marital\nconsortium with a fellow human being with dignity equal to\nthat he accords himself. He cannot be permitted to violate this\ndignity by coercing her to engage in a sexual act without her\nfull and free consent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_303\">111. Further, the delicate and reverent nature of sexual\nintimacy between a husband and wife excludes cruelty and\ncoercion. Sexual intimacy brings spouses wholeness and\noneness. It is a gift and a participation in the mystery of\ncreation. It is a deep sense of spiritual communion. It is a\nfunction which enlivens the hope of procreation and ensures\nthe continuation of family relations. It is an expressive interest\nin each other&#x27;s feelings at a time it is needed by the other and\nit can go a long way in deepening marital relationship. When it\nis egoistically utilized to     despoil marital union in order to\nadvance a felonious urge for coitus by force, violence or\nintimidation, the same should be made punishable to protect\nits lofty purpose, vindicate justice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_304\">112. Besides, a husband who feels aggrieved by his indifferent\nor uninterested wife&#x27;s absolute refusal to engage in sexual\nintimacy may legally seek the court&#x27;s intervention to declare\nher psychologically incapacitated to fulfill an essential marital\nobligation.

I am conscious of the fact that the marital rape may be\nused as a tool to harass the innocent husbands and this is\nwhat of the Parliament is worried about. In this regard, let it\nbe stressed that the safeguards in the criminal justice system\nare in place to spot and scrutinize fabricated or false marital\ncomplaints,      and     any   person      who       institutes     untrue       and\nmalicious charges, can be made answerable in accordance\nwith law.

The basic argument which is advanced in favour of these\nso-called &#x27;laws&#x27; is that consent to marry in itself encompasses\na consent to engage into sexual activity. But, an implied\nconsent to engage into sexual activity does not mean consent\nto being inflicted with sexual violence. It is often felt that as in\nsadomasochistic sexual acts, in marital rape women are\npresumed to have consented to the violence. However Rape\nand sex cannot be distinguished on the basis of violence alone.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_315\">122. Various authors, over a period of time, have come up\nwith different theories regarding the occurrence of marital rape\nin the society;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_316\">123. The Feminist Theory:- this theory considers marital rape\nas a tool in the hands of the patriarchal society that is used to\nexercise control over the women. They consider that the\nexemption given in cases of marital rape is a remnant of the\nearlier laws regarding women that considered them to be the\nproperty of the husband. The feminists are of the view that\nmarital rape is nothing but a result of a power play by the male\nspouse in the marriage. Radical feminists have gone to the\nextent of arguing that any form of heterosexual intercourse is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_389\">                             Page 138 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_390\">       R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                         CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nbased mainly on the basis of the man and is another form of\noppression on women.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_317\">124. The Social Constructionism Theory:- the believers in the\ntheory of social constructionism are of the view that men have\ndominated the society in law making and the political arena\nsince time memorial. Law thus came as a reflection of the\ninterest of men. Such laws considered women to be their\nhusband&#x27;s property after marriage and hence, marital rape\nwas considered an offence of lesser degree as compared to\nrape. Some jurisprudence even considered that rape in a\nmarriage is not rape at all. The social construcionism believe\nthat marital rape is a means through which men try to assert\nthemselves over their wives so as to retain their long gained\npower over their property.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_318\">125. The        Sex-Role    Socialization           Theory:-   these    theorists\nbelieve that it is the particular gender roles which guide the\nsexual interactions between the spouses in a marriage. In a\nmarriage, women are always taught to be calm and passive,\nsubmissive whereas, men are trained to be dominant and\naggressive. Care and love are attributed to women, Man, on\nthe    other      hand,    are   the    major        perpetrators      of   sexual\nentertainment with violent themes. Sex role socialists are of\nthe view that marital rape is nothing but an expression of the\ntraditional perceptions of sex roles.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_319\">126.

Some of the observations\nare extracted hereunder;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_244\">     &quot;The appeal arises out of the appellant&#x27;s conviction at Leicester\n     Crown Court on 30 July 1990, upon his pleas of guilty, of attempted\n     rape and of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The alleged\n     victim in respect of each offence was the appellant&#x27;s wife. The\n     circumstances of the case were these. The appellant married his\n     wife in August 1984 and they had one son born in 1985. On 11\n     November 1987 the couple separated for about two weeks but\n     resumed cohabitation at the end of that period. On 21 October\n     1989 the wife left the matrimonial home with the son and went to\n     live with her parents. She had previously consulted solicitors about\n     matrimonial problems, and she left at the matrimonial home a\n     letter for the appellant informing him that she intended to petition\n     for divorce. On 23 October 1989 the appellant spoke to his wife on\n     the telephone indicating that it was his intention also to see about a\n     divorce. No divorce proceedings had, however, been instituted\n     before the events which gave rise to the charges against the\n     appellant. About 9 p.m. on 12 November 1989 the appellant forced\n     his way into the house of his wife&#x27;s parents, who were out at the\n     time, and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her against\n     her      will.   In     the     course      of     doing     so    he\n     assaulted her by squeezing her neck with both hands. The appellant\n     was arrested and interviewed by police officers.Headmitted\n     responsibility for what had happened.On 3 May 1990 a\n     decree nisi of divorce was made absolute.The appellant was\n     charged        on      an        indictment       containing      two\n     counts, the first being rape and the second being assault\n     occasioning actual bodily harm. When he appeared before Owen J.\n     at Leicester Crown Court on 30 July 1990 it was submitted to the\n     judge on his behalf that a husband could not in law be guilty as a\n     principal of the offence of raping his own wife. Owen J. rejected\n     that proposition as being capable of exonerating the appellant in\n     the circumstances of the case. His ground for doing so was that,\n     assuming an implicit general consent to sexual intercourse by a\n     wife on marriage to her husband, that consent was capable of\n     being withdrawn by agreement of the parties or by the wife\n     unilaterally removing herself from cohabitation and clearly\n     indicating that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.\n     On the facts appearing from the depositions either the first or the\n     second of these sets of circumstances prevailed. Following the\n     judge&#x27;s ruling the appellant pleaded guilty to attempted rape and\n     to the assault charged. He was sentenced to three years&#x27;\n     imprisonment on the former count and to eighteen months\n     imprisonment on the latter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_245\">     The appellant appealed to the Court            of   Appeal   (Criminal\n     Division) on the ground that Owen J.:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">     &quot;made a wrong decision in law in ruling that a man may\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_393\">                              Page 140 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_394\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                 CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n rape his wife when the consent to intercourse which his\n wife gives in entering the contract of marriage has been\n revoked neither by order of a court nor by agreement\n between the parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_320\"> On 14 March 1990 that Court (Lord Lane C.J., Sir Stephen BrownP.,\n Watkins, Neill and Russell L.JJ.) delivered a reserved judgment\n dismissing the appeal but certifying the question of general public\n importance set out above and granting leave to appeal to your\n Lordships&#x27; House, which the appellant now does.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_321\"> Sir Matthew Hale, in his History of the Pleas of the Crown\n (1736) vol. 1, ch. 58, p. 629, wrote:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_247\"> &quot;But the husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed byhimself\n upon      his   lawful   wife,     for    by   their    mutual\n matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given\n herself up in this kind unto her husband which she cannot\n retract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_322\"> There is no similar statement in the works of any earlier English\n commentator. In 1803 East, in his Treatise of the Pleas of the\n Crown, Vol. 1 ch. X, p. 446, wrote:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\"> &quot;... a husband cannot by law be guilty of ravishing his\n wife, on account of the matrimonial consent which she\n cannot retract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\"> &quot;In the first edition (1822) of Archbold, A Summary of the Law\n Relative to Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, at p. 259 it\n was stated, after a reference to Hale, &quot;A husband also cannot be\n guilty of a rape upon his wife.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_323\"> For over 150 years after the publication of Hale&#x27;s work\n there appears to have been no reported case in which judicial\n consideration was given to his proposition. The first such case\n was Reg. v. Clarence (1888) 22 Q.B.D. 23, to which I shall refer\n later. It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded\n as an accurate statement of the common law of England. The\n common law is, however, capable of evolving in the light of\n changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale&#x27;s\n proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects at the\n time it was enunciated. Since then the status of women, and\n particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition\n in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is\n unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and\n the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most\n important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as\n a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must\n be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale&#x27;s proposition\n involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to\n sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and\n irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_395\">                         Page 141 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_396\"> R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                  CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must\n regard that conception as quite unacceptable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_324\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133978540\" id=\"span_397\">In <a href=\"/doc/133978540/\" id=\"a_429\">S. v. H.M. Advocate</a> 1989 S.L.T. 469 the High Court of\n Justiciary in Scotland recently considered the supposed marital\n exemption in rape in that country.</span> In two earlier cases, H.M.\n Advocate v. Duffy 1983 S.L.T. 7 and H.M. Advocate v. Paxton\n 1985 S.L.T. 96 it had been held by single judges that the\n exemption did not apply where the parties to the marriage were\n not cohabiting. The High Court held that the exemption, if it had\n ever been part of the law of Scotland, was no longer so. The\n principal authority for the exemption was to be found in Baron\n Hume&#x27;s Criminal Law of Scotland, first published in 1797. The\n same statement appeared in each edition up to the fourth, by Bell,\n in 1844. At p. 306 of vol. 1 of that edition, dealing with art and\n part guilt of abduction and rape, it was said:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\"> &quot;This is true without exception even of the husband of the\n woman; who although he cannot himself commit a rape on\n his own wife, who has surrendered her person to him in that\n sort,  may    however    be   accessory to  that  crime  ...\n committed on her by another.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_325\"> It seems likely that this pronouncement consciously followed Hale:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\"> The Lord Justice-General, Lord Emslie, who delivered the\n judgment of the court, expressed doubt whether Hume&#x27;s view\n accurately represented the law of Scotland even at the time when\n it was expressed and continued, at p. 473:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_252\"> &quot;We say no more on this matter which was not the subject\n of debate before us, because we are satisfied that the Solicitor\n Genral was well founded in his contention that whether or not the\n reason for the husband&#x27;s immunity given by Hume was a good one\n in        the        18th      and               early      19th\n senturies, it has since disappeared altogether. Whatever\n Hume meant to encompass in the concept of a wife&#x27;s\n &#x27;surrender of her person&#x27; to her husband &#x27;in that sort&#x27; the\n concept is to be understood against the background of the\n status of women and the position of a married woman at\n the time when he wrote. Then, no doubt, a married woman\n could be said to have subjected herself to her husband&#x27;s\n dominion in all things. She was required to obey him in all\n things. Leaving out of account the absence of rights of\n property, a wife&#x27;s freedoms were virtually non-existent, and\n she had in particular no right whatever to interfere in her\n husband&#x27;s control over the lives and upbringing of any\n children of the marriage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\"> By the second half of the 20th century, however, the status\n of women, and the status of a married woman, in our law\n have changed quite dramatically. A husband and wife are\n now for ail practical purposes equal partners in marriage\n and both husband and wife are tutors and curators of their\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_398\">                          Page 142 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_399\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                      CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n     children. A wife is not obliged to obey her husband in all\n     things nor to suffer excessive sexual demands on the part of\n     her husband. She may rely on such demands as evidence of\n     unreasonable behaviour for the purposes of divorce. A live\n     system of law will always have regard to changing\n     circumstances to test the justification for any exception to\n     the application of a general rule. Nowadays it cannot\n     seriously be maintained that by marriage a wife submits\n     herself     irrevocably     to      sexual     intercourse       in   all\n     circumstances. It cannot be affirmed nowadays, whatever\n     the position may have been in earlier centuries, that it is\n     an incident of modern marriage that a wife consents to\n     intercourse in all circumstances, including sexual intercourse\n     obtained only by force. There is no doubt that a wife does\n     not consent to assault upon her person and there is no\n     plausible justification for saying today that she nevertheless\n     is to be taken to consent to intercourse by assault. The\n     modern cases of H.M. Advocate v. Duffy and H.M. Advocate\n     v. Paxton show that any supposed implied consent to\n     intercourse     is   not    irrevocable,     that      separation   may\n     demonstrate that such consent has been withdrawn, and that\n     in these circumstances a relevant charge of rape may lie\n     against a husband. This development of the law since\n     Hume&#x27;s time immediately prompts the question: is revocation\n     of a wife&#x27;s implied consent to intercourse, which is\n     revocable, only capable of being established by the act of\n     separation? In our opinion the answer to that question must be no.\n     Revocation of a consent which is revocable must depend on the\n     circumstances. Where there is no separation this may be harder to\n     prove        but      the       critical     question         in     any\n     case must simply be whether or not consent has been\n     withheld. The fiction of implied consent has no useful\n     purpose to serve today in the law of rape in Scotland. The\n     reason given by Hume for the husband&#x27;s immunity from\n     prosecution upon a charge of rape of his wife, if it ever\n     was a good reason, no longer applies today. There is\n     now,accordingly, no justification for the supposed immunity of a\n     husband. Logically the only question is whether or not as\n     matter of fact the wife consented to the acts complained of, and we\n     affirm     the     decision      of      the     trial     judge    that\n     charge 2(b) is a relevant charge against the appellant to go to trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">     I consider the substance of that reasoning to be no less valid in\n     England than in Scotland. On grounds of principle there is now no\n     justification for the marital exemption in rape.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_326\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_400\">127.

Outlawing the traditional notion that the husband cannot\nbe guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife,\nfor by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract, the wife\nis deemed in law to have given herself up in this kind unto her\nhusband which she cannot retract, Justice Brennan of the\nAustralian High Court observed in 1991 that &quot;the common law\nfiction has always been offensive to human dignity and\nincompatible with the legal status of a spouse (<a href=\"/doc/22762820/\" id=\"a_438\">R v. L</a> (1991)\nH.C.A 48).&quot; The research indicates that the marital rape has\nsevere and long lasting consequences for women, both\nphysical and psychological. The physical effects include injuries\nto   the    private       organs,     miscarriages,      stillbirths,   bladder\ninfections, infertility and the potential contraction of sexually\ntransmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS.                   Women raped by their\npartners also suffer severe psychological consequence such as\nflashbacks, sexual dysfunction and emotional pain for years\nafter violence.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_407\">                                    Page 145 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_408\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                   CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_329\">130. My final conclusion is summarized as under;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_330\">130.1        The husband cannot be prosecuted for the offence\nof rape punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_439\">section 376</a> of the IPC at the instance\nof his wife as the marital rape is not covered under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_440\">section 375</a>\nof the IPC. The husband cannot be prosecuted for the offence\nof rape at the instance of his wife in view of Exception-II in\n<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_441\">section 375</a> of the IPC, which provides that sexual intercourse\nor sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being\nunder 18 years of age, is not rape.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">130.2        A wife can initiate proceedings against her husband\nfor unnatural sex under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_442\">section 377</a> of the IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_443\">Section 377</a> IPC\ndoes not criminalize a particular class of people or identity or\norientation.     It merely   identifies         certain acts, which     if\ncommitted, would constitute an offence. Consent is not a\ndetermining criterion in the case of unnatural offences and\nrather any offence which is against the order of nature and can\nbe described as carnal penetration would constitute an offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_444\">section 377</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_332\">130.3        Except the sexual perversions of sodomy, buggery\nand bestiallity, all other sexual perversions, would not fall\nwithin the sweep of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_445\">section 377</a> IPC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_333\">130.4        More than a prima facie is made out having regard\nto the nature of the allegations so far as the offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_446\">section 498A</a> of the IPC is concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_334\">130.5        As discussed above, a prima facie case to proceed\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_409\">                              Page 146 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_410\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nagainst the accused-husband for outraging the modesty of his\nwife could also be said to have been made out. Although\nsection 354 is not one of the offences in the FIR, yet I am of\nthe view that the investigation in this direction is necessary.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_335\">130.6        The exemption given to marital rape, as Justice\nVerma noted, &quot;stems from a long out-dated notion of marriage\nwhich regarded wives as no more than the property of their\nhusbands&quot;. Marital rape ought to be a crime and not a concept.\nOf course, there will be objections such as a perceived threat\nto the integrity of the marital union and the possibility of\nmisuse of the penal provisions. It is not really true that the\nprivate or domestic domain has always been outside the\npurview of law. The law against domestic violence already\ncovers both physical and sexual abuse as grounds for the legal\nsystem to intervene. It is difficult to argue that a complaint of\nmarital rape will ruin a marriage, while a complaint of domestic\nviolence against a spouse will not. It has long been time to\njettison the notion of &#x27;implied consent&#x27; in marriage. The law\nmust uphold the bodily autonomy of all women, irrespective of\ntheir marital status.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_336\">130.7        Way back in the 1800s, almost around 125 years\nback, there was a situation that brought forth to the law\nmakers.     A girl aged 11 years was brutally raped by her 35\nyear old husband. The then colonial government proposed to\namend the age of consent for a girl from 10 to 12 years, yet,\nthis idea was criticized at large but only after much acrimony\nand argument, the same was amended in 1891. In the words\nof Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, &quot;realizing depth of the degradation to\nwhich the so-called leaders of the peoples had fallen.... could\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_411\">                            Page 147 of 150</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_412\">     R/CR.MA/26957/2017                                  CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nany sane man, could any man, with a sense of shame, oppose\nso simple a measure? But it was opposed...&quot; Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\nreferred to the idea of necessity in the law that has been\nneeded since then. I wonder how               Dr. B.R. Ambedkar would\nhave seen the present day scenario when no one is willing to\neven discuss to reform the criminalization of marital rape. A\nlaw that does not give married and unmarried women equal\nprotection creates conditions that lead to the marital rape. It\nallows the men and women to believe that wife rape is\nacceptable. Making wife rape illegal or an offence will remove\nthe destructive attitudes that promote the marital rape. Such\nan action raises a moral boundary that informs the society that\na punishment results if the boundary is transgressed. The\nHusbands may then begin to recognize that marital rape is\nwrong. Recognition coupled with the criminal punishment\nshould deter the husbands from raping their wives. Women\nshould not have to tolerate rape and violence in the marriage.\nThe total statutory abolition of the marital rape exemption is\nthe first necessary step in teaching societies that dehumanized\ntreatment of women will not be tolerated and that the marital\nrape is not a husband&#x27;s privilege, but rather a violent act and\nan injustice that must be criminalized.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_337\">131.
