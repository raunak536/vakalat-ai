According to petitioner, even before the nomination of the 4th\n\nrespondent was accepted, he has come to know that 4th respondent is\n\nhaving four children, as such he has submitted a representation on\n\n21.11.2020 to the Returning Officer informing about 4th respondent\n\nhaving four children and requesting to verify the said fact and to\n\ndisqualify 4th respondent. Petitioner also submitted the details of four\n\nchildren of 4th respondent along with their birth certificates.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">      6.     The Returning Officer-3rd respondent has taken the written\n\nstatement    of    4th   respondent.   In   the   said   written   statement,\n\n4th respondent denied that he has four children and given the particulars\n\nof his children.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">      7.     According to 4th respondent, Derangula Sai Chandana is not\n\nhis daughter and is his brother&#x27;s daughter and submitted birth\n\ncertificate and her details.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">      8.     Third respondent rejected the objection raised by petitioner\n\ngiving benefit of doubt to 4th respondent and accepted his nomination.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">      9.     According to petitioner, the statement of 4th respondent\n\nabout his children is blatant lie. According to petitioner the particular of\n\nbirth certificates obtained by him and birth certificates submitted by 4th\n\nrespondent are totally different. According to the Registrar of Birth and\n\nDeaths, the Birth Certificate No. 200607014874 digitally signed on\n\n23.2.2016 submitted by the petitioner is genuine and certificate No.\n\n200707021863 digitally signed on 29.10.2020 submitted by the 4th\n\nrespondent is not available in records.      According to petitioner, this\n\nclearly demonstrates that 4th child Derangula Sai Chandana was born on\n\n10.7.2006 to 4th respondent and his wife D Vasantha and that her birth\n\nis registered at Serial No. 547 with date of Registration as 11.2.2006 and\n\nthat she was born in Vijay Marie Hospital, Khairtabad.        Further, the\n\nbirth certificate submitted by 4th respondent to the Returning Officer is\n\nalso declared as false and not found in the records by the very same\n\nMedical Officer. It is thus contended that 4th respondent has submitted\n\nfalse particulars to the Returning Officer and played fraud on the\n\nElection Authorities as well as Electorate. It is further submitted that in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       6</span>\n\n\nso far as the other children are concerned, their birth certificates are also\n\nmanipulated and the same are submitted with false dates. As per the\n\noriginal birth certificates, the first child Anil was born on 9.8.2001 in\n\nVijay Krishna Nursing Home and second and third children Ramu and\n\nLaxman were born on 12.1.2003 in St Theresa&#x27;s Hospital, whereas 4th\n\nrespondent has submitted the birth certificate of the said children as\n\nthough Anil was born in Nilofer Hospital on 9.8.2000 and Ramu and\n\nLaxman born on 15.8.2003 in Area Hospital, Vanasthalipuram.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">         10.   Challenging the election of 4th respondent on the ground that\n\nhe has four children, petitioner filed Election O.P. No. 1 of 2021 in the\n\nCity Civil Court, Hyderabad.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">         11.   In the said Election O.P., petitioner filed I A NO. 3763 of\n\n2021 to summon the original records of the documents mentioned\n\ntherein. He has filed I A No. 3479 of 2022 to direct 4th respondent, his\n\nwife and brother of 4th respondent to summon Derangula Sai Chandana\n\nfor the purpose of conducting DNA test to determine parenthood of the\n\nchild.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">         12.   The Election Tribunal by order dated 2.12.2021 dismissed\n\nI.A.No.3763 of 2021. By order dated 10.12.2022 the Election Tribunal\n\ndisposed of I A No. 3479 of 2022 directing summoning of records from\n\nVijay Mary Hospital, Khairtabad and Nilofer Hospital, Hyderabad with\n\nrespect to details of birth of Derangula Sai Chandana but rejected plea to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        7</span>\n\n\nsummon Derangula Sai Chandana to take blood samples to conduct\n\nDNA test to determine parenthood of the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">       13.    According to learned counsel Sri Mahit Reddy for 4th\n\nrespondent, Kumari Derangula Sai Chandana is not the daughter of 4th\n\nrespondent but daughter of D.Ramesh and D.Lavanya, 4th respondent\n\nbrother and sister-in-law.     The petitioner is prosecuting a vexatious\n\nlitigation and by filing application after application protracting the\n\nlitigation.   He would contend that after completion of recording of\n\nevidence by both parties and when matter was coming for oral\n\narguments, petitioner filed I A No. 3479 of 2022.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">       14.    He would submit that I A No. 3479 of 2022 was filed to\n\nsubject Derangula Sai Chandana for DNA test.            When the Election\n\nTribunal refused to grant the said relief, it went beyond the prayer to\n\ndirect production of birth records from two hospitals.        It is further\n\ncontended that this order is contrary to the order passed in I A Nos.\n\n3762, 3763 and 3764 of 2022, and said order acts as res-judicata.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">       15.    He would submit that it is settled principle of law that in an\n\nelection dispute a child can not be subjected to DNA profile and it offends\n\nthe child&#x27;s right to privacy and right to be silent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">       16.    He would submit that documents marked as Ex.A6 to A.18\n\nare already obtained under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">Right to Information Act</a> and the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       8</span>\n\n\nare admissible in evidence and there is no requirement to obtain certified\n\ncopies. Learned counsel for the 4th respondent placed reliance on the\n\nfollowing decisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169684843\" id=\"span_7\"><a href=\"/doc/169684843/\" id=\"a_11\">i) Ashok Kumar Vs Raj Gupta</a> and others1;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170697\" id=\"span_8\"><a href=\"/doc/170697/\" id=\"a_12\">ii) Bachhaj Nahar vs. Nilima Mandal</a> and another2;</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"62123684\" id=\"span_9\"><a href=\"/doc/62123684/\" id=\"a_13\">iii) Aparna Ajinkya Firoda Vs Ajinkya Arun Firodia3</a>.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">       17.     Per contra, according to learned counsel Sri Peri Prabhakar\n\nfor petitioner, the Election Tribunal grossly erred in not ordering DNA\n\nprofile on Derangula Sai Chandana. According to learned counsel the\n\ndocuments secured by petitioner clearly point out that Derangula Sai\n\nChandana is daughter of 4th respondent. If only the Tribunal ordered\n\nDNA profile of Derangula Sai Chandana entire controversy could have\n\nbeen resolved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">       18.     As the birth records produced by petitioner secured under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_14\">Right to Information Act</a> are not tallying with the bogus records filed by\n\nthe 4th respondent, the Tribunal grossly erred in not summoning the\n\nrecords sought to be produced by the petitioner.       Production of said\n\nrecord would help in going to the crux of the issue and in the interest of\n\njustice the record ought to have been called.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">1</span>\n  (2022) 1 SCC 20\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">2</span>\n   (2008) 17 SCC 491\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">3</span>\n  2023 SCC OnLine SC 161\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                           9</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">        19.

Mere\n\npreponderance of probabilities are not enough, as may be the case in a\n\ncivil dispute. Allegations should be clear and precise and charge should\n\nbe proved to the hilt as in a criminal trial by clear, cogent and credible\n\nevidence.         In SANTOSH YADAV, Supreme Court summarized the\n\nprinciples on improper acceptance of nominations. It is held that case\n\nhas to be made out by raising specific pleadings setting out all material\n\nfacts and adducing cogent evidence so as to enable a clear finding being\n\narrived at.             The burden of proving such material facts has to be\n\ndischarged by the election petitioner by adducing positive, satisfactory\n\nand cogent evidence. If petitioner is unable to adduce such evidence the\n\nburden is not discharged and the election must stand.           Difficulty of\n\nproof cannot obviate the need of strict proof or relax the rigour of\n\nrequired proof. The burden of proof placed on the election petitioner is\n\nvery strict and so difficult to discharge as nearing almost impossibility.\n\nThere is no room for any guesswork, speculation, surmises or\n\nconjectures i.e., acting on a mere possibility.      The law requires proof.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">9</span>\n    (2002) 1 SCC 160\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">10</span>\n     AIR 2009 SC 1045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                               11</span>\n\n\nHow far that proof should go or what it should contain is not provided by\n\nthe legislature.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">          22.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80510634\" id=\"span_28\">In <a href=\"/doc/80510634/\" id=\"a_20\">B.RAVI YADAV Vs CHERKULA UDAY KUMAR AND\n\nOTHERS11, Division Bench</a> of this Court held as under:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">         &quot;......To prove the charge of corrupt practice a mere preponderance of\n         probabilities would not be enough.

The charge shall have to be\n         proved to the hilt, the standard of proof being the same as in a criminal\n         trial. It is further held by the Apex Court that the success of a candidate\n         who has won at an election should not be lightly interfered with.        Any\n         petition    seeking   such   interference   must strictly conform to the\n         requirements of the law. Though the purity of the election process has to be\n         safeguarded and the Court shall be vigilant to see that people do not get\n         elected by flagrant breaches of law or by committing corrupt practices, the\n         setting aside of an election involves serious consequences not only for\n         the returned candidate and the constituency, but also for the public at\n         large   inasmuch as   re-election involves an enormous load on the public\n         funds and administration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">          23.

It is further held that &quot;We have also elaborated how\n\nthe compulsory administration of any of these techniques is an\n\nunjustified intrusion into the mental privacy of an individual. It would\n\nalso amount to &quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&quot; with regard to\n\nthe language of evolving international human rights norms.&quot; (para 263).\n\nIt is further held that &quot;no individual should be forcibly subjected to any\n\nof the techniques in question, whether in the contest of investigation in\n\ncriminal cases or otherwise.

Right to privacy is implicit in right to life   and liberty as\n\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

Similarly, in personal law concerning relationship of\n\nhusband and wife and the children born to such wedlock, the right to\n\nprivacy is invaded to ascertain whether the marriage was consumed\n\nproperly, whether the spouses to the marriage are suitable to live\n\ntogether or suffering from any disease which disentitles them to live as\n\nhusband and wife. In matters where a marriage is sought to be nullified\n\nalso it may be necessary to ascertain the health of one of the spouses of\n\nthe marriage etc.   To ascertain the birth of a child to the couple, DNA\n\ntest can be ordered. Similarly, when it comes to the custody of a child,\n\nthe mental condition of the spouse is also necessarily to be ascertained\n\nbefore Court orders the custody of the child to one of the parents. In all\n\nsuch circumstances, subjecting a person to medical examination does\n\nnot amount to violating right of privacy.

Mere      preponderance         of     probabilities     or\n\npresumptions cannot be the basis to challenge an election.

In view of the above\n\nproposition of law on the subject, the burden lies on the petitioner to\n\nmake specific allegations and lead evidence in support of said\n\nallegations.

It is held that such tests impinge upon the right of privacy of an\n\nindividual and could also have major societal repercussions.                      Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_40\">&quot;13. The presumption of legitimacy of a child can only be displaced by\n     strong preponderance of evidence, and not merely by balance of\n     probabilities. The material portion of the Court&#x27;s opinion is produced\n     hereinbelow : (Kamti Devi case [<a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_28\">Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram</a>, (2001) 5 SCC 311 :</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     2001 SCC (Cri) 892] , SCC p. 316, para 11)\n               &quot;11. ... But at the same time the test of preponderance of\n           probability is too light as that might expose many children to the peril\n           of being illegitimatised. If a court declares that the husband is not the\n           father of his wife&#x27;s child, without tracing out its real father the fallout\n           on the child is ruinous apart from all the ignominy visiting his mother.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">           The bastardised child, when grows up would be socially ostracised\n           and can easily fall into wayward life. Hence, by way of abundant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                            16</span>\n\n            caution and as a matter of public policy, law cannot afford to allow\n            such consequence befalling an innocent child on the strength of a\n            mere tilting of probability. Its corollary is that the burden of the\n            plaintiff husband should be higher than the standard of\n            preponderance of probabilities. The standard of proof in such cases\n            must at least be of a degree in between the two as to ensure that there\n            was no possibility of the child being conceived through the plaintiff\n            husband.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">        14. It was also the view of the Court that the normal rule of evidence is\n    that the burden is on the party that asserts the positive. But in instances\n    where that is challenged, the burden is shifted to the party, that pleads the\n    negative. Keeping in mind the issue of burden of proof, it would be safe to\n    conclude that in a case like the present, the court&#x27;s decision should be\n    rendered only after balancing the interests of the parties i.e. the quest for\n    truth, and the social and cultural implications involved therein. The\n    possibility of stigmatising a person as a bastard, the ignominy that attaches\n    to an adult who, in the mature years of his life is shown to be not the\n    biological son of his parents may not only be a heavy cross to bear but\n    would also intrude upon his right of privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">         15. DNA is unique to an individual (barring twins) and can be used to\n    identify a person&#x27;s identity, trace familial linkages or even reveal sensitive\n    health information. Whether a person can be compelled to provide a sample\n    for DNA in such matters can also be answered considering the test of\n    proportionality <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_29\">laid down in</a> the unanimous decision of this Court in K.S.\n    Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5 J.) v. Union of India [K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5\n    J.) v. Union of India, (2019) 1 SCC 1] , wherein the right to privacy has been\n    declared a constitutionally protected right in India. The Court should\n    therefore examine the proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued\n    i.e. whether the same are not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may\n    have an adverse impact on the person and that they justify the\n    encroachment upon the privacy and personal autonomy of the person, being\n    subjected to the DNA test.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n      28.2. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"62123684\" id=\"span_42\">In <a href=\"/doc/62123684/\" id=\"a_30\">Aparna Ajinkya Firoda</a> (supra) the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt extensively considered the right to privacy and the rights of the\n\nchildren.     In paragraph 60, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court culled out the\n\nprinciples governing DNA test. It reads:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;60. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, the following principles\n    could be culled out as to the circumstances under which a DNA test of a\n    minor child may be directed to be conducted:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      i. That a DNA test of a minor child is not to be ordered routinely, in\n          matrimonial disputes. Proof by way of DNA profiling is to be directed\n          in matrimonial disputes involving allegations of infidelity, only in\n          matters where there is no other mode of proving such assertions.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                            17</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      ii. DNA tests of children born during the subsistence of a valid marriage\n           may be directed, only when there is sufficient prima-facie material to\n           dislodge the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n           Further, if no plea has been raised as to non-access, in order to rebut\n           the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, a DNA test\n           may not be directed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      iii. A Court would not be justified in mechanically directing a DNA test of\n           a child, in a case where the paternity of a child is not directly in issue,\n           but is merely collateral to the proceeding.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      iv. Merely because either of the parties have disputed a factum of\n          paternity, it does not mean that the Court should direct DNA test or\n          such other test to resolve the controversy. The parties should be\n          directed to lead evidence to prove or disprove the factum of paternity\n          and only if the Court finds it impossible to draw an inference based on\n          such evidence, or the controversy in issue cannot be resolved without\n          DNA test, it may direct DNA test and not otherwise. In other words,\n          only in exceptional and deserving cases, where such a test becomes\n          indispensable to resolve the controversy the Court can direct such\n          test.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      v. While directing DNA tests as a means to prove adultery, the Court is to\n          be mindful of the consequences thereof on the children born out of\n          adultery, including inheritance-related consequences, social stigma,\n          etc.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">     28.3. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court discussed on the child rights.\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">            &quot;66. In 1989, the United Nations Organisation drew up the\n    Convention on Rights of Child with a view to provide special protection to\n    children, proclaiming that &quot;childhood is entitled to special care and\n    assistance.&quot; The Declaration, inter-alia, recognises that a child, for full and\n    harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a\n    family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and\n    understanding. The Declaration further emphasises the importance of\n    family, as the &quot;fundamental group of society and the natural environment for\n    the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">        69. The concept of privacy for a child may not be equivalent to that of an\n    adult. However, the evolving capacity of children has been recognised and\n    the Convention acknowledges the control that individuals, including\n    children, have over their own personal boundaries and the means by which\n    they define who they are in relation to other people. Children are not to be\n    deprived of this entitlement to influence and understand their sense of self\n    simply by virtue of being children. Further, <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 8</a> of the Convention\n    provides children with an express right to preserve their identity. Details of\n    parentage are an attribute of a child&#x27;s identity. Therefore, long-accepted\n    notions about a child&#x27;s parentage must not be frivolously challenged before\n    Courts of Law.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                           18</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n     Best interests of a child:\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_66\">        70. The phrase &quot;mankind owes to the child the best it has to give&quot; clearly\n     underlines our duties towards children, and it entitles them to the best that\n     mankind can give. This implies that the interest of the child should be given\n     primary consideration in actions involving children.&quot;\n\n\n\n      28.4. In Narayan Dutt Tiwari (supra),                Rohit Shekhar sought\n\ndeclaration that he is biological son of N.D.Tiwari and sought\n\ndeclaration. He filed I.A. under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 to subject\n\nN.D.Tiwari to DNA test to determine parentage.                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82359779\" id=\"span_45\">In <a href=\"/doc/82359779/\" id=\"a_34\">Immadabathuni\n\nNagendramma</a> (supra) the petitioners contended that Veeranjaneyulu\n\nfalsely claimed himself as Kathi David Raju and secured caste certificate.\n\nDuring criminal investigation petition was filed to subject him to DNA\n\ntest to establish their blood relationship. It is seen that in peculiar facts\n\nof those cases, DNA test was ordered.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">      29.       In the instant case, child is not a party to the Election O.P.\n\nTherefore, the child can not be compelled to undergo DNA profile to\n\nascertain her parents to decide the Election O.P. The child has a right to\n\nbe silent. No one can be compelled to give up the right to privacy against\n\nthe will of the child. The case on hand does not fall into the exceptions\n\ncarved out from the normal principle on right to privacy, more\n\nparticularly, when the child is not the person elected and is a stranger to\n\nthe issue of earning disqualification by an elected candidate. A wrong\n\ndeclaration and a resultant disqualification relates to the 4th respondent.\n\nThe child is no way concerned. She is a stranger to the election dispute.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                     19</span>\n\n\nThus, she cannot be compelled to undergo medical examination against\n\nher will.    Certainly subjecting the child to medical examination would\n\noffend her personal liberty, privacy and dignity of person         that is\n\nbestowed on a girl child. There can be myriad reasons where the girl\n\nchild would genuinely wish to keep the issue of her parenthood a secret.\n\nMoreover, she being a child, she can not give her consent for such tests\n\nand affecting her privacy, her parents can not subject her to DNA test.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">      30.    Further by virtue of subjecting the child to medical\n\nexamination at the     instance of the petitioner in election petition, the\n\nfactum of her parents would be in public domain and would be against\n\nthe   conscience and will of the person concerned and            can have\n\ndeleterious effect which cannot be repaired. The consequence of such\n\nmedical examination can be far and wide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">      31.    I am therefore of the opinion that the Election Tribunal has\n\nrightly rejected the plea.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">ISSUE No. 2:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">      32.    In I A No. 3479 of 2022 the petitioner only prayed to subject\n\nDerangula Sai Chandana for DNA profile. The Election Tribunal was not\n\npersuaded to grant the said relief. That being so, the I A is liable to be\n\ndismissed.    But strangely,    the Election Tribunal observes that the\n\npetitioner ought to have asked for calling of records from Nilofer Hospital\n\nand Vijaya Mary Hospital instead of DNA test and then issues direction\n\nto the petitioner to summon records from Vijaya Mary Hospital,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                  20</span>\n\n\nKhairtabad and Nilofer Hospital, Hyderabad with respect to birth details\n\nof Derangula Sai Chandana. This direction of the Election Tribunal is in\n\nexcess of jurisdiction.           The Election Tribunal can not go beyond the\n\nprayer sought in the Interlocutory Application and grant a relief never\n\nsought by the petitioner. Further, as there was no relief sought, there\n\nwas no occasion for the 4th respondent to contest the said aspect. Thus,\n\nthe order to that extent is not sustainable. It is accordingly set aside.\n\nThe Issue No.2 is answered accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">\nISSUE No.3:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">          33.      At the time of recording petitioner&#x27;s evidence Exhibits A 6 to\n\nA 18 were marked.                Those exhibits were obtained under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_35\">Right to\n\nInformation Act</a>.            The Election Tribunal noticed     that the Deputy\n\nCommissioner, GHMC filed an affidavit stating that all the relevant\n\ndocuments sought to be produced were already obtained and are already\n\nmarked. Since said assertion is on oath, the Election Tribunal observed\n\nthat no purpose would be served in calling for the documents.                The\n\nElection Tribunal noticed the decision of this court in Datti Kameswari\n\nVs singan Rao Sarath Chandra15 where it is held that Xerox copies\n\ncertified by the designated Public Information Officer under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_36\">Right to\n\nInformation Act</a> are not certified copies within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 65</a>\n\nof the Evidence Act. Having regard to this view, the Election Tribunal\n\nobserved that petitioner has not filed petition under <a href=\"/doc/178462232/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 65 (a) (b)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/73003394/\" id=\"a_39\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">15</span></a>\n     2015 SCC OnLine Hyd 389= (2016) 1 ALT 700\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                        21</span>\n\n\n(c ) of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_40\">Indian Evidence Act</a> seeking to mark the documents obtained\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_41\">Right to Information Act</a> as secondary evidence.           The Election\n\nTribunal also observed that the petitioner had ample time to secure\n\ncertified copies of the documents now sought to be summoned to prove\n\ngenuineness of Exs.A.6 to A.18.             For the aforesaid reasons, the\n\napplication was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">      34.      Having regard to the facts of this case, I do not see any error\n\nin the opinion expressed by the Election Tribunal and its decision not to\n\nsummon the records sought by the petitioner.          The issue is answered\n\naccordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">      35.      In the result, C.R.P.
