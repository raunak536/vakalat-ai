The 2 nd\n\npetitioner is an unfortunate mother who conceived the 1st\n\npetitioner while she was a minor under a mysterious\n\ncircumstance by an unidentified person. This writ petition is\n\nfiled by the petitioners to expunge and remove the father&#x27;s\n\nname from the birth register maintained by the office of the\n\n1st respondent with respect to the 1st petitioner and issue a\n\ncertificate showing the mother&#x27;s name only as a single parent.\n\nA child of an unwed mother is also a citizen of our country,\n\nand nobody can infringe any of his/her fundamental rights,\n\nwhich are guaranteed in our Constitution.

The children of unwed mothers and the children of\n\nraped victim can also live in this country with the fundamental\n\nrights of privacy, liberty, and dignity. None can intrude into\n\ntheir personal life, and if it happens, the constitutional Court\n\nof this country will protect their fundamental rights. The Apex\n\nCourt has held that a woman&#x27;s reproductive choice is a\n\nfundamental right and compassed the same under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_2\">Suchita Srivastava and\n\nAnother v.

The\n\n           crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to\n\n           privacy,   dignity,   and     bodily   integrity   should   be\n\n           respected.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28938556\" id=\"span_6\">2.

The Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_7\">K.S. Puttuswamy v. Union of\n\nIndia</a> [2017 (4) KLT 1], observed like this:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          &quot;To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of the\n          Constitution defined their vision of the society in which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> W.P.(C).No.4262/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                        6</span>\n\n\n\n          constitutional values would be attained by emphasising,\n          among    other    freedoms,       liberty   and   dignity.   So\n          fundamental is dignity that it permeates the core of the\n          rights guaranteed to the individual by Part III. Dignity is\n          the core which unites the fundamental rights because the\n          fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the\n          dignity of existence. Privacy with its attendant values\n          assures dignity to the individual and it is only when life\n          can been enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true\n          substance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity and is\n          a core value which the protection of life and liberty is\n          intended to achieve.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     4.      In the light of the above decisions, the facts of the\n\npresent case are to be considered. To keep the anonymity of\n\nthe son and the mother, who are the petitioners in this writ\n\npetition, the 1st petitioner son is referred to as &quot;X&quot; and the 2 nd\n\npetitioner mother is referred to as &quot;Y&quot;. The name of the father\n\nof the 1st petitioner is given differently in three different\n\ndocuments, and therefore, the father&#x27;s name is referred as\n\n&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;Z1&quot; and &quot;Z2&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">     5.      The    1st    petitioner       was   conceived     by     the   2 nd\n\npetitioner, the mother of the 1st petitioner, while she was a\n\nminor under mysterious circumstance by an unidentified\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> W.P.(C).No.4262/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                7</span>\n\n\n\nperson. Therefore the father&#x27;s name of the 1st petitioner\n\nhappened to be recorded differently in different documents.\n\nThe name of the mother of the 1 st petitioner is correctly\n\nrecorded in all identification and education certificates. In the\n\nbirth registration certificate of the 1st petitioner before the\n\nRegistrar of Births and Deaths, Pathanamthitta, the father&#x27;s\n\nname is recorded as &quot;Z&quot;. Ext.P1 is the copy of the birth\n\ncertificate. In the Secondary School Leaving Certificate\n\n(SSLC), the name of the father of the 1 st petitioner is\n\nrecorded    as   &quot;Z1&quot;.   Ext.P1(2)    is   the   copy   of   the\n\ncertificate(SSLC). In the Higher Secondary Examination (HSE)\n\nCertificate, the parents&#x27; names are not recorded on the face.\n\nExt.P1(3) is the copy of the HSE certificate. In the Election ID,\n\nmother&#x27;s name is recorded on the face. Ext.P1(4) is the copy\n\nof the Election ID card of the 1 st petitioner. In AADHAR card,\n\nname of the father of the 1st petitioner is recorded as &quot;Z2&quot;.\n\nExt.P1(5) is the copy of the AADHAR card. In the driving\n\nlicence, the name of the mother alone is recorded on the\n\nface. Ext.P1(6) is the copy of the driving licence of the 1 st\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> W.P.(C).No.4262/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                               8</span>\n\n\n\npetitioner. In the card showing the Permanent Account\n\nNumber (PAN), name of the mother, &quot;Y&quot; alone is recorded on\n\nthe face. In the Passport, the name of the father is recorded\n\nas &quot;Z3&quot;. The same is produced as Ext.P1(8).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">     6.   Since the paternal name of the 1st petitioner\n\nappears differently in different documents and the name is\n\nuncertain, the petitioner did not want the father&#x27;s name to be\n\nrecorded in any of the documents and certificates. Hence the\n\n1st petitioner sent a request to the 1 st respondent as well as\n\nrespondents 2 to 8 requesting to delete the name of the\n\nfather of the petitioner appears in all identity certificates,\n\nrecords, and databases concerning the 1 st petitioner and after\n\ndeleting the name of the father, to issue new corrected\n\nidentity cards and certificates. Ext.P1 is the request submitted\n\nby the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162566950\" id=\"span_15\">7.

The State of Kerala framed\n\nRules as per the Act, which enables such correction and\n\ndeletion of errors that are wrongly or improperly made.\n\nMoreover, the Government of India, as per Ext.P3 letter,\n\ncirculated to all Chief Registrar of Births and Deaths in the\n\ncountry directing that the name of the single parent will be\n\nwritten in the birth record, and the name of the other parent\n\nmust be left blank if such requests are made. This letter was\n\nissued in the light of the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/162566950/\" id=\"a_10\">ABC\n\nv. State (NCT of Delhi</a>) [2015 (10) SCC 1]. In the light of\n\nthe law declared by the Apex Court and clarified by the\n\ndirection in Ext.P3, it is the case of the petitioner that the 1 st\n\nrespondent is bound to expunge the name of the father from\n\nthe Birth Register and based on which the other respondents\n\nare also bound to correct the records in tune with the same.\n\nHence this writ petition is filed with following prayers:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           A.

Therefore, on a combined reading of Section 15 of the\n\nAct 1969 and Rule 11 of the Rules 1999, it is clear that a\n\ncorrection of an entry in the Register of Births and Deaths is\n\npossible in certain circumstances mentioned in it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162566950\" id=\"span_30\">13. The Apex Court in             <a href=\"/doc/162566950/\" id=\"a_23\">ABC</a>&#x27;s case (supra) also\n\nconsidered a similar issue. The apex court was considering\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> W.P.(C).No.4262/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                   15</span>\n\n\n\nthe legal conundrum as to whether it is imperative for an\n\nunwed mother to specifically notify that the putative father of\n\nthe child to whom she has given birth to in her petition for\n\nappointment as the guardian of her child. The Apex Court\n\ndiscussed the matter in paragraph 19 of the above judgment\n\nand the same is extracted hereunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">       &quot;We are greatly perturbed by the fact that the Appellant\n       has not obtained a Birth Certificate for her son who is\n       nearly five years old. This is bound to create problems for\n       the child in the future. In this regard, the Appellant has\n       not sought any relief either before us or before any of the\n       Courts below. It is a misplaced assumption in the law as\n       it is presently perceived that the issuance of a Birth\n       Certificate would be a logical corollary to the Appellant\n       succeeding in her guardianship petition. It may be\n       recalled that owing to curial fiat, it is no longer necessary\n       to state the name of the father in applications seeking\n       admission of children to school, as well as for obtaining a\n       passport for a minor child. However, in both these cases,\n       it may still remain necessary to furnish a Birth Certificate.\n       The law is dynamic and is expected to diligently keep\n       pace with time and the legal conundrums and enigmas it\n       presents. There is no gainsaying that the identity of the\n       mother is never in doubt. Accordingly, we direct that if a\n       single parent/unwed mother applies for the issuance of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> W.P.(C).No.4262/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                   16</span>\n\n\n\n       Birth Certificate for a child born from her womb, the\n       Authorities concerned may only require her to furnish an\n       affidavit to this effect, and must thereupon issue the Birth\n       Certificate, unless there is a Court direction to the\n       contrary. Trite though it is, yet we emphasize that it is the\n       responsibility of the State to ensure that no citizen suffers\n       any inconvenience or disadvantage merely because the\n       parents fail or neglect to register the birth. Nay, it is the\n       duty of the State to take requisite steps for recording\n       every birth of every citizen. To remove any possible\n       doubt, the direction pertaining to issuance of the Birth\n       Certificate   is   intendedly    not    restricted    to    the\n       circumstances or the parties before us.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123666059\" id=\"span_35\">14.
