Mr. I.Subramanian, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners,\n\n                      at the outset, drew the attention of this Court to the complaint lodged by the\n\n                      respondent before the court below, wherein it is averred that defamatory and\n\n                      derogatory statement with caption have been made against Mr.Senthil Balaji, the\n\n                      then Minister for Transport, Government of Tamil Nadu. It is the contention of\n\n                      the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that the publications, which is\n\n                      alleged to be defamatory and derogatory in character against the Minister for\n\n                      Transport, in no way could be termed as defamation or derogation to the\n\n                      particular authority.

In view of the above, on the issuance of\n\n                      the above Government Orders, the respondent preferred the complaint before\n\n                      the learned Principal Sessions Judge, Chennai, which was taken on file.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                             9.

One of the main contention raised in\n\n                      the said case relates to &#x27;Reasonable Restriction&#x27; found in <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19 (1)</a> of the\n\n                      Constitution and in that context, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court held as under :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                    “130. The principles as regards reasonable restriction as has\n                                 been stated by this Court from time to time are that the\n                                 restriction should not be excessive and in public interest. The\n                                 legislation should not invade the rights and should not smack of\n                                 arbitrariness. The test of reasonableness cannot be determined\n                                 by laying down any abstract standard or general pattern.

The “impact\n                              doctrine” or the principle of “inevitable effect” or “inevitable\n                              consequence” stands in contradistinction to abuse or misuse of a\n                              legislation or a statutory provision depending upon the\n                              circumstances of the case.

The nature\n                              of social control which includes public interest has a role.

As the submissions would show, the stress is given on the\n                              right to freedom of speech and expression in the context of\n                              individual growth, progress of democracy, conceptual respect for\n                              a voice of dissent, tolerance for discordant note and acceptance\n                              of different voices. Right to say what may displease or annoy\n                              others cannot be throttled or garrotted. There can never be any\n                              cavil over the fact that the right to freedom of speech and\n                              expression is a right that has to get ascendance in a democratic\n                              body polity, but at the same time the limit has to be\n                              proportionate and not unlimited. It is urged that the defamation\n                              has been described as an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 499</a> IPC that\n                              protects an individual&#x27;s perception of his own reputation which\n                              cannot be elevated to have the status of public interest.

This is for the reason that once a matter\n                              becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n                              subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\n                              press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion\n                              that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must\n                              be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a\n                              sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not\n                              further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the\n                              incident being publicised in press/media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">                                 (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above —\n                              indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the\n                              case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n                              matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available\n                              with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge\n                              of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is\n                              based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the\n                              official establishes that the publication was made (by the\n                              defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n                              would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or\n                              media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of\n                              the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has\n                              written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be\n                              false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n                              defendant would have no defence and would be liable for\n                              damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the\n                              discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                      14/21</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                               ___________________\n                                                                                   Crl.

To be more\n\n                      precise, what had happened in the meeting, as divulged by the officials, who took\n\n                      part in the meeting, has been published and no castigating or derogatory\n\n                      remarks, maligning the public office of the Minister of Transport has been carried\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                      15/21</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                         ___________________\n                                                                             Crl.

As has been time and again held by the\n\n                      Apex Court, it is not necessary for the Press/Media to ascertain the truthfulness\n\n                      or the veracity of the statements made. However, in the present case, the\n\n                      statements have been made by the higher officials of the Government/Transport\n\n                      Corporations. Further, a careful analysis of what has been published in the print\n\n                      media shows that what transpired in the meeting has been taken to print and this\n\n                      in no way could be imputed as defamatory statements against the office of the\n\n                      said individual or tarnishing the name of the individual. <a href=\"/doc/822867/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 199 (2)</a> Cr.P.C.\n\n                      clearly and unequivocally mandates that the Sessions Court can take cognizance\n\n                      of the complaint by the Public Prosecutor, on appropriate sanction, only when\n\n                      such defamatory statements are made about the conduct of the individual in the\n\n                      discharge of his/her public functions.

Rather, it is clear not only from a reading of the news item published\n\n                      by the petitioners, but also the extracted portion of the complaint, which was in\n\n                      culmination of the sanction orders, that no defamatory or derogatory statement,\n\n                      much less, statements tarnishing the public functions of the authority has been\n\n                      made.
