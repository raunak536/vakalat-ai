He added further that\n     the Government has moved the &quot;Judicial Standards and Accountability\n     Bill&quot;, to provide for a comprehensive mechanism for handling complaints\n     against judges.

Appellant stated that he wants working-sheets on action taken on his\n     representation based on his grievances, and claimed that complete working-\n     sheets   can    be   provided   as   held    by   the   CIC   in   case   file   No.\n     CIC/BS/A/2014/001442.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">  14.On point No. 2, 3 &amp; 4 the CPIO said representation dated 06.05.2013 was\n     forwarded to PPS of the Chief Justice to India for appropriate action in the\n     matter. CPIO explained that the Government does not monitor action taken\n     on them. On point No. 5 &amp; 6, CPIO said no information is available with\n     them, and that the department has no information with respect to internal\n     working of Supreme Court. On point No. 8, the CPIO said that names of\n     former Chief Justice of India against whom complaints are received, were\n     forwarded forthwith as it is to the office of Chief Justice of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">  15. He also stated that disclosure of name of former Chief Justice of India\n     against whom complaints are filed will be improper, and might have serious\n     repercussions as it might become a subject of discussion in media. He said\n\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                           Page 5\n      that at most they can provide number of complaints received and\n     forwarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">  16.The CPIO explained that they cannot disclose the names of judges to ensure\n     media interventions. He said all sorts of complaints have been filed by\n     several people including some of dissatisfied litigants. Such complaints are\n     sent to the concerned PPS to the Chief Justice of Supreme Court and High\n     Courts   respectively.   They   maintain   only   forwarding   letters   of    such\n     complaints, as the complaints run into numerous pages and they are not in a\n     position to maintain record of whole complaint. Giving point-wise replies, Mr.\n     K.C. Thang, CPIO of Union Ministry of Law and Justice, on 5th March 2014\n     stated that representation dated 06.05.2013 of Dr. M. Furquan against Shri\n     Justice Altamas Kabir was forwarded to PPS to Chief Justice of India on\n     27.6.2013 for appropriate action.      The CPIO stated that the complaints\n     received against serving/retired judges of the Supreme Court and High\n     Courts are also forwarded to the Supreme Court and concerned High Courts\n     for action and as originals were forwarded, they do not have those copies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">  17.Appellant wanted copies of all documents regarding complaints against\n     Justice Altmas Kabir from any division of Union Law Ministry, if forwarded.\n     He sought names of other former CJI&#x27;s, against whom complaints were\n     lodged and outcome of probe on such complaints if any. He contended that\n     the CPIO should have given him the copies of forwarding letters of complaint\n     against former CJI Justice Altamas Kabir which forms part of &#x27;information&#x27;\n     under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">RTI Act</a>. He said that the PMO and Lok Sabha Secretariat had provided\n     such copies of complaint against former CJI. He should have given at least\n     number of complaints and number of judges against whom complaints were\n     made. He said that he was not asking for copies of the complaints.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">  18.The CPIO explained about limitations of their Ministry in order to respect the\n     independence of judiciary, in giving this huge information.      He said if they\n     provided forwarding-letters, or names of former CJI or former/retired judges\n     against whom complaints were made, or their number, it would immediately\n     land in the hands of the media to hit headlines. He was also apprehensive of\n\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                            Page 6\n      increased number of harassing RTI requests if such disclosures are allowed.\n     The    CPIO      asked:      why      the    contents       of     complaints       which     were      not\n     substantiated should be disclosed?                   If dissatisfied litigants file all sorts of\n     complaints, others might seek under RTI their copies, names of judges and\n     contents that might be discussed in public with far reaching consequences\n     like demoralizing the judges.               He also said that Union Ministry of Law and\n     Justice has no authority to take action, or ask Supreme Court to take action\n     on news-reports, complaints and representations like those mentioned in this\n     RTI application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">  19.The CPIO has not given copies of forwarding letters, names of ex CJIs,\n     retired or serving judges against whom complaints came, or the number of\n     such complaints. Though it appears that his apprehensions were quite\n     genuine, he could not explain under what exceptions such information could\n     be denied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">  20.First Appellate Authority Sri H. C. Bhatia upheld the CPIO&#x27;s reply dated\n     6.3.2014. Appellant reiterated before the Commission that information on\n     number of judges against whom complaints were filed would be enough.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">  21.Later, the appellant has filed following letters, he received through RTI:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                            F.

However, it was recorded in our notes, that their acceptance to the post is doubtful. In the case\n     of Justice R.C.

Question who is appointing &amp;\n     disciplining authority for judges, who will receive and handle the complaints\n     against sitting and retired judges of Constitutional Courts, etc.     Referring to\n     representations/letters sent by eminent jurists like Justice V R Krishna Iyer,\n     and clippings in newspapers, the appellant wanted to know the measures\n     initiated to prevent corruption, and action on the representations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">  24.During the hearings, the appellant pruned his demand for information saying\n     copies of complaints and the names of judges against whom the complaints\n     are made need not be given, but he wanted to know where the complaint\n     against the judges sitting or retired could be filed, the complaints before\n     appointment and after, or impact of complaints on functioning and post\n     retirement assignments.

Appellant wanted clarification as to who the appointing\n     authority and who can hear complaints of misconduct and corruption against\n     judges. The MoP does not clarify whether Supreme Court is appointing or\n     disciplining authority.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">  29.He brought to the notice of the Commission that the PMO vide its letter No.\n     RTI/3441/2013-PMR Dated 23.08.2013 provided a copy of complaint, which\n     mentions serious allegations of corruption against Mr. Justice Altamas Kabir\n     (who was holding office of Chief Justice of India at that time) besides saying\n     &quot;the present chief justice is indulging in corrupt practice to much higher level\n     than the former Chief Justice Sri K G Balakrishnan&quot;. The Lok Sabha\n     Secretariat vide letter No. 1(1046)/IC/13 dated 31.12.2013 has also\n     furnished the copies of complaints filed against the then Chief Justice Mr.\n     Justice Altamas Kabir in response to RTI applications of the appellant.

As the complaints against former CJI Justice Altamas\n     Kabir were forwarded for appropriate action, this part of RTI application also\n     should have been forwarded to the Supreme Court.          The Registry of the\n     Supreme Court could have acted appropriately on this request for complaints\n     if rejected or admitted for inquiry etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">  32.It is relevant to mention that in letter dated 15.03.2010, the Human Rights\n     Division of Union Ministry of Home Affairs stated &quot;because of the adverse\n     media and other reports with regard to Mr Justice Y K Sabharwal, it was felt\n     that the highly sensitive post of Chairperson NHRC may not be offered to\n     him&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">  33.It could be unreasonable to give copies of the complaints, when those were\n     rejected as not substantial or frivolous or not worth considering because of\n     any reasons including that those were filed by disgruntled litigants. If the\n     complaints or representations are rejected for any reason, the fact of\n     rejection could have been shared without disclosing the names and contents\n     of the allegations. At the same time if any complaints were taken up for\n     further probe or follow-up action after prima facie inquiry, it could be in\n     public interest to disclose the copies of the complaints along with status of\n     action taken etc. Secrecy on such matters give rise to doubts or strengthen\n     rumours or kick up unwarranted discussions in public and media. If some of\n     complaints if proved prima facie are taken up for inquiry, sharing that could\n     be in public interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">  34.Despite delay and deficiencies, the CPIO reasonably responded on the &quot;issue\n     of independence of Judiciary from executive action which help judges to give\n     judicial decisions in a free and fair manner without any fear or inducements\n     and that Constitution also provided checks against misbehavior by judges\n     and the process is <a href=\"/doc/66970168/\" id=\"a_8\">laid down in</a> the Judges (inquiry) Act, 1968 etc&quot; (as stated\n     by CPIO).

Professor Mustafa gave certain\n     examples from different jurisdictions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">              Under Roman law, a judge could be held liable for damages if he failed: to\n              appear in court at the agreed time; to adjourn for just cause; to hear both\n              sides equitably; to give judgment in good faith, without animosity or favour.\n              In Sweden, till 1976, judges were subjected to mild criminal sanctions for\n              breach of duty, and the ombudsman could initiate action or even prosecute\n              them. Today, though the ombudsman&#x27;s criminal jurisdiction has been\n              drastically curtailed, the authority of admonition is very much there.

Investigations are carried out\n     before making a recommendation to the House. If the committee has\n     concluded for the impeachment process to take place, the matter is\n     discussed in both the Houses. The alleged judge will also be given\n     opportunity to rebut the charges. After the debate and judge is heard, if the\n     House decides to put the motion to vote by 2/3rds majority in both Houses,\n     the process of which has to be completed in a single session, President might\n     remove the Judge based on resolution. Many regard such an impeachment\n     almost impossible and it appears that accountability is also impossible. From\n     the NJAC order and debate it is clear that appointments process is not fool-\n     proof. And because of impossibility of accountability, the person who enters\n     somehow, remain unquestioned with all immunity which is totally against the\n     rule of law. As far as people are concerned they do not know where primarily\n     the complaint against the judge has to be sent. Should that be sent to office\n     of President, office of Chief Justice, office of Parliament? Who will register,\n     who acknowledges and who informs him about follow-up?

This\n     was proposed in the Judges Inquiry Amendment Bill 2006 providing for a\n     National Judicial Council consisting of the CJI, two senior-most judges of the\n\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                                       Page 14\n      SC and two CJ&#x27;s of HCs as members to enquire allegations. Section 33\n     mandates not to disclose any information relating to the complaint to any\n     person in any proceeding except when directed by the Council. The positive\n     feature of the bill is it makes possible to initiate an enquiry into the\n     allegations of misconduct of a judge. Professor Mustafa suggested a\n     mechanism for judicial performance evaluation.            (<a href=\"/doc/66970168/\" id=\"a_11\">referred above</a>). Though\n     &quot;accountability&quot; demands this also, the Appellant did not ask to this extent.\n     David Pannick, a scholar of this field had written: &quot;The value of the principle\n     of judicial independence is that it protects the judge from dismissal or other\n     sanctions imposed by the Government or by others who disapprove of the\n     contents of his decisions. But judicial independence was not designed as, and\n     should not be allowed to become, a shield for judicial misbehavior or\n     incompetence or a barrier to examination of complaints about injudicious\n     conduct on apolitical criteria...That a man who has an arguable case that a\n     judge has acted corruptly or maliciously to his detriment should have no\n     cause of action against the judge is quite indefensible&quot; (D Pannick, Judges, Oxford\n     University Press 1987, p 99)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">  38.

The\n           provision in the article is that there should be consultation of persons who are\n           ex hypothesi, well qualified to give proper advice in matters of this sort, and\n           my judgment is that this sort of provision may be regarded as sufficient for\n           the moment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">           With regard to the question of the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it seems\n           to me that those who advocate that proposition seem to rely implicitly both\n           on the impartiality of the Chief Justice and the soundness of his judgment. I\n           personally feel no doubt that the Chief Justice is a very eminent person. But\n           after all the Chief Justice is a man with all the failings, all the sentiments and\n           all the prejudices which we as common people have; and I think, to allow the\n           Chief Justice practically a veto upon the appointment of judges is really to\n           transfer the authority to the Chief Justice which we are not prepared to veto\n           in the President or the Government of the day.

The five-\n     member committee will be appointed by the President, who is bound to\n     accept PM&#x27;s recommendation. A recommendation is to be made by a three\n     member committee- two from government and one recommended by the\n     leader of the opposition, which accommodates other view. On receiving a\n     complaint, the committee will forward it to scrutiny panels having the powers\n     of a civil court. If the charges are serious, the committee can request the\n     judge concerned to resign, if the judge does not do so, the &#x27;oversight\n     committee&#x27; will forward the case to the President with an advisory for his\n     removal. The bill also mandates that the judges should not have any close\n     association with the individual members of the bar. This bill contains a\n     proposal for transparency that mandates all the details concerning\n     the investigations to be put up in the SC and HC websites. The\n     accountability bill was passed by Lok Sabha in 2012 but it lapsed with the\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                             Page 17\n      dissolution of the 15th House.

The Report of the Committee on in-House Procedure\n     signed by SC Agrawal, AS Anand, SP Bharucha, PS Mishra and DP Mohapatra\n     JJ, says:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           Complaints are often received containing allegations against a Judge\n           pertaining to the discharge of his judicial functions. Sometimes complaints are\n           received with regard to the conduct and behaviour of the Judge outside the\n           court. The complaints are generally made by a party to the proceedings who\n           feel dissatisfied with the adverse order passed by the Judge or by persons\n           having a personal grudge against the Judge. Most of these complaints are\n           found to be false and frivolous. But there may be complaints which cannot be\n           regarded as baseless and may require deeper probe. A complaint casting\n           reflection on the independence and integrity of a Judge is bound to have a\n           prejudicial effect on the image of the higher judiciary of which the Judge is an\n           honoured member. The adoption of In-House Procedure would enable a\n           complaint against a Judge being dealt with at the appropriate level within the\n           institution. Such a procedure will serve a dual purpose. In the first place, the\n           allegations against a Judge would be examined by his peers and not by an\n           outside agency and thereby the independence of the judiciary would be\n           maintained. Secondly, the awareness that there exists a machinery for\n           examination of complaints against a Judge would preserve the faith\n           of the people in the independence and impartiality of the judicial\n           process. The Committee has approached the task assigned to it in\n           perspective.

The MoP 1999\n     recognized the fact that announcing machinery to examine complaints\n     against judges would preserve the faith of the people in the judiciary. This\n     report has prescribed a procedure for complaining against High Court judges,\n     and the judges of Supreme Court including the Chiefs. Appellant pointed\n     out that there was no mention about complaints against former\n     judges, former Chief Justice of High Courts and Supreme Court.

This effort is revived recently. In December 2015, the Supreme Court\n     struck down as unconstitutional an enactment to set up a National Judicial\n     Appointments Commission (NJAC), observing that &quot;the Memorandum of\n     Procedure (1999) provides for a participatory role to the judiciary as well as\n     the political-executive&quot; and this procedure &quot;now needs fine tuning.&quot; The\n     Court directed the government to draft a Memorandum of Procedure but with\n     the final stamp of approval from the collegium. On May 28, 2016, it was\n     reported in the Economic Times that the Supreme Court has turned down a\n     new MoP and returned it to the government, two months after the Centre\n     prepared it. Quoting government sources the report said the collegiums\n     undesirability of certain clauses which were not in harmony with the tenets of\n     independent functioning of judiciary. This report says that the government\n     contended that the current system of selection was opaque and that\n     transparency was imperative, and that the government felt that the draft\n     could not instill transparency in the process of selections. The media\n     report also stated that the government had decided to keep appointment of\n     top judges out of purview of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_16\">Right to Information Act</a>. Earlier it was\n     contending constantly before the Supreme Court that the collegium system\n     was opaque, also asserting that any appointment should be open to scrutiny\n     under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_17\">RTI Act</a>. However the government had later took the stand\n     that transparency could be achieved &#x27;even without&#x27; RTI.

The 99th\n     Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act have not taken note of the\n     privacy concerns of an individual. This is important because it was submitted\n     by the learned Attorney-General that the proceedings of the NJAC will be\n     completely transparent and any one can have access to information that is\n     available with the NJAC.     This is a rather sweeping generalization which\n     obviously does not take into account the privacy of a person who has been\n     recommended for appointment, particularly as a judge of the High Court or in\n     the first instance as a judge of the Supreme Court. The right to know is not a\n     fundamental right but at best it is an implicit fundamental right and it is\n     hedged in with the implicit fundamental right to privacy that all people enjoy.\n     The balance between the two implied fundamental rights is difficult to\n     maintain, but the 99th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act do not\n     even attempt to consider, let alone achieve that balance. It is possible to\n     argue that information voluntarily supplied by a person who is recommended\n     for appointment as a judge might not have a right to privacy, but at the\n     same time, since the information is supplied in confidence, it is possible to\n     argue that it ought not to be disclosed to third party unconcerned persons.\n     Also, if the recommendation is not accepted by the President, does the\n     recommended person have a right to non-disclosure of the adverse\n     information supplied by the President?

At least five per\n     cent of judges should be selected from this unexplored stream of legal\n     academicians to bring a quality change in the judicial process. As the apex\n     court has to deal both with appellate and original disputes with substantial\n     questions of law it is bound to develop new legal principles and jurisprudence\n     by interpreting the Constitution and other statutes. Legal academicians with\n     good track record of research and writing can develop necessary concepts\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                                              Page 27\n      and script judgments on par with experts on Bench and Bar. Almost every\n     state today has a National Law School striving to improve the quality\n     of legal education sending hundreds of graduates every year into\n     research, practice and academia, besides some graduates coming from\n     the traditional law colleges and private universities under guidance of\n     eminent professors. New generation of lawyers are coming and most\n     of them are spread over High Courts and the Supreme Court while\n     some of them are pursuing academics after specialization and\n     research. Most industrious and innovative of them could get a chance\n     to enrich the Bench if <a href=\"/doc/1995948/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 124(2)(c)</a> is used. On May 24, 1949 Mr.\n     H.V.   Kamath,   member     of   the   Constituent   Assembly,   proposed   the\n     &quot;distinguished jurist&quot; category and said,: &quot;The object of this little amendment\n     of mine is to open a wider field of choice for the President in the matter of\n     appointment of judges of the Supreme Court... I am sure that the House will\n     realize that it is desirable, may [be] it is essential, to have men -- or for the\n     matter of that, women -- who are possessed of outstanding legal and juristic\n     learning. In my humble judgment, such are not necessarily confined to\n     Judges or Advocates. Incidentally, I may mention that this amendment of\n     mine is based on the provision relating to the qualifications for Judges of the\n     International Court of Justice at The Hague.&quot; The Constituent Assembly\n     adopted it and <a href=\"/doc/1995948/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 124 (2)(c)</a> is incorporated. Mr. Kamath referred to US\n     example where President Roosevelt appointed Felix Frankfurter, a Professor\n     at Harvard Law School for 25 years, as an Associate Judge of the American\n     Supreme Court in 1939. Justice Frankfurter has a reputation of being one of\n     the most celebrated judges of the American Supreme Court. Next example is\n     Justice A.M. Kennedy, who was a Professor of Constitutional law for 23 years\n     before President Reagan made him judge in 1988. Another professor who\n     taught Law for 17 years in Columbia R.B. Ginsburg was appointed as Judge\n     of US Supreme Court. Same necessity of legal academicians is there for the\n     High Courts of states also. Hence there should be a similar provision in the\n     relevant <a href=\"/doc/37564/\" id=\"a_29\">article 217(2)</a> of the Constitution, which was omitted by the makers\n\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                      Page 28\n      of the Constitution.    In fact, by 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, sub-\n     clause (c) was included in <a href=\"/doc/37564/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 217(2)</a> in 1976. Because several provisions\n     subverting the basic structure of the Constitution were there in the 42nd\n     Amendment Act, it was thoroughly amended by 44th Amendment in 1978\n     where in the original structure of the Constitution was restored. In the\n     process a required provision in <a href=\"/doc/37564/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 217 (2)</a> was also removed. There is a\n     need to insert following clause (c) at the end of <a href=\"/doc/37564/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 217(2)</a> after clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">     (b): &quot;(c) is, in the opinion of President, a distinguished jurist&quot;. If eminent\n     jurists are appointed at both Supreme Court and High Courts of different\n     states, a new blood would enter the judiciary and if necessary researchers\n     are provided to all judges, besides periodical training, it would be a worthy\n     addition to our innovative judiciary.      Though Constitution provided for\n     appointing jurists as judges, the posts of HC judges are mostly filled with\n     senior District Court judges and judges of High Courts are elevated to\n     Supreme Court. A few Advocates are directly appointed as Judges of High\n     Courts and Supreme Court. The tragedy is nobody even discussed in 70\n     years why none was selected from stream of Jurists. There are many\n     eminent professors of law in our country, some of them should have been\n     considered. Neither Executive nor Judiciary thought any one of them before\n     they turned 65 years of age. They allowed the constitutional provision to\n     remain a dead letter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">  71.It is not known where proposal for jurist for judgeship is made and what the\n     process is. Which is the entry point for an applicant to become judge? The\n     exit for misconduct, except by way of retirement, is almost impossible as\n     explained above. For long, the judges are not appointed and suddenly some\n     of them take oath. The vacancies by retirement are known on the day of\n     taking oath of judges. But significant posts lie vacant, even as crores of cases\n     await a date of hearing for years. It is good luck of nation if many judges are\n     honest and efficient. Should we depend on the luck or a system? Having a\n     system that facilitates appointment of better judges is matter of governance\n     and allowing the system to be strongly in place is the duty of Government.\n     Hence, the transparency.

The Government departments\n      were involved in at least 46% of the court cases. In October 2016, Prime\n      Minister while addressing Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Delhi High Court\n      mentioned how the government was biggest litigant&#x27; and called for lessening\n      the burden on the judiciary, saying it spent the maximum time in dealing\n      with cases in which government was a party. The Prime Minister said the\n      load on the judiciary can be reduced if cases are filed after taking a\n      considered view. He said if a teacher approaches court over a service matter\n      and wins, then the judgment should be used as a yardstick to extend the\n      benefit to thousands of others to reduce litigation at a later stage.\n      (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Government-biggest-litigant-need-to-lessen-load-on-judiciary-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">      PM-Modi/articleshow/55154921.cms)     In thousands of cases a wing of Government\n      fights the citizen or with another wing of itself. This is one of the points on\n      which a judge thought it was not proper to &#x27;litigant&#x27; to take part in\n      appointment process. Being a huge litigant, which prevents the common\n      man, to that extent, from seeking justice/remedy, the state should be\n      primarily accountable to the huge pendencies piling up before the Supreme\n      Court, High Courts and other courts in India.

Let it be the Judges.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">   73.The discussion above leads to following conclusions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">      a) There is no system for redressal of grievances in any court of India, and\n          no mechanism to receive complaints against judiciary. A comprehensive\n          mechanism need to be put in place to ensure both answerability and\n          access      to    information        about      administration         of   justice      including\n          appointments, securing ethics, enforcing probity, complaints and action\n          on them, to ensure transparency and accountability without compromising\n\n\nCIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                                              Page 30\n         the basic constitutional character of the Independence of Judiciary, to be\n        precise, it is not known who will discipline the judges or former judges,\n        CJI or former CJI. Union Ministry of Law and Justice is expected to\n        inform the appellant/citizen and the Commission, what is possible\n        time required to introduce grievance-redressal system in High\n        Courts and Supreme Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">     b) There is lack of basic information to the citizens as where the process of\n        appointment of judge begins, whether a jurist could become judge, if so,\n        where the proposal originates, where the aspirant jurist needs to file his\n        application or how the bring their candidature to the notice collegiums,\n        whether this constitutional provision for appointing judges from jurists will\n        ever be implemented, what is the policy, if any. Similarly people like\n        appellant do not know where complaint against sitting judges or retired\n        judges could be filed. The third aspect of ignorance by lack of policy is\n        that a petitioner or litigant also does not know when his case will be\n        disposed of. The Supreme Court in cases <a href=\"/doc/1351834/\" id=\"a_34\">referred above</a> opined that the\n        accountability and transparency alone could guarantee good governance\n        systems in all the three estates. Will Union Ministry of Law and the\n        Judiciary inform the citizens where to file complaint against Chief\n        Justice or former chief justice &amp; sitting Justice in or retired, of SC\n        &amp; HCs and action thereon?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">     c) The state continues to be the biggest litigant, in spite of policy statement\n        and also the statements of the Government leaders assuring reduction of\n        the cases concerning the system.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">  74.The Commission, in view of the facts, circumstances and contentions\n     analyzed above, directs Union Ministry of Law and Justice to:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">     a) forward the concerned part of RTI application (what action taken on\n        complaints made against former CJI Altamas Kabir and what action was\n        taken on the leakage of judgment before it was pronounced) to the CPIO\n        or appropriate authority in Supreme Court of India within five days from\n        date of receipt of this order, under intimation to the applicant.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">CIC/VS/A/2014/000989-SA                                                      Page 31\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">      b) inform the appellant how many complaints (against former CJIs and\n        former Judges) were received and forwarded, redacting the names and\n        contents,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     c) inform the appellant as to what is the current status of the Judicial\n        Standards and Accountability Bill, and what are alternate measures\n        proposed to ensure accountability,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">     d) inform action initiated to place the mechanism or MoP (procedure)\n        explaining the receiving point of the complaints against former Chief\n        Justices, former Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts, after duly\n        consulting the Judiciary.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">     e) inform when they will finalize and implement national litigation policy to\n        reduce state sponsored litigation against citizen,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">     f) inform when the new Memorandum of Procedure will be finalized and\n        implemented, and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">     g) inform    the response to suggestion of the Government to create\n        mechanism for redressal of grievances in Supreme Court and High Courts.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">  75.The Commission directs the CPIO of Supreme Court to inform appellant, the\n     action or follow up, on the representation dated 6.5.2013 of Dr. M.
