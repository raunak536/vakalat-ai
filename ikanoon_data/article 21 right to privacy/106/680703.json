In order to escape from the\n\n\n\n\n                                   \n     provisions of the Act, many doctors/radiologists indulge in false\n     reporting in form `F&#x27; in this fashion.

The on-line\n     submission of     `F&#x27; forms in such large numbers has four distinct\n     advantages.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:40:42 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                          22</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">                  In the first place, the sonography centres sending such\n     forms in physical form very often take the plea in the prosecution\n     under the Act that some columns in the form were not filled in\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n     inadvertently, but there was no mens rea and, therefore, the\n     appropriate authority should not take a harsh view by prosecuting the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n     radiologist/sonologist merely for incomplete information submitted in\n     `F&#x27; form. The advantage of the on-line submission of `F&#x27; form will be\n     that if any column in the form is left blank, the form will not be\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n     accepted on-line Hence, the person filling in the form is immediately\n     alerted that some column/s in the form/s is/are incomplete. Hence, all\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n     the columns in form `F&#x27; will have to be filled in.\n</p>                     \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">                  The second advantage will be that since `F&#x27; form is to be\n     submitted on-line within 24 hours, the concerned persons required to\n                    \n     submit the information in `F&#x27; form will have to complete their work on\n     day-to-day basis and, therefore, will have no excuse to plead that the\n     information cannot be submitted after lapse of one month. In fact,\n      \n\n\n     having gone through the contents of `F&#x27; form, we find that it would be\n   \n\n\n\n     possible for the person assisting the radiologist/sonologist to fill in the\n     form immediately after the sonography test is undertaken.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">                  The third advantage is to the district administration.

The entire premise and the apprehension based\n     thereon is without any basis.
