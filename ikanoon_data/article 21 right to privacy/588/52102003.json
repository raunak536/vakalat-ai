The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that\n\n     continuation of rowdy sheet against the petitioners is also a social sigma\n\n     on the petitioners.

It would\n\n   depend upon the nature of the activities of the rowdy sheeter for\n\n   continuing the suspect sheet to enable peace and tranquility in the\n\n   society.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">6. The learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing for the state does\n\n   not dispute that there are no cases pending against the petitioners;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">   however submits that the petitioners&#x27; activities would require continuous\n\n   surveillance for the police to maintain the law and order in the state.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">7. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the learned\n\n   Assistant Government Pleader for the state and perused the material on\n\n   record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">8. The following questions would fall for consideration of this writ petition;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">     I.   Whether the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of a\n          Citizen is infringed upon on account of continued surveillance\n          under the guise of opening and continuing rowdy sheet ?\n    II.   The scope of judicial review of rowdy sheet / rowdy sheet on\n          the touchstone of reasonableness, arbitrariness and non-\n          application of mind?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">9. The stand taken by the respondents, that the Police Standing Orders\n\n   would empower the respondents to open rowdy sheets/rowdy sheets in\n\n   order to maintain law and order is not a unfettered right. The Police\n\n   Standing Orders do not have statutory force. The standing orders are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\n\n   only administrative instructions. It is also not in dispute that the Police\n\n   Standing Orders which are issued under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_8\">Police Act</a> would have\n\n   statutory force.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">10. It is pertinent to refer to Chapter 31 of the A.P. Police Code which\n\n   contains 24 Standing Orders.

(G.O.Ms.\n         No. 3929 Home dt:5.9.1950).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">14. A reading of the Standing Orders leads to the following conclusions:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">    a)   A police station has to open Rowdy sheet automatically at\n         the time of conviction of a person. But the conviction is not\n         for all offences. When a person is convicted once\n         Under 310(2) to 310(5) of BNS (Previously <a href=\"/doc/1119707/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections\n         395</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_12\">402</a> IPC), when a person is convicted twice for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                      7</span>\n\n\n        house breaking or theft, when a person is bound over twice\n        Under Section 128 of BNSS (previously <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 109</a> of the\n        Code of Criminal Procedure), and bound over once the\n        Police are empowered to open rowdy sheet. Besides these,\n        persons who are convicted for offences relating to coins\n        and Government Stamps and persons convicted twice for\n        the offences like theft and house breaking and professional\n        prisoners are also the persons against whom rowdy sheet\n        can be automatically opened by the police.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">   b)   Rowdy sheets can also be opened even if there is no\n        conviction. But in such case the person should have been\n        known or believed to be addicted to, or aid or abet the\n        commission of a crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">   c)   The Rowdy sheet opened shall be continued and\n        maintained only for a period of two years and shall be\n        closed only on definite orders of Gazetted Officer. The\n        Police may however order closure of the Rowdy sheet at\n        any time (PSO 735).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">   d)   The Rowdy sheet can be continued and maintained for\n        further period of one year till the end of December, but such\n        continuance can be on specific orders of a Gazetted Officer\n        who after considering the case comes to conclusion that it\n        is necessary to continue the Rowdy sheet and extend\n        retention of the Rowdy sheet. Annual extensions for\n        continuation of Rowdy sheet can also be given from\n        January to December, (PSOs. 735 and 737).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">   e)   The police may also open rowdy sheets for suspects.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">        Suspects are those persons who are convicted under any\n        section of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and who are\n        considered likely to commit crime again. Persons who are\n        not convicted but are believed to be addicted to crime are\n        also treated as suspects. In case a Rowdy sheet is opened\n        on the ground that a person is a suspect care should be\n        taken that Rowdy sheets are opened only for persons who\n        are likely to become habitual criminals (PSO 736).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">11. The police after opening rowdy sheets would constantly keep the rowdy\n\n    sheeter under their radar of surveillance. The same would restrict the\n\n    free movement of the said citizen.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                            8</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">    12. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of Kharaksingh Vs. The\n\n         State of U.P and others1 had dealt with this issue and duly considering\n\n         the law laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in A.K. Gopalan v.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">         State of Madras2 case set aside the suspect sheet by holding that such\n\n         illogical acts without adequate and justifiable reasons which is infringe\n\n         upon the fundamental rights of the petitioner therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">    13. On the facts of the present case, the continuance of rowdy sheet\n\n         against the petitioners would amount to illegal surveillances which is an\n\n         arbitrary act on part of the state. The same includes the right to privacy\n\n         and violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. At the same time, it is\n\n         made clear that keeping a person under watch to prevent crime and to\n\n         maintain law and order as authorized by law is a reasonable restriction\n\n         which is permissible under the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">    14. There is no justification in continuation of the rowdy sheet against the\n\n         petitioners, more so when there was no case registered against the\n\n         petitioners for a period of five years from the date of opening of the\n\n         rowdy sheet. The pending case against the petitioners would also not\n\n         warrant continuance of the rowdy sheet against the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">    15. For the aforementioned reasons, the writ petition is allowed. A\n\n         mandamus is issued to the respondents and to their subordinates to\n\n         close the proceedings vide C.No.30/Crime/SDPO-PLK/2024, dated\n\n         25.08.2024.
