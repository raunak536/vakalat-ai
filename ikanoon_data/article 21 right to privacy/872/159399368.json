An isolated act or commission cannot be\ncharacterised as a habitual act or commission involving breach of peace or\nlaw and order. While forming an opinion that the person is believed to be\naddicted to or aid or abet, the commission of crime, whether convicted or\nnot, the Sub-Inspector of Police and his men have to collect information and\nthat the same has to be ascertained before making a recommendation to an \nofficer of and above the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, in whose\njurisdiction, such person is ordinarily resident either permanently or\ntemporarily.    \n</blockquote>        \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        46.Opening of history sheet in the case of persons convicted for\noffences involving imprisonment for life under Chapter XII and XVII and\nconviction for offences under Section 395 to 402, I.P.C. in the case of\nprofessional prisoners, Sections 392 to 394, I.P.C. and under Sections 75 of\nthe Indian Penal Code, house breaking theft Section 109 Cr.P.C., 110 Cr.P.C.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">depending upon the number of convictions stated in Police Standing Order 747,\nis automatic, at the time of conviction of such persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">        47.Whereas, in the case of opening of history sheets for  rowdies as\nper Form 112, where, some persons are classified as rowdies, the orders of\nthe Superintendent of Police or concerned Sub-divisional Officer have to be\nobtained, on the basis of the information and facts ascertained by the\nStation House Officer, and his men. Persons who habitually commit, attempt to\ncommit, or abet, the commission of offences involving breach of peace or (b)\nPersons bound over under <a href=\"/doc/622891/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 106</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1914745/\" id=\"a_4\">107</a>, Criminal Procedure Code or (c) \nPersons who have been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/19244746/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 75</a> of the Madras City Police \nAct or twice in two consecutive years, under <a href=\"/doc/159493123/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3</a> Clause 12 of the Town\nNuisance Act, or (d) Persons either convicted under <a href=\"/doc/95302477/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 49-A</a> of the\nMadras City Police Act, 1888 (Madras Act III of 1888) or under Section 4 of\nthe Madras Gaming Act, 1930 (Madras Act III of 1930), or reasonably suspected\nto be habitually committing or abetting the commission of the offences, are\nclassified as rowdies.  Clause 4 of Police Standing Order 749, enjoins a\nduty on the police to enter the names of history-sheeted rowdies in the\nstation register of a known depredator and that rowdies should be checked\nregularly by beat Police Constable Constables in rural Police Stations and by\nrowdy patrols in large towns, as also by the Sub-Inspectors (Law and Order).\nThe checking, however should be discretely done by the method of enquiries\nand not in the manner of domiciliary checks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">        48.Police Standing Order dealing with opening and retention of History\nSheets in relation to the nature of offences stated in Police Standing Order\n749(2)(a) to (d), makes it explicit that a duty is cast on the Sub-Inspector\nof Police, Station House Officer/ Inspector of Police and his men to collect,\nverify and ascertain as to whether a person is known or believed to be\naddicted to or aid and abet, the commission of crime and that there should be\nactive criminality, affecting breach of peace or law and order. Criminality,\nas conceived in the police Standing Orders, is commission of offences by the\nindividual or aiding commission of offences or, by inducing/instigating\ncommission of offences by other some person. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">        49.History sheet is ordinarily retained for two years, in the case of\npersons convicted of offences mentioned in Police Standing Order 747.  Where\nretention of history sheet is considered necessary after two years of\nregistration, orders of an officer of and above the rank of Assistant\nSuperintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police, must be taken for\nextension in the first instance upto the end of the next December and further\nannual extension from January to December.  Police Standing Orders, thus,\nmakes it clear that the conduct and activities of history-sheeted persons\nshall be monitored for a specified period during which period, they should\nnot come to any adverse notice and  the authority empowered to extend the\nperiod of retaining his name in the history sheet, should have reason to\nbelieve that such history- sheeted person is habitually addicted to or aid or\nabet, the commission \nof offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">        50.Keeping surveillance or vigil on a history-sheeted person should not\nbe made permanent, mechanically, as it would affect his freedom of life and\nliberty. The discretion conferred on the police is both objective and\nsubjective in nature.  Objective satisfaction with reference to the conduct\nof a history-sheeted person, to prevent commission or aiding or abetting of\noffences, by such persons, involving breach of peace or law and order.  The\nsubjective satisfaction should be based on valid materials and it cannot be\nat the whims and fancies of the police officers.  Reading of the Police\nStanding Order shows that the discretion conferred on the police officers is\nin-built, subject to the limitations, including a specific period, provided\nunder the said orders and it is not for any unlimited period, unless the\nconduct of the history-sheeted person is required to be monitored\ncontinuously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">        51.As the discretionary jurisdiction conferred on the Police Officers\nto open and retain a history sheet is to curtail his freedom and right of\nprivacy, there should be awareness on the part of the authority and it should\nbe on the basis of surveillance materials, where that a reasonable man would\nby probable reasoning arrive at a conclusion or infer that a person has to be\nnecessarily included in the History sheet. &#x27;Belief&#x27;, in the case on\nhand,means a degree of conviction of the truth of something especially based\non a consideration or examination of the evidence and the authorities vested\nwith discretion of opening and retaining history sheets should prove that on\nthe examination of the data that there is awareness on their part indicating\ntheir state of mind that by probable reasoning, they come to a conclusion or\ninfer, about the conduct of person, for whom a History sheet is opened or\nretained. The record of events and the materials should be considered with\ncare and the authority concerned should pass an order, reflecting that he has\nthought over the matter deliberately with care and it has been found\nnecessary, as a result of such careful examination, an order opening or\nretaining a history sheet is required to be passed.                     \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">        52. The Discretion conferred on the authorities is controlled by\nfactors which are in built in PSO 746, which states that history sheets can\nbe broadly opened in respect of persons who are &quot;known or believed to be\naddicted to or aid and abet the commission of crime, whether convicted or\nnot, or who are believed to be habitual receivers&quot;. History sheets can also\nbe re-opened in respect of following persons:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        &quot;a)Persons once convicted under any section of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">Indian Penal Code</a>\nareconsidered to be likely to commit crime;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        b)Persons, not convicted, but believed to be addicted to crime&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">        53.PSO 747 deals with automatic opening of history sheets at the time\nof conviction for persons convicted and shall be retained for two years after\nrelease from jail. It also deals with opening of a history sheet of a known\ndepredator against whom an order has been passed under <a href=\"/doc/1709471/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 356</a> Cr.P.C.,  \nand it shall not be closed, until the period during which he is required to\nreport changes of residence, has elapsed.  History sheet can be opened for\nsuspects, under the orders of the Superintendent or Divisional Officer, if so\nempowered by the Superintendent for the persons included in PSO 749. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">        54.As per PSO 749 (4), all registered rowdies should be kept under the\nsame type of watch as envisaged for registered suspects. The names of History\nsheeted rowdies should be entered in the Station check register of KDs and\nthe rowdies should be checked regularly by beat police constables in rural\npolice stations and by rowdy patrols in large towns as also by the Sub\nInspectors (Law and Order). The checking however should be discretely done by\nthe method of enquiries and not in the manner of domiciliary checks.\nInspectors and Divisional Officers when they visit the area should make their\nown independent enquiries and note their findings in the history sheets and\nin inspection reports, if any. All reports against notorious rowdies entered\nin the General diary of the Station or matters brought to light on enquiries\nin the petitions should be entered against them in the personal sheets and\nshould be dated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">        55.As per PSO 748, where retention of a history sheet is considered\nnecessary after two years of registration, orders of an officer of and above\nthe rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of\nPolice must be taken for the extension in the first instance upto the end of\nthe next December. The above order shall be applied to the rowdy sheets also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">        60.Police Standing Orders makes it explicit that the Sub  Inspector of\nPolice has to make necessary enquiries and ascertain the same before making a \nrequest to the Sub Divisional Officer to open or retain a history sheet. The\nSub Divisional Officer or the Superintendent of Police after consideration of\nthe surveillance report should arrive at a reasonable conclusion, as to the\nexistence of materials warranting retention of the rowdy list. The discretion\nconferred on the police authorities under the Police Standing Orders is to\nsubserve the object, viz., to control the prevention of crime and protection\nto others from crime and the surveillance data has to be carefully examined\nby the Station House Officer or the Competent Person, while recommending \nopening or retaining a rowdy list.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">        61.Thus it could be seen, that an elaborate procedure and the manner in\nwhich the surveillance data has to be collected and ascertained, are set out\nin the Police Standing Orders. Intimation of the movements of the persons\nclosely watched under PSO 752 is also given to the nearest railway police\nstations.  Needless to say that when movements of the persons are watched,\nthere is an invasion of right of privacy. This intrusion of privacy is\nauthorised to control, prevention of crime and to protect others from crime\nand if the person against whom the history sheet is opened is free from any\ntaint or suspicion for over a considerable period of time, the Sub Divisional\nOfficers/Superintendent of Police has to exercise his discretion in favour of\nthose branded as rowdy, so as to allow himself to be free in the best\ninterest of the society.  The Sub Divisional Officers should not be swayed\naway by any bald statement of his subordinates seeking opening or retention\nof history sheets, unless it is considered necessary or where an automatic\nopening of history sheet is necessary, as in the case of conviction for the\noffences stated in the police standing orders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">        62.In a situation of this nature, keeping in mind the nature of the\nduties required to be performed by the law enforcing agencies,  the\ndiscretion to be exercised by the second respondent should be on sound\nprinciples of fairness, reasonableness and it should be in accordance with\nthe object sought to be achieved while opening or retaining a rowdy history\nsheet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">        65.     The criteria for opening a history sheet therefore, is the\nsubjective satisfaction of the authority and it has to be arrived at, on the\nreasonable belief or knowledge that the person, for whom the history sheet is\nopened or retained, is habitually addicted or aid or abet, the Commission of\nCrime, whether convicted or not etc.  While arriving at the subjective\nsatisfaction, current doings in other words, the activities of such persons\nwhich are informative and useful, based on the facts ascertained both by the\nSub-Inspector and his men from the date of last entry shall be made month-\nwise for close watch of characters and quarterly for non-close watch of\ncharacters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">        66.When it is said that something has to be done within the discretion\nof the authorities, that something has to be done according to the rules of\nreason and justice, not according to private opinion; according to law and\nnot humour. It is to be not arbitrary, vague, and fanciful, but legal and\nregular. And it must be exercised within the limit, to which an honest man,\ncompetent to the discharge of his office ought to confine himself.\n</p>                        \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">        67.Branding a person as a history sheeted rowdy has a tainted image in\nthe society as compared to others. Needless to say that  his relationship\nwith others and the prospects of personal development may not remain the\nsame. Characterisation of a person is stigmatic, if any photographs is\ndisplayed in some conspicuous places in the area where he resides, or in\npublic places, and it affects not only his personal rights, but there is\nevery likelihood of damage being caused to the members of his family and it\ncannot be lost sight of.  Innocent children of such persons could be even\nlooked down, if the officer, mechanically under the guise of prevention of\ncrime and to protect others, open or extend history sheets, which has an\nimpact on the right of privacy of not only the individual against whom the\norder is passed, but also causes harm to other person&#x27;s rights.  Therefore, a\nfair and reasonable decision should be taken, taking into consideration the\nConstitutional rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and the\ninterests of the State. It should be noted that at time of opening a history\nsheet, the individual is not informed of the decision taken by the\nauthorities behind his back and that the information collected is discreet.\nNeedless to say that every person wants to live with dignity and he cannot be\ncondemned arbitrarily. It is also to be borne in mind that estrangement of\nthe members of a history sheeted rowdy, in social gatherings, etc., is not\nuncommon in our society.  Therefore, opening or retention of history sheets,\nwhich interferes with the right of privacy of a person, should be done\nstrictly adhering to the parameters inbuilt in the Police Standing Orders,\nkeeping in mind the object sought to be achieved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">        4.This Court in judgment dated 22.03.2010 in WP No.5677 of 2007 has \nheld  as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        ?12.Keeping the above in mind, while dealing with the provisions of PSO\n748 and 749,  a learned Judge of this Court in the judgment in K.M.Sheriff v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">The Superintendent of Police, Pudukkottai District and another, 2006 (2) MWN\n(Crl.) 421, had ultimately observed as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;12.

If that is so, the\nrespondents should have followed PSO 748. As per PSO 748, the Superintendent  \nof Police may order the closure of a History Sheet at any time but a\nDivisional Officer may only do so on the expiry of the period named above.\nAs per 748(2), where retention of a History Sheet is considered necessary\nafter two years of registration, orders of an officer of and above the rank\nof the Assistant Superintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police\nmust be taken for extension in the first instance upto the end of the next\nDecember and further annual extensions from January to December.  As per PSO   \n748(3), PSO 748(1) and 748(2) apply to rowdy sheets also.

When\nthe above said Police Standing Order No.748(2) mandates the taking of\nspecific orders from superior officers for the retention of a History Sheet\nbeyond two years of registration, the respondents in this case have failed to\ndo so.

This court has noticed that in\nmost of the orders passed under PSO 746 or under PSO 749, there is no such  \nreason found recorded by the police officers as required under the said\nprovisions. This, in my considered opinion, may be, because of lack of\nunderstanding of these police standing orders by the officers in the level of\nthe Deputy Superintendent of Police or Assistant Superintendent of Police.\nTherefore, it is high time for the Director General of Police to issue\ninstructions to all the Divisional Police Officers by means of a circular\nimpressing upon them to pass detailed orders reflecting application of mind\nas required under PSO 746 or 749, as the case may be, as and when either a \nhistory sheet or a rowdy sheet is opened or the period is extended.

In this\nrecord all cases of crime that are mentioned in PSO No.742, which provides\nvarious classes of crime, shall be entered and even an attempt to commit\nthose offences, are entered in the records maintained in the Police Station.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        b. These crime records maintained by the Various Police Stations shall\nbe reviewed every year by the Inspector of Police of the concerned Police\nStation. On such review, the Inspector of Police has to furnish a concise\nappreciation of the year&#x27;s crime for the benefit of the Superior Officers and\nalso to make suggestions in order to improve the quality of crime control.\nThe review undertaken by the Inspector of Police is not  merely a catalogue\nof the crime in the year. It should reflect the valuable suggestions in order\nto prevent such crimes in future and to provide ways and means of handling\nserious offences in an effective manner.        \n</blockquote>        \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">        c. History Sheet can be opened by the concerned Police Station under\ntwo circumstances. The first circumstance is provided under               PSO\nNo.746, which states that the history sheet can be opened against a person\nwho is a resident (permanently or temporarily) within the station limit, who\nis known or believed to be addicted to commission of crime, whether convicted\nor not. Here the thrust is on the habituality or the propensity  to commit a\ncrime by a person, which is sought to be monitored by opening a history\nsheet.\n</blockquote>        \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        d. The second category of persons against whom history sheet can be \nopened are the persons, who are convicted for various offences that has been\nlisted in PSO No.747, wherein opening of the history sheet is automatic.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        e. In the first category of opening history sheet, month wise scrutiny\nor a close watch on the person concerned is contemplated. Here also there is\nsub-catogrization as, close watch bad characters and non-close watch bad\ncharacters. In the former, the entry shall be made month wise and in the\nlater, the entry shall be made once in a quarter. What is entered is normally\nanything of interest in respect of the bad character, which goes to the\nnotice of the Police. These records must be checked and brought upto date\nonce in a year. Here the main thrust is on ?Current Doings?.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">        f. In the second category of opening history sheet, a mere act of\nconviction under the offences listed in PSO No.747 is enough. The name of the\npersons, who have been convicted for those offences can be retained for a\nperiod of two years after their release from jail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        g. PSO No.748, is the most important provision, which deals with\ndiscontinuance of history sheet. This provision is common to both the\ncategories falling under PSO Nos.746 and 747. As per PSO No.748,  \nthe Superintendent of Police may order a closure of a history sheet at any\ntime. But, the Divisional Officer can order closure of history sheet only\nafter the expiry of the period stipulated in PSO No.747.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">        h. As per PSO 748, where retention of the history sheet is considered\nto be necessary, even after two years of registration, orders of an Officer\nof and above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police/ Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police must be taken for extension for the first  instance\nupto the end of next December. For further annual extension from January to\nDecember, separate orders must be passed every time by an Officer of and\nabove the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police / Deputy Superintendent\nof Police. This provision is made applicable even for rowdy sheeters.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        i. For the purpose of passing such orders, there must be valid\nmaterials available on record and it cannot be passed on the whims and\nfancies of the Police Officers. Therefore, the authority empowered to extend\nthe period of retention  of the names of the persons in the history sheet,\nshould record his reasons based on both objective and subjective\ninstructions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        j. Branding a person as a history sheeted rowdy, taints the name and\nimage of the person. It is true that the entire purpose of maintaining a\nhistory sheet is to ensure public peace. However, it should be balanced with\nthe fundamental right guaranteed to every citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India. Therefore, a fair and reasonable decision, based on\nthe materials, with sufficient reasons, becomes                  sine qua non\nto retain the name of a person as a history sheeter beyond the period\nstipulated in the Police Standing Orders.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1760179\" id=\"span_3\">k. This Court has time and again brought the above principle to the\nnotice of the Higher Police Officials and in one of the judgments in\n<a href=\"/doc/1760179/\" id=\"a_13\">Manivanan Vs. State</a>  represented by The District Collector, Coimbatore\nDistrict and Others, reported in (2013) 7 MLJ 501,  this  Court felt that\nthere is lack of understanding on the part of the Police in maintaining\nhistory sheet and therefore, directed the Director General of Police to issue\nnecessary instructions / guidelines / circulars with regard to the manner in\nwhich it has to be maintained and the manner in which the orders will have to\nbe passed for extension of the period to continue a person as a history\nsheeter.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">        8.The above principles that has been culled out of various decisions of\nthis Court will now be applied to each case in order to see if the Police\nofficials have scrupulously followed all the Police Standing Orders and the\njudgments of this Court, while retaining the name of a person as a history\nsheeter, beyond the stipulated period.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">        9.WP(MD)No.19651 of 2017 :  \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        In this case the name of the petitioner was added in the history sheet\nin the year 2011 in HS No.7 of 2011. The petitioner claims himself to be a\nCoolie worker, who is struggling to maintain his family.\nThe petitioner has further contended that the respondent Police registered  a\ncase against him in Crime No.384 for the alleged offence under Sections 148\nand 302 r/w 149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a> and at that point of time,  history sheet was opened\nfor the petitioner by the second respondent. The petitioner was arrayed as A-\n6 in the said case. Subsequently, the case ended in an acquittal by judgment\ndated 18.06.2014, passed by the IV Additional District and Sessions Judge,\nMadurai on the ground that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the\ncase.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">        9.2. It is the further case of the petitioner that the respondent\nPolice registered another FIR against the petitioner and another person in\ncrime No.26 of 2012 for the alleged offence under <a href=\"/doc/1198799/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_16\">323</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_17\">506(i)</a> of IPC and final report was also filed. This case also ended in an\nacquittal by judgment dated 29.01.2013 in STC No.14 of 2013. According to the\npetitioner apart from these two cases there are no other cases registered by\nthe respondent Police against the petitioner after the acquittal in both the\nabove said cases. However, the respondent has filed a Counter affidavit and\nhas mentioned three more cases registered against the petitioner in Crime\nNo.340 of 2012 for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 41(b)(ii)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_19\">110</a> of CrPC, in\nCrime No.849 of 2014 under <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 109</a> of CrPC and Crime No.88 of 2016 under  \n<a href=\"/doc/1228992/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 151</a> of CrPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">        9.3.From the facts stated above, it is seen that the case of the\npetitioner does not fall under PSO No.747, since admittedly, the petitioner\nhas not been convicted either under <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 109</a> of CrPC or under <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 110</a>\nof CrPC. Therefore, this case will fall under                     PSO No.746.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">It is clear that after the year 2012, admittedly, the petitioner has not\ninvolved in any offence. The two offences for which the petitioner faced\ntrail, ended in acquittal in the year 2013 and 2014 respectively. The\nsubsequent three cases that were registered in the year 2012, 2014 and 2016\nunder <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_24\">CrPC</a> is clearly a ruse to continue to retain the name of the petitioner\nas a history sheeter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">        9.4. There are absolutely no materials produced before this Court or\nmentioned in the Counter affidavit to show that PSO No.748 (2) was followed\nto retain the name of the petitioner till the year 2018. There is nothing to\nshow that the concerned Inspector of Police maintained the record and\ncontinuously entered the various instances of bad character exhibited by the\npetitioner as contemplated under PSO No.746(3) and 746(4). Apart from that\nthere are absolutely no materials to show that an officer in the rank of\nAssistant Superintendent of Police /                   Deputy Superintendent\nof Police objectively considered those materials  placed by the Inspector of\nPolice and gave reasons as to why the name of the petitioner should be\ncontinued as a history sheeter and passed a separate order in that regard.\nThis Court finds that these mandatory requirements were not fulfilled in this\ncase. There is not even a mention in the Counter affidavit with regard to the\norder passed to retain the name of the petitioner after two years from the\ndate on which the petitioner&#x27;s name was added in the history sheet and there\nis also no mention about the yearly extensions for which specific and\nseparate orders needs to be passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">        9.5.This Court finds that continuing to retain the name of the\npetitioner in the history sheet is illegal and violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">        9.6.In view of the above, the writ petition is allowed and the\nproceedings of the respondent Police in retaining the name of the petitioner\nas a history sheeter in HS No.7 of 2011 is hereby quashed and there shall be\na direction to the respondent Police to remove the name of the petitioner\nfrom the record of history sheet rowdies.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">        10.WP(MD)No.14198 of 2018:   \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">        In this case the petitioner was added in the history sheet in the year\n2017 in HS No.650 of 2017.

In the said\ncounter affidavit, the respondent Police has shown three cases registered\nagainst the petitioner.

Therefore, this case will fall under PSO No.746. It is clear that\nthere are two cases pending against the petitioner. One was registered in the\nyear 2012 and the other was registered in the year 2017. No materials have\nbeen placed before this Court as to why the petitioner has been branded as a\nrowdy and history sheet was opened in the year 2017. The respondent Police\nhave not brought to the notice this Court any crime committed by the\npetitioner during the period from the year 2012 to 2017. The latest case that\nhas been shown in                                  Crime No.91 of 2017, to be\nthe trigger for opening the history sheet against the petitioner pertains to\na land dispute between the petitioner and one Sasindran and on the date of\noccurrence, the petitioner and others are said to have entered into the\nproperty and taken away                 jack fruits and caused damages to the\ntree and when questioned, abused the complainant. This case is admittedly\npending trial.                   By no stretch, this case can be a ground to\nopen a history sheet against the  petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">        13.5.A stray incident of this nature, if is made a ground to open a\nhistory sheet against the person, in almost every case, the Police can open a\nhistory sheet against every person. This will go against the very purpose of\nmaintaining the history sheet. The purpose behind the opening of the history\nsheet is to keep in check the habitual offenders, who are a threat to the\nsociety. The so called offences that has been portrayed in this case merely\narose out of a private dispute between the parties. It makes this Court to\nthink that the Police wanted to keep the petitioner in control and not allow\nhim to question them by using his status as an Advocate and as a person\nbelonging to a political party. This in the considered view of this Court, is\ncolourable exercise of power and there is absolutely no justification to open\na history sheet against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">        13.6.This Court finds that continuing to retain the name of the\npetitioner in the history sheet is illegal and violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">        13.7.In view of the above, the writ petition is allowed and the\nproceedings of the respondent Police in retaining the name of the petitioner\nas a history sheeter in HS No.8 of 2017 is hereby quashed and there shall be\na direction to the respondent Police to remove the name of the petitioner\nfrom the record of history sheet rowdies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">        14.WP(MD)No.16180 of 2018:   \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">        In this case the petitioner was added in the history sheet in the year\n2017 in HS No.646 of 2017.

Apart from this, there is no other case registered against the\npetitioner. However, for the incident that took place in the year 2011 and\nwhich is pending, the respondent has opened a history sheet for the\npetitioner in the year 2017 without any basis.

Even to do it, PSO No.747 requires a\nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 110</a> of CrPC, which is not the case here.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">        14.7.This Court is convinced that the fourth respondent has opened a\nhistory sheet against the petitioner without any materials or basis and\naccording to his own whims and facies.

This  \nSangam regularly helps people belonging to the Community from oppression and  \nhigh handedness of the Police. Whenever any corrupt activities are brought to\nthe notice of this Sangam, complaints used to be given to the higher\nofficials. Therefore, the Police always had an antagonistic attitude against\nthe petitioner and  his family members.

Apart from that\nthere are absolutely no materials to show that an officer in the rank of\nAssistant Superintendent of Police /            Deputy Superintendent of\nPolice objectively considered those materials  placed by the Inspector of\nPolice and gave reasons as to why the name of the petitioner should be\ncontinued as a history sheeter and passed a separate order in that regard.\nThis Court finds that this mandatory requirements were not fulfilled in this\ncase. There is not even a mention in the Counter affidavit with regard to the\norder passed to retain the name of the petitioner after two years from the\ndate on which the petitioner&#x27;s name was added in the history sheet and there\nis also no mention about the yearly extensions for which specific and\nseparate orders needs to be passed.\n</p>        \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">        25.5.This Court finds that continuing to retain the name of the\npetitioner in the history sheet is illegal and violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">        25.6.In view of the above, the criminal original petition is allowed\nand the proceedings of the respondent Police in retaining the name of the\npetitioner as a history sheeter in HS No.226 of 2005 is hereby quashed and\nthere shall be a direction to the respondent Police to remove the name of the\npetitioner from the record of history sheet rowdies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">        26.CrlOP(MD)N0.14462 of 2017:  \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">        In this case the name of the petitioner was added in the history sheet\nin the year 2015 in HS No.208 of 2015. The petitioner claims to be  a\nresident of Cuttralam and also is working in Cuttralam Thiruvilancore\nAranmanai as a Superintendent. It is the case of the petitioner that three\ncriminal cases were registered against the petitioner in Crime Nos.266 and\n267 of 2014 and 381 of 2015.  In the first case, the name of the petitioner\nwas deleted at the time of filing of the final report. In the second case,\nthe petitioner was acquitted by judgment dated 15.12.2016 and in the third\ncase, the same was closed by the Judicial Magistrate, Shenkottai. This\nincident took place in the years 2014 and 2015. However,  even thereafter,\nthe name of the petitioner is shown in the history sheet that has resulted in\nembarrassment for the petitioner and the petitioner who is living with his\nwife, children and aged parents is unnecessarily being subjected to\nsurveillance by the respondent without any justification.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">        26.2.The second respondent has filed a counter affidavit, in which the\nfactual details raised by the petitioner has been admitted. However, the only\nground taken by the second respondent to continue to retain the name of the\npetitioner in the history sheet is that the activities of the petitioner has\nto be watched.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">        26.3.From the facts stated above, it is seen that the case of the\npetitioner does not fall under PSO No.747, since admittedly, the petitioner\nhas not been convicted for any of the offences listed in PSO No.747.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">Therefore, this case will fall under PSO No.746. It is clear that after the\nyear 2015, admittedly, the petitioner has not involved in any offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">        26.4. There are absolutely no materials produced before this Court or\nmentioned in the Counter affidavit to show that PSO No.748(2) was followed to\nretain the name of the petitioner till the year 2018. There is nothing to\nshow that the concerned Inspector of Police maintained the record and\ncontinuously entered the various instances of bad character exhibited by the\npetitioner as contemplated under PSO No. 746(3) and 746 (4). Apart from that\nthere are absolutely no materials to show that an officer in the rank of\nAssistant Superintendent of Police /                      Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police objectively considered those materials  placed by\nthe Inspector of Police and gave reasons as to why the name of the petitioner\nshould be continued as a history sheeter and passed a separate order in that\nregard. This Court finds that these mandatory requirements were not fulfilled\nin this case. There is not even a mention in the Counter affidavit with\nregard to the order passed to retain the name of the petitioner after two\nyears from the date on which the petitioner&#x27;s name was added in the history\nsheet and there is also no mention about the yearly extensions for which\nspecific and separate orders needs to be passed.\n</p>        \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">        27.5.This Court finds that continuing to retain the name of the\npetitioner in the history sheet is illegal and violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">        27.6.In view of the above, the criminal original petition is allowed\nand the proceedings of the respondent Police in retaining the name of the\npetitioner as a history sheeter in HS No.208 of 2015 is hereby quashed and\nthere shall be a direction to the respondent Police to remove the name of the\npetitioner from the record of history sheet rowdies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">        28.It can be seen from all the above cases that there is a general\npattern adopted trend by the Police to continue to retain the names of the\npersons in the history sheet showing them as rowdies without any justifiable\nreasons. The Police did not realise that the purpose of opening a history\nsheet is to keep surveillance and check on hardened and habitual criminals in\norder to maintain peace and tranquility in the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">        29.As mentioned above, it also becomes the duty of the Police to keep\nreviewing the history sheet regularly to ensure that the persons, who are no\nlonger required to be retained in the list are removed from the list, since\nit involves the dignity and public image of a person which is guaranteed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">        30.Whenever representations are made by the persons whose  names are   \nfound in the history sheet, it is the  duty of the respondent Police to\nconsider the same, since it gives an opportunity to the respondent Police to\nreview the history sheet and to ensure that only those names, which deserves\nto be kept in the history sheet are continued and all the other names are\nremoved. It will be of no use for the respondent Police to keep the\nrepresentation pending even without considering them and driving the\nconcerned persons to file appropriate petition before this Court. This Court\nonly hopes that the Police learns a lesson at least after the passing of this\norder, to be more sensitive and serious in maintaining history sheet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">        31.One more factor which needs to be addressed is the pattern that is\nseen in all these cases. The Police seems to be adopting the practice of\nregistering FIRs against the persons under <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_135\">Sections 109</a> and <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_136\">110</a> of CrPC, just\nto open the history sheet and to justify the continuance of the name of the\npersons in the history sheet. Section 109 and <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 110</a> of CrPC are not\nmeant for that purpose. Even in                       PSO No.747, there is\nrequirement that automatic opening of history sheet can be done only if the\nperson has been convicted more than twice under <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 109</a> of CrPC and more  \nthan once under <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 110</a> of CrPC. Therefore, mere registration of an FIR\nunder <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_140\">Sections  109</a> and <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_141\">110</a> of CrPC can never justify the action of the\nPolice in continuing to retain the name of the person in the history sheet.\nThese shortcut methods should never be adopted and the Courts can easily see- \nthrough it, if the same is done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">        32. Before parting with these cases, this Court again draws the\nattention of the Director General of Police, Chennai and the Inspector\nGeneral of Police of various Zones, to sensitize and educate the Police with\nregard to opening and closing of history sheets. This Court has already given\nsuch instructions in the judgment in Manivanan Vs. State  represented by The\nDistrict Collector, Coimbatore District and Others, reported in (2013) 7 MLJ\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">501.  However, the situation has not improved and it only seems to be\ndeteriorating.\n</p>        \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">        33.This Court wants to make it clear that in all future cases, where\nthe retention of the name of a person in history sheet becomes a subject\nmatter of challenge before this Court, if this Court finds that the name of\nthe person has been retained without any justification and is in\ncontravention with PSO Nos.746 to 748 and the guidelines given by this Court,\ncompensation will be granted to the victims and the same will be directed to\nbe recovered from the monthly salary of the Inspector of Police in whose\nstation the history sheet is being maintained. Consequently, all connected\nmiscellaneous petitions are closed. There shall be no orders as to costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">To\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">1.The Assistant Commissioner of Police,\n   Annanagar (L &amp;O) Range, \n   Madurai City,\n   Madurai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">2.The Inspector of Police,\n   K.Pudur Police Station,\n   Madurai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">3.The Inspector of Police,\n   Appanthirupathi Police Station,\n   Madurai.     \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">4.The Additional Public Prosecutor,\n    Madurai Bench of Madras High Court,\n    Madurai.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">Copy to \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">1.The Director General of Police,\n  Chennai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_120\">2.The Inspector General of Police,\n   All Zones.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\">.\u001a\n          </p>","numcites":43,"numcitedby":59,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":159399368,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 110 of code of criminal procedure","formInput":"section%20110%20of%20code%20of%20criminal%20procedure"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"section 110 crpc","formInput":"section%20110%20crpc"},{"value":"history sheet","formInput":"history%20sheet"},{"value":"article 21 of constitution","formInput":"article%2021%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"no violation of article 21","formInput":"no%20violation%20of%20article%2021"},{"value":"history sheets opening","formInput":"history%20sheets%20opening"},{"value":"constitution of india articles","formInput":"constitution%20of%20india%20articles"},{"value":"case and counter case","formInput":"case%20and%20counter%20case"},{"value":"removal of name from history sheet","formInput":"removal%20of%20name%20from%20history%20sheet"},{"value":"removal of history sheet ","formInput":"removal%20of%20history%20sheet%20"},{"value":"police standing orders","formInput":"police%20standing%20orders"},{"value":"tnppdl act ","formInput":"tnppdl%20act%20"},{"value":"sec 109 of crpc","formInput":"sec%20109%20of%20crpc"},{"value":"rowdy sheet","formInput":"rowdy%20sheet"},{"value":"history sheeter ","formInput":"history%20sheeter%20"},{"value":"110 CrPC","formInput":"110%20CrPC"},{"value":"history-sheet of criminal","formInput":"history-sheet%20of%20criminal"},{"value":"Section 110 Cr.P.C","formInput":"Section%20110%20Cr.P.C"},{"value":"ipc 506","formInput":"ipc%20506"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"rioting","formInput":"tag:rioting"},{"value":"criminal-intimidation","formInput":"tag:criminal-intimidation"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
