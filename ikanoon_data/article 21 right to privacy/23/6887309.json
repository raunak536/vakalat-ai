Sharma\n\nPublic Authority   :     Municipal Corporation Delhi\n\nDate of Hearing    :     21.11.2013\nDate of Decision   :     17.12.2013\n\n                                         Facts</pre>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1\">   1. Pursuant to the Commission&#x27;s Orders dated 27 August 2013, and 30 October\n\n      2013, a full bench of the Commission had been constituted in the above\n\n      mentioned cases. Matter was heard on 21 November 2013. Appellant was\n\n      present at the hearing in person and made submissions. Respondents\n\n      representing the three Municipal Corporations namely East Delhi Municipal\n\n      Corporation, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal\n\n      Corporation, Delhi were present at the hearing in person and also made their\n\n      respective submissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">   2. Appellant submitted that Respondent Public Authority has prescribed\n\n      procedures to check any unauthorized construction prevailing in Delhi and\n\n      they have the powers to take stringent action against the Unauthorized\n\n      Constructions. Appellant submitted multiple Office Orders of the MCD\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                        1</span>\n supplementing the above submission. Further, it was submitted that <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 8</a>\n\nof the RTI Act    is not attracted in allowing the inspection to the third party\n\nas relation between the owners of the property falls in the fiduciary\n\nrelationship with the Corporation rather it is under legal obligation through\n\nthe Architect to furnish specific information nor is there any danger to the life\n\nand property of the constructer rather the inspection of the property along\n\nwith the MCD Official is an exercise to disclose conspiracy between the\n\nOfficers of Corporation and constructers. Also joint inspection of the\n\nproperties does not impede the process of investigation rather this action\n\nfacilitates process of investigation. It was then submitted that Appellant has\n\nfiled PIL against the Govt. of NCT Delhi in the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court on\n\nthe subject matter of unauthorized construction in the larger public interest so\n\nit is beneficial for the Appellant to seek information pertaining to the\n\nidentified properties. Further, it is obligatory function of the corporation to\n\nmake all efforts to number the properties and display the same on site\n\nespecially before construction commences as per the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_2\">DMC Act</a>. In the\n\nabsence of the above, it is impossible for the Appellant to identify the exact\n\nnumber, location and address of the property and he is left with no choice but\n\nto describe it as &quot;abutting or in front of property situated opposite the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     2</span>\n   building&quot; while making RTI Application for information to the MCD under\n\n  the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">RTI Act</a> thereby necessitating joint inspection with the MCD Officials.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">3. Respondents   submitted that inspection of the alleged &#x27;unauthorized\n\n  constructions&#x27; is delegated statutory power authorized to the MCD\n\n  engineers, with the prescribed procedure under the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_4\">DMC Act</a>. Without the\n\n  said procedures, Engineers can neither enter nor inspect the premises of the\n\n  citizen who has a Right to Privacy. It was further submitted that merely\n\n  because a person doubts the integrity and functioning of the Officers of the\n\n  MCD, it cannot be a ground to allow him the powers of Supervision and\n\n  Powers of Entry. Further, any grievances against the &#x27;working&#x27; of Public\n\n  Authority may be raised before the Honorable Delhi High Court in the\n\n  pending litigation matters involving Appellant and MCD, but CIC is not a\n\n  suitable forum to raise grievances by the Appellant. Allowing Inspection of\n\n  the property is not &#x27;information&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\n\n  which is &#x27;Recorded and Available&#x27; and CPIO is not required to create\n\n  information or interpret information or to solve grievances or furnish replies\n\n  to the hypothetical questions of the Appellant. It was also submitted that the\n\n  CIC does not have powers under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">RTI Act</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_7\">DMC Act</a> to give any\n\n  directions to allow inspection of the third party property to the Appellant.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\"> 4. Commission after hearing both the parties, asked them to provide any\n\n  additional submission with respect to the issues involved in the present case in\n\n  writing by 2 December 2013. Matter was thus reserved subject to the\n\n  additional submissions by the parties to the present case.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">                                  Decision Notice\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">  5.      The Commission has taken cognizance of the final submissions as\n\n  made by both Appellant and the Respondents in the present case. There are\n\n  two issues involved in the present case, the first being: Whether the Central\n\n  Information Commission (hereinafter &quot;Commission&quot;) has the &#x27;power to\n\n  direct&#x27; the Public Authority i.e. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (hereinafter\n\n  &quot;MCD&quot;) to allow inspection of the Private/Third Party properties to the\n\n  Appellant-in person along with technical staff/Engineers of the MCD under\n\n  the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act, 2005</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_9\">DMC Act</a>. The second issue before the Commission\n\n  is (in case the Commission has the power to direct the said &#x27;inspection of the\n\n  properties&#x27;) whether such inspection would invade the privacy of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       4</span>\n individual owner and/or occupant of the said property and would hence\n\nattract <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">6.      In his submissions regarding the first issue, Appellant has insisted that\n\nthe Commission under <a href=\"/doc/51330/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 25 (5)</a> of the RTI Act may direct the MCD to\n\nallow inspection. <a href=\"/doc/51330/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 25 (5)</a> of the RTI Act states that:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> &quot;...(5) If it appears to the Central Information Commission or State Information\n\n Commission, as the case may be, that the practice of a public authority in relation to the\n\n exercise of its functions under this Act does not conform with the provisions or spirit of\n\n this Act, it may give to the authority a recommendation specifying the steps which ought\n\n in its opinion to be taken for promoting such conformity.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\"> 7. It is observed that though Commission under the said Section; can\n\n     &#x27;recommend&#x27; to the Public Authority to perform certain action in\n\n     conformity with the spirit of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">RTI Act</a>, however, the said <a href=\"/doc/51330/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 25\n\n     (5)</a> does not confer any power to the Commission to &#x27;direct&#x27; any specific\n\n     actions. Such powers have been laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_16\">19</a> of the\n\n     RTI Act alone. Hence it would be inappropriate to interpret <a href=\"/doc/51330/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 25\n\n     (5)</a> in such casual manner, and Commission certainly cannot coerce the\n\n     Public Authority to allow any inspection under <a href=\"/doc/51330/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 25 (5)</a> of the RTI\n\n     Act. With reference to <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 19</a>, the Honorable Supreme Court in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         5</span>\n case Chief Information Commr. and Another State of Manipur and\n\nAnother (CIVIL APPEAL NOs.10787-10788 OF 2011) dated 12 December\n\n2011 has observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"> &quot;...38. It may be that sometime in statute words are used by way of abundant\n\n caution. The same is not the position here. Here a completely different procedure\n\n has been enacted under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 19</a>. If the interpretation advanced by the learned\n\n counsel for the respondent is accepted in that case <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 19</a> will become\n\n unworkable and especially\n\n <a href=\"/doc/1758911/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 19(8)</a> will be rendered a surplusage. Such an interpretation is totally\n\n opposed to the fundamental canons of construction. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"350457\" id=\"span_6\">Reference in\n\n this connection may be made to the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/350457/\" id=\"a_23\">Aswini Kumar\n\n Ghose and another v. Arabinda Bose and another</a> - AIR 1952 SC 369. of the\n\n report Chief Justice Patanjali Sastri had laid down:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"> &quot;It is not a sound principle of construction to brush aside words in a statute as\n\n being inapposite surplusage, if they can have appropriate application in\n\n circumstances conceivably within the contemplation of thestatute&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1786180\" id=\"span_7\">39. Same was the opinion of Justice Jagannadhadas in <a href=\"/doc/1786180/\" id=\"a_24\">Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh\n\n and another v. State of U.P.</a> - AIR 1953 SC 394 at page 397: &quot;It is incumbent on\n\n the court to avoid a construction, if reasonably permissible on the language,\n\n which would render a part of the statute devoid of any meaning or application&quot;.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"790887\" id=\"span_8\">40. Justice Das Gupta in <a href=\"/doc/790887/\" id=\"a_25\">J.K. Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. State\n\n of Uttar Pradesh and others</a> - AIR 1961 SC 1170 at page 1174 virtually reiterated\n\n the same principles in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   6</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     &quot;the courts always presume that the Legislature inserted every part thereof for a\n\n    purpose and the legislative intention is that every part of\n\n    the statute should have effect&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">    41. It is well-known that the legislature does not waste words or say anything in\n\n    vain or for no purpose. Thus a construction which leads to\n\n    redundancy of a portion of the statute cannot be accepted in the absence of\n\n    compelling reasons. In the instant case there is no compelling reason to accept\n\n    the construction put forward by the\n\n    respondents.&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">\nThe above ratio also appears in full measure while interpreting the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/51330/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 25 (5)</a> of the RTI Act and therefore the Appellant&#x27;s\n\ncontention cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\nThe powers of the Commission under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 18</a> of the RTI Act specifically\n\nallow the CIC to inquire into any complaint filed by the RTI Applicant. The\n\nsaid section further allows the CIC to initiate an enquiry into the matter, if\n\nrequired which includes summoning and enforcing the attendance of\n\npersons, receiving evidence on affidavit, inspection of documents, etc.\n\nHowever, CIC does not have any power under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 18</a> of the Act to\n\nallow Joint inspection of third party property to a RTI Applicant. <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 18</a>\n\nfurther does not grant power to the CIC to disclose any information to the\n\nRTI Applicant. Such power is mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 19</a> of the RTI Act. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                       7</span>\n provisions of Section 18 of the RTI Act were interpreted by the Honorable\n\nSupreme Court in the case Chief Information Commr. and Another State\n\nof Manipur supra as:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;...29. If we look at <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 18</a> of the Act it appears that the powers under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 18</a> have been categorized under clauses (a) to (f) of <a href=\"/doc/759435/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 18(1)</a>.\n      Under clauses (a) to (f) of <a href=\"/doc/759435/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 18(1)</a> of the Act the Central Information\n      Commission or the State Information Commission, as the case may be, may\n      receive and inquire into complaint of any person who has been refused access\n      to any information requested under this Act [<a href=\"/doc/340663/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 18(1)(b)</a>] or has been\n      given incomplete, misleading\n      or false information under the Act [<a href=\"/doc/15195/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 18(1)(e)</a>] or has not been given a\n      response to a request for information or access to information within time\n      limits specified under the Act [<a href=\"/doc/66861/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 18(1)(c)</a>. We are not concerned with\n      provision of <a href=\"/doc/741383/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 18(1)(a)</a> or 18(1)(d) of the Act. Here we are concerned with\n      the residuary provision under <a href=\"/doc/345924/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 18(1)(f)</a> of the Act. Under <a href=\"/doc/1537777/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 18(3)</a>\n      of the Act the Central Information Commission or State Information\n      Commission, as the case may be, while inquiring into any matter in this Section\n      has the same powers as are vested in a civil court while trying a suit in respect\n      of certain matters specified in <a href=\"/doc/1423388/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 18(3)(a)</a> to (f). Under <a href=\"/doc/641541/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 18(4)</a>\n      which is a non-obstante clause, the Central Information Commission or the\n      State Information Commission, as the case may be, may examine any record to\n      which the Act applies and which is under the control of the public authority\n      and such records cannot be withheld from it on any ground.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      30. It has been contended before us by the respondent that under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 18</a> of\n      the Act the Central Information Commission or the State Information\n      Commission has no power to provide access to the information which has been\n      requested for by any person but which has been denied to him. The only order\n      which can be passed by the Central Information Commission or the State\n      Information Commission, as the case may be, under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 18</a> is an order of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                      8</span>\n       penalty provided under <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 20</a>. However, before such order is passed the\n      Commissioner must be satisfied that the conduct of the Information Officer was\n      not bona fide. 31. We uphold the said contention and do not find any error in\n      the impugned judgment of the High court whereby it has been held that the\n      Commissioner while entertaining a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 18</a> of the said Act\n      has no jurisdiction to pass an order providing for access to the information...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">In light of the above, Commission, under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 18</a> of the RTI Act, has the\n\npower to inquire into the matter and has same powers as are vested in a civil\n\ncourt and thus may initiate penalty provisions against the CPIO in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 20</a> of the Act. However, under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 18</a>, Commission may not\n\ndirect to provide information and does not possess inherent power of the\n\nHigh Court to issue Writs to the Public Authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">8. In the next submission, Appellant has highlighted the fact that since the\n\n   properties (which are to be inspected) has been allegedly constructed\n\n   without obtaining the No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the concerned\n\n   department of the Public Authority, the property does not belong to the\n\n   building/persons residing in it and thus the &#x27;ownership&#x27; of the said\n\n   property does not have any legal standing. Commission is of the view\n\n   that whether a particular property has or has not received NOC is a\n\n   matter between the property owner/occupant (claiming its legitimacy)\n\n   and the Public Authority. The &#x27;inspection&#x27; of the said property by the\n\n   Appellant along with the Officials of the MCD is a separate matter.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     9</span>\n However, Commission is of the view that such information which\n\nhighlights the NOC status of individual property must be in the public\n\ndomain but &#x27;disclosure&#x27; of the said information through inspection of the\n\nproperty by a &#x27;third party&#x27; is not a solution to the problem and has not\n\nbeen inculcated in any legislative enactment <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_50\">(RTI Act</a> or <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_51\">DMC Act</a>).\n\nArguendo, even if the said properties have not obtained the NOC or are\n\nunauthorized; there is a prescribed procedure to take action against/\n\ndemolish, as per the relevant provision of the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_52\">DMC Act</a> which does not\n\ngive any right of inspection to any &#x27;third party&#x27;. For Example, if any\n\nstudent is found using mischievous methods/cheating in a particular\n\nexamination, there is a prescribed procedure to handle such answer\n\nsheets. No third party can claim to hold a right to inspect the said answer\n\nsheets of the student just because there is an allegation of cheating or on\n\nthe grounds that the answer sheet belongs to the body conducting the\n\nexamination. However, third party may claim the right to know the\n\noutcome of any investigation in the matter, which is not the same as\n\nclaiming right to &#x27;inspection&#x27; of third party property under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_53\">RTI Act</a>.\n\nSuch interpretation taken by the Appellant of the Observations of the\n\nApex court in the CBSE case is incorrect. A clear reading of the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_54\">RTI Act</a> concludes that the CIC does not have any\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               10</span>\n   power to direct the Public Authority to allow inspection of the third party\n\n  Properties to the Appellant. Further, nowhere in the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_55\">DMC Act</a> is it\n\n  mentioned that any &#x27;third party&#x27; can be allowed inspection. Commission\n\n  is in agreement with the Submissions of the Respondents that there exist\n\n  a sound mechanism (by providing Delegated Statutory powers to inspect\n\n  under Section 431 and <a href=\"/doc/155617030/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 491</a> of the DMC Act, 1957) to tackle\n\n  encroachment and unauthorized construction and which certainly does\n\n  not confer any power to the CIC to direct any inspection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">9. Further, Respondents have also submitted that the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_57\">Scheme of DMC Act</a>\n\n  provides that any person aggrieved against the action relating to the\n\n  demolitions as explained in <a href=\"/doc/9494205/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 347</a> of the DMC Act can approach\n\n  the Tribunal specially constituted in this regard and presided by the\n\n  Judicial Officer of the rank of Additional District Judge. The said tribunal\n\n  functions from Tis Hazari Courts and hears the appeals against the\n\n  Orders of the MCD. Therefore, if another statutory provision, created\n\n  under any other law, vests the right to seek information and provides the\n\n  mechanism for invoking the said right (which is also statutory, as in this\n\n  case) that mechanism should be preserved and operated, and not\n\n  destroyed merely because another general law created to empower the\n\n  citizens to access information has subsequently been framed. Honorable\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 11</span>\n Delhi High Court in the case Registrar of Companies and Ors.v.

It is also\n  defined, inter alia, as &quot;not let go; keep, retain&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">  32. The expression &#x27;control&#x27; is defined in the Advanced Law Lexicon by P.N.\n  Ramanatha Aiyar 3rd Edition Reprint 2009 and it reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">  (As a verb) To restrain; to check; to regulate; to govern; to keep under check;\n  to hold in restraint; to dominate; to rule and direct; to counteract; to exercise a\n  directing, restraining or governing influence over; to govern with reference\n  thereto; to subject to authority; to have under command, and authority over, to\n  have authority over the particular matter. (Ame. Cyc)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">  33. From the above, it appears that the expression &#x27;held by&#x27; or &#x27;under the\n  control of any public authority&#x27;, in relation to &#x27;information&#x27;, means that\n  information which is held by the public authority under its control to the\n  exclusion of others. It cannot mean that information which the public authority\n  has already &#x27;let go&#x27;, i.e. shared generally with the citizens, and also that\n  information, in respect of which there is a statutory mechanism evolved,\n  (independent of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_61\">RTI Act</a>) which obliges the public authority to share the\n  same with the citizenry by following the prescribed procedure, and upon\n  fulfillment of the prescribed conditions. This is so, because in respect of such\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   12</span>\n information, which the public authority is statutorily obliged to disseminate, it\ncannot be said that the public authority &#x27;holds&#x27; or &#x27;controls&#x27; the same. There is\nno exclusivity in such holding or control. In fact, the control vests in the seeker\nof the information who has only to operate the statutorily prescribed\nmechanism to access the information. It is not this kind of information, which\nappears to fall within the meaning of the expression &#x27;right to information&#x27;, as\nthe information in relation to which the &#x27;right to information&#x27; is specifically\nconferred by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_62\">RTI Act</a> is that information which &quot;is held by or under the\ncontrol of any public authority&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">34. The mere prescription of a higher charge in the other statutory mechanism\n(in this case <a href=\"/doc/226241/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act), than that prescribed under the\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_64\">RTI Act</a> does not make any difference whatsoever. The right available to any\nperson to seek inspection/copies of documents under <a href=\"/doc/226241/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 610</a> of the\nCompanies Act is governed by the Companies (Central Government&#x27;s) General\nRules &amp; Forms, 1956, which are statutory rules and prescribe the fees for\ninspection of documents, etc. in Rule 21A. The said rules being statutory in\nnature and specific in their application, do not get overridden by the rules\nframed under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_66\">RTI Act</a> with regard to prescription of fee for supply of\ninformation, which is general in nature, and apply to all kinds of applications\nmade under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_67\">RTI Act</a> to seek information. It would also be complete waste of\npublic funds to require the creation and maintenance of two parallel\nmachineries by the ROC - one under <a href=\"/doc/226241/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act, and the\nother under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_69\">RTI Act</a> to provide the same information to an applicant. It\nwould lead to unnecessary and avoidable duplication of work and consequent\nexpenditure.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">35. The right to information is required to be balanced with the need to\noptimize use of limited fiscal resources. In this context I may refer to the\nrelevant extract of the Preamble to the RTI Act which, inter alia, provides:-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                13</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"> AND WHEREAS revelation of information in actual practice is likely to\nconflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the\nGovernments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation of\nconfidentially of sensitive information;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">AND WHEREAS it is necessary to harmonise these conflicting interests while\npreserving the paramountancy of the democratic ideal;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(emphasis supplied).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">36. <a href=\"/doc/324418/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 4(1)(a)</a> also lays emphasis on availability of recourses, when it talks\nabout computerization of the records. Therefore, in the exploitation and\nimplementation of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_71\">RTI Act</a>, a delicate and reasonable balance is required to\nbe maintained. Nobody can go overboard or loose ones equilibrium and sway in\none direction or assume an extreme position either in favour of upholding the\nright to information granted by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_72\">RTI Act</a>, or to deny the said right.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1548289\" id=\"span_17\">37.

In light of the above, Commission is of the view that the words of\n\n   legislature should not be interpreted beyond its true intent and objective.\n\n   Hence, Appellant cannot construe that Commission has &#x27;plenary power&#x27;\n\n   to direct the Public Authority to allow inspection to any third party (i.e.\n\n   Appellant, in the present case) in absence of any specific provision\n\n   mentioned in the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_76\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">11.However, even assuming           that the CIC had the &#x27;power&#x27; to allow\n\n   inspection, the next issue is that whether the said inspection of the\n\n   properties would amount to information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 2 (f)</a> and whether\n\n   there will be any right to such information under <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 2 (j)</a> of the RTI\n\n   Act.

The intent of the legislature while drafting <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 2 (f)</a> was clear\n\nthat any information held in any form i.e. whether tangible or virtual form\n\nwould amount to information (wider sense). However, inspection of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                          16</span>\n &#x27;information&#x27; would certainly not include private &#x27;house property&#x27; as it\n\nwould lead to interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_85\">section 2 (f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_86\">2 (j)</a> in too liberal a fashion.\n\n\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 2 (f)</a>-&#x27;information&#x27;- material in any form means that any\n\ndocument/record maintained in any tangible/intangible form. Now, if the\n\nMCD already maintains any record in tangible/intangible form of the said\n\nproperties, the same would certainly amount to &#x27;information&#x27; and the\n\ninspection of the same may be provided under <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 2 (j)</a> of the RTI Act\n\n[Subject to provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 8 (1)</a> of the RTI Act]. The above\n\nunderstanding of law is in consonance with the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_90\">Copyright Act, 1957</a> as\n\nmentioned by the Appellant in his submission, since any Copyright exists\n\nonly in the &#x27;work&#x27; which is expressed and not merely is an &#x27;idea in the\n\nmind&#x27;. Similarly, right to inspect particular information resides only with the\n\nmaterial in any form. Mere allegations of encroachment and not obtaining\n\nNOCs would not provide any right to inspect personal spaces to the\n\nAppellant. Also merely because Appellant doubts the integrity and\n\nfunctioning of the Officers of the Public Authority, this cannot be a ground\n\nto allow him inspection under the Act. Appellant is free to approach the\n\nsuitable forums for any such grievance against the Public Authority but\n\ncertainly not under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_91\">RTI Act</a>. Hence, inspection of the private property\n\nby any &#x27;third party&#x27; would not amount to inspection of particular\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                    17</span>\n       &#x27;information&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 2(f)</a>. Commission further observes that the\n\n      properties to be inspected are in &#x27;personal&#x27; capacity and not a &#x27;public\n\n      activity&#x27;. It is only the report/document/sample generated after inspection\n\n      and which is within the domain of the public authority that can be accessed\n\n      under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_93\">RTI Act</a>. &#x27;Any material in any form&#x27; may not be\n\n      equated with the term &#x27;material in ANY FORM&#x27; as such comparison is\n\n      odious in the present case and evidently overreaches the legislative intent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">      12.

Governments action to collect information\n\nrelated to government services such as Taxation, medical, employment,\n\nfingerprints, DNA mapping, and personal communications has evolved and\n\nexpanded. This has led to the concerns about the possibility of abuse of such\n\npersonal information for unlawful purposes. In Griswold v. Connecticut, 381\n\nU.S. 479 (1965), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the\n\nConstitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved a Connecticut\n\nlaw that prohibited the use of contraceptives. By a majority ruling, the\n\nSupreme Court (US) invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the\n\n&quot;right to marital privacy&quot;. Recently, in the case United States v. Jones, U.S\n\n10-1259 (2012), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously\n\nthat government agents violated the Constitution when they tracked a\n\nsuspect for 28 days using a GPS device installed without a warrant.

Rajagopal (supra) held as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                 22</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\"> The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the\ncitizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has\na right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation,\nmotherhood, child bearing and education among other matters.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">Restrictions and Limitations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">47. Right to information and Right to privacy are, therefore, not absolute rights,\nboth the rights, one of which falls under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the other under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, can obviously be regulated, restricted\nand curtailed in the larger public interest. Absolute or uncontrolled individual\nrights do not and cannot exist in any modern State. Citizens&#x27; right to get\ninformation is statutorily recognized by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_121\">RTI Act</a>, but at the same time\nlimitations are also provided in the Act itself, which is discernible from the\nPreamble and other provisions of the Act. First of all, the scope and ambit of\nthe expression &quot;public authority&quot; has been restricted by a statutory definition\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 2(h)</a> limiting it to the categories mentioned therein which\nexhaust itself, unless the context otherwise requires. Citizens, as already\nindicated by us, have a right to get information, but can have access only to the\ninformation &quot;held&quot; and under the &quot;control of public authorities&quot;, with\nlimitations. If the information is not statutorily accessible by a public authority,\nas defined in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act, evidently, those information will not be\nunder the &quot;control of the public authority&quot;. Resultantly, it will not be possible\nfor the citizens to secure access to those information which are not under the\ncontrol of the public authority. Citizens, in that event, can always claim a right\nto privacy, the right of a citizen to access information should be respected, so\nalso a citizen&#x27;s right to privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">48. Public authority also is not legally obliged to give or provide information\neven if it is held, or under its control, if that information falls under Clause (j)\nof Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 8</a>. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is of considerable importance so\nfar as this case is concerned, hence given below, for ready reference:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                     23</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\"> 8.

Even\nif, there is any indication to the contrary, still there is no obligation on the\npublic authority to give information to any citizen of what has been mentioned\nin Clauses (a) to (j). Public authority, as already indicated, cannot access all the\ninformation from a private individual, but only those information which he is\nlegally obliged to pass on to a public authority by law, and also only those\ninformation to which the public authority can have access in accordance with\nlaw. Even those information, if personal in nature, can be made available only\nsubject to the limitations provided in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 8(j)</a> of the RTI Act. Right to be left\nalone, as propounded in Olmstead v. The United States reported in 1927 (277)\nUS 438 is the most comprehensive of the rights and most valued by civilized\nman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_34\">50. Recognizing the fact that the right to privacy is a sacrosanct facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_128\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution, the legislation has put a lot of safeguards to protect the\nrights Under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 8(j)</a>, as already indicated. If the information sought for is\npersonal and has no relationship with any public activity or interest or it will\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                 24</span>\n       not sub-serve larger public interest, the public authority or the officer\n      concerned is not legally obliged to provide those information. Reference may be\n      made to a recent judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_130\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.\n      Central Information Commissioner and Ors. MANU/SC/0816/2012</a> : (2013) 1\n      SCC 212, wherein this Court held that since there is no bona fide public\n      interest in seeking information, the disclosure of said information would cause\n      unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual Under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n      Act. Further, if the authority finds that information sought for can be made\n      available in the larger public interest, then the officer should record his reasons\n      in writing before providing the information, because the person from whom\n      information is sought for, has also a right to privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_132\">Article\n      21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">      ...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175012216\" id=\"span_36\">53. Consequently, an information which has been sought for relates to personal\n      information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity\n      or interest or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the\n      individual, the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, even if he has got that\n      information, is not bound to furnish the same to an applicant, unless he is\n      satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such\n      information, that too, for reasons to be recorded in writing...&quot;\n\n\n\n\nFurther Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in the case <a href=\"/doc/175012216/\" id=\"a_133\">UPSC v. R K Jain (WP</a> no\n\n1243/2011) dated 13 July 2012 had observed that:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">      &quot;...14. The principal contention of the Petitioner, right from the stage when the\n      RTI application was considered by the CPIO up till the stage of consideration\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                      25</span>\n of the Second Appeal before the CIC, was that the information sought for by\nthe Respondent is exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\nTherefore, I proceed to deal with it first.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">15. The exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is available in respect of &quot;personal\ninformation&quot; of an individual. For the exemption to come into operation, the\npersonal information sought:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">(i) Should not have relation to any public activity, or to public interest OR,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">(ii) Should be such as to cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the\nindividual. However, the exemption is not available in a case where larger\npublic interest justifies such disclosure.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">16. The word &quot;personal&quot; means appertaining to the person; belonging to an\nindividual; limited to the person; having the nature or partaking of the qualities\nof human beings, or of movable property. [See Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, Sixth\nEdition].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">17. The word &quot;information&quot; is defined in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 2(f)</a> of the Act as meaning:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails,\nopinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports,\npapers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and\ninformation relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public\nauthority under any other law for the time being in force.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">18. Therefore, &quot;personal information&quot; under the Act, would be information, as\nset forth above, that pertains to a person. As such it takes into its fold possibly\nevery kind of information relating to the person. Now, such personal\ninformation of the person may, or may not, have relation to any public activity,\nor to public interest. At the same time, such personal information may, or may\nnot, be private to the person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                 26</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\"> 19. The term &quot;personal information&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_137\">section 8(1)(j)</a> does not mean\ninformation relating to the information seeker, or the public authority, but\nabout a third party. The section exempts from disclosure personal information,\nincluding that which would cause &quot;unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the\nindividual&quot;. If one were to seek information about himself, the question of\ninvasion of his own privacy would not arise. It would only arise where the\ninformation sought relates to a third party. Consequently, the exemption under\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is as regards third party personal information only.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">20. Further, the personal information cannot be that of a &quot;public authority&quot;.\nNo public authority can claim that any information held by it is personal to it.\nThere is nothing &quot;personal&quot; about any information held by a public authority\nin relation to itself. The expression &quot;personal information&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 8(1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">(j) means information personal to any &quot;person&quot;, that the public authority may\nhold. For instance, a public authority may in connection with its functioning\nrequire any other person to provide information which may be personal to that\nperson. It is that information, pertaining to that other person, which the public\nauthority may refuse to disclose, if the information sought satisfies the\nconditions set out in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act, i.e., if such\ninformation has no relationship to any public activity (of the person who has\nprovided the information, or who is the source of the information, or to whom\nthat information pertains), or to public interest, or which would cause\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual (unless larger public\ninterest justifies disclosure). The use of the words &quot;invasion of the privacy of\nthe individual&quot;, instead of &quot;an individual&quot;, shows that the legislative intent was\nto connect the expression &quot;personal information&quot; with the word &quot;individual&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">21. Merely because information that may be personal to a third party is held by\na public authority, a querist does not become entitled to access it, unless the\nsaid personal information has a relationship to a public activity of the third\nperson (to whom it relates), or to public interest. If it is private informtaion (i.e.\nit is personal information which impinges on the privacy of the third party), its\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                 27</span>\n disclosure would not be made unless larger public interest dictates it.\nTherefore, for example, a querist cannot seek the personal or private\nparticulars provided by a third party in his application made to the passport\nauthorities in his application to obtain a passport, merely because such\ninformation is available with the passport authorities, which is a public\nauthority under the Act. The querist must make out a case (in his application\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 6</a> of the Act) justifying the disclosure of the information sought\non the touchstone of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">22. Proceeding further, I now examine the expressions &quot;Public activity&quot;,\n&quot;Public interest&quot; and &quot;Privacy of the individual&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">23. &quot;Public activity&quot; qua a person are those activities which are performed by\nthe person in discharge of a public duty, i.e. in the public domain. There is an\ninherent public interest involved in the discharge of such activities, as all public\nduties are expected to be discharged in public interest. Consequently,\ninformation of a person which is related to, or has a bearing on his public\nactivities, is not exempt from disclosure under the scheme and provisions of the\nAct, whose primary object is to ensure an informed citizenry and transparency\nof information and also to contain corruption. For example, take the case of a\nsurgeon employed in a Government Hospital who performs surgeries on his\npatients who are coming to the government hospital. His personal information,\nrelating to discharge of his public duty, i.e. his public activity, is not exempt\nfrom disclosure under the Act. Such information could include information\nrelating to his physical and mental health, his qualifications etc., as the said\ninformation has a bearing on the discharge of his public duty, but would not\ninclude his other personal information such as, his taste in music, sport, art, his\nfamily, his family background etc., which has no bearing/relation to his act of\nperforming his duties as a surgeon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                 28</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\"> 24. &quot;Public interest&quot; is also a ground for taking away the exemption from\ndisclosure of personal information. Therefore, a querist may seek personal\ninformation of a person from a public authority in public interest. The second\nhalf of the first part of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 8(1)</a> shows that when personal\ninformation in respect of a person is sought, the authority concerned shall\nweigh the competing claims i.e., the claim for the protection of personal\ninformation of the concerned person on the one hand, and the claim of public\ninterest on the other, and if &quot;public interest&quot; justifies disclosure, i.e., the public\ninterest outweighs the need for protection of personal information, the\nconcerned authority shall disclose the information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">25. For example, a querist may seek from the income tax authorities- the details\nof the income tax returns filed by private individual/juristic entity - if the\nquerist can justify the disclosure of such personal information on the anvil of\npublic interest. The authorities would, in such cases, be cautious to ensure that\nthe ground of &quot;public interest&quot; is not routinely used as a garb by busy bodies to\npry on the personal affairs of individual private citizens/entities, as it would be\nagainst public interest (and not in public interest) to permit such personal\ninformation of third parties to fall into the hands of anybody or everybody.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">26. At this stage, I may digress a little and observe that whenever the querist\napplicant wishes to seek information, the disclosure of which can be made only\nupon existence of certain special circumstances, for example- the existence of\npublic interest, the querist should in the application (moved under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 6</a> of\nthe Act) disclose/ plead the special circumstance, so that the PIO concerned can\napply his mind to it, and, in case he decides to issue notice to the concerned\nthird party under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 11</a> of the Act, the third party is able to effectively deal\nwith the same. Only then the PIO/appellate authority/CIC would be able to\ncome to an informed decision whether, or not, the special circumstances exist\nin a given case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 29</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\"> 27. I may also observe that public interest does not mean that which is\ninteresting as gratifying curiosity or love of information or amusement; but that\nin which a class of the community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest\nby which their rights or liabilities are affected. The expression &quot;public interest&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">is not capable of a precise definition and has not a rigid meaning and is elastic\nand takes its colors from the statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with\nthe time and the state of the society and its needs. [See Advanced Law Lexicon,\nThird Edition].\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">28. The second part of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 8(1)</a> appears to deal with the scope\nof defence founded on the right of privacy of an individual. The tussle between\nthe right of privacy of an individual and the right of others to seek information\nwhich may impinge on the said right of privacy, is what the said clause seeks to\naddress.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">29. The right to privacy means the right to be left alone and the right of a\nperson to be free from unwarranted publicity. Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary says that\nthe terms &quot;right to privacy&quot; is a generic term encompassing various rights\nrecognized to be inherent in concept of ordered liberty, and such rights prevent\ngovernment interference in intimate personal relationship&#x27;s or activities,\nfreedoms of individual to make fundamental choices involving himself, his\nfamily, and his relationship with others. A man has the right to pass through\nthis world, if he wills, without having his picture published, his business\nenterprises discussed, his successful experiments written for the benefit of\nothers, or his eccentricities commented upon by any means or mode. It is based\non the theory that everyone has the right of inviolability of the person.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">30. The &quot;right to privacy&quot;, even though by itself has not been defined by our\nConstitution and though, as a concept, it may be too broad to define judicially,\nthe Supreme Court has recognised by its liberal interpretation that &quot;right to\nprivacy&quot; is an integral part of the right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                30</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"> 31. In Rajagopal vs. State of Tamil Nadu, MANU/SC/0056/1995 : AIR 1995 SC\n264, the Supreme Court had the occasion to comment on the origin, basis,\nnature and scope of the right to privacy in India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_43\">Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan\nReddy, referred to the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Kharak Singh\nand Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors., MANU/SC/0085/1962 : 1964 (1)\nSCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 129 and the decision in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_149\">Gobind v. State of Madhya\nPradesh, MANU/SC/0119/1975</a> : 1975 (2) SCC 148: AIR 1975 SC 1378.</span> In the\nlater case, Mathew, J., speaking for himself, Krishna Iyer and Goswami, JJ.\ntraced the origins of this right and also pointed out how the said right has been\ndealt with by the United States Supreme Court in two of its well-known\ndecisions in Griswold v. Connecticut, [1965] 385 U.S. 479 : 14 L.Ed. 2d. 510\nand Roe v. Wade, [1973] 410 U.S. 113. After referring to Kharak Singh (supra)\nand the said American decisions, the learned Judge stated the law in the\nfollowing words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">... privacy-dignity claims deserve to be examined with care and to be denied\nonly when an important countervailing interest is shown to be superior. If the\nCourt does find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a fundamental\nprivacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the compelling State interest\ntest....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">...privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore relates to and overlaps\nwith the concept of liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy must confess\nthat there are serious problems of defining the essence and scope of the right.\nPrivacy interest in autonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights\nand values.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal intimacies of the\nhome, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child rearing. This\ncatalogue approach to the question is obviously not as instructive as it does not\ngive analytical picture of the distinctive characterstics of the right of privacy.\nPerhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying principle\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                31</span>\n underlying the concept has been the assertion that a claimed right must be a\nfundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">There are two possible theories for protecting privacy of home. The first is that\nactivities in the home harm others only to the extent that they cause offence\nresulting from the mere thought that individuals might be engaging in such\nactivities and that such &#x27;harm&#x27; is not constitutionally protectible by the State.\nThe second is that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they can be free\nfrom societal control. The importance of such a sanctuary is that individuals\ncan drop the mask, desist for a while from projecting on the world the image\nthey want to be accepted as themselves, an image that may reflect the values of\ntheir peers rather than the realities of their natures. [See 26 Stanford Law Rev.\n1161, 1187].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process\nof case-by-case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to\npersonal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and\nthe freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation\nfrom them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think\nthat the right is absolute.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">The European Convention on Human Rights, which came into force on\nSeptember 3, 1953, represents a valiant attempt to tackle the new problem.\n<a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 8</a> of the Convention is worth citing [See &quot;Privacy and Human Rights&quot;,\nEd.

A citizen\nhas a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage,\nprocreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent -\nwhether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so,\nhe would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be\nliable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person\nvoluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a\ncontroversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\nconcerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication\nis based upon public records including court records. This is for the reason that\nonce a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\nsubsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media\namong others. We are, however, of the opinion that in the interest of decency\n[<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 19 (2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who\nis the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not\nfurther be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident being\npublicised in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">(3) There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above - indeed, this is not\nan exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is\nobvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                  33</span>\n simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\ndischarge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based\nupon facts and statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\nthat the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for\ntruth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the\npress or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the\nfacts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of\ncourse, where the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\npersonal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be liable\nfor damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge\nof his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen,\nas explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is\nprotected by the power to punish for contempt of court and the Parliament and\nLegislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_153\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_154\">104</a>\nrespectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">33. It follows that the &quot;privacy&quot; of a person, or in other words his &quot;private\ninformation&quot;, encompasses the personal intimacies of the home, the family,\nmarriage, motherhood, procreation, child rearing and of the like nature.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">&quot;Personal information&quot;, on the other hand, as aforesaid, would be\ninformation, in any form, that pertains to an individual. Therefore, &quot;private\ninformation&quot; is a part of &quot;personal information&quot;. All that is private is personal,\nbut all that is personal may not be private. A person has a right to keep his\nprivate information, or in other words, his privacy guarded from disclosure. It\nis this right which has come to be recognised as fundamental to a person&#x27;s life\nand liberty, and is accordingly protected from unwarranted/unauthorised\ninvasion under the Act, and can be overridden only in &quot;larger&quot; public interest.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">34. The use of the expression &quot;unwarranted&quot; before &quot;invasion of the privacy of\nthe individual&quot; and the expression &quot;larger&quot; before &quot;public interest&quot; needs\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                 34</span>\n attention. The use of &quot;unwarranted&quot;, as aforesaid, shows that the PIO,\nAppellate Authority or the CIC, as the case may be, should come to a definite\nfinding upon application of mind to all the relevant considerations and\nsubmissions of the querist and the third party - whose privacy is at stake, that\nthe disclosure of the information, which would cause invasion of the privacy of\nthe individual is warranted, in the facts of the case. He should, therefore, come\nto the conclusion that even after application of the principle of severability\n(contained in <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 10</a> of the Act), it is necessary to disclose the personal and\nprivate information in larger public interest. The expression &quot;larger public\ninterest&quot; connotes that the public interest that is sought to be addressed by the\ndisclosure of the private information, serves a large section of the public, and\nnot just a small section thereof. Therefore, if the information has a bearing on\nthe state of the economy; the moral values in the society; the environment;\nnational safety, or the like, the same would qualify as &quot;larger public interest&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">35. Take for instance, a case where a person is employed to work in an\norphanage or a children&#x27;s home having small children as inmates. The\nemployer may or may not be a public authority under the Act. That person, i.e.\nthe employee, has a background of child abuse, for which he has undergone\npsychiatric treatment in a government hospital. A querist could seek\ninformation regarding the medical and psychiatric treatment undergone by the\nperson concerned from the government hospital where the person has\nundergone treatment, in larger public interest, even though the said\ninformation is not only personal, but private, vis--vis. the employee. The larger\npublic interest in such a case would lay in protecting the children living in the\norphanage/ children&#x27;s home from possible child abuse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">36. In light of the above discussion, the following principles emerge for the\nexemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> to apply:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                35</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">          (i) The information sought must relate to &quot;Personal information&quot; as\n         understood above of a third party.

If the information sought relates to\n         public activity of the third party, i.e. to his activities falling within the public\n         domain, the exemption would not apply. Similarly, if the disclosure of the\n         personal information is found justified in public interest, the exemption would\n         be lifted, otherwise not;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">         OR\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">         (iii) (b) The disclosure of the information would cause unwarranted invasion of\n         the privacy of the individual, and that there is no larger public interest involved\n         in such disclosure....&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_49\">13.

RIGHT TO INFORMATION VIS-À-VIS RIGHT TO PRIVACY\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">         110. The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept originated\n         in the field of Tort law, under which the new cause of action for damages\n         resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy was recognized. This right has two\n         aspects: (i) The ordinary law of privacy which affords a tort action for damages\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                          36</span>\n resulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy and (ii) the constitutional\nrecognition given to the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against\nunlawful government invasion. Right to privacy is not enumerated as a\nfundamental right in our Constitution but has been inferred from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 21.</a>\nThe first decision of the Supreme Court dealing with this aspect is Kharak\nSingh v. State of UP MANU/SC/0085/1962 : AIR 1963 SC 1295. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_51\">A more\nelaborate appraisal of this right took place in later decisions in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_159\">Gobind v. State\nof MP MANU/SC/0119/1975</a> : (1975) 2 SCC 148, R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N.\nMANU/SC/0056/1995 : (1994) 6 SCC 632 and District Registrar and Collector\nv. Canara Bank MANU/SC/0935/2004 : (2005) 1 SCC 496.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">111. The freedom of information principle holds that, generally speaking, every\ncitizen should have the right to obtain access to government records. The\nunderlying rationale most frequently offered in support of the principle are,\nfirst, that the right of access will heighten the accountability of government and\nits agencies to the electorate; second, that it will enable interested citizens to\ncontribute more effectively to debate on important questions of public policy;\nand third, that it will conduce to fairness in administrative decision-making\nprocesses affecting individuals. The protection of privacy principle, on the other\nhand, holds in part at least that individuals should, generally speaking, have\nsome control over the use made by others, especially government agencies, of\ninformation concerning themselves. Thus, one of the cardinal principles of\nprivacy protection is that personal information acquired for one purpose should\nnot be used for another purpose without the consent of the individual to whom\nthe information pertains. The philosophy underlying the privacy protection\nconcern links personal autonomy to the control of data concerning oneself and\nsuggests that the modern acceleration of personal data collection, especially by\ngovernment agencies, carries with it a potential threat to a valued and\nfundamental aspect of our traditional freedoms.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">112. The right to information often collides with the right to privacy. The\ngovernment stores a lot of information about individuals in its dossiers supplied\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                37</span>\n by individuals in applications made for obtaining various licences, permissions\nincluding passports, or through disclosures such as income tax returns or for\ncensus data. When an applicant seeks access to government records containing\npersonal information concerning identifiable individuals, it is obvious that\nthese two rights are capable of generating conflict. In some cases this will\ninvolve disclosure of information pertaining to public officials. In others, it will\ninvolve disclosure of information concerning ordinary citizens. In each\ninstance, the subject of the information can plausibly raise a privacy protection\nconcern. As one American writer said one man&#x27;s freedom of information is\nanother man&#x27;s invasion of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER SECTION 8(1)(j)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">113. The right to information, being integral part of the right to freedom of\nspeech, is subject to restrictions that can be imposed upon that right under\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 19(2).</a> The revelation of information in actual practice is likely to\nconflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the\nGovernment, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation of\nconfidentiality of sensitive information and, therefore, with a view to harmonize\nthese conflicting interests while preserving the paramountacy of the democratic\nideal, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 8</a> has been enacted for providing certain exemptions from\ndisclosure of information. <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 8</a> contains a well defined list of ten kinds of\nmatters that cannot be made public. A perusal of the aforesaid provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 8</a> reveals that there are certain information contained in Sub-clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">(a), (b), (c), (f),(g) and (h), for which there is no obligation for giving such an\ninformation to any citizen; whereas information protected under Sub-clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">(d), (e) and (j) are protected information, but on the discretion and satisfaction\nof the competent authority that it would be in larger public interest to disclose\nsuch information, such information can be disclosed. These information, thus,\nhave limited protection, the disclosure of which is dependent upon the\nsatisfaction of the competent authority that it would be in larger public interest\nas against the protected interest to disclose such information.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                 38</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\"> 114. There is an inherent tension between the objective of freedom of\ninformation and the objective of protecting personal privacy. These objectives\nwill often conflict when an applicant seeks access for personal information\nabout a third party. The conflict poses two related challenges for law makers;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">first, to determine where the balance should be struck between these aims; and,\nsecondly, to determine the mechanisms for dealing with requests for such\ninformation. The conflict between the right to personal privacy and the public\ninterest in the disclosure of personal information was recognized by the\nlegislature by exempting purely personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of\nthe Act. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> says that disclosure may be refused if the request\npertains to &quot;personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship\nto any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of\nthe privacy of the individual.&quot; Thus, personal information including tax\nreturns, medical records etc. cannot be disclosed in view of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of\nthe Act. If, however, the applicant can show sufficient public interest in\ndisclosure, the bar (preventing disclosure) is lifted and after duly notifying the\nthird party ( i.e. the individual concerned with the information or whose records\nare sought) and after considering his views, the authority can disclose it. The\nnature of restriction on the right of privacy, however, as pointed out by the\nlearned single Judge, is of a different order; in the case of private individuals,\nthe degree of protection afforded to be greater; in the case of public servants,\nthe degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at stake. This is so\nbecause a public servant is expected to act for the public good in the discharge\nof his duties and is accountable for them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">115. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_167\">The Act</a> makes no distinction between an ordinary individual and a public\nservant or public official. As pointed out by the learned single Judge &quot;----- an\nindividual&#x27;s or citizen&#x27;s fundamental rights, which include right to privacy - are\nnot subsumed or extinguished if he accepts or holds public office.&quot; <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 8(1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">(j) ensures that all information furnished to public authorities - including\npersonal information [such as asset disclosures] are not given blanket access.\nWhen a member of the public requests personal information about a public\nservant, - such as asset declarations made by him - a distinction must be made\nbetween personal data inherent to the person and those that are not, and,\ntherefore, affect his/her private life. To quote the words of the learned single\nJudge &quot;if public servants ---- are obliged to furnish asset declarations, the mere\nfact that they have to furnish such declaration would not mean that it is part of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                39</span>\n       public activity, or &quot;interest&quot;. ----- That the public servant has to make\n      disclosures is a part of the system&#x27;s endeavour to appraise itself of potential\n      asset acquisitions which may have to be explained properly. However, such\n      acquisitions can be made legitimately; no law bars public servants from\n      acquiring properties or investing their income. The obligation to disclose these\n      investments and assets is to check the propensity to abuse a public office, for a\n      private gain.&quot; Such personal information regarding asset disclosures need not\n      be made public, unless public interest considerations dictates it, under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_169\">Section\n      8(1)(j)</a>. This safeguard is made in public interest in favor of all public officials\n      and public servants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">14.    In light of the above Judgments, Commission is of the view that the\n\nsaid inspection of the properties would certainly attract <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of\n\nthe RTI Act as it would invade the privacy of the owner/occupant(s) of the\n\nsaid property which is a Fundamental right enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_171\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India and such &#x27;inspection&#x27; does not have any\n\nrelationship to any Public Activity or interest specially in the presence of\n\nalternate mechanism to carry out such inspection by the MCD officials as\n\nper the <a href=\"/doc/115807286/\" id=\"a_172\">Provisions of the DMC Act</a>. On the contrary, allowing such\n\ninspection of the personal property to &#x27;third party&#x27; under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_173\">RTI Act</a> may\n\ninculcate the &#x27;misuse&#x27; of this privileged transparency right which will not be\n\nin the larger public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                      40</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\"> 15.
