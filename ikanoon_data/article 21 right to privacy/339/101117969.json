To an average tourist, Kerala is famous for toddy,\n\nbut, the operation of toddy shops does not bring cheer to\n\nthe residents in the neighbourhood of such toddy shops. The\n\nState of Kerala is known to be a consumer State and its\n\nexponential     growth   in   lifestyle   has   thrown   up   many\n\nchallenges on the social front. Toddy shops run in the\n\nprimitive style have become an eyesore to its neighbours. In\n\nsocial life, anything that is lopsided or degenerated in\n\nquality is decried in different forms.      These writ petitions\n\nresemble a cause for those values cared and nurtured by\n\nKeralites.     The issue of privacy was not raised as the main\n\nissue in these writ petitions. These writ petitions filed\n\nfor different reliefs in varied grounds, urge the common\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    -:2:-</span>\n\n\nconcern in regard to the pain and suffering faced by each\n\none of them on account of the location of toddy shops near\n\nto their houses. This Court, realising that this is related\n\nmore to the privacy of those individuals, decided to proceed\n\nwith the issues raised in these writ petitions on a broader\n\nparameter to assimilate the concern within the frame of the\n\nright to privacy. To further the Court&#x27;s enquiry, this Court\n\nappointed two lawyers of this Court as amici curiae.     Sri.\n\nR.T.Pradeep, a seasoned lawyer of this Court and a young\n\nlawyer Sri.Ashok Kini were appointed as amici curiae.   Their\n\ncontribution to deciding this case is immense.

The petitioner states that\n\nthe persons who are coming to the toddy shop cause nuisance\n\nto   her.     She    raised     various       complaints.           She    also   had\n\napproached this Court in W.P.(C) No.6559/2014.

The   Excise      Commissioner         passed       Ext.P7    order       dated\n\n05.02.2015 on the representation. The Excise Commissioner\n\nwas satisfied that nuisance is being generated and ordered\n\nshifting of the toddy shop to another location. The Excise\n\ncommissioner had also observed in the order that the toddy\n\nshop    is   being     run    since   more      than       20   years     and    Laisy\n\nSanthosh had started living in the area only five years ago.\n\nPerhaps while deciding such a dispute in a civil court\n\ncomplaining of a civil wrong, subsequent residence after the\n\ngeneration of nuisance would have an impact on the relief\n\nsought.      However, this has to be examined in the perspective\n\nof   declaring       right     to   privacy     as     a    fundamental         right.\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         -:4:-</span>\n\n\nTherefore, this Court has to deal with the issue separately\n\nin    the     latter      part      of    this     judgment.

This    task\n\nessentially is a fact finding.                     The challenge to privacy may\n\narise in different forms and different contexts.                             Privacy\n\nbeing    an    issue     primarily          focussed      on   the   guarantee   to\n\npersonal life and personal liberty of individuals concerned\n\nto protect freedom as well as dignity, the Court has to\n\nassimilate values, interest, and ethos that would subserve\n\nthe normative aspiration of a human.                      It may be appropriate\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                    -:17:-</span>\n\n\nto refer some of the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in Puttusamy&#x27;s case supra which are as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">. Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which\nemerges primarily from the guarantee of life and personal\nliberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.      Elements of\nprivacy also arise in varying contexts from the other facets\nof   freedom and dignity recognized and guaranteed by the\nfundamental rights contained in Part III.\n.    Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity.\nPrivacy has both a normative and a descriptive function. At\na normative level, privacy subserves those eternal values\nupon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are\nfounded. At a descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle\nof entitlements and interests which lie at the foundation of\nordered liberty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">.    Privacy includes at its core the preservation of\npersonal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage,\nprocreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also\nconnotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards\nindividual autonomy and recognises the ability of the\nindividual to control vital aspects of his or her life.\nPersonal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to\nprivacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the\nplurality and diversity of our culture.\n.    While the legitimate expectation of privacy may vary\nfrom the intimate zone to the private zone and from the\nprivate to the public arenas, it is important to underscore\nthat privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the\nindividual is in a public place. Privacy attaches to the\nperson since it is an essential facet of the dignity of the\nhuman being.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">.    An invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the\nthree-fold requirement of (i) legality, which postulates the\nexistence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\nlegitimate state aim; and (iii) proportionality which\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                      -:18:-</span>\n\n\nensures a rational nexus between the objects and the means\nadopted to achieve them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">.    Privacy has both positive and negative content: The\nnegative content restrains the State from committing an\nintrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen.\nIts positive content imposes an obligation on the State to\ntake all necessary measures to protect the privacy of the\nindividual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">The standards for assessment of violation of fundamental\n\nrights and human rights are more or less the same.                            The\n\nhuman     rights     jurisprudence         focuses     on   rights    of    human\n\navailable       collectively         and       derivation   of   such      rights\n\nindividually        to    human.       This       co-relation    of   group     or\n\ncollective        rights       and    derivative        individual         rights,\n\ndistinguish the breach between fundamental right and civil\n\nwrong.       If the rights cannot be claimed as a collective\n\nright or common to all, any such wrong on an individual\n\nwould be short of protected right as a fundamental right.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">Thus, violation of privacy must have an immutable character\n\navailable to the group or collective.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">       17.    In a challenge based on infringement of privacy,\n\nthe first task upon the constitutional court is to classify\n\nthe nature of the action complained.                  On the classification\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                      -:19:-</span>\n\n\nof such action, the Court has to find out whether such\n\naction complained is sufficient to harm the citizen from\n\nenjoying his life with dignity or amenities which he was\n\nenjoying before the action complained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">       18.    The     Court    cannot     lay      exhaustive       standards       or\n\nnorms for evaluation of infringement of privacy rights, but\n\ncertainly the Court can lay down rules that would require to\n\nenunciate      such    assessment.             There    are    judgments      of   the\n\nEuropean      Court     of    Human    Rights      (&#x27;ECtHR&#x27;        for   short)     as\n\nguiding factors.            This can have a bearing in Indian context\n\nas   well,      as    the     human   rights       jurisprudence         is   having\n\nuniversal       application.            There          is     no   difficulty       in\n\nincorporating human rights jurisprudence developed in Europe\n\nor elsewhere while amplifying fundamental right garbed in\n\nthe form of human right subject to any limitation placed\n\nunder the Constitution.               As the values of human rights in\n\nthe organic process evolve principles for governance in\n\nConstitutional democracy, it lays down foundation for the\n\nfundamental rights through declaration under the written\n\nConstitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\"> W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                       -:20:-</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">       19.

ECtHR, after adverting\n\nto the nature of nuisance caused, observed that the State\n\nshould     succeed      in   striking         a   fair   balance   between   the\n\ninterest      of    town     economic        well-being    -   that   of   waste\n\ntreatment plant - and the applicant&#x27;s effective enjoyment of\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                      -:22:-</span>\n\n\nher right to respect for her home and her private and family\n\nlife.

The\n\nCourt said that mere declaration of the neighbourhood as an\n\nacoustically saturated zone would not be sufficient.                             There\n\nmust be a real action to protect the rights in an effective\n\nmanner.        In    the      case    of    Dees     v.

The Court relying upon Moreno Gomez&#x27;s\n\ncase (supra) observed that <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 8</a> would come into play\n\nnot only when there is direct interference by the public\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                        -:24:-</span>\n\n\nauthority but also in circumstances where authorities fail\n\nto take action to put a stop to third parties&#x27; breaches of\n\nthe rights relied upon by the applicant.                      This approach is\n\nmore parallel to the horizontal application of fundamental\n\nrights against private parties action.                   In case of Fadeyeva\n\nv. Russia [Application No.55723/00], the applicant alleged\n\nthat concentration of toxic elements and noise levels in the\n\nsanitary      security       zone    exceeded      the   maximum    permissible\n\nlimits established by the Russian legislation and therefore,\n\nsought resettlement of residents outside the zone.                             The\n\nCourt    observed      that     State      is    required    to   take   positive\n\nmeasures and, the choice of means is in principle a matter\n\nthat     falls      within     the      Contracting      State&#x27;s     margin     of\n\nappreciation. There are different avenues to ensure &quot;respect\n\nfor private life&quot;, and if the State has failed to apply one\n\nparticular measure provided by domestic law, it may still\n\nfulfil its positive duty by other means.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">       22.    The    State    being      the     protector    and   guardian    of\n\nfundamental rights is not only obliged to take positive\n\nmeasures as against breach of fundamental rights in any of\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                          -:25:-</span>\n\n\nits action which may result in denial or infringement of\n\nrights of the citizen, it is bound to take same measures\n\nwhen similar infringement arises as the result of private\n\nactions     as    well.     The         sale    or    vending      of     liquor      is   a\n\ncontrolled activity of the State.

Having extrapolated the privacy rights in human\n\nrights jurisprudence, the task of this Court is to elucidate\n\nthe impact assessment of privacy rights. The privacy rights\n\nare   contextually         relevant            upon   the    values       in    a    social\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                       -:26:-</span>\n\n\nstructure to recognize as a distinct and irreducible right.\n\nIt must be able to strike a balance between the legally\n\nrecognized rights of an individual and the larger interest\n\nor collective interest of the social structure. Privacy\n\nrights     cannot      be    recognized         to   promote   the    individual\n\ninterest to deny the rights of others. Therefore, it must\n\nseek to promote public morality and social morality of the\n\ngiven social structure. The ethos of the individual may vary\n\neven to the extent of derogation of social morality or\n\npublic morality. Privacy rights are not to support such\n\nindividual ethos.           Privacy rights are basic rights derived\n\nfrom the ultimate values declared in the Constitution. It\n\nmust be broad enough to encapsulate individual identity or\n\ndignity     on    a    larger       frame       of   constitutional    morality.\n\nLocation of toddy shop in any residential area may invite\n\nconflicts of interest in varied forms. Toddy shop in the\n\nneighbourhood of a luxurious mansions may be disliked by\n\nrich men, who are living there. It may look like a rotten\n\napple spoiling the bunch.               That cannot be the criteria for\n\nthe assessment of violation of privacy rights. ECtHR adopted\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                        -:27:-</span>\n\n\nassessment based on a &#x27;threshold severity test&#x27;.                         This test\n\nrefers     to    the   minimum        level      of   severity    of   the    action\n\ncomplained. That means to say, in the context of a breach of\n\nprivacy, it must have a direct immediate consequence to the\n\napplicants&#x27; right to respect for their homes. The gravity\n\nand severity of nuisance of the complained action is the\n\nbenchmark for assessment of violation of privacy rights\n\nprotected as fundamental rights. Anything short of such\n\nseverity can be treated only as a civil wrong. In Fadeyeva&#x27;s\n\ncase (supra), ECtHR referred to &quot;the assessment of a noise\n\npollution and said that the assessment of that minimum is\n\nrelative        and    depends        on    all       the    circumstances:       the\n\nnuisance&#x27;s intensity and duration, its physical or mental\n\neffects, the general context, and whether the detriment\n\ncomplained        of    was         negligible        in    comparison       to   the\n\nenvironmental hazards inherent to life in a modern city.&quot;\n\nSimilarly,        in    Galev         and     Others        v.   Bulgaria     (Dec.)\n\n[Application No.18324/04], the same court opined that the\n\nalleged nuisances must be sufficiently serious to affect\n\nadversely the applicants&#x27; enjoyment of the amenities of\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                         -:28:-</span>\n\n\ntheir homes and the quality of their private and family\n\nlives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      24.

If this negative test brings an\n\naffirmative result, then it has to be assumed that the\n\naction would affect the privacy right of the individual on\n\nlocating toddy shop in the neighbourhood. An affirmative\n\nresult must indicate that the individual is able to lead a\n\nnormal     life    with     the     amenities   that   would   be   otherwise\n\navailable to him.

The    breach         of   privacy     rights   as    referred   in\n\naforenoted paragraphs essentially require a fact finding.\n\nThe constitutional court has the limitation of its own in\n\nentering      into     fact    finding.            The   Kerala    Abkari   Shops\n\nDisposal Rules, 2002 confers power on the Commissioner of\n\nExcise to order transfer of shops or to close the shops in\n\npublic peace or morality or on grounds of expediency (See\n\nRule 7(3)].         Therefore, there may not be any difficulty for\n\nthe Excise Commissioner to entertain any complaint alleging\n\ninfringement of privacy rights.                    The above provision itself\n\nwould take care of the issue relatable to the privacy.\n\nApart from that, an individual concern also can approach the\n\nHuman Rights Commission to redress their grievances.\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                         -:31:-</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">      26.

W.P.(C).Nos.29704/2015 &amp; 2213/2018: In these\n\ncases, the Excise Commissioner, on finding that the location\n\nof toddy shop is only one and a half meter distance from the\n\nresidential building ordered shifting of toddy shop.                                This\n\norder was passed invoking Rule 7(3) of the Kerala Abkari\n\nShops     Disposal      Rules,      2002.            The     licensee      filed   W.P.\n\n(C).No.2213/2018 challenging the order.                             The case of the\n\nlicensee is that the residential building was put much long\n\nafter the establishment of toddy shop and, therefore, the\n\nowner     of     the     residential              building     is    estopped       from\n\nchallenging the location of the toddy shop.                           Further, it is\n\ncontended       that     there      is     no      complaint        from   any     other\n\nneighbouring residential owners, except by the petitioner.\n\nThe licensee placed reliance on a report of the Excise\n\nInspector Vaikom dated 8.12.2015.                      This report states that\n\nexcept      Laisy      Santhosh,         the        writ     petitioner      in     W.P.\n\n(C).No.29704/2015, no other persons in the neighbourhood\n\nhave raised any complaint.                This report also states that the\n W.P.(C) No.25901/2018 and c.cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                    -:32:-</span>\n\n\nlicensee has agreed to shift the toddy shop to another\n\nbuilding. The point to be considered is by applying minimum\n\nlevels severity test, the privacy rights of the neighbouring\n\nowner have been affected or not.              The Excise Commissioner\n\nrelied upon the report of the Deputy Excise Commissioner,\n\nKottayam.        That report states that the presence of the toddy\n\nshop has affected the privacy rights of the residents.\n\nThere were written complaints made by the petitioner in W.P.\n\n(C).No.29704/2015, Laisy Santhosh along with others.                 These\n\ncomplaints indicate that there are instances of ruckus and\n\nfight by drunkards in front of the house and the drunkards\n\nusing abusive language against the passers-by.                There is a\n\nclear finding by the Excise Commissioner that the quite\n\nenjoyment of the house of Laisy Santhosh is affected.                That\n\nwould be sufficient to hold breach of privacy as well as to\n\naffirm the justification of the order passed by the Excise\n\nCommissioner under Rule 7(3). The scope of judicial review\n\nis limited.        This Court cannot reverse the finding on facts\n\nunless those finding of facts are without any evidence or\n\nconduct     of    any    inquiry.
