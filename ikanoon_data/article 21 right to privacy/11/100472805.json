This writ petition has been preferred by Naz Foundation, a\n\n     Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) as a Public Interest\n\n     Litigation to challenge the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n     377</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>), which criminally\n\n     penalizes what is described as &quot;unnatural offences&quot;, to the\n\n     extent the said provision criminalises consensual sexual\n\n     acts between adults in private. The challenge is founded on\n\n     the plea that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 377</a> IPC, on account of it covering\n\n     sexual acts between consenting adults in private infringes\n\n     the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_5\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_6\">, 19</a>\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">&amp; 21</a> of the Constitution of India.   Limiting their plea, the\n\n     petitioners submit that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 377</a> IPC should apply only to\n\n     non-consensual penile non-vaginal sex and penile non-\n\n     vaginal   sex involving minors. The Union of India is\n\n     impleaded as respondent No.5 through Ministry of Home\n\n     Affairs and Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare. Respondent\n\n     No.4 is the National Aids Control Organisation (hereinafter\n\n     referred to as &quot;NACO&quot;) a body formed under the aegis of\n\n     Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of India.\n\n     NACO is    charged with formulating       and   implementing\n\n     policies for the prevention of HIV/AIDS in India. Respondent\n\n     No.3 is the Delhi State Aids Control Society.    Respondent\n\n     No.2 is the Commissioner of Police, Delhi. Respondents No.6\n\n     to 8 are individuals and NGOs, who were permitted to\n\n     intervene on their request. The writ petition was dismissed\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                Page 2 of 105\n      by this Court in 2004 on the ground that there is no cause of\n\n     action in favour of the petitioner and that such a petition\n\n     cannot be entertained to examine the academic challenge\n\n     to the constitutionality of the legislation.       The Supreme\n\n     Court     vide   order   dated   03.02.2006   in   Civil   Appeal\n\n     No.952/2006 set aside the said order of this Court observing\n\n     that the matter does require consideration and is not of a\n\n     nature which could have been dismissed on the aforesaid\n\n     ground.     The matter was remitted to this Court for fresh\n\n     decision.\n\n\n\n     HISTORY OF THE LEGISLATION\n\n\n2.   At the core of the controversy involved here is the penal\n\n     provision <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 377</a> IPC which criminalizes sex other than\n\n     heterosexual penile-vaginal. The legislative history of the\n\n     subject indicates that the first records of sodomy as a crime\n\n     at Common Law in England were chronicled in the Fleta,\n\n     1290, and later in the Britton, 1300. Both texts prescribed\n\n     that sodomites should be burnt alive. Acts of sodomy later\n\n     became penalized by hanging under the Buggery Act of\n\n     1533 which was re-enacted in 1563 by Queen Elizabeth I,\n\n     after which it became the charter for the subsequent\n\n     criminalisation of sodomy in the British Colonies. Oral-\n\n     genital sexual acts were later removed from the definition\n\n     of buggery in 1817. And in 1861, the death penalty for\n\n     buggery was formally abolished in England and Wales.\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                   Page 3 of 105\n      However, sodomy or buggery remained as a crime &quot;not to\n\n     be mentioned by Christians.&quot;\n\n\n3.   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">Indian Penal Code</a> was drafted by Lord Macaulay and\n\n     introduced in 1861 in British India.         <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 377</a> IPC is\n\n     contained in Chapter XVI of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">IPC</a> titled &quot;Of Offences\n\n     Affecting the Human Body&quot;.       Within this Chapter <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n\n     377</a> IPC is categorised under the sub-chapter titled &quot;Of\n\n     Unnatural Offences&quot; and reads as follows:\n\n\n       &quot;377. Unnatural Offences - Whoever voluntarily has\n       carnal intercourse against the order of nature with\n       any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with\n       imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either\n       description for a term which may extend to ten\n       years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n       Explanation - Penetration is sufficient to constitute\n       the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence\n       described in this section.&quot;\n\n     JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION\n\n\n4.   The marginal note refers to the acts proscribed as\n\n     &quot;unnatural offences&quot;. This expression, however, is not used\n\n     in the text of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 377</a> IPC.       The expression &quot;carnal\n\n     intercourse&quot; is used in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 377</a> IPC as distinct from the\n\n     expression &quot;sexual intercourse&quot;, which appears in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections\n\n     375</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_17\">497</a> IPC.         According to the Concise Oxford\n\n     Dictionary (ninth edition, 1995), the term &quot;carnal&quot; means\n\n     &quot;of the body or flesh; worldly&quot; and &quot;sensual, sexual&quot;.\n\n     Consent is no defence to an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                   Page 4 of 105\n     and no distinction regarding age is made in the section. In\n\n    Khanu v. Emperor, AIR 1925 Sind 286, Kennedy A.J.C. held\n\n    that &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_19\">section 377</a> IPC punishes certain persons who have\n\n    carnal intercourse against the order of nature with inter alia\n\n    human beings.... [if the oral sex committed in this case is\n\n    carnal intercourse], it is clearly against the order of nature,\n\n    because the natural object of carnal intercourse is that\n\n    there should be the possibility of conception of human\n\n    beings,   which     in   the     case    of   coitus   per   os   is\n\n    impossible.&quot;[page 286] It appears that the courts had\n\n    earlier held in R. V. Jacobs (1817) Russ &amp; Ry 331 C.C.R.,\n\n    and Govindarajula In re., (1886) 1 Weir 382, that inserting\n\n    the penis in the mouth would not amount to an offence\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 377</a> IPC.         Later,   <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 377</a> IPC has been\n\n    interpreted to cover oral sex, anal sex and penetration of\n\n    other orifices. In Lohana Vasantlal Devchand v. State,\n\n    AIR 1968 Guj 252, the issue was whether oral sex amounted\n\n    to an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 377</a> IPC. It was held that the\n\n    &quot;orifice of the mouth is not, according to nature, meant for\n\n    sexual or carnal intercourse.&quot; In Calvin Francis v. Orissa,\n\n    1992 (2) Crimes 455, relying on Lohana, it was held that\n\n    oral sex fell within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 377</a> IPC. The Court\n\n    used the references to the Corpus Juris Secundum relating\n\n    to sexual perversity and abnormal sexual satisfaction as the\n\n    guiding criteria.   In Fazal Rab Choudhary v. State of\n\n    Bihar, AIR 1983 SC 323, it was observed that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 377</a>\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                    Page 5 of 105\n      <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a> implied &quot;sexual perversity&quot;. It is evident that the tests\n\n     for attracting the penal provisions have changed from the\n\n     non-procreative to imitative to sexual perversity.\n\n\n5.   The English law was reformed in Britain by the Sexual\n\n     Offences Act, 1967, which de-criminalised homosexuality\n\n     and acts of sodomy between consenting adults (above age\n\n     of 21) pursuant to the report of Wolfenden Committee. The\n\n     Committee advising the Parliament had recommended in\n\n     1957 repeal of laws punishing homosexual conduct.\n\n\n     THE CHALLENGE\n\n\n6.   The petitioner NGO has been working in the field of HIV/AIDS\n\n     Intervention   and   prevention.     This   necessarily    involves\n\n     interaction with such sections of society as are vulnerable to\n\n     contracting HIV/AIDS and which include gay community or\n\n     individuals described as &quot;men who have sex with men&quot;\n\n     (MSM). For sake of convenient reference, they would\n\n     hereinafter be referred to as &quot;homosexuals&quot; or &quot;gay&quot;\n\n     persons or gay community. Homosexuals, according to the\n\n     petitioner, represent a population segment that is extremely\n\n     vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection.      The petitioner claims to\n\n     have been impelled to bring this litigation in public interest\n\n     on the ground that HIV/AIDS prevention efforts were found\n\n     to   be   severely   impaired   by     discriminatory      attitudes\n\n     exhibited by state agencies towards gay community, MSM\n\n     or   trans-gendered    individuals,     under     the     cover   of\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                     Page 6 of 105\n      enforcement of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 377</a> IPC, as a result of which basic\n\n     fundamental human rights of such individuals/groups (in\n\n     minority) stood denied and they were subjected to abuse,\n\n     harassment, assault from public and public authorities.\n\n\n7.   According to the petitioner, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 377</a> IPC is based upon\n\n     traditional Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards,\n\n     which conceive of sex in purely functional terms, i.e., for the\n\n     purpose of procreation only.       Any non-procreative sexual\n\n     activity is thus viewed as being &quot;against the order of\n\n     nature&quot;. The submission is that the legislation criminalising\n\n     consensual oral and anal sex is outdated and has no place in\n\n     modern society. In fact, studies of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\n     jurisprudence reveal that lately it has generally been\n\n     employed in cases of child sexual assault and abuse.            By\n\n     criminalising private, consensual same-sex conduct, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n     377</a> IPC serves as the weapon for police abuse; detaining\n\n     and   questioning,    extortion,     harassment,    forced     sex,\n\n     payment of hush money; and perpetuates negative and\n\n     discriminatory   beliefs   towards    same-sex     relations   and\n\n     sexuality minorities; which consequently drive the activities\n\n     of gay men and MSM, as well as sexuality minorities\n\n     underground thereby crippling HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 377</a> IPC thus creates a class of vulnerable people\n\n     that is continually victimised and directly affected by the\n\n     provision.    It has been submitted that the fields of\n\n     psychiatry and psychology no longer treat homosexuality as\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                  Page 7 of 105\n      a disease and regard sexual orientation to be a deeply held,\n\n     core part of the identities of individuals.\n\n\n8.   The petitioner submits that while right to privacy is implicit\n\n     in the right to life and liberty and guaranteed to the citizens,\n\n     in order to be meaningful, the pursuit of happiness\n\n     encompassed within the concepts of privacy, human dignity,\n\n     individual autonomy and the human need for an intimate\n\n     personal sphere require that privacy - dignity claim\n\n     concerning private, consensual, sexual relations are also\n\n     afforded protection within the ambit of the said fundamental\n\n     right to life and liberty given under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21.</a> It is averred\n\n     that no aspect of one&#x27;s life may be said to be more private\n\n     or intimate than that of sexual relations, and since private,\n\n     consensual, sexual relations or sexual preferences figure\n\n     prominently within an individual&#x27;s personality and lie easily\n\n     at the core of the &quot;private space&quot;, they are an inalienable\n\n     component of the right of life.         Based on this line of\n\n     reasoning, a case has been made to the effect that the\n\n     prohibition of certain private, consensual sexual relations\n\n     (homosexual) provided by <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 377</a> IPC unreasonably\n\n     abridges the right of privacy and dignity within the ambit of\n\n     right to life and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21.</a>        The petitioner\n\n     argues that fundamental right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a>\n\n     can be abridged only for a compelling state interest which,\n\n     in its submission, is amiss here.             Also based on the\n\n     fundamental right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> is the further\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                     Page 8 of 105\n      submission that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 377</a> IPC has a damaging impact\n\n     upon the lives of homosexuals inasmuch as it not only\n\n     perpetuates social stigma and police/public abuse but also\n\n     drives    homosexual         activity     underground       thereby\n\n     jeopardizing      HIV/AIDS   prevention      efforts    and,     thus,\n\n     rendering gay men and MSM increasingly vulnerable to\n\n     contracting HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n9.   Further, it has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner\n\n     that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 377</a> IPC&#x27;s legislative objective of penalizing\n\n     &quot;unnatural sexual acts&quot; has no rational nexus to the\n\n     classification    created    between     procreative     and      non-\n\n     procreative sexual acts, and is thus violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 14</a> of\n\n     the Constitution of India. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 377</a>&#x27;s legislative objective\n\n     is based upon stereotypes and misunderstanding that are\n\n     outmoded and enjoys no historical or logical rationale which\n\n     render it arbitrary and unreasonable.        It is further the case\n\n     of the petitioner that the expression &quot;sex&quot; as used in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_40\">Article\n\n     15</a> cannot be read restrictive to &quot;gender&quot; but includes\n\n     &quot;sexual orientation&quot; and, thus read, equality on the basis of\n\n     sexual orientation is implied in the said fundamental right\n\n     against    discrimination.     The      petitioner     argues     that\n\n     criminalization     of   predominantly      homosexual         activity\n\n     through <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 377</a> IPC is discriminatory on the basis of\n\n     sexual orientation and, therefore, violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 15.</a> It\n\n     is further the case of the petitioner that the prohibition\n\n     against homosexuality in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 377</a> IPC curtails or\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                     Page 9 of 105\n       infringes the basic freedoms guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 19 (1)\n\n      (a) (b) (c)</a> &amp; (d); in that, an individual&#x27;s ability to make\n\n      personal statement about one&#x27;s sexual preferences, right of\n\n      association/assembly and right to move freely so as to\n\n      engage in homosexual conduct are restricted and curtailed.\n\n\n10.   Broadly on the above reasoning, it has been submitted that\n\n      there is a case for consensual sexual intercourse (of the kind\n\n      mentioned above; i.e. homosexual) between two willing\n\n      adults in privacy to be saved and excepted from the penal\n\n      provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 377</a> IPC.\n\n\n      REPLY BY UNION OF INDIA - CONTRADICTORY STANDS OF\n      MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS AND MINISTRY OF HEALTH &amp;\n      FAMILY WELFARE\n11.   A rather peculiar feature of this case is that completely\n\n      contradictory affidavits have been filed by two wings of\n\n      Union of India. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) sought to\n\n      justify the retention of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 377</a> IPC, whereas the Ministry\n\n      of Health &amp; Family Welfare insisted that continuance of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 377</a> IPC has hampered the HIV/AIDS prevention\n\n      efforts. We shall first deal with the affidavit of the Ministry\n\n      of Home Affairs.    The Director (Judicial) in the Ministry of\n\n      Home Affairs, Government of India, in his affidavit, seeks to\n\n      justify the retention of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 377</a> IPC on the statute book\n\n      broadly on the reason that it has been generally invoked in\n\n      cases   of   allegation   of   child   sexual    abuse   and     for\n\n      complementing lacunae in the rape laws and not mere\n\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                      Page 10 of 105\n       homosexuality. This penal clause has been used particularly\n\n      in cases of assault where bodily harm is intended and/or\n\n      caused. It has been submitted that the impugned provision\n\n      is necessary since the deletion thereof would well open\n\n      flood gates of delinquent behaviour and can possibly be\n\n      misconstrued     as     providing    unfettered     licence      for\n\n      homosexuality.        Proceeding    on   the   assumption       that\n\n      homosexuality is unlawful, it has been submitted in the\n\n      affidavit that such acts cannot be rendered legitimate only\n\n      because the person to whose detriment they are committed\n\n      has given consent to it. Conceding ground in favour of right\n\n      to respect for private and family life, in the submission of\n\n      Union of India, interference by public authorities in the\n\n      interest of public safety and protection of health as well as\n\n      morals is equally permissible.\n\n\n12.   Terming the issues raised in the petition at hand as a\n\n      subject relating to policy of law rather than that of its\n\n      legality, Union of India relies upon the reports of Law\n\n      Commission of India particularly on the issue whether to\n\n      retain or not to retain <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 377</a> IPC. Reference has been\n\n      made to 42nd report of the Commission wherein it was\n\n      observed that Indian society by and large disapproved of\n\n      homosexuality, which disapproval was strong enough to\n\n      justify it being treated as a criminal offence even where the\n\n      adults indulge in it in private. Union of India submits that\n\n      law cannot run separately from the society since it only\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                     Page 11 of 105\n       reflects the perception of the society. It claims that at the\n\n      time of initial enactment, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 377</a> IPC was responding to\n\n      the values and morals of the time in the Indian society. It\n\n      has been submitted that in fact in any parliamentary secular\n\n      democracy, the legal conception of crime depends upon\n\n      political as well as moral considerations notwithstanding\n\n      considerable overlap existing between legal and safety\n\n      conception of crime i.e. moral factors.\n\n\n13.   Acknowledging that there have been legal reforms in a large\n\n      number of countries so as to de-criminalise homosexual\n\n      conduct, Union of India seeks to attribute this trend of\n\n      change to increased tolerance shown by such societies to\n\n      new sexual behaviour or sexual preference.       Arguing that\n\n      public tolerance of different activities undergoes change\n\n      with the times in turn influencing changes in laws, it is\n\n      sought to be pointed out that even the reforms in the nature\n\n      of Sexual Offences Act, 1967 (whereby buggery between\n\n      two consenting adults in private ceased to be an offence in\n\n      the United Kingdom) had its own share of criticism on the\n\n      ground that the legislation had negatived the right of the\n\n      state to suppress &#x27;social vices&#x27;. Union of India argues that\n\n      Indian society is yet to demonstrate readiness or willingness\n\n      to show greater tolerance to practices of homosexuality.\n\n      Making out a case in favour of retention of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\n      in the shape it stands at present, Union of India relies on the\n\n      arguments of public morality, public health and healthy\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                  Page 12 of 105\n       environment claiming that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 377</a> IPC serves the\n\n      purpose.\n\n\n14.   From the above summary of submissions of the Union of\n\n      India through the MHA it is clear that the thrust of the\n\n      resistance to the claim in the petition is founded on the\n\n      argument of public morality. Though the MHA has referred\n\n      to the issue of public health and healthy environment, the\n\n      affidavit has not set out elaborately the said defence.\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF NACO / MINISTRY OF HEALTH &amp; FAMILY WELFARE\n\n\n15.   National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has submitted its\n\n      response in the shape of an affidavit affirmed by the Under\n\n      Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which\n\n      thus also represents the views of the said Ministry of the\n\n      Government of India.         The submissions of NACO only\n\n      confirm the case set out by the petitioner that homosexual\n\n      community    (MSM    etc.)    is   particularly   susceptible   to\n\n      attracting HIV/AIDS in which view a number of initiatives\n\n      have been taken by NACO to ensure that proper HIV\n\n      intervention and prevention efforts are made available to\n\n      the said section of the society by, amongst other things,\n\n      protecting and promoting their rights. In the reply affidavit,\n\n      NACO states that the groups identified to be at greater risk\n\n      of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection due to a high\n\n      level of risky behaviour and insufficient capacity or power\n\n      for decision making to protect themselves from infection,\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                    Page 13 of 105\n       generally described as &#x27;High Risk Groups&#x27; (HRG), broadly\n\n      include men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex\n\n      workers and injecting drug users.\n\n\n16.   NACO has adopted a strategy for preventing and further\n\n      transmission of infection, which include the following efforts:\n\n\n      (a)   The strategy for preventing and the further\n\n      transmission of infection includes:\n\n\n        i. Making the General Population and High Risk\n\n            Groups         aware        through    strategic   IEC\n\n            (Information Education Communication) &amp; BCC\n\n            (Behaviour Change Communication) providing\n\n            them with the necessary tools and information\n\n            for protecting themselves from HIV infection.\n\n\n        ii. Motivating safer sexual practices by reducing\n\n            sexual partners, being faithful to a single\n\n            partner abstaining from casual sex and the\n\n            correct and consistent use of condoms.\n\n\n        iii. Controlling    Sexually      Transmitted    Infections\n\n            (STIs) among High Risk Groups along with\n\n            promoting       use    of    condoms   as   preventive\n\n            measure.\n\n\n        iv. Peer education and Community participation\n\n            (being the essential component of Primary\n\n            Health Care).\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                        Page 14 of 105\n           v. Ensuring availability of safe blood and blood\n\n            products; and\n\n\n          vi. Reinforcing the traditional Indian moral values\n\n            of   abstinence,     delayed   sexual   debut   till\n\n            marriage and fidelity among youth and other\n\n            impressionable groups of population.\n\n\n    (b)     To    create    an     enabling   socio-economic\n\n    environment so that all sections of population can\n\n    have access to proper information, health care &amp;\n\n    counseling services to protect themselves from the\n\n    infection and at the same time empower families and\n\n    communities to provide better care &amp; support to\n\n    people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n    (c)     Improving services for the care of people living\n\n    with AIDS both in hospital and at homes through\n\n    community care.\n\n\n17. In the reply affidavit filed on behalf of NACO, it has been\n\n    submitted that the report of the Expert Group on Size\n\n    Estimation of Population with High Risk Behaviour for NACP-\n\n    III Planning, January 2006 estimated that there are about 25\n\n    lakh MSM (Men having sex with men). The National Sentinel\n\n    Surveillance Data 2005 shows that more than 8% of the\n\n    population of MSM is infected by HIV while the HIV\n\n    prevalence among the general population is estimated to be\n\n    lesser than 1%. Given the high vulnerability of MSM to HIV\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                    Page 15 of 105\n     infection, NACO has developed programmes for undertaking\n\n    targeted interventions among them.          These projects are\n\n    implemented by NGOs with financial support from NACO.\n\n    Presently 1,46,397 MSM (6%) are being covered through 30\n\n    targeted interventions.     Under the targeted intervention\n\n    projects, the objectives are to:\n\n\n    a.    reduce number of partners and by bringing\n\n    about a change in their behaviour;\n\n\n    b.    reduce their level of risk by informing them\n\n    about and providing access to condoms;\n\n\n    c.    providing access to STD services.\n\n\n18. According to the submissions of NACO, those in the High Risk\n\n    Group are mostly reluctant to reveal same sex behaviour\n\n    due to the fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large\n\n    section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the\n\n    cases of infection underground making it very difficult for the\n\n    public health workers to even access them. It illustrates this\n\n    point by referring to the data reflected in the National\n\n    Baseline Behaviour Surveillance Survey (NBBSS of 2002)\n\n    which indicates that while 68.6% MSM population is aware\n\n    about the methods of preventing infection, only 36% of them\n\n    actually use condoms.      NACO has further submitted that\n\n    enforcement of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 377</a> IPC against homosexual groups\n\n    renders   risky   sexual   practices   to   go   unnoticed    and\n\n    unaddressed inasmuch as the fear of harassment by law\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 16 of 105\n     enforcement    agencies    leads    to   sex     being     hurried,\n\n    particularly because these groups lack &#x27;safe place&#x27;, utilise\n\n    public places for their indulgence and do not have the option\n\n    to consider or negotiate safer sex practices. It is stated that\n\n    the   very   hidden   nature   of   such   groups        constantly\n\n    inhibits/impedes interventions under the National AIDS\n\n    Control Programme aimed at prevention.              Thus NACO\n\n    reinforces the plea raised by the petitioner for the need to\n\n    have an enabling environment where the people involved in\n\n    risky behaviour are encouraged not to conceal information\n\n    so that they can be provided total access to the services of\n\n    such preventive efforts.\n\n\n    RESPONSES OF OTHER RESPONDENTS\n\n19. &#x27;Voices against <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 377</a> IPC&#x27; (hereinafter referred to as\n\n    &quot;respondent No.8&quot;) is a coalition of 12 organisations that\n\n    represent child rights, women&#x27;s rights, human rights, health\n\n    concerns as well as the rights of same sex desiring people\n\n    including those who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,\n\n    Transgenders, Hijra and Kothi persons (which are referred to\n\n    in the affidavit as &quot;LGBT&quot;).   It has been submitted on its\n\n    behalf that organisations that constitute respondent No.8 are\n\n    involved in diverse areas of public and social importance and\n\n    that in the course of their work they have repeatedly come\n\n    across gross violation of basic human rights of &quot;LGBT&quot;\n\n    persons, both as a direct and indirect consequence of the\n\n    enforcement of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 377</a> IPC.      It relies upon its report\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                   Page 17 of 105\n     tilted &#x27;Rights for All : Ending Discrimination under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_56\">Section\n\n    377</a>&#x27; published in 2004 to create awareness about negative\n\n    impact of this law on society in general and Lesbian, Gay,\n\n    Bisexual and Transgenders people in particular.\n\n\n20. Respondent No.8 supports the cause espoused by the\n\n    petitioner in this PIL and avers that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 377</a> IPC, which\n\n    criminalises &#x27;carnal intercourse against the order of the\n\n    nature&#x27;, is an unconstitutional and arbitrary law based on\n\n    archaic    moral    and    religious      notions   of   sex   only     for\n\n    procreation.       It    asserts   that     criminalisation    of    adult\n\n    consensual sex under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 377</a> IPC does not serve any\n\n    beneficial public purpose or legitimate state interest. On the\n\n    contrary, according to respondent No.8, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 377</a> IPC by\n\n    criminalising the aforementioned kinds of sexual acts has\n\n    created an association of criminality towards people with\n\n    same sex desires. It pleads that the continued existence of\n\n    this provision on the statute book creates and fosters a\n\n    climate    of    fundamental       rights   violations    of   the     gay\n\n    community, to the extent of bolstering their extreme social\n\n    ostracism.\n\n\n21. To illustrate the magnitude and range of exploitation and\n\n    harsh     and    cruel    treatment    experienced       as    a     direct\n\n    consequence of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 377</a> IPC, respondent No.8 has placed\n\n    on record material in the form of affidavits, FIRs, judgments\n\n    and     orders   with    objectively      documented     instances      of\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                        Page 18 of 105\n     exploitation, violence, rape and torture suffered by LGBT\n\n    persons.   The particulars of the incidents are drawn from\n\n    different parts of the country. In an instance referred to as\n\n    &quot;Lucknow incident - 2002&quot; in the report titled &#x27;Epidemic of\n\n    Abuse : Police Harassment of HIV/AIDS Outreach Workers in\n\n    India&#x27; published by Human Rights Watch, the police during\n\n    investigation of a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 377</a> IPC picked up\n\n    some information about a local NGO (Bharosa Trust) working\n\n    in the area of HIV/AIDS prevention and sexual health\n\n    amongst MSMs raided its office, seized safe sex advocacy\n\n    and information material and arrested four health care\n\n    workers. Even in absence of any prima facie proof linking\n\n    them to the reported crime under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 377</a> IPC, a\n\n    prosecution was launched against the said health care\n\n    workers on charges that included <a href=\"/doc/1704109/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 292</a> IPC treating\n\n    the educational literature as obscene material. The health\n\n    workers remained in custody for 47 days only because\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 377</a> IPC is a non-bailable offence.\n\n\n22. Then there is a reference to &#x27;Bangalore incident, 2004&#x27;\n\n    bringing out instances of custodial torture of LGBT persons.\n\n    The victim of the torture was a hijra (eunuch) from\n\n    Bangalore, who was at a public place dressed in female\n\n    clothing. The person was subjected to gang rape, forced to\n\n    have oral and anal sex by a group of hooligans. He was later\n\n    taken to police station where he was stripped naked,\n\n    handcuffed to the window, grossly abused and tortured\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 19 of 105\n     merely because of his sexual identity. Reference was made\n\n    to a judgment of the High Court of Madras reported as\n\n    Jayalakshmi v. The State of Tamil Nadu, (2007) 4 MLJ\n\n    849, in which an eunuch had committed suicide due to the\n\n    harassment and torture at the hands of the police officers\n\n    after he had been picked up on the allegation of involvement\n\n    in a case of theft. There was evidence indicating that during\n\n    police custody he was subjected to torture by a wooden stick\n\n    being inserted into his anus and some police personnel\n\n    forcing him to have oral sex.      The person in question\n\n    immolated himself inside the police station on 12.6.2006 and\n\n    later succumbed to burn injuries on 29.6.2006.             The\n\n    compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- was awarded to the family of\n\n    the victim.   Another instance cited is of a case where the\n\n    Magistrate in his order observed that the case involved a\n\n    hidden allegation of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 377</a> IPC as\n\n    well, thereby stretching the reach of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 377</a> IPC to two\n\n    lesbian adult women who were involved in a romantic\n\n    relationship with each other while the initial accusation was\n\n    only under <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 366</a> IPC. An affidavit of a gay person is\n\n    also filed on record. The person was picked up from a bus\n\n    stand at about 10 p.m. by the police, who accused him of\n\n    being a homosexual. He was physically assaulted with\n\n    wooden sticks, taken to police post where he was subjected\n\n    to sexual and degrading abusive language.        During the\n\n    incarceration in the police post over the night, four police\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                              Page 20 of 105\n     men actually raped and sexually abused him including\n\n    forcing him to have oral and anal sex. The respondent No.8\n\n    has relied upon several other instances of fundamental\n\n    rights violation of homosexuals and gay persons.                        The\n\n    material on record, according to the respondent No.8, clearly\n\n    establishes that the continuance of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 377</a> IPC on the\n\n    statute book operate to brutalise a vulnerable, minority\n\n    segment of the citizenry for no fault on its part.                      The\n\n    respondent No.8 contends that a section of society has been\n\n    thus   criminalised     and      stigmatized      to    a   point     where\n\n    individuals are forced to deny the core of their identity and\n\n    vital dimensions of their personality.\n\n\n23. Respondents      No.1    (Govt.      of     NCT        of   Delhi),    No.2\n\n    (Commissioner of Police, Delhi) and No.3 (Delhi State Aids\n\n    Control Society) did not file any counter affidavit/pleadings.\n\n    Respondent      No.6    (Joint     Action   Council         Kannur)     and\n\n    respondent No.7 (Mr. B.K.Singhal), who were impleaded as\n\n    intervenors, filed counter affidavits mainly adopting the\n\n    views / stand of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Union of India\n\n    on the issue.\n\n\n    ARGUMENTS\n\n\n24. Learned counsel appearing for the parties have addressed\n\n    the Court at length.          During the course of submissions,\n\n    extensive references were made to voluminous material\n\n    which included various reports, publications, articles, Indian\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                           Page 21 of 105\n     and foreign judgments including those of US Supreme Court,\n\n    European Commission of Human Rights, Human Rights\n\n    Committee etc.      Counsel also provided comprehensive\n\n    written submissions supported by authorities but as we\n\n    understand it, the prime arguments can be generally\n\n    summarised in this way:-\n\n\n    (i)   The submission of Mr. Anand Grover, Sr. Advocate,\n\n    appearing for the petitioner, and Mr. Shyam Divan, Sr.\n\n    Advocate, appearing for respondent No.8, is that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 377</a>\n\n    IPC violates the constitutional protections embodied in\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_70\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_71\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_72\">21.</a>        It suffers from the vice of\n\n    unreasonable classification and is arbitrary in the way it\n\n    unfairly targets the homosexuals or gay community. It also\n\n    unreasonably and unjustly infringes upon the right of\n\n    privacy, both zonal and decisional.      It also conveys the\n\n    message that homosexuals are of less value than other\n\n    people, demeans them and unconstitutionally infringes upon\n\n    their right to live with dignity. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 377</a> IPC also creates\n\n    structural impediments to the exercise of freedom of speech\n\n    and expression and other freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 19</a> by\n\n    homosexuals or gays and is not protected by any of the\n\n    restrictions contained therein.    Furthermore, morality by\n\n    itself cannot be a valid ground for restricting the right under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_75\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_76\">21.</a>     Public disapproval or disgust for a\n\n    certain class of persons can in no way serve to uphold the\n\n    constitutionality of a statute.     In any event, abundant\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                Page 22 of 105\n     material has been placed on record which shows that the\n\n    Indian society is vibrant, diverse and democratic and\n\n    homosexuals have significant support in the population. It is\n\n    submitted that courts in other jurisdictions have struck down\n\n    similar laws that criminalise same-sex sexual conduct on the\n\n    grounds of violation of right to privacy or dignity or equality\n\n    or all of them. Keeping in mind that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 377</a> IPC is the\n\n    only law that punishes child sexual abuse and fills a lacuna\n\n    in rape law, it is prayed that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 377</a> IPC may be\n\n    declared as constitutionally invalid insofar as it affects\n\n    private sexual acts between consenting adults or in the\n\n    alternative to read down <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 377</a> IPC to exclude\n\n    consenting same-sex sexual acts between adults.\n\n\n    (ii)   In reply, learned ASG submits that there is no\n\n    fundamental right to engage in the same sex activities. In\n\n    our country,    homosexuality       is abhorrent   and        can be\n\n    criminalised by imposing proportional limits on the citizens&#x27;\n\n    right to privacy and equality.       Learned ASG submits that\n\n    right to privacy is not absolute and can be restricted for\n\n    compelling state interest. <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 19(2)</a> expressly permits\n\n    imposition of restrictions in the interest of decency and\n\n    morality. Social and sexual mores in foreign countries cannot\n\n    justify   de-criminalisation   of    homosexuality       in    India.\n\n    According to him, in the western societies the morality\n\n    standards are not as high as in India. Learned ASG further\n\n    submits that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 377</a> IPC is not discriminatory as it is\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 23 of 105\n     gender neutral. If <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 377</a> IPC is struck down there will\n\n    be no way the State can prosecute any crime of non-\n\n    consensual carnal intercourse against the order of nature or\n\n    gross male indecency. He hastens to add that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 377</a>\n\n    IPC is not enforced against homosexuals and there is no\n\n    need to &quot;read down&quot; the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 377</a> IPC.\n\n    Learned ASG further contends that spread of AIDS is\n\n    curtailed by <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 377</a> IPC and de-criminalisation of\n\n    consensual - same - sex acts between adults would cause a\n\n    decline in public health across society generally since it\n\n    would foster the spread of AIDS.     He submits that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_86\">Section\n\n    377</a> IPC does not impact upon the freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_87\">Article\n\n    19(1)</a> as what is criminalised is only a sexual act. People will\n\n    have the freedom to canvass any opinion of their choice\n\n    including the opinion that homosexuality must be de-\n\n    criminalised. He, therefore, submits that the <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\n    is constitutionally valid.\n\n\n    (iii)   Mr.Ravi Shankar Kumar, appearing for respondent\n\n    No.6, and Mr.H.P. Sharma, appearing for respondent No.7,\n\n    submitted that the petitioner&#x27;s arguments with respect to\n\n    the spread of HIV and AIDS are founded on propaganda and\n\n    are not factually correct. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 377</a> IPC prevents HIV by\n\n    discouraging rampant homosexuality.       According to them,\n\n    Indian society considers homosexuality to be repugnant,\n\n    immoral and contrary to the cultural norms of the country.\n\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                Page 24 of 105\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_90\">ARTICLE 21</a>, THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND PROTECTION OF A PERSON&#x27;S\n    DIGNITY, AUTONOMY AND PRIVACY\n\n\n\n25. Until the decision of the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi\n\n    v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, a rather narrow and\n\n    constricted meaning was given to the guarantee embodied\n\n    in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 21.</a> But in Maneka Gandhi, a seven-Judge Bench\n\n    decision, P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as his Lordship then was) held\n\n    that the expression &quot;personal liberty&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 21</a> is of the\n\n    widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to\n\n    constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them\n\n    have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights\n\n    and give additional protection under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 19.</a>        Any law\n\n    interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a\n\n    triple test: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the\n\n    procedure must withstand a test of one or more of the\n\n    fundamental rights conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 19</a> which may be\n\n    applicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also be liable\n\n    to be tested with reference to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 14.</a>         As the test\n\n    propounded by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 14</a> pervades <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 21</a> as well, the\n\n    law and procedure authorising interference with the personal\n\n    liberty must also be right and just and fair and not arbitrary,\n\n    fanciful or oppressive. If the procedure prescribed does not\n\n    satisfy the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 14</a>, it would be no\n\n    procedure at all within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 21.</a> The Court\n\n    thus expanded the scope and ambit of the right to life and\n\n    personal liberty enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 21</a> and sowed the seed\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 25 of 105\n     for future development of the law enlarging this most\n\n    fundamental of the fundamental rights.       This decision in\n\n    Maneka Gandhi became the starting point for a very\n\n    significant evolution of the law culminating in the decisions\n\n    in M.H. Hoskot v. State of Maharashtra, (1978) 3 SCC\n\n    544, Hussainara Khatoon and Ors. v. Home Secretary\n\n    State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 81, Sunil Batra v. Delhi\n\n    Admn., (1978) 4 SCC 494, Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi\n\n    Admn., (1980) 3 SCC 526, Francis Coralie Mullin v.\n\n    Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi and others,\n\n    (1981) 1 SCC 608.\n\n\n    DIGNITY\n\n\n26. Dignity as observed by L&#x27;Heureux-Dube, J is a difficult\n\n    concept to capture in precise terms [Egan v. Canada,\n\n    (1995) 29 CRR (2nd) 79 at 106]. At its least, it is clear that\n\n    the constitutional protection of dignity requires us to\n\n    acknowledge the value and worth of all individuals as\n\n    members of our society.    It recognises a person as a free\n\n    being who develops his or her body and mind as he or she\n\n    sees fit. At the root of the dignity is the autonomy of the\n\n    private will and a person&#x27;s freedom of choice and of action .\n\n    Human dignity rests on recognition of the physical and\n\n    spiritual integrity of the human being, his or her humanity,\n\n    and his value as a person, irrespective of the utility he can\n\n    provide to others. The expression &quot;dignity of the individual&quot;\n\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                               Page 26 of 105\n     finds specific mention in the Preamble to the Constitution of\n\n    India.   V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. observed that the guarantee of\n\n    human dignity forms part of our constitutional culture [Prem\n\n    Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Admn. (supra),page 529 of SCC].\n\n\n27. In Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union\n\n    Territory of       Delhi   and others (supra), Justice P.N.\n\n    Bhagwati explained the concept of right to dignity in the\n\n    following terms:\n\n\n      &quot;... We think that the right to life includes the right to live\n      with human dignity and all that goes along with it,\n      namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate\n      nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading,\n      writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely\n      moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow\n      human beings. ......... Every act which offends against or\n      impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro\n      tanto of this right to live and it would have to be in\n      accordance with reasonable, fair and just procedure\n      established by law which stands the test of other\n      fundamental rights.&quot; [para 8 of SCC]\n\n\n28. The Canadian Supreme Court in Law v. Canada (Ministry\n\n    of Employment and Immigration), [1999 1 S.C.R. 497]\n\n    attempts to capture the concept of dignity in these words :\n\n\n      &quot;Human dignity means that an individual or group feels\n      self-respect and self-worth.     It is concerned with\n      physical and psychological integrity and empowerment.\n      Human dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised\n      upon personal traits or circumstances which do not\n      relate to individual needs, capacities, or merits. It is\n      enhanced by laws which are sensitive to the needs,\n      capacities, and merits of different individuals, taking\n      into account the context underlying their differences.\n      Human dignity is harmed when individuals and groups\n      are marginalized, ignored, or devalued, and is enhanced\n      when laws recognise the full place of all individuals and\n      groups within Canadian society.&quot;[at para 53]\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                   Page 27 of 105\n     PRIVACY\n\n\n\n29. <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n    (1948) refers to privacy and it states:\n\n\n      &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with\n      his privacy, family, home or correspondence nor to\n      attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has\n      the right to the protection of the law against such\n      interference or attacks.&quot;\n    <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 17</a> of the International Covenant of Civil and Political\n\n    Rights (to which India is a party), refers to privacy and states\n\n    that:\n\n\n      &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful\n      interference with his privacy, family, home and\n      correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour\n      and reputation.&quot;\n30. The European Convention on Human Rights also states that:\n\n\n      &quot;1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and\n      family life, his home and his correspondence.\n      2. There shall be no interference by a public authority\n      except such as is in accordance with law and is\n      necessary in a democratic society in the interests of\n      national security, public safety or the economic well-\n      being of the country, for the protection of health or\n      morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms\n      of others.&quot;\n31. In India, our Constitution does not contain a specific\n\n    provision as to privacy but the right to privacy has, as we\n\n    shall presently show, been spelt out by our Supreme Court\n\n    from the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> dealing with freedom\n\n    of speech and expression, <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> dealing with right\n\n    to freedom of movement and from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 21</a>, which deals\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 28 of 105\n     with right to life and liberty. We shall first refer to the case-\n\n    law in US relating to the development of the right to privacy\n\n    as these cases have been adverted to in the decisions of our\n\n    Supreme Court. Olmstead v. United States, 277 US 438\n\n    (1928), was a case of wire-tapping or electronic surveillance\n\n    and where there was no actual physical invasion, the\n\n    majority held that the action was not subject to Fourth\n\n    Amendment      restrictions.   But,   in   his    dissent,   Justice\n\n    Brandeis, stated that the amendment protected the right to\n\n    privacy which meant &quot;the right to be let alone&quot;, and its\n\n    purpose was &quot;to secure conditions favourable to the pursuit\n\n    of happiness&quot;, while recognising &quot;the significance of man&#x27;s\n\n    spiritual nature, of his feelings and intellect: the right sought\n\n    &quot;to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their\n\n    emotions and their sensations&quot; (page 478).             The dissent\n\n    came to be accepted as the law after another four decades.\n\n\n32. In Griswold v. State of Connecticut, 381 US 479 (1965),\n\n    the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of drugs\n\n    or devices of contraception and counseling or aiding and\n\n    abetting the use of contraceptives. The Court described the\n\n    protected interest as a right to privacy and placed emphasis\n\n    on the marriage relation and the protected space of the\n\n    marital bedroom.\n\n\n33. After Griswold it was established that the right to make\n\n    certain decisions regarding sexual conduct extends beyond\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                     Page 29 of 105\n     the marital relationship. In Eisenstadt v. Baired, 405 US\n\n    438 (1972), the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the\n\n    distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons. The\n\n    case was decided under the Equal Protection Clause; but\n\n    with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to\n\n    state the fundamental proposition that the law impaired the\n\n    exercise of their personal rights.          It quoted from the\n\n    statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to be in\n\n    conflict with fundamental human rights, and it observed:\n\n\n      &quot;It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in\n      question inhered in the marital relationship..... If the\n      right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the\n      individual married or single, to be free from\n      unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so\n      fundamentally affecting a person as the decision\n      whether to bear or beget a child.&quot; [para 453]\n\n\n34. Jane Roe v. Wade, 410 US 113 (1973), was a case in which\n\n    an unmarried pregnant woman, who wished to terminate her\n\n    pregnancy by abortion instituted action in the United States\n\n    District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking a\n\n    declaratory judgment that the Texas Criminal Abortion\n\n    Statutes, which prohibited abortions except with respect to\n\n    those procured or attempted by medical advice for the\n\n    purpose   of   saving   the   life    of    the    mother,    were\n\n    unconstitutional.    The   Court     said   that   although    the\n\n    Constitution of the USA does not explicitly mention any right\n\n    of privacy, the United States Supreme Court recognised that\n\n    a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or\n\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                  Page 30 of 105\n     zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution, and that\n\n    the roots of that right may be found in the First Amendment,\n\n    in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, in the penumbras of\n\n    the Bill of Rights in the Ninth Amendment and in the concept\n\n    of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth\n\n    Amendment.     In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\n\n    Pa v. Casey, 505 US 833 (1992), the Court again confirmed\n\n    the constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to\n\n    marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships,\n\n    child rearing and education.    In explaining the respect the\n\n    Constitution demands for the     autonomy of the person in\n\n    making these choices, the Court stated as follows:\n\n\n          &quot;These matters, involving the most intimate and\n          personal choices a person may make in a lifetime,\n          choices central to personal dignity and autonomy,\n          are central to the liberty protected by the\n          Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is\n          the right to define one&#x27;s own concept of existence,\n          of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of\n          human life. Beliefs about these matters could not\n          define the attributes of personhood were they\n          formed under compulsion of the State.&quot; [page\n          851]\n\n\n    DEVELOPMENT OF LAW OF PRIVACY IN INDIA\n\n\n35. In Kharak Singh v. The State of U.P., (1964) 1 SCR 332,\n\n    the U.P. Regulations regarding domiciliary visits were in\n\n    question and the majority referred to Munn v. Illinois, 94\n\n    US 113 (1877), and held that though our Constitution did not\n\n    refer to the right to privacy expressly, still it can be traced\n\n    from the right to &quot;life&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 21.</a>     According to the\n\n[WP(C)7455/2001]                                Page 31 of 105\n     majority, clause 236 of the relevant Regulations in U.P., was\n\n    bad in law; it offended <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 21</a> inasmuch as there was no\n\n    law permitting interference by such visits. The majority did\n\n    not go into the question whether these visits violated the\n\n    &quot;right to privacy&quot;.

We now come to the celebrated judgment in Gobind v.\n\n    State of M.P., (1975) 2 SCC 148, in which Mathew, J.\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">    developed the law as to privacy from where it was left in\n\n    Kharak Singh.

United\n      States, 277 US 438, 471 the significance of man&#x27;s\n      spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect and\n      that only a part of the pain, pleasure, satisfaction of life\n      can be found in material things and therefore they must\n      be deemed to have conferred upon the individual as\n      against the Government a sphere where he should be\n      let alone.&quot; [para 20 of SCC]\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">37.

If the court\n\n    then finds that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\n\n    fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the\n\n    compelling state interest test. Then the question would be\n\n    whether the state interest is of such paramount importance\n\n    as would justify an infringement of the right.     The learned\n\n    Judge observed that the right to privacy will have to go\n\n    through a process of case-by-case development.                The\n\n    learned Judge further observed that the right is not absolute.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">    The issue whether enforcement of morality is a State\n\n    interest sufficient to justify infringement of fundamental\n\n    &quot;privacy right&quot; was held not necessary to be considered for\n\n    purposes of the case. The Court refused &quot;to enter into the\n\n    controversial thicket whether enforcement of morality is a\n\n    function of the State.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_2\">38.

On 26th March, 2007, a group of human rights experts\n\n    launched the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of\n\n    Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and\n\n    Gender Identity (Yogyakarta Principles).

The experts came from 25\n\n    countries representative of all geographical regions.

L. Rev 1447, that privacy centers round values of\n\n    repose, sanctuary and intimate decision.       Repose refers to\n\n    freedom from unwanted stimuli; sanctuary to protection\n\n    against intrusive observation; and intimate decision, to\n\n    autonomy with respect to the most personal of life choices.\n\n    For every individual, whether homosexual or not, the sense\n\n    of gender and sexual orientation of the person are so\n\n    embedded in the individual that the individual carries this\n\n    aspect of his or her identity wherever he or she goes.           A\n\n    person cannot leave behind his sense of gender or sexual\n\n    orientation at home. While recognising the unique worth of\n\n    each person, the Constitution does not presuppose that a\n\n    holder of rights is as an isolated, lonely and abstract figure\n\n    possessing a disembodied and socially disconnected self. It\n\n    acknowledges    that   people   live   in   their   bodies,   their\n\n    communities, their cultures, their places and their times.\n\n    The expression of sexuality requires a partner, real or\n\n    imagined. It is not for the state to choose or to arrange the\n\n    choice of partner, but for the partners to choose themselves.\n\n    [Sachs, J. in The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian\n\n    Equality v.

Prof. Ryan Goodman of the Harvard Law School, in his well\n\n    researched study of the impact of the sodomy laws on\n\n    homosexuals in South Africa argues that condemnation\n\n    expressed through the law shapes an individual&#x27;s identity\n\n    and self-esteem. Individuals ultimately do not try to conform\n\n    to the law&#x27;s directive, but the disapproval communicated\n\n    through it, nevertheless, substantively affects their sense of\n\n    self-esteem, personal identity and their relationship to the\n\n    wider society.   Based on field research, he argues that\n\n    sodomy laws produce regimes of surveillance that operate in\n\n    a dispersed manner, and that such laws serve to embed\n\n    illegality within the identity of homosexuals. He categorises\n\n    how sodomy laws reinforce public abhorrence of lesbians\n\n    and gays resulting in an erosion of self-esteem and self-\n\n    worth in numerous ways, including (a) self-reflection, (b)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                               Page 40 of 105</span>\n     reflection of self through family, (c) verbal assessment and\n\n    disputes, (d) residential zones and migrations, (e) restricted\n\n    public places, (f) restricted movement and gestures, (g)\n\n    &quot;safe places&quot; and (h) conflicts with law enforcement\n\n    agencies.

The studies conducted in different parts of world including\n\n    India show that the criminalisation of same-sex conduct has\n\n    a negative impact on the lives of these people. Even when\n\n    the penal provisions are not enforced, they reduce gay men\n\n    or   women      to    what    one      author       has    referred    to    as\n\n    &quot;unapprehended         felons&quot;,     thus    entrenching          stigma     and\n\n    encouraging discrimination in different spheres of life.

In so\n      doing, it punishes a form of sexual conduct which is\n      identified by our broader society with homosexuals. Its\n      symbolic effect is to state that in the eyes of our legal\n      system all gay men are criminals. The stigma thus\n      attached to a significant proportion of our population is\n      manifest. But the harm imposed by the criminal law is\n      far more than symbolic. As a result of the criminal\n      offence, gay men are at risk of arrest, prosecution and\n      conviction of the offence of sodomy simply because\n      they seek to engage in sexual conduct which is part of\n      their experience of being human. Just as apartheid\n      legislation rendered the lives of couples of different\n      racial groups perpetually at risk, the sodomy offence\n      builds insecurity and vulnerability into the daily lives of\n      gay men. There can be no doubt that the existence of a\n      law which punishes a form of sexual expression for gay\n      men degrades and devalues gay men in our broader\n      society.

Since 1967 the process of change has informed legal\n\n    attitude    towards   sexual   orientation.   This   process    has\n\n    culminated in the de-criminalisation of sodomy in private\n\n    between consenting adults, in several jurisdictions.            The\n\n    superior courts in some of these jurisdictions have struck\n\n    down anti-sodomy laws, where such laws remain on the\n\n    statute book. In 1967 in England and Wales and in 1980 in\n\n    Scotland sodomy between consenting adult males in private\n\n    was de-criminalised.       However, in Northern Ireland the\n\n    criminal law relating to sodomy remained unchanged.               In\n\n    1982, in pursuance of the decision of the ECHR in Dudgeon\n\n    v.    United    Kingdom     (supra),   sodomy    between       adult\n\n    consenting males in private was de-criminalised in Northern\n\n    Ireland. The same conclusion was reached in 1988 in Norris\n\n    v. Ireland (supra) and Ireland repealed sodomy laws in 1993.\n\n    Laws prohibiting homosexual activity between consenting\n\n    adults in private having eradicated within 23 member-states\n\n    that had joined the Council of Europe in 1989 and of the 10\n\n    European countries that         had joined since (as at 10th\n\n    February, 1995), nine had de-criminalised sodomy laws\n\n    either before or shortly after their membership applications\n\n    were granted. In Australia, all the States with the exception\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                   Page 47 of 105</span>\n     of Tasmania, had by 1982 de-criminalised sexual acts in\n\n    private between consenting adults and had also passed anti-\n\n    discrimination laws which prohibited discrimination on the\n\n    ground, amongst others, of sexual orientation. Tasmania\n\n    repealed offending sections in its Criminal Code in 1997 in\n\n    view of the decision of United Nations Human Rights\n\n    Committee in Toonen v. Australia. Consensual sexual\n\n    relations between adult males have been de-criminalised in\n\n    New   Zealand.       In   Canada,   consensual   adult   sodomy\n\n    (&quot;Buggery&quot;) and so-called &quot;gross indecency&quot; were de-\n\n    criminalised by statute in 1989 in respect of such acts\n\n    committed in private between 21 years and older which was\n\n    subsequently brought down to age of 18 years or more. In\n\n    United States of America though the challenge to sodomy\n\n    laws was turned down in Bowers v. Hardwick (supra), but\n\n    subsequently in Lawrence v.Texas, the sodomy laws\n\n    insofar as between consenting adults in private were struck\n\n    down. A number of open democratic societies have turned\n\n    their backs to criminalisation of sodomy laws in private\n\n    between consenting adults despite the fact that sexual\n\n    orientation      is not expressly protected in the equality\n\n    provisions of their constitutions.    Homosexuality has been\n\n    de-criminalised in several countries of Asia, Africa and South\n\n    America.      The High Court of Hongkong in its judgments in\n\n    Leung T.C.William Roy v.

No\n         evidence has been adduced to show that this has\n         been injurious to moral standards in Northern\n         Ireland or that there has been any public demand\n         for stricter enforcement of the law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">         It cannot be maintained in these circumstances\n         that there is a &quot;pressing social need&quot; to make\n         such acts criminal offences, there being no\n         sufficient justification provided by the risk of harm\n         to vulnerable sections of society requiring\n         protection or by the effects on the public...&quot; [para\n         60]\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">78.

Thus popular morality or public disapproval of certain acts is\n\n      not a valid justification for restriction of the fundamental\n\n      rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 21.</a> Popular morality, as distinct from a\n\n      constitutional morality derived from constitutional values, is\n\n      based on shifting and subjecting notions of right and wrong.\n\n      If there is any type of &quot;morality&quot; that can pass the test of\n\n      compelling    state   interest,   it   must    be   &quot;constitutional&quot;\n\n      morality     and   not   public    morality.    This    aspect    of\n\n      constitutional morality was strongly insisted upon by Dr.\n\n      Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly.           While moving the\n\n      Draft Constitution in the Assembly [Constitutional Assembly\n\n      Debates : Official Reports Vol.VII: November 4, 1948, page\n\n      38], Dr. Ambedkar quoted Grote, the historian of Greece,\n\n      who had said:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">         &quot;The diffusion of constitutional morality, not\n         merely among the majority of any community but\n         throughout the whole, is an indispensable\n         condition of government at once free and\n         peaceable; since even any powerful and obstinate\n         minority may render the working of a free\n         institution impracticable without being strong\n         enough     to  conquer    the  ascendancy    for\n         themselves.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">      After quoting Grote, Dr. Ambedkar added:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">         &quot;While everybody recognised the necessity of\n         diffusion of constitutional morality for the\n         peaceful working of the democratic constitution,\n         there are two things interconnected with it which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                      Page 64 of 105</span>\n         are not, unfortunately, generally recognised. One\n        is that the form of administration must be\n        appropriate to and in the same sense as the form\n        of the Constitution. The other is that it is perfectly\n        possible to pervert the Constitution, without\n        changing its form by merely changing its form of\n        administration and to make it inconsistent and\n        opposed to the spirit of the Constitution. ......The\n        question is, can we presume such a diffusion of\n        constitutional morality? Constitutional morality is\n        not a natural sentiment. It has to be cultivated.\n        We must realise that our people have yet to learn\n        it. Democracy in India is only a top dressing on\n        an Indian soil which is essentially undemocratic.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">80. Granville Austin in his treatise &quot;The Indian Constitution -\n\n    Cornerstone       of   A     Nation&quot;   had   said     that    the    Indian\n\n    Constitution is first and foremost a social document.                    The\n\n    majority of its provisions are either directly aimed at\n\n    furthering the goals of the social revolution or attempt to\n\n    foster   this    revolution      by    establishing     the    conditions\n\n    necessary       for    its   achievement.       The      core       of   the\n\n    commitments to the social revolution lies in Parts III and IV,\n\n    in the Fundamental Rights and in the Directive Principles of\n\n    State Policy. These are the conscience of the Constitution.\n\n    The Fundamental Rights, therefore, were to foster the social\n\n    revolution by creating a society egalitarian to the extent that\n\n    all citizens were to be equally free from coercion or\n\n    restriction by the state, or by society privately; liberty was\n\n    no longer to be the privilege of the few. The Constitution of\n\n    India recognises, protects and celebrates diversity.                      To\n\n    stigmatise or to criminalise homosexuals only on account of\n\n    their sexual orientation would be against the constitutional\n\n    morality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                          Page 65 of 105</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\"> 81. The question of the State in fact being a protector of\n\n    constitutional    morality   was    also    canvassed    by     the\n\n    Constitutional Court of South Africa in The National\n\n    Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v. The Minister\n\n    of Justice (supra):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">          &quot;A state that recognises difference does not mean\n          a state without morality or one without a point of\n          view. It does not banish concepts of right and\n          wrong, nor envisage a world without good and\n          evil..... The Constitution certainly does not debar\n          the state from enforcing morality. Indeed, the Bill\n          of Rights is nothing if not a document founded on\n          deep political morality. What is central to the\n          character and functioning of the State, however,\n          is that the dictates of the morality which it\n          enforces, and the limits to which it may go, are to\n          be found in the text and spirit of the Constitution\n          itself.&quot; [para 136]\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">82. The     Wolfenden     Committee     in     considering   whether\n\n    homosexual acts between consenting adults in private\n\n    should cease to be criminal offences examined a similar\n\n    argument of morality in favour of retaining them as such. It\n\n    was urged that conduct of this kind is a cause of the\n\n    demoralisation and decay of civilisations, and that, therefore,\n\n    unless the Committee wished to see the nation degenerate\n\n    and decay, such conduct must be stopped, by every possible\n\n    means. Rejecting this argument, the Committee observed:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">    &quot;We have found no evidence to support this view, and we\n\n    cannot feel it right to frame the laws which should govern\n\n    this country in the present age by reference to hypothetical\n\n    explanations of the history of other peoples in ages distant in\n\n    time and different in circumstances from our own.

Many\n\n    people feel this revulsion, for one or more of these reasons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">    But moral conviction or instinctive feeling, however strong, is\n\n    not a valid basis for overriding the individual&#x27;s privacy and\n\n    for bringing within the ambit of the criminal law private\n\n    sexual behaviour of this kind.&quot; [para 54] The Committee\n\n    regarded the function of the criminal law in this field as:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">             &quot;to preserve public order and decency, to\n             protect the citizen from what is offensive or\n             injurious,   and     to    provide     sufficient\n             safeguards     against      exploitation     and\n             corruption of others, particularly those who\n             are specially vulnerable because they are\n             young, weak in body or mind, inexperienced,\n             or in a state of special physical, official, or\n             economic dependence, but not to intervene\n             in the private lives of citizens, or to seek to\n             enforce any particular pattern of behaviour,\n             further than is necessary to carry out the\n             purposes we have outlined.&quot; [para 13 and\n             14]\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">83.

It also makes no distinction\n\n    between the consensual and non-consensual acts between\n\n    adults. Consensual sex between adults in private does not\n\n    cause any harm to anybody.        Thus it is evident that the\n\n    disparate grouping in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 377</a> IPC does not take into\n\n    account relevant factors such as consent, age and the\n\n    nature of the act or the absence of harm caused to anybody.\n\n    Public animus and disgust towards a particular social group\n\n    or vulnerable minority is not a valid ground for classification\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_193\">Article 14.</a>    <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 377</a> IPC targets the homosexual\n\n    community as a class and is motivated by an animus\n\n    towards this vulnerable class of people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">92. According to Union of India, the stated object of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 377</a>\n\n    IPC is to protect women and children, prevent the spread of\n\n    HIV/AIDS     and     enforce    societal    morality     against\n\n    homosexuality. It is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_196\">Section 377</a> IPC, whatever its\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 75 of 105</span>\n     present pragmatic application, was not enacted keeping in\n\n    mind instances of child sexual abuse or to fill the lacuna in a\n\n    rape law. It was based on a conception of sexual morality\n\n    specific to Victorian era drawing on notions of carnality and\n\n    sinfulness. In any way, the legislative object of protecting\n\n    women and children has no bearing in regard to consensual\n\n    sexual acts between adults in private.                   The second\n\n    legislative purpose elucidated is that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 377</a> IPC serves\n\n    the cause of public health by criminalising the homosexual\n\n    behaviour.        As already held, this purported legislative\n\n    purpose is in complete contrast to the averments in NACO&#x27;s\n\n    affidavit. NACO has specifically stated that enforcement of\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 377</a> IPC adversely contributes to pushing the\n\n    infliction underground, make risky sexual practices go\n\n    unnoticed and unaddressed. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 377</a> IPC thus hampers\n\n    HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. Lastly, as held earlier, it is not\n\n    within the constitutional competence of the State to invade\n\n    the privacy of citizens lives or regulate conduct to which the\n\n    citizen alone is concerned solely on the basis of public\n\n    morals.      The criminalisation of private sexual relations\n\n    between consenting adults absent any evidence of serious\n\n    harm deems the provision&#x27;s objective both arbitrary and\n\n    unreasonable.      The state interest &quot;must be legitimate and\n\n    relevant&quot; for the legislation to be non-arbitrary and must be\n\n    proportionate towards achieving the state interest.            If the\n\n    objective    is   irrational,   unjust   and   unfair,    necessarily\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                    Page 76 of 105</span>\n     classification will have to be held as unreasonable.               The\n\n    nature of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 377</a> IPC and its purpose is\n\n    to criminalise private conduct of consenting adults which\n\n    causes no harm to anyone else.            It has no other purpose\n\n    than to criminalise conduct which fails to conform with the\n\n    moral or religious views of a section of society.

Learned ASG strenuously contended that the Judges must\n\n    maintain judicial self-restraint while exercising the power of\n\n    judicial review of legislation. There is a broad separation of\n\n    powers under the Constitution, and the three organs of the\n\n    State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, must\n\n    respect each other and must not ordinarily encroach into\n\n    each others&#x27; domain.     The legislature is a democratically\n\n    elected body which expresses the will of the people, and in a\n\n    democracy, this will is not to be lightly frustrated or\n\n    obstructed. The Court should, therefore, ordinarily defer to\n\n    the decision of the legislature as it is the best judge of what\n\n    is good for the community. He placed reliance on a recent\n\n    judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/856631/\" id=\"a_261\">Government\n\n    of Andhra Pradesh v. P. Laxmi Devi</a>, (2008) 4 SCC 720,\n\n    where the Court after referring to the classic essay of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                Page 93 of 105</span>\n     Professor James Bradley Thayer entitled &quot;The Origin and\n\n    Scope of the American Doctrine of Constitutional Law&quot; and\n\n    certain observations of Justice Felix Frankfurter, held as\n\n    follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1509783\" id=\"span_83\">&quot;46. In our opinion, there is one and only one\n        ground for declaring an Act of the legislature (or a\n        provision in the Act) to be invalid, and that is if it\n        clearly violates some provision of the Constitution\n        in so evident a manner as to leave no manner of\n        doubt.      This violation can, of course, be in\n        different ways, e.g. if a State legislature makes a\n        law which only the Parliamnet can make under\n        List I to the Seventh Schedule, in which case it will\n        violate <a href=\"/doc/671198/\" id=\"a_262\">Article 246(1)</a> of the Constitution, or the\n        law violates some specific provision of the\n        Constitution (other than the directive principles).\n        But before declaring the statute to be\n        unconstitutional, the Court must be absolutely\n        sure that there can be no manner of doubt that it\n        violates a provision of the Constitution. If two\n        views are possible, one making the statute\n        constitutional    and     the  other     making     it\n        unconstitutional, the former view must always be\n        preferred. Also, the Court must make every effort\n        to uphold the constitutional validity of a statute,\n        even if that requries giving a strained\n        construction or narrowing down its scope vide\n        <a href=\"/doc/1509783/\" id=\"a_263\">Mark Netto v.

In\n        evaluating such elusive factors and forming their\n        own conception of what is reasonable, in all the\n        circumstances of a given case, it is inevitable that\n        the social philosophy and the scale of values of the\n        Judges participating in the decision should play an\n        important part, and the limit to their interference\n        with legislative judgment in such cases can only be\n        dictated by their sense of responsibility and self-\n        restraint and the sobering reflection that the\n        Constitution is meant not only for people of their\n        way of thinking but for all, and that the majority of\n        the elected representatives of the people have, in\n        authorising the imposition of the restrictions,\n        considered them to be reasonable.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">118.

It is the duty of the court to be\n        watchful to protect the constitutional rights of a\n        citizen as against any encroachment gradually or\n        stealthily thereon.

After the conclusion of oral hearing, learned ASG filed his\n\n    written submissions in which he claimed that the courts\n\n    have only to interpret the law as it is and have no power to\n\n    declare the law invalid. According to him, therefore, if we\n\n    were to agree with the petitioner, we could only make\n\n    recommendation to Parliament and it is for Parliament to\n\n    amend the law.     We are constrained to observe that the\n\n    submission of learned ASG reflects rather poorly on his\n\n    understanding of the constitutional scheme.             It is a\n\n    fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme that\n\n    every organ of the State, every authority under the\n\n    Constitution derives its power or authority under the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 99 of 105</span>\n     Constitution and has to act within the limits of powers. The\n\n    judiciary is constituted as the ultimate interpreter of the\n\n    Constitution and to it is assigned the delicate task of\n\n    determining what is the extent and scope of the power\n\n    conferred on each branch of government, what are the\n\n    limits on the exercise of such power under the Constitution\n\n    and whether any action of any branch transgresses such\n\n    limits. The role of the judiciary is to protect the fundamental\n\n    rights. A modern democracy while based on the principle of\n\n    majority rule implicitly recognizes the need to protect the\n\n    fundamental rights of those who may dissent or deviate\n\n    from the majoritarian view. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_96\">It is the job of the judiciary to\n\n    balance the principles ensuring that the government on the\n\n    basis of number does not override fundamental rights.

If, however, this is not possible, it\n         becomes necessary to decide whether the law is\n         bad as a whole, or whether the bad part can be\n         severed from the good part. The question of\n         construction, and the question of severability are\n         thus two distinct questions&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">         ....\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">         3.9 There are two kinds of severability : a\n         statutory provision may contain distinct and\n         separate words dealing with distinct and separate\n         topics, as for example, one sub-section may apply\n         it retrospectively. The first sub-section may be\n         valid and the second void. In such a case, the\n         Court may delete the second sub-section by\n         treating it as severable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                    Page 101 of 105</span>\n         3.10 There     is   however     another   kind   of\n        severability namely severability in application, or\n        severability in enforcement. The question of this\n        other kind of severability arises when an\n        impugned provision is one indivisible whole, as for\n        instance, the definition of a word.            Here\n        severability cannot be applied by deleting an\n        offending provision and leaving the rest standing.\n        It becomes necessary therefore to enquire\n        whether the impugned definition embraces\n        distinct classes and categories of subject matter\n        in respect to some of which the Legislature has no\n        power to legislate or is otherwise subject to a\n        Constitutional limit.    If it is found that the\n        definition does cover distinct and separate classes\n        and categories, the Court will restrain the\n        enforcement of the law in respect of that class of\n        subjects in respect of which the law is invalid.\n        This might be done by granting perpetual\n        injunction restraining the enforcement of law on\n        the      forbidden     field,     as    held     in\n        Chamarbaughwalla&#x27;s Case (1957) S.C.R. 930.\n        3.11 The principle of severability in application\n        was first adopted by our Sup. Ct. when dealing\n        with the contention that a tax law must be\n        declared wholly void if it was bad in part as\n        transgressing Constitutional limitations.

The notion of equality in the Indian Constitution flows from\n\n    the &#x27;Objective Resolution&#x27; moved by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru\n\n    on December 13, 1946. Nehru, in his speech, moving this\n\n    Resolution wished that the House should consider the\n\n    Resolution not in a spirit of narrow legal wording, but rather\n\n    look at the spirit behind that Resolution. He said, &quot;Words are\n\n    magic things often enough, but even the magic of words\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                               Page 103 of 105</span>\n     sometimes cannot convey the magic of the human spirit and\n\n    of a Nation&#x27;s passion........

If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be\n\n    underlying theme of the Indian Constitution, it is that of\n\n    &#x27;inclusiveness&#x27;. This Court believes that Indian Constitution\n\n    reflects this value deeply ingrained in Indian society,\n\n    nurtured over several generations. The inclusiveness that\n\n    Indian society traditionally displayed, literally in every\n\n    aspect of life, is manifest in recognising a role in society for\n\n    everyone. Those perceived by the majority as &quot;deviants&#x27; or\n\n    &#x27;different&#x27; are not on that score excluded or ostracised.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">131. Where society can display inclusiveness and understanding,\n\n    such persons can be assured of a life of dignity and non-\n\n    discrimination. This was the &#x27;spirit behind the Resolution&#x27; of\n\n    which Nehru spoke so passionately. In our view, Indian\n\n    Constitutional law does not permit the statutory criminal law\n\n    to be held captive by the popular misconceptions of who the\n\n    LGBTs are. It cannot be forgotten that discrimination is anti-\n\n    thesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality\n\n    which will foster the dignity of every individual.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">[WP(C)7455/2001]                                 Page 104 of 105</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\"> 132.
