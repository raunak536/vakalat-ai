Freedom of expression and right to information\nIn the Constitution of our democratic Republic, among the\nfundamental freedoms, freedom of speech and expression\nshines radiantly in the firmament of Part III. We must take\nlegitimate pride that this cherished freedom has grown from\nstrength to strength in the post independent era. It has been\nconstantly nourished and shaped to new dimensions in tune\nwith the contemporary needs by the constitutional Courts.\nBarring a few aberrations, the Executive Government and the\nPolitical Parties too have not lagged behind in safeguarding this\nvaluable right which is the insignia of democratic culture of a\nnation. Nurtured by this right, Press and electronic media have\nemerged as powerful instruments to mould the public opinion\nand to educate, entertain and enlighten the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">Freedom of speech and expression, just as equality clause\nand the guarantee of life and liberty has been very broadly\nconstrued by this Court right from 1950s. It has been variously\ndescribed as a &#x27;basic human right&#x27;, &#x27;a natural right&#x27; and the like.\nIt embraces within its scope the freedom of propagation and\ninter-change of ideas, dissemination of information which would\nhelp formation of one&#x27;s opinion and viewpoint  and debates on\nmatters of public concern. The importance which our\nConstitution- makers wanted to attach to this freedom is evident\nfrom the fact that reasonable restrictions on that right could be\nplaced by law only on the limited grounds specified in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n19(2)</a>, not to speak of inherent limitations of the right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_2\">In due course of time, several species of rights\nunenumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> have branched off from the\ngenus of the Article through the process of  interpretation by\nthis apex Court. One such right is the &#x27;right to information&#x27;.\nPerhaps, the first decision which has adverted to this right is\n<a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_7\">State of U.P. Vs.

That was the primary\nquestion decided <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_16\">in that case</a>.

Right to information in the context of the voter&#x27;s right\nto know the details of contesting candidates and the right of the\nmedia and others to enlighten the voter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"6396968\" id=\"span_7\">For the first time in <a href=\"/doc/6396968/\" id=\"a_19\">Union of India Vs. Association</a> for\nDemocratic Reforms&#x27; case (supra), which is the forerunner to the\npresent controversy, the right to know about the candidate\nstanding for election has been brought within the sweep of\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> There can be no doubt that by doing so, a new\ndimension has been given to the right embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_21\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> through a creative approach dictated by the need to\nimprove and refine the political process of election. In carving\nout this right, the Court had not traversed a beaten track but\ntook a fresh path.  It must be noted that the right to information\nevolved by this Court in the said case is qualitatively different\nfrom the right to get information about public affairs or the right\nto receive information through the Press and electronic media,\nthough to a certain extent, there may be overlapping.  The right\nto information of the voter/citizen is sought to be enforced\nagainst an individual who intends to become a public figure and\nthe information relates to his personal matters. Secondly, that\nright cannot materialize without State&#x27;s intervention. The State\nor its instrumentality has to compel a subject to make the\ninformation available to public, by means of legislation or orders\nhaving the force of law.</span>  With respect, I am unable to share the\nview that it stands on the same footing as right to telecast and\nthe right to view the sports and games or other items of\nentertainment through television (vide observations at\nParagraph 38 of of Association for Democratic Reforms case).\nOne more observation at Paragraph 30 to the effect that &quot;the\ndecision making process of a voter would include his right to\nknow about public functionaries who are required to be elected\nby him&quot; needs  explanation. Till a candidate gets elected and\nenters the House, it would not be appropriate to refer to him as a\npublic functionary. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_8\">Therefore, the right to know about a public\nact done by a public functionary to which we find reference in\n<a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_22\">Raj Narain</a>&#x27;s case (supra) is not the same thing\t as the right to\nknow about the antecedents of the candidate contesting for the\nelection. Nevertheless, the conclusion reached by the Court that\nthe voter has such a right and that the right falls within the realm\nof freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_23\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> can be justified on good and substantial grounds. To\nthis aspect, I will advert a little later.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"6396968\" id=\"span_9\">Before that, I would like to\nsay that it would have been in the fitness of the things if the\ncase [<a href=\"/doc/6396968/\" id=\"a_24\">U.O.I. vs. Association</a> for Democratic Reforms] was\nreferred to the Constitution Bench as per the mandate of  <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_25\">Article\n145(3)</a> for the reason that a new dimension has been added to\nthe concept of freedom of expression so as to bring within its\nambit a new species of right to information. Apparently, no such\nrequest was made at the hearing and all parties invited the\ndecision of three Judge Bench. The law has been laid down\ntherein elevating the right to secure information about a\ncontesting candidate to the position of a fundamental right. That\ndecision has been duly taken note of by the Parliament and\nacted upon by the Election Commission. It has attained finality.\nAt this stage, it would not be appropriate to set the clock back\nand refer the matter to Constitution Bench to test the\ncorrectness of the view taken <a href=\"/doc/6396968/\" id=\"a_26\">in that case</a>. I agree with my\nlearned brother Shah, J. in this respect. However, I would prefer\nto give reasons of my own-may not be very different from what\nthe learned Judge had expressed, to demonstrate that the\nproposition <a href=\"/doc/6396968/\" id=\"a_27\">laid down by</a> this Court rests on a firm\nConstitutional basis.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">I shall now  proceed to elucidate as to how the right to\nknow the details about the contesting candidate should be\nregarded as a part of the freedom of expression guaranteed by\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> This issue has to be viewed from more than one\nangle-from the point of view of the voter, the public viz.,\nrepresentatives of Press, organizations such as the petitioners\nwhich are interested in taking up public issues and thirdly from\nthe point of view of the persons seeking election to the\nlegislative bodies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1867182\" id=\"span_10\">The trite saying that &#x27;democracy is for the people, of the\npeople and by the people&#x27; has to be remembered for ever. In a\ndemocratic republic, it is the will of the people that is paramount\nand becomes the basis of the authority of the Government. The\nwill is expressed in periodic elections based on universal adult\nsuffrage held by means of secret ballot. It is through the ballot\nthat the voter expresses his choice or preference for a\ncandidate.  &quot;Voting is formal expression of will or opinion by the\nperson entitled to exercise the right on the subject or issue&quot;, as\nobserved by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1867182/\" id=\"a_29\">Lily Thomas Vs. Speaker, Lok Sabha</a>\n[(1993) 4 SCC 234] quoting from Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary. The\ncitizens of the country are enabled to take part in the\nGovernment through their chosen representatives. In a\nParliamentary democracy like ours, the Government of the day\nis responsible to the people through their elected\nrepresentatives. The elected representative acts or is supposed\nto act as a live link between the people and the Government. The\npeoples&#x27;  representatives fill the role of law-makers and\ncustodians of Government. People look to them for ventilation\nand redressal of their grievances. They are the focal point of the\nwill and authority of the people at large. The moment they put in\npapers for contesting the election, they are subjected to public\ngaze and public scrutiny. The character, strength and weakness\nof the candidate is widely debated. Nothing is therefore more\nimportant for sustenance of democratic polity than the voter\nmaking an intelligent and rational choice of his or her\nrepresentative. For this, the voter should be in a position to\neffectively formulate his/her opinion and to ultimately express\nthat opinion through ballot by casting the vote. The concomitant\nof the right to vote which is the basic postulate of democracy is\nthus  two fold: first, formulation of opinion about the candidates\nand second, the expression of choice by casting the vote in\nfavour of the preferred candidate at the polling booth. The first\nstep is complementary to the other. Many a voter will be\nhandicapped in formulating the opinion and making a proper\nchoice of the candidate unless the essential information\nregarding the candidate is available. The  voter/citizen should\nhave at least the basic information about the contesting\ncandidate, such as his involvement in serious criminal offences.\nTo scuttle the flow of information-relevant and essential would\naffect the electorate&#x27;s ability to evaluate the candidate. Not only\nthat, the information relating to the candidates will pave the way\nfor public debate on the merits and demerits of the candidates.\nWhen once there is public disclosure of the relevant details\nconcerning the candidates, the Press, as a  media of mass\ncommunication and voluntary organizations vigilant enough to\nchannel the public opinion on right lines will be able to\ndisseminate the information  and thereby enlighten and alert the\npublic at large regarding the adverse antecedents of a\ncandidate. It will go a long way in promoting the freedom of\nspeech and expression. That goal would be accomplished in two\nways. It will help the voter who is interested in seeking and\nreceiving information about the candidate to form an opinion\naccording to his or her conscience and best of judgment and\nsecondly it will facilitate the Press and voluntary organizations\nin imparting information on a matter of vital public concern. An\ninformed voter-whether he acquires information directly by\nkeeping track of disclosures or through the Press and other\nchannels of communication, will be able to fulfil his\nresponsibility in a more satisfactory manner. An enlightened and\ninformed citizenry would undoubtedly enhance democratic\nvalues.\t Thus, the availability of proper and relevant information\nabout  the candidate fosters and promotes the freedom of\nspeech and expression both from the point of view of imparting\nand receiving the information. In turn, it would lead to the\npreservation of the integrity of electoral process which is so\nessential for the growth of democracy. Though I do not go to the\nextent of remarking that the election will be a farce if the\ncandidates&#x27; antecedents are not known to the voters, I would\nsay that such information will certainly be conducive to fairness\nin election process and integrity in public life. The disclosure of\ninformation would facilitate and augment the freedom of\nexpression both from the point of view of the voter as well as the\nmedia through which the information is publicized and openly\ndebated.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">The problem can be approached from another angle. As\nobserved by this Court in Association for Democratic Reforms&#x27;\ncase (supra), a voter &#x27;speaks out or expresses by casting vote&#x27;.\nFreedom of expression, as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\nwhich in many respects overlaps and coincides with freedom of\nspeech, has manifold meanings. It need not and ought not to be\nconfined to expressing something  in words orally or in writing.\nThe act of manifesting by action or language is one of the\nmeanings given in Ramanatha Iyer&#x27;s Law Lexicon\t(edited by\nJustice Y.V. Chandrachud). Even a manifestation of an emotion,\nfeeling etc., without words would amount to expression. The\nexample given in Collin&#x27;s Dictionary of English language (1983\nreprint) is: &quot;tears are an expression of grief&quot;, is quite apposite.\nAnother shade of meaning is: &quot;a look  on the face that indicates\nmood or emotion; eg:   a joyful expression&quot;. Communication of\nemotion and display of talent through music, painting etc., is\nalso a sort of expression. Having regard to the comprehensive\nmeaning of phrase &#x27;expression&#x27;, voting can be legitimately\nregarded as a form of expression. Ballot is the instrument by\nwhich the voter expresses his choice between candidates or in\nrespect to propositions; and his &#x27;vote&#x27; is his choice or election,\nas expressed by his ballot (vide &#x27;A Dictionary of Modern Legal\nUsage&#x27;; 2nd Edition, by Garner Bryan A). &quot;Opinion expressed,\nresolution or decision carried, by voting&quot; is one of the meanings\ngiven to the expression &#x27;vote&#x27; in the New Oxford Illustrated\nDictionary. It is well settled and it needs no emphasis that the\nfundamental right of freedom of speech and expression should\nbe broadly construed and it has been so construed all these\nyears. In the light of this, the dictum of the Court that the voter\n&quot;speaks out or expresses by casting a vote&quot; is apt and well\nfounded. I would only reiterate and say that freedom of voting by\nexpressing preference for a candidate is nothing but freedom of\nexpressing oneself in relation to a matter of prime concern to\nthe country and the voter himself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">I.\t (3) Right to vote is a Constitutional right though not a\nfundamental right but right to make choice by means of ballot is\npart of freedom of expression.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">The right to vote for the candidate of one&#x27;s choice is of the\nessence of democratic polity. This right is recognized by our\nConstitution and it is given effect to in specific form by the\n<a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_31\">Representation of the People Act</a>. The Constituent Assembly\ndebates reveal that the idea to treat the voting right as a\nfundamental right was dropped; nevertheless, it was decided to\nprovide for it elsewhere in the Constitution. This move found its\nexpression in <a href=\"/doc/1620503/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 326</a> which enjoins\t that &quot;the elections to\nthe House of the People and to the Legislative Assembly of\nevery State shall be on the basis of adult suffrage; that is to say,\nevery person who is a citizen of India and who is not less than\n21* years of age, and is not otherwise disqualified under the\nConstitution or law on the ground of non-residence,\nunsoundness of mind, crime, corrupt or illegal practice-shall\nbe entitled to be registered as voter at such election&quot; (* Now 18\nyears). However, case after case starting from Ponnuswami&#x27;s case\n[(1952) SCR 218] characterized\tit as a statutory right.  &quot;The right\nto vote or stand as a candidate for election&quot;,\tit was observed in\nPonnuswami&#x27;s case &quot;is not a civil right but is a creature of\nstatute or special law and must be subject to the limitations\nimposed\t by it.&quot;  It was further elaborated in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t&quot;Strictly speaking, it is the sole right of the\nLegislature to examine and determine all matters\nrelating to the election of  its own members, and if\nthe legislature takes it out of its own hands and\nvests in a special tribunal an entirely new and\nunknown jurisdiction, that special jurisdiction\nshould be exercised in accordance with the law\nwhich creates it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"46932\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/46932/\" id=\"a_33\">Jyoti Basu  Vs. Debi Ghosal</a> [1982 (3) SCR 318] this\nCourt again pointed out in no uncertain terms that: &quot; a right to\nelect, fundamental though it is to democracy, is, anomalously\nenough, neither a fundamental right nor a common law right.  It\nis pure and simple a statutory right.&quot;\tWith great reverence to\nthe eminent Judges, I would like to clarify that the right to vote,\nif not a fundamental  right, is certainly a constitutional right.  The\nright originates from the Constitution and in accordance with the\nconstitutional mandate\tcontained in <a href=\"/doc/1620503/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 326</a>, the right has\nbeen shaped  by the statute, namely, <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_35\">R.P. Act</a>.\tThat, in my\nunderstanding, is the correct legal position as regards the\nnature of the right to vote in elections to the House of people\nand Legislative Assemblies.  It is not very accurate to describe it\nas a  statutory right, pure and simple.\t Even with this\nclarification, the argument of the learned Solicitor General that\nthe right to vote not being a fundamental right, the information\nwhich at best facilitates meaningful exercise of that right cannot\nbe read as an integral part of any  fundamental right, remains to\nbe squarely met.   Here, a distinction has to be drawn between\nthe conferment of the right to vote on fulfillment of requisite\ncriteria and the culmination of that right in the final act of\nexpressing  choice towards a particular candidate by means of\nballot.\t Though the initial right cannot be placed on the pedestal\nof a fundamental right, but, at the stage when the voter goes to\nthe polling booth and casts his vote, his freedom to express\narises.\t The casting of vote in favour of one or the other\ncandidate tantamounts to expression of his opinion and\npreference and that final stage in the exercise of voting right\nmarks the accomplishment of freedom of expression of the\nvoter. That is where <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is attracted.  Freedom of\nvoting as distinct from right to vote is thus a species of freedom\nof expression and therefore carries with it the auxiliary  and\ncomplementary rights such  as right to secure information about\nthe candidate which are conducive to the freedom.  None of the\ndecisions of this Court\t wherein  the proposition  that the right\nto vote is a pure and simple statutory right was declared and\nreiterated, considered the question whether the citizen&#x27;s\nfreedom of expression  is or is not involved when a citizen\nentitled to vote casts his vote in favour of one or the other\ncandidate.</span>  The issues that arose in Ponnuswami&#x27;s case and\nvarious cases cited by the learned Solicitor-General fall broadly\nwithin the realm of procedural or remedial aspects of\nchallenging the election or the nomination of a candidate.  None\nof these decisions, in my view, go counter to the proposition\naccepted by us that the fundamental right  of freedom of\nexpression sets in when a voter actually casts his vote.   I,\ntherefore,  find no merit in the submission made by the learned\nSolicitor General that these writ petitions have to be referred to a\nlarger bench in view of the apparent conflict.\tAs already stated,\nthe factual matrix and legal issues involved in those cases were\ndifferent and the view, we are taking, does not go counter to the\nactual ratio of the said decisions rendered by the eminent\nJudges of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1588713\" id=\"span_12\">Reliance has been placed by the learned Solicitor General\non the Constitution Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1588713/\" id=\"a_37\">Jamuna Prasad Vs.\nLachhi Ram</a> [(1955) 1 SCR Page 608]. That was a case of special\nappeal to this Court against the decision of an Election Tribunal.\nApart from assailing the finding of the Tribunal on the aspect of\n&#x27;corrupt practice&#x27;, Sections 123(5) and 124(5) (as they stood\nthen) of the <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_38\">R.P. Act</a> were challenged as ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_39\">Article\n19(1)(a).</a> The former provision declared the character\nassassination of a candidate as a major corrupt practice and the\nlatter provision made an appeal to vote on the ground of caste\ta\nminor corrupt practice. The contention that these provisions\nimpinged on the freedom of speech and expression was\nunhesitatingly rejected. The Court observed that those\nprovisions did not stop a man from speaking. They merely\nprescribed conditions which must be observed if a citizen\nwanted to enter the Parliament. It was further observed that the\nright to stand as a candidate and contest an election is a special\nright created by the statute and can only be exercised on the\nconditions <a href=\"/doc/1588713/\" id=\"a_40\">laid down by</a> the statute. In that context, the Court\nmade an observation that the fundamental right chapter had no\nbearing on the right to contest the election which is created by\nthe statute and the appellant had no fundamental right to be\nelected as a member of\tParliament. If a person wants to get\nelected, he must observe the rules <a href=\"/doc/1588713/\" id=\"a_41\">laid down by</a> law. So holding,\nthose Sections were held to be intra vires.  I do not think that\nthis decision which dealt with the contesting candidate&#x27;s rights\nand obligations has any bearing on the freedom of expression of\nthe voter and the public in general in the context of elections.\nThe remark that &#x27;the fundamental right chapter has no bearing\non a right like this created by statute&#x27; cannot be divorced from\nthe context in which it was made.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_13\">The learned senior counsel appearing for one of the\ninterveners (B.J.P.) has advanced the contention that if the right\nto information is culled out from <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and read as an\nintegral part of that right, it is fraught with dangerous\nconsequences inasmuch as the grounds of reasonable\nrestrictions which could be imposed are by far limited and\ntherefore, the Government may be constrained to part with\ncertain sensitive informations which would not be in public\ninterest to disclose. This raises the larger question whether\napart from the heads of restriction envisaged by sub-Article (2)\nof <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 19</a>, certain inherent limitations should not be read into\nthe Article, if it becomes necessary to do so in national or\nsocietal interest.

The learned Judge was of the view\nthat the freedom of speech and expression cannot be so\nexercised as to endanger the interest of the nation or the\ninterest of the society, even if the expression &#x27;national interest&#x27;\nor &#x27;public interest&#x27; has not been used in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19(2).</a> It was\npointed out that such implied limitation has been read into the\nfirst amendment of the U.S. Constitution which guarantees the\nfreedom of speech and expression in unqualified terms.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"> The following observations of the U.S. Supreme Court in\nGiltow Vs.

By virtue of the\n<a href=\"/doc/192048/\" id=\"a_50\">Representation of the People (Amendment) Act, 2002</a> the only\ninformation which a prospective contestant is required to\nfurnish apart from the information which he is obliged to\ndisclose under the existing provisions is the information on two\npoints: (i) Whether he is accused of any offence punishable with\nimprisonment for two years or more in a pending case in which\na charge has been framed and; (ii) Whether he has been\nconvicted of an offence (other than the offence referred to in\nsub-Sections (1) to (3) of <a href=\"/doc/195408352/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 8</a>) and sentenced to\nimprisonment for one year or more. On other points spelt out in\nthis Court&#x27;s judgment, the candidate is not liable to furnish any\ninformation and that is so, notwithstanding anything contained\nin any judgment or order of a Court OR any direction, order or\ninstruction issued by the Election Commission.\tOmission to\nfurnish the information as per the mandate of Section 33B and\nfurnishing false information in that behalf is made punishable.\nThat is the sum and substance of the two provisions namely,\nSection 33A and 33B.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">The plain effect of the embargo contained in Section 33B is\nto nullify substantially the directives issued by the Election\nCommission pursuant to the judgment of this Court. At present,\nthe instructions issued by the Election Commission could only\noperate in respect of the items specified in Section 33A and\nnothing more. It is for this reason that Section 33B has been\nchallenged as ultra vires the Constitution both on the ground\nthat it affects the fundamental right of the voter/citizen to get\nadequate information about the candidate and that the\nParliament is incompetent to nullify the judgment of this Court. I\nshall briefly notice the rival contentions on this crucial issue.\nII.\t (2). Contentions:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">Petitioners&#x27; contention is that the legislation on the subject\nof disclosure of particulars of candidates should adopt in\nentirety the directives issued by this Court to the Election\nCommission in the pre-ordinance period. Any dilution or\ndeviation of those norms or directives would necessarily violate\nthe fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> as\ninterpreted by this Court and therefore the law, as enacted by\nParliament, infringes the said guarantee. This contention has\napparently been accepted by my learned brother M.B. Shah, J.\nThe other view point presented on behalf of Union of India  and\none of the interveners is that the freedom of legislature in\nidentifying and evolving the specific areas in which such\ninformation should be made public cannot be curtailed by\nreference to the ad hoc directives given by this Court in pre-\nordinance period and the legislative wisdom of Parliament,\nespecially in election matters, cannot be questioned. This is the\nposition even if the right to know about the candidate is\nconceded to be part of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> It is for the Parliament to\ndecide to what extent and how far the information should be\nmade available. In any case, it is submitted that the Court&#x27;s\nverdict has been duly taken note of by Parliament and certain\nprovisions have been made to promote the right to information\nvis--vis the contesting candidates. Section 33B is only a part of\nthis exercise and it does not go counter to <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> even\nthough the scope of public disclosures has been limited to one\nimportant aspect only.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">II.\t (3). Broad points for consideration\n\nA liberal but not a constricted approach in the matter of\ndisclosure of information  in relation to candidates seeking\nelection is no doubt a desideratum. The wholesale adoption of\nthe  Court&#x27;s diktats  on the various items of information while\nenacting the legislation would have received public approbation\nand would have been welcomed by public. It would have been in\ntune with the recommendations of various Commissions and\neven the statements made by eminent and responsible political\npersonalities.\tHowever, the fact remains that the Parliament in\nits discretion did not go the whole hog, but chose to limiting the\nscope of mandated disclosures to one only of the important\naspects highlighted in the judgment. The question remains to be\nconsidered whether in doing so, the Parliament out-stepped its\nlimits and enacted a law in violation of the guarantee enshrined\nin <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. The allied question is\nwhether the Parliament has no option but to scrupulously adopt\nthe directives given by this Court to the Election Commission. Is\nit open to the Parliament to independently view the issue and\nformulate the parameters and contents of disclosure, though it\nhas the effect of diluting or diminishing the scope of disclosures\nwhich, in the perception of the Court, were  desirable? In\nconsidering these questions of far reaching importance from the\nConstitutional angle, it is necessary to have a clear idea of the\nratio and implications of this Court&#x27;s Judgment in the\nAssociation for Democratic Reforms case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">II.\t(4) Analysis of the judgment in Association for Democratic\nReforms case-whether and how far the directives given therein\nhave impact on the Parliamentary legislation-Approach of\nCourt in testing the legislation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"> The first proposition laid down by this Court in the said\ncase is that a citizen/voter has the right to know about the\nantecedents of the contesting candidate and that right is a part\nof the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In this context,\nM.B. Shah, J. observed that-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;...Voter&#x27;s speech or expression in case of\nelection would include casting of votes, that is\nto say, voter speaks out or expresses by casting\nvote.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">It was then pointed out that the information about the candidate\nto be selected is essential as it would be conducive to\ntransparency  and purity in the process of  election.  The next\nquestion considered was how best to enforce that right. The\nCourt having noticed that there was void in the field in the sense\nthat it was not covered by any legislative provision, gave\ndirections to the Election Commission to fill the vacuum by\nrequiring the candidate to furnish information on the specified\naspects while filing the nomination paper.  Five items of\ninformation which the Election Commission should call for from\nthe prospective candidates were spelt out by the Court. Two of\nthem relate to criminal background of the candidate and\npendency of criminal cases against him. Points 3 &amp; 4 relate to\nassets and liabilities of the candidate and his/her family. The last\none is about the educational qualifications of the candidate. The\nlegal basis and the justification for issuing such directives to the\nCommission has been stated thus (vide paragraphs    19 &amp; 20) :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;19. At the outset, we would say that it is not\npossible for this Court to give any directions for\namending the Act or the statutory Rules. It is for\nParliament to amend the Act and the Rules. It is\nalso established law that no direction can be\ngiven, which would be contrary to the Act and\nthe Rules.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">x\t\t\tx\t\t\tx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">20. However, it is equally settled that in case\nwhen the Act or Rules are silent on a particular\nsubject and the authority implementing the\nsame has constitutional or statutory power to\nimplement it, the Court can necessarily issue\ndirections or orders on the said subject to fill\nthe vacuum or void till the suitable law is\nenacted.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">Again, at paragraph 49 it was emphasized-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;It is to be stated that the Election Commission\nhas from time to time issued instructions/orders\nto meet with the situation where the field is\nunoccupied by the legislation. Hence, the norms\nand modalities to carry out and give effect to the\naforesaid directions should be drawn up\nproperly by the Election Commission as early as\npossible.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">Thus, the Court was conscious of the fact that the Election\nCommission could act in the matter only so long as the field is\nnot covered by legislation. The Court also felt that the vacuum\nor void should be suitably filled  so that the right to information\nconcerning a candidate would soon become a reality. In other\nwords, till the Parliament applied its mind and came forward with\nappropriate legislation to give effect to the right available to a\nvoter-citizen, the Court felt that the said goal has to be\ntranslated into action through the media of Election\nCommission, which is endowed with &#x27;residuary power&#x27; to\nregulate the election process in the best interests of the\nelectorate. Instead of leaving it to the Commission and with a\nview to give  quietus to the possible controversies that might\narise, the Court considered it expedient to spell out five points\n(broadly falling into three categories) on which the information\nhas to be called for from the contesting candidate. In the very\nnature of things, the directives given by the Court were intended\nto operate only till the law was made by legislature and in that\nsense &#x27;pro tempore&#x27; in nature. The five directives cannot be\nconsidered to be rigid theorems-inflexible  and immutable, but\nonly reflect the perception and tentative thinking of the Court at\na point of time when the legislature did not address itself to the\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">When the Parliament, in the aftermath of the verdict of\nthis   Court,  deliberated  and\t thought  it fit to secure the right to\n\n\ninformation to a citizen only to a limited extent (having a bearing\non criminal antecedents), a fresh look has to be necessarily\ntaken by the Court and the validity of the law made has to be\ntested on a clean slate. It must be remembered that the right to\nget information which is a corollary to the fundamental right to\nfree speech and expression has no fixed connotation. Its\ncontours and parameters cannot be precisely defined and the\nCourt in my understanding, never meant to do so. It is often a\nmatter of perception and approach. How far to go and where to\nstop? These are the questions to be pondered over by the\nLegislature and the Constitutional Court called upon to decide\nthe question of validity of legislation. For instance, many\nvoters/citizens may like to have more complete information-a\nsort of bio-data of the candidate starting from his school days\nsuch as his academic career, the properties which he had before\nand after entering into politics, the details of his income and tax\npayments for the last one decade and sources of acquisition of\nhis and his family&#x27;s wealth. Can it be said that all such\ninformation which will no doubt enable the voter and public to\nhave a comprehensive idea of the contesting candidate, should\nbe disclosed by a prospective candidate and that the failure to\nprovide for it by law would infringe the fundamental right under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 19(1)(a)?</a> The preponderance of\tview would be that it is\nnot reasonable to compel a candidate to make disclosures\naffecting his privacy to that extent in the guise of effectuating\nthe right to information. A line has to be drawn somewhere.\nWhile there cannot be a lip service to the valuable right to\ninformation, it should not be stretched too far. At the same time,\nthe essence and substratum of the right has to be preserved and\npromoted, when once it is brought within the fold of\nfundamental right. A balanced but not a rigid approach, is\nneeded in identifying and defining the parameters of the right\nwhich the voter/citizen has. The standards to be applied to\ndisclosures vis--vis public affairs and governance AND the\ndisclosures relating to personal life and bio-data of a candidate\ncannot be the same. The measure or yardstick will be somewhat\ndifferent.  It should not be forgotten that the candidates&#x27; right to\nprivacy is one of the many factors that could be kept in view,\nthough that right is always subject to overriding public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">In my view, the points of disclosure spelt out by this Court\nin the Association for Democratic Reforms case should serve as\nbroad indicators or parameters in enacting the legislation for the\npurpose of securing the right to information about the\ncandidate. The paradigms set by the Court, though pro tempore\nin nature as clarified supra, are entitled to due weight. If the\nlegislature in utter disregard of the indicators enunciated by this\nCourt proceeds to make a legislation providing only for a\nsemblance or pittance  of information or omits to provide for\ndisclosure on certain essential points, the law would then fail to\npass the muster of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Though certain amount of\ndeviation from the aspects of disclosure spelt out by this Court\nis not impermissible, a substantial departure cannot be\ncountenanced. The legislative provision should be such as to\npromote the right to information to a reasonable extent, if not to\nthe fullest extent on details of concern to the voters and citizens\nat large. While enacting the legislation, the legislature has to\nensure that the fundamental right to know about the candidate is\nreasonably secured and information which is crucial, by any\nobjective standards, is not denied.  It is for the  Constitutional\nCourt in exercise of its judicial review power to judge whether\nthe areas of disclosure carved out by the Legislature are\nreasonably adequate to safeguard the citizens&#x27; right to\ninformation.  The Court has to take a holistic view and adopt a\nbalanced approach, keeping in view the twin principles that the\ncitizens&#x27; right to information to know about the personal details\nof a candidate is not an unlimited right and that at any rate, it\nhas no fixed concept and the legislature has freedom to choose\nbetween two reasonable alternatives.\tIt is not a proper\napproach to test the validity of legislation only from the stand-\npoint whether the legislation implicitly and word to word gives\neffect to the directives issued by the Court as an ad hoc\nmeasure when the field was unoccupied by legislation. Once\nlegislation is made, this Court has to make an independent\nassessment in the process of evaluating whether the items of\ninformation statutorily ordained are reasonably adequate to\nsecure the right of information to the voter so as to facilitate him\nto form a fairly clear opinion on the merits and demerits of the\ncandidates. In embarking on this exercise, as already stated, this\nCourt&#x27;s directives on the points of disclosure even if they be\ntentative or ad hoc in nature, cannot be brushed aside, but\nshould be given due weight. But, I reiterate that the shape of\nlegislation need not be solely controlled by the directives issued\nto the Election Commission to meet an ad hoc situation. As I\nsaid earlier, the right to information cannot be placed in straight\njacket formulae and the perceptions regarding the extent and\namplitude of this right are bound to vary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">III.\tSection 33-B is unconstitutional\nIII.  (1). The right to information cannot be frozen and stagnated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\"> In my view, the Constitutional validity of Section 33B has\nto be judged from the above angle and perspective. Considered\nin that light, I agree with the conclusion of  M.B. Shah, J. that\nSection 33B does not pass the test of Constitutionality. The\nreasons are more than one. Firstly, when the right to secure\ninformation about a contesting candidate is recognized as an\nintegral part of fundamental right as it ought to be, it follows that\nits ambit, amplitude and parameters cannot be chained and\ncircumscribed for all time to come by declaring that no\ninformation, other than that specifically laid down in the Act,\nshould be required to be given. When the legislation delimiting\nthe areas of disclosure was enacted, it may be that the\nParliament felt that the disclosure on other aspects was not\nnecessary for the time being. Assuming that the guarantee of\nright to information is not violated by making a departure from\nthe paradigms set by the Court, it is not open to the Parliament\nto stop all further disclosures concerning the candidate in\nfuture. In other words, a blanket ban on dissemination of\ninformation other than that spelt out in the enactment,\nirrespective of need of the hour and the future exigencies and\nexpedients is, in my view, impermissible. It must be remembered\nthat the concept of freedom of speech and expression does not\nremain static.\t The felt necessities of the times coupled with\nexperiences drawn from the past may give rise to the need to\ninsist on additional information on the aspects not provided for\nby law. New situations and march of events may demand the\nflow of additional facets of information. The right to information\nshould be allowed to grow rather than being frozen and\nstagnated; but the mandate of Section 33B prefaced by the non\nobstante clause impedes the flow of such information conducive\nto the freedom of expression. In the face of the prohibition under\nSection 33B, the Election Commission which is entrusted with\nthe function of monitoring and supervising the election process\nwill have to sit back with a sense of helplessness inspite of the\npressing need for insisting on additional information. Even the\nCourt may at times feel handicapped in taking necessary\nremedial steps to enforce the right to information.  In my view,\nthe legislative injunction curtailing the nature of information to\nbe furnished by the contesting candidates only to the specific\nmatters provided for by the legislation and nothing more would\nemasculate the fundamental right to freedom of expression of\nwhich the right to information is a part. The very objective of\nrecognizing the right to information as part of the fundamental\nright under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> in order to ensure free and fair\nelections would be frustrated if the ban prescribed by Section\n33B is taken to its logical effect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">III.  (2) Impugned legislation fails to effectuate right to\ninformation on certain vital aspects.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\"> The second reason why Section 33B should be\ncondemned is that by blocking the ambit of disclosures only to\nwhat has been specifically provided for by the amendment, the\nParliament failed  to give effect to one of the vital aspects of\ninformation, viz., disclosure of assets and liabilities and thus\nfailed in substantial measure to give effect to the right to\ninformation as a part of the freedom of expression.  The right to\ninformation which is now provided for by the legislature no\ndoubt relates to one of the essential points but in ignoring the\nother essential aspect relating to assets and liabilities as\ndiscussed hereinafter, the Parliament has unduly restricted the\nambit of information which the citizens should have and thereby\nimpinged on the guarantee enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\nIII.   (3) How far the principle that the Legislature cannot\nencroach upon the judicial sphere applies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">It is a settled principle of constitutional jurisprudence that\nthe only way to render a judicial decision ineffective is to enact a\nvalid law by way of amendment or otherwise fundamentally\naltering the basis of the judgment either prospectively or\nretrospectively. The legislature cannot overrule or supersede a\njudgment of the Court without lawfully removing\t the defect or\ninfirmity pointed out by the Court because it is obvious that the\nlegislature cannot trench on the judicial power vested in the\nCourts. Relying on this principle, it is contended that the\ndecision of apex Constitutional Court cannot be set at naught in\nthe manner in which it has been done by the impugned\nlegislation. As a sequel,  it is further contended that the question\nof altering the basis of judgment or curing the defect does not\narise in the instant case as the Parliament cannot pass a law in\ncurtailment of fundamental right recognized, amplified and\nenforced by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">The contention that the fundamental basis of the decision\nin Association for Democratic Reforms case has not at all been\naltered by the Parliament, does not appeal to me. I have\ndiscussed at length the real scope and ratio of the judgment and\nthe nature and character of directives given by this Court to the\nElection Commission. As observed earlier, those directions are\npro tempore in nature when there was vacuum in the field. When\nonce the Parliament stepped in and passed the legislation\nproviding for right of information, may be on certain limited\naspects, the void must be deemed to have been filled up and the\njudgment works itself out, though the proposition laid down and\nobservations made in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> on the need\nto secure information to the citizens will hold good. Now the new\nlegislation has to be tested on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\nOf course, in doing so, the decision of this Court should be\ngiven due weight and there cannot be marked departure from\nthe items of information considered essential by this Court to\neffectuate the fundamental right to information. Viewed in this\nlight, it must be held that the Parliament did not by law provide\nfor disclosure of information on certain crucial points such as\nassets and liabilities and at the same time, placed an embargo\non calling for further informations by enacting Section 33B. That\nis where Section 33B of the impugned amendment Act does not\npass the muster of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, as interpreted by this Court.\nIV. Right to information with reference to specific aspects:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">I shall now discuss the specifics of the problem. With a\nview to promote the right to information, this Court gave certain\ndirectives to the Election Commission which, as I have already\nclarified, were ad hoc in nature. The Election Commission was\ndirected to call for details from the contesting candidates\nbroadly on three points, namely, (i) criminal record (ii) assets\nand liabilities and (iii) educational qualification. The third\namendment  to <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_64\">R.P. Act</a> which was preceded by an Ordinance\nprovided for disclosure of information. How far the third\namendment to the <a href=\"/doc/192048/\" id=\"a_65\">Representation of the People Act, 2002</a>\nsafeguards the right of information which is a part of the\nguaranteed right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, is the question to be\nconsidered now with specific reference to each of the three\npoints spelt out in the judgment of this Court in Association for\nDemocratic Reforms case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">IV.  (1). Criminal background and pending criminal cases against\ncandidates-Section 33-A of the R.P. (3rd Amendment) Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">As regards the first aspect, namely criminal record, the\ndirectives in Association for Democratic Reforms case are two\nfold: &quot;(i) whether the candidate is convicted/\nacquitted/discharged of any criminal case in the past-if any,\nwhether he is punished with imprisonment or fine and (ii) prior\nto six months of filing of nomination, whether the candidate is\nan accused in any pending case of any offence punishable with\nimprisonment for two years or more and in which charge is\nframed or cognizance  is taken by the Court of law.&quot; As regards\nthe second directive, the Parliament has substantially proceeded\non the same lines and made it obligatory to the candidate to\nfurnish information as to whether he is accused of any offence\npunishable with imprisonment for two years or more in a\npending case in which a charge has been framed by the\ncompetent Court. However, the case in which cognizance has\nbeen taken but charge has not been framed is not covered by\nClause (i) of Section 33A(I). The Parliament having taken the\nright step of compelling disclosure of the pendency of cases\nrelating to major offences, there is no good reason why it failed\nto provide for the disclosure of the cases of the same nature of\nwhich cognizance has been taken by the Court. It is common\nknowledge that on account of variety of reasons such as the\ndelaying tactics of one or the other accused and inadequacies of\nprosecuting machinery, framing of formal charges get delayed\nconsiderably, especially in serious cases where committal\nprocedure has to be gone through. On that account, the\nvoter/citizen shall not be denied information regarding\ncognizance taken by the Court of an offence punishable with\nimprisonment for two years or more. The citizen&#x27;s right to\ninformation, when once it is recognized to be part of the\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 19(I)(a)</a>, cannot be truncated in\nthe manner in which it has been done. Clause (i) of Section\n33(A)(I) therefore falls short of the avowed goal to effectuate the\nright of information on a vital aspect. Cases in which cognizance\nhas been taken should therefore be comprehended within the\narea of information accessible to the voters/citizens, in addition\nto what is provided for in Clause (i) of Section 33A.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">Coming to Clause (ii) of Section 33A(I), the Parliament\nbroadly followed the pattern shown by the Court itself. This\nCourt thought it fit to draw a line between major/serious\noffences and minor/non-serious offences while giving direction\nNo.2 (vide Para 48). If so, the legislative thinking that this\ndistinction should also hold good in regard to past cases cannot\nbe faulted on the ground that the said clause fails to provide\nadequate information about the candidate. If the Parliament felt\nthat the convictions and sentences of the long past related to\npetty/non serious offences need not be made available to\nelectorate, it cannot be definitely said that the valuable right to\ninformation becomes a casuality. Very often, such offences by\nand large may not involve moral turpitude. It is not uncommon,\nas one of the learned senior counsel  pointed out that the\npolitical personalities are prosecuted for politically related\nactivities such as holding demonstrations and visited with the\npunishment of fine or short imprisonment. Information regarding\nsuch instances may not be of real importance to the electorate\nin judging the worth of the relative merits of the candidates. At\nany rate, it is a matter of perception and balancing of various\nfactors, as observed supra. The legislative judgment cannot be\nfaulted merely for the reason that the pro tempore directions of\nthis Court have not been scrupulously followed.\t As regards\nacquittals, it is reasonable to take the view that such information\nwill not be of much relevance inasmuch as acquittal prima facie\nimplies that the accused is not connected with the crime or the\nprosecution has no legs to stand. It is not reasonable to expect\nthat from the factum of prosecution resulting in the acquittal, the\nvoters/citizens would be able to judge the candidate better.  On\nthe other hand, such information in general has the potential to\nsend misleading signals about the honesty and integrity of the\ncandidate.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">I am therefore of the view that as regards past criminal\nrecord, what the Parliament has provided for is fairly adequate.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">One more aspect which needs a brief comment is the\nexclusion of offences referred to in sub-Sections (1) and (2) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 8</a> of the R.P. Act, 1951. <a href=\"/doc/195408352/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 8</a> deals with\ndisqualification on conviction for certain offences. Those\noffences are of serious nature from the point of view of national\nand societal interest.\tEven the existing provisions, viz., Rule 4A\ninserted by Conduct of Elections (Amendment) Rules, 2002\nmake a provision for disclosure of such offences in the\nnomination form. Hence, such offences have been excluded\nfrom the ambit of Clause (ii) of Section 33A.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45852197\" id=\"span_15\">IV.    (2). Assets and liabilities\n\nDisclosure of assets and liabilities is another thorny issue.\nIf the right to information is to be meaningful and if it is to serve\nits avowed purpose, I am of the considered view that the\ncandidate entering the electoral contest should be required to\ndisclose the assets and liabilities (barring articles of household\nuse). A member of Parliament or State Legislature is an elected\nrepresentative occupying high public office and at the same\ntime, he is a &#x27;public servant&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_70\">Prevention of\nCorruption Act</a> as ruled by this Court in the case of  <a href=\"/doc/45852197/\" id=\"a_71\">P.V.\nNarasimha Rao Vs. State</a> [(1998) 4 SCC 626].  They are the\nrepositories of public trust. They have public duties to perform.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">It is borne out by experience that by virtue of the office they hold\nthere is a real potential for misuse. The public awareness of\nfinancial position of the candidate will go a long way in forming\nan opinion whether the candidate, after election to the office had\namassed wealth either in his own name or in the name of family\nmembers viz., spouse and dependent children. At the time when\nthe candidate seeks re-election, the citizens/voters can have a\ncomparative idea of the assets before and after the election so\nas to assess whether the high public office had possibly been\nused for self-aggrandizement. Incidentally, the disclosure will\nserve as a check against misuse of power for making quick\nmoney-a malady which nobody can deny, has been pervading\nthe political spectrum of our democratic nation.  As regards\nliabilities, the disclosure will enable the voter to know, inter alia,\nwhether the candidate has outstanding dues payable to public\nfinancial institutions or the Government. Such information has a\nrelevant bearing on the antecedents and the propensities of the\ncandidate in his dealings with public money. &#x27;Assets and\nliabilities&#x27; is one of the important aspects to which extensive\nreference has been made in Association for Democratic Reforms\ncase. The Court did consider it, after an elaborate discussion, as\na vital piece of information as far as the voter is concerned. But,\nunfortunately, the observations made by this Court in this\nregard have been given a short shrift by the Parliament with little\nrealization that they have significant bearing on the right to get\ninformation from the contesting candidates and such\ninformation is necessary to give effect to the freedom of\nexpression.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\"> As regards the purpose of disclosure of assets and\nliabilities, I would like to make it clear that it is not meant to\nevaluate whether the candidate is financially sound or has\nsufficient money to spend in the election. Poor or rich are alike\nentitled to contest the election. Every citizen has equal\naccessibility in public arena. If the information is meant to\nmobilize public opinion in favour of an affluent/financially sound\ncandidate, the tenet of socialistic democracy and the concept of\nequality so firmly embedded in our Constitution will be\ndistorted. I cannot also share the view that this information on\nassets would enable the public to verify whether unaccounted\nmoney played a part in contesting the election. So long as the\nExplanation-I to <a href=\"/doc/117675817/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 77</a> of R.P. Act, 1951 stands and the\ncontributions can legitimately come from any source, it is not\npossible for a citizen/voter to cause a verification to be made on\nthose lines. In my opinion, the real purposes of seeking\ninformation in regard to assets and liabilities are those which I\nadverted to in the preceding paragraph.\t It may serve other\npurposes also, but, I have confined myself to the relevancy of\nsuch disclosure vis--vis right to information only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">It has been contended with much force that the right to\ninformation made available to the voters/citizens by judicial\ninterpretation has to be balanced with the right of privacy of the\nspouse\tof the contesting candidate and any insistence on the\ndisclosure of  assets and liabilities of the spouse invades his/her\nright to privacy which is implied in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21.</a> After giving\nanxious consideration to this argument, I am unable to uphold\nthe same. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_16\">In this context, I would like to recall the apt words of\nMathew J, in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_74\">Gobind Vs. State of M.P.</a> [(1975) 2 SCC 148]. While\nanalyzing the right to privacy as an ingredient of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 21</a>, it\nwas observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\"> &quot;There can be no doubt that privacy-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">dignity claims deserve to be\nexamined with care and to be denied\nonly when an important\ncountervailing interest is shown to be\nsuperior&quot; (emphasis supplied).\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">  It was then said succinctly:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">&quot;If the Court does find that a claimed\nright is entitled to protection as a\nfundamental privacy right, a law\ninfringing it must satisfy the\ncompelling State interest test. Then\nthe question would be whether a\nState interest is of such paramount\nimportance as would justify an\ninfringement of the right.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">It was further explained-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">&quot;Privacy primarily concerns the\nindividual. It therefore relates to and\noverlaps with the concept of liberty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">The most serious advocate of privacy\nmust confess that there are serious\nproblems of defining the essence and\nscope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the\ncontext of other rights and values.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"> By calling upon the contesting candidate to disclose the assets\nand liabilities of his/her spouse, the fundamental right to\ninformation of a voter/citizen is thereby promoted. When there is\na competition between the right to privacy of an individual and\nthe right to information of the citizens,  the former right has to\nbe subordinated to the latter right as it serves larger public\ninterest. The right to know about the candidate who intends to\nbecome a public figure and a representative of the people would\nnot be effective and real if only truncated information of the\nassets and liabilities is given. It cannot be denied that the family\nrelationship and social order in our country is such that the\nhusband and wife look to the properties held by them as\nbelonging to the family for all practical purposes, though in the\neye of law the properties may distinctly belong to each of them.\nBy and large, there exists a sort of unity of interest in the\nproperties held by spouses. The property being kept in the name\nof the spouse benami is not unknown in our country. In this\nsituation, it could be said that a countervailing or paramount\ninterest is involved in requiring a candidate who chooses to\nsubject himself/herself to public gaze and scrutiny to furnish the\ndetails of assets and liabilities of the spouse as well. That is one\nway of looking at the problem.\tMore important, it is to be noted\nthat the Parliament itself accepted in principle that not only the\nassets of the elected candidates but also his or her spouse and\ndependent children should be disclosed to the constitutional\nauthority and the right of privacy should not come in the way of\nsuch disclosure; but, the hitch lies in the fact that the disclosure\nhas to be made to the Speaker or Chairman of the House after he\nor she is elected.   No provision has been made for giving\naccess to the details filed with the presiding officer of  the\nHouse. By doing so, the Parliament has omitted to give effect to\nthe principle, which it rightly accepted as a step in aid to\npromote integrity in public life.   Having accepted the need to\ninsist on disclosure of assets and liabilities of the elected\ncandidate together with those of other family members, the\nParliament refrained from making a provision for furnishing the\ninformation at the time of filing the nomination. This has\nresulted in jeopardizing the right to information implicitly\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Therefore, the provision made in\nSection 75A regarding declaration of assets and liabilities of the\nelected candidates to the presiding officer has failed to\neffectuate the right to information and the freedom of expression\nof the voters/citizens.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">IV.    (3). Educational qualifications\n\nThe last item left for discussion is about educational\nqualifications. In my view, the disclosure of information\nregarding educational qualifications of a candidate is not an\nessential component of the right to information flowing from\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> By not providing for disclosure of educational\nqualifications, it cannot be said that the Parliament violated the\nguarantee of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Consistent with the principle of\nadult suffrage, the Constitution has not prescribed any\neducational qualification for being Member of the House of the\nPeople or Legislative Assembly. That apart, I am inclind to think\nthat the information relating to educational qualifications of\ncontesting candidates does not serve any useful purpose in the\npresent context and scenario. It is a well known fact that barring\na few exceptions, most of the candidates elected to Parliament\nor the State Legislatures are fairly educated even if they are not\nGraduates or Post-Graduates. To think of illiterate candidates is\nbased on a factually incorrect assumption. To say that well\neducated persons such as those having graduate and post-\ngraduate qualifications will be able to serve the people better\nand conduct themselves in a better way inside and outside the\nHouse is nothing but overlooking the stark realities. The\nexperience and events in public life and the Legislatures have\ndemonstrated that the dividing line between the well educated\nand less educated from the point of view of his/her calibre and\nculture is rather thin. Much depends on the character of the\nindividual, the sense of devotion to duty and the sense of\nconcern to the welfare of the people. These characteristics are\nnot the monopoly of well educated persons. I do not think that it\nis necessary to supply information to the voter to facilitate him\nto indulge in an infructuous exercise of comparing the\neducational qualifications of the candidates. It may be that\ncertain candidates having exceptionally\t high qualifications in\nspecialized field may prove useful to the society, but it is natural\nto expect that such candidates would voluntarily come forward\nwith an account of their own academic and other talents as a\npart of their election programme. Viewed from any angle, the\ninformation regarding educational qualifications is not a vital\nand useful piece of information to the voter, in ultimate analysis.\nAt any rate, two views are reasonably possible. Therefore, it is\nnot possible to hold that the Parliament should have necessarily\nmade the provision for disclosure of information regarding\neducational qualifications of the candidates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">V.\tConclusions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">Finally, the summary of my conclusions:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">1.\tSecuring information on the basic details concerning the\ncandidates contesting for elections to the Parliament or\nState Legislature promotes freedom of expression and\ntherefore the right to information forms an integral part of\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> This right to information is, however,\nqualitatively different from the right to get information\nabout public affairs or the right to receive information\nthrough the Press and electronic media, though, to a\ncertain extent, there may be overlapping.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">2.\tThe right to vote at the elections to the House of people or\nLegislative Assembly is a constitutional right but not\nmerely a statutory right; freedom of voting as distinct from\nright to vote is a facet of the fundamental right enshrined in\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  The casting of vote in favour of one or the\nother candidate marks the accomplishment of freedom of\nexpression of the voter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"6396968\" id=\"span_17\">3.\tThe directives given by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/6396968/\" id=\"a_81\">Union of India Vs.\nAssociation</a> for Democratic Reforms [(2002) 5 SCC 294]\nwere intended to operate only till the law was made by the\nLegislature and in that sense &#x27;pro tempore&#x27; in nature. Once\nlegislation is made, the Court has to make an independent\nassessment in order to evaluate whether the items of\ninformation statutorily ordained are reasonably adequate\nto secure the right of information available to the\nvoter/citizen.
