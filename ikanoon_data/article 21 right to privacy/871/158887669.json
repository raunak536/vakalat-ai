Civil Appeal Nos. 9813 and 9833 of 2011  were  filed  challenging  the\norder dated 18.10.2011 of the  Securities  Appellate  Tribunal  whereby  the\nappellants (hereinafter for short “Sahara”) were directed to refund  amounts\ninvested with the appellants in certain Optionally Fully  Convertible  Bonds\n(OFCD) with interest by a stated date.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">3.    By order dated 28.11.2011, this Court issued show cause notice to  the\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India  (SEBI),  respondent  No.  1  herein,\ndirecting Sahara to put on affidavit as to how they  intend  to  secure  the\nliabilities incurred by them to the OFCD holders during the pendency of  the\nCivil Appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.    Pursuant to the aforesaid order dated  28.11.2011,  on  4.01.2012,  an\naffidavit was filed by Sahara explaining the manner in which it proposed  to\nsecure its liability to OFCD  holders  during  the  pendency  of  the  Civil\nAppeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.    On 9.01.2012, both the appeals were admitted  for  hearing.   However,\nIA No. 3 for interim  relief  filed  by  Sahara  was  kept  for  hearing  on\n20.01.2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.    On 20.01.2012, it was submitted by the learned counsel for  SEBI  that\nwhat was stated in the affidavit of 4.01.2012 filed  by  Sahara  inter  alia\nsetting  out  as  to  how  the  liabilities  of  Sahara  India  Real  Estate\nCorporation Ltd. (SIRECL) and  Sahara  Housing  and  Investment  Corporation\n(SHICL) were to be secured was insufficient to protect the OFCD holders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    This Court then indicated to the learned counsel for Sahara  and  SEBI\nthat they should attempt, if possible, to reach a consensus with respect  to\nan acceptable security in the form of an unencumbered  asset.   Accordingly,\nIA No. 3 got stood over for three weeks for that purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">8.    On 7.02.2012, the learned counsel  for  Sahara  addressed  a  personal\nletter to the learned counsel for SEBI at  Chennai  enclosing  the  proposal\nwith details of security to secure repayment of OFCD to  investors  as  pre-\ncondition for stay of the impugned orders dated  23.06.2011  and  18.10.2011\npending  hearing  of  the  Civil  Appeals  together   with   the   Valuation\nCertificate indicating fair market  value  of  the  assets  proposed  to  be\noffered as security. This was communicated by e-mail from Delhi to  Chennai.\n Later, on the same day, there was also an official communication  enclosing\nthe said proposal by the Advocate-on-Record for Sahara to  the  Advocate-on-\nRecord for SEBI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">9.    A day prior to the hearing of IA No. 3 on 10.02.2012, one of the  news\nchannels flashed on TV the details of  the  said  proposal  which  had  been\ncommunicated only inter parties  and  which  was  obviously  not  meant  for\npublic circulation.  The concerned television channel also named the  valuer\nwho had done  the  valuation  of  the  assets  proposed  to  be  offered  as\nsecurity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">10.   On 10.02.2012, there was  no  information  forthcoming  from  SEBI  of\neither acceptance or rejection of the proposal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.   The above facts were inter alia brought to the notice  of  this  Court\nat the hearing of IA No. 3 on 10.02.2012 when  Shri  F.S.  Nariman,  learned\nsenior counsel for Sahara orally submitted that disclosure to the Media  was\nby SEBI in breach  of  confidentiality  which  was  denied  by  the  learned\ncounsel for SEBI.  After hearing the learned counsel for the  parties,  this\nCourt passed the following order:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           “We  are  distressed  to  note  that  even  “without  prejudice”\n           proposals sent by learned counsel  for  the  appellants  to  the\n           learned counsel for SEBI has come on one  of  the  TV  channels.\n           Such incidents are increasing by the day.   Such  reporting  not\n           only affects the business sentiments but also interferes in  the\n           administration of justice.  In the above circumstances, we  have\n           requested  learned  counsel  on  both  sides  to  make   written\n           application to this Court  in  the  form  of  an  I.A.  so  that\n           appropriate orders could be passed by this Court with regard  to\n           reporting of matters, which are sub-judice.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">12.   Pursuant to the aforesaid order, IA Nos. 4 and 5 came to be  filed  by\nSahara.  According to Sahara, IA Nos. 4 and 5 raise a  question  of  general\npublic importance.  In the said IA Nos. 4 and  5,  Sahara  stated  that  the\ntime has come that  this  Court  should  give  appropriate  directions  with\nregard to reporting of matters (in electronic and  print  media)  which  are\nsub judice.  In this connection, it has been further  stated:  “it  is  well\nsettled that it is inappropriate for comments to be made  publicly  (in  the\nMedia or otherwise) on cases (civil and  criminal)  which  are  sub  judice;\nthis principle has been stated in <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 3</a> of the Contempt of  Courts  Act,\nwhich defines criminal contempt of court as the doing of an  act  whatsoever\nwhich prejudices or interferes or tends to interfere with the due course  of\nany judicial proceeding or tends to interfere or interfere with or  obstruct\nor tends to interfere or obstruct the administration of  justice”.   In  the\nIAs, it has been further stated that whilst there is no fetter on  the  fair\nreporting of any matter in court, matters relating to proposal  made  inter-\nparties  are  privileged  from  public  disclosure.   That,  disclosure  and\npublication of pleadings and other documents on the record of  the  case  by\nthird parties (who are not parties to the proceedings  in  this  court)  can\n(under the rules of this Court) only take place on  an  application  to  the\ncourt and pursuant to the directions given by  the  court  (see  Order  XII,\nRules 1, 2 and 3 of Supreme Court Rules, 1966).  It was further stated  that\nin cases like the present one a thin line has to be drawn between two  types\nof matters; firstly, matters between  company,  on  the  one  hand,  and  an\nauthority, on the other hand, and, secondly, matters  of  public  importance\nand concern.  According to Sahara, in  the  present  case,  no  question  of\npublic concern was involved in the telecast of news regarding  the  proposal\nmade by Sahara on 7.02.2012 by one side  to  the  other  in  the  matter  of\nproviding security in an ongoing matter.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1454600\" id=\"span_1\">In the IAs, it  has  been  further\nstated that this Court has observed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1454600/\" id=\"a_2\">State of  Maharashtra  v.\nRajendra J. Gandhi</a> [(1997) 8 SCC 386] that: “A trial  by  press,  electronic\nmedia  or  public  agitation  is  the  very  antithesis  of  rule  of  law”.\nConsequently, it has been stated in  the  IAs  by  Sahara  that  this  Court\nshould consider giving guidelines as to the manner and extent  of  publicity\nwhich can be given to pleadings/ documents filed in  court  by  one  or  the\nother party in a pending proceedings which have  not  yet  been  adjudicated\nupon.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">13.   Accordingly, vide IA Nos. 4 and 5, Sahara made the following  prayers:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           “(b) appropriate guidelines be framed with regard  to  reporting\n           (in the electronic and print media) of matters  which  are  sub-\n           judice in a  court  including  public  disclosure  of  documents\n           forming part of court proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           (c)   appropriate directions be issued  as  to  the  manner  and\n           extent of publicity to be given by the print/  electronic  media\n           of pleadings/ documents filed in a proceeding in court which  is\n           pending and not yet adjudicated upon;”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">14.   Vide IA No. 10, SEBI, at the very  outset,  denied  that  the  alleged\ndisclosure was at its instance or  at  the  instance  of  its  counsel.   It\nfurther denied that papers furnished by Sahara were passed  on  by  SEBI  to\nthe TV Channel.  In its IA, SEBI stated that it is  a  statutory  regulatory\nbody and that as a matter of policy SEBI never gives  its  comments  to  the\nmedia on matters which are under  investigation  or  sub  judice.   Further,\nSEBI had no business stakes involved to make such disclosures to the  media.\n However, even according to SEBI, in view of the  incident  having  happened\nin court, this Court  should  give  appropriate  directions  or  frame  such\nguidelines as may be deemed appropriate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">15.   At the very outset, we need to state that since an important  question\nof public importance  arose  for  decision  under  the  above  circumstances\ndealing with the rights of the citizens and the media, we  gave  notice  and\nhearing to those who had filed the IAs;  the  question  of  law  being  that\nevery citizen has a right to negotiate in confidence  inasmuch  as  he/  she\nhas a right to defend himself or herself.  The source of  these  two  rights\ncomes  from  the  common  law.   They   are   based   on   presumptions   of\nconfidentiality and innocence.  Both, the said  presumptions  are  of  equal\nimportance.  At one stage, it was submitted before us that  this  Court  has\nbeen acting suo motu.  We made it  clear  that  Sahara  was  at  liberty  to\nwithdraw the IAs  at  which  stage  Shri  Sidharth  Luthra,  learned  senior\ncounsel stated that Sahara would not like to withdraw its  IAs.   Even  SEBI\nstated that if Sahara withdraws its IAs, SEBI would insist on its  IA  being\ndecided.  In short, both Sahara and SEBI sought adjudication.   Further,  on\n28.03.2012, learned counsel for Sahara filed a  note  in  the  Court  citing\ninstances  (mostly  criminal  cases)  in  which  according  to  him  certain\naberration qua presumption of innocence has taken place.   This  Court  made\nit clear that this Court is  concerned  with  the  question  as  to  whether\nguidelines for the media be laid down?  If so, whether they should be  self-\nregulatory?  Or whether this Court should restate the  law  or  declare  the\nlaw under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 141</a> on balancing  of  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_4\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  rights  vis-à-vis\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a>, the scope of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19(2)</a> in the context of the law  regulating\ncontempt of court and the scope of Article 129/ <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 215.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">16.   Thus, our decision herein is confined to IA Nos. 4, 5  and  10.   This\nclarification is important for the reason that some accused have  filed  IAs\nin which they have sought relief on the ground that  their  trial  has  been\nprejudiced on account of excessive media publicity.  We express  no  opinion\non the merits of those IAs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">Constitutionalization of free speech\nComparative  law:  differences  between  the   US   and   other   common-law\nexperiences\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">17.   Protecting speech is the US approach.  The First  Amendment  does  not\ntolerate any form of restraint.  In US, unlike India and Canada  which  also\nhave written Constitutions, freedom of the press is expressly  protected  as\nan absolute right.  The US Constitution does not have provisions similar  to\n<a href=\"/doc/1801328/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 1</a> of the Charter Rights under the Canadian Constitution nor is  such\nfreedom subject to reasonable restrictions as we have  under  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_9\">Article  19(2)</a>\nof the Indian Constitution.  Therefore, in US,  any  interference  with  the\nmedia freedom to access, report and comment upon  ongoing  trials  is  prima\nfacie  unlawful.   Prior  restraints   are   completely   banned.    If   an\nirresponsible piece of journalism results in prejudice to  the  proceedings,\nthe legal  system  does  not  provide  for  sanctions  against  the  parties\nresponsible for the wrongdoings.  Thus, restrictive contempt of  court  laws\nare generally considered incompatible with the constitutional  guarantee  of\nfree speech.  However, in view of cases,  like  O.J.  Simpson,  Courts  have\nevolved procedural devices aimed at neutralizing the effect  of  prejudicial\npublicity like change of venue, ordering re-trial,  reversal  of  conviction\non appeal (which, for the sake of brevity, is  hereinafter  referred  to  as\n“neutralizing devices”).  It may be stated that  even  in  US  as  of  date,\nthere is no absolute rule against “prior restraint” and  its  necessity  has\nbeen recognized, albeit in exceptional cases [see Near v. Minnesota, 283  US\n697] by the courts evolving neutralizing techniques.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">18.   In 1993, Chief Justice  William  Rehnquist  observed:  “constitutional\nlaw is now so firmly grounded in so many countries, it is time that  the  US\nCourts begin looking at decisions of other constitutional courts to  aid  in\ntheir own deliberative process”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">19.   Protecting Justice is the English approach.  Fair  trials  and  public\nconfidence in the courts as the proper forum for settlement of  disputes  as\npart of the administration of justice, under  the  common  law,  were  given\ngreater weight than the goals served by unrestrained freedom of  the  press.\nAs a consequence, the exercise  of  free  speech  respecting  ongoing  court\nproceedings stood limited.  England does not have  a  written  constitution.\nFreedoms in English law have  been  largely  determined  by  Parliament  and\nCourts.  However, after the judgment of ECHR in the case of Sunday Times  v.\nUnited Kingdom [(1979) 2 EHRR 245],  in  the  light  of  which  the  English\nContempt of Courts Act, 1981 (for short “the 1981  Act”)  stood  enacted,  a\nbalance is sought to be achieved between fair trial rights  and  free  media\nrights vide <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 4(2)</a>.    Freedom of speech (including free press) in  US\nis not restricted as under  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_11\">Article  19(2)</a>  of  our  Constitution  or  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1801328/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 1</a> of the Canadian  Charter.   In  England,  Parliament  is  supreme.\nAbsent written constitution, Parliament can by  law  limit  the  freedom  of\nspeech.  The view in England,  on  interpretation,  has  been  and  is  even\ntoday, even after the <a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_13\">Human Rights Act, 1998</a> that the right of  free  speech\nor right to access the courts for the determination of legal  rights  cannot\nbe excluded, except by clear words of  the  statute.   An  important  aspect\nneeds to be highlighted.  Under <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 4(2)</a> of the  1981  Act,  courts  are\nexpressly  empowered  to  postpone  publication  of  any   report   of   the\nproceedings or any part of the proceedings for  such  period  as  the  court\nthinks  fit  for  avoiding  a  substantial  risk   of   prejudice   to   the\nadministration of justice in those proceedings.  Why  is  such  a  provision\nmade in the Act of 1981?  One of the reasons is that in  <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_15\">Section  2</a>  of  the\n1981 Act, strict liability has been incorporated (except in <a href=\"/doc/1915023/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 6</a>  whose\nscope has led to conflicting decisions on the question of  intention).   The\nbasis  of  the  strict  liability  contempt  under  the  1981  Act  is   the\npublication of “prejudicial” material.  The  definition  of  publication  is\nalso very wide.  It is true that the 1981  Act  has  restricted  the  strict\nliability contempt to a fewer circumstances as  compared  to  cases  falling\nunder common law.  However, contempt is an offence  sui  generis.   At  this\nstage, it is important to note that the strict liability rule  is  the  rule\nof law whereby a conduct or an act may be treated as contempt  of  court  if\nit tends to interfere  with  the  course  of  justice  in  particular  legal\nproceedings, regardless of intent to do so.  Sometimes,  fair  and  accurate\nreporting of the trial (say a murder trial) would nonetheless give  rise  to\nsubstantial risk of prejudice not in the pending trial but in the  later  or\nconnected trials.  In such cases, there is no other  practical  means  short\nof postponement orders that is capable of avoiding such  risk  of  prejudice\nto the later  or  connected  trials.   Thus,  postponement  order  not  only\nsafeguards fairness of the later or connected trials, it  prevents  possible\ncontempt.  That seems to  be  the  underlying  reason  behind  enactment  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 4(2)</a> of the 1981 Act.  According to Borrie &amp; Lowe  on  the  “Law  of\nContempt”, the extent to which prejudgment by publication of the outcome  of\na proceedings (referred to by the House of Lords  in  Sunday  Times’s  case)\nmay still apply in certain cases.  In the circumstances to balance  the  two\nrights of equal importance, viz., right to freedom of expression  and  right\nto a fair trial, that <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 4(2)</a> is put  in  the  1981  Act.   Apart  from\nbalancing it makes the media  know  where  they  stand  in  the  matters  of\nreporting of court cases.  To this extent, the discretion  of  courts  under\ncommon law contempt has been reduced  to  protect  the  media  from  getting\npunished for contempt under strict liability contempt.  Of  course,  if  the\ncourt’s order is violated, contempt action would follow.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">20.   In the case of Home Office v. Harman [(1983) 1 A.C. 280] the House  of\nLords found that the counsel for a party  was  furnished  documents  by  the\nopposition party during  inspection on the  specific  undertaking  that  the\ncontents will not be disclosed to the public.  However, in violation of  the\nsaid undertaking, the  counsel  gave  the  papers  to  a  third  party,  who\npublished them.  The counsel was held to be in contempt on the principle  of\nequalization of the right of the accused  to  defend  himself/herself  in  a\ncriminal trial with right to negotiate settlement in confidence.  [See  also\nGlobe and Mail v. Canada (Procureur général), 2008 QCCA 2516]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">21.   The Continental Approach seeks to protect personality.  This model  is\nless concerned with  the  issue  of  fair  trial  than  with  the  need  for\nsafeguarding privacy, personal  dignity  and  presumption  of  innocence  of\ntrial participants.  The underlying assumption of this  model  is  that  the\nmedia coverage of pending trials might be at odds  not  only  with  fairness\nand impartiality of the proceedings  but  also  with  other  individual  and\nsocietal interests.  Thus, narrowly focussed prior restraints  are  provided\nfor, on either a statutory or judicial basis.  It is important to note  that\nin the common-law approach the protection of sanctity of  legal  proceedings\nas a part of administration of  justice  is  guaranteed  by  institution  of\ncontempt proceedings.  According to <a href=\"/doc/531094/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 6(2)</a> of the European  Convention\nof Human Rights, presumption  of  innocence  needs  to  be  protected.   The\nEuropean Courts of Human Rights has ruled  on  several  occasions  that  the\npresumption of innocence should be employed as a normative parameter in  the\nmatter of balancing the right to a fair trial as against freedom of  speech.\n The German Courts have accordingly  underlined  the  need  to  balance  the\npresumption of innocence with freedom of expression based on  employment  of\nthe above normative parameter  of  presumption  of  innocence.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1217564\" id=\"span_2\">France  and\nAustralia have taken  a  similar  stance.   <a href=\"/doc/531094/\" id=\"a_20\">Article  6(2)</a>  of  the  European\nConvention of Human Rights imposes a positive obligation  on  the  State  to\ntake action to protect the presumption of  innocence  from  interference  by\nnon-State actors.  However, in a catena of decisions, the ECHR  has  applied\nthe principle of  proportionality  to  prevent  imposition  of  overreaching\nrestrictions on the media.  At this stage,  we  may  state,  that  the  said\nprinciple of proportionality has been enunciated by this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/1217564/\" id=\"a_21\">Chintaman\nRao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a> [ (1950) SCR 759].</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">22.   The Canadian Approach:   Before  <a href=\"/doc/1801328/\" id=\"a_22\">Section  1</a>  of  Canadian  Charter  of\nRights, the  balance  between  fair  trial  and  administration  of  justice\nconcerns, on the one hand, and freedom of press, on the other  hand,  showed\na clear preference accorded to the former.  Since the Charter introduced  an\nexpress  guarantee  of  “freedom  of  the   press   and   other   media   of\ncommunication”, the Canadian Courts reformulated the traditional sub  judice\nrule, showing a more tolerant attitude towards trial-related reporting  [see\njudgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Canada  in   Dagenais   v.   Canadian\nBroadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 SCR 835  which  held  that  a  publication  ban\nshould be ordered when such an order is necessary to prevent a serious  risk\nto  the  proper  administration  of  justice  when  reasonably   alternative\nmeasures like postponement of trial or change of venue will not prevent  the\nrisk (necessity test); and that salutary effects  of  the  publication  bans\noutweigh the deleterious effects on the rights and interests of the  parties\nand the public, including the effect on the right  to  free  expression  and\nthe right of the accused to open trial (i.e.  proportionality  test)].   The\ntraditional common law rule governing publication bans – that there be  real\nand substantial risk of interference with  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  –\nemphasized the right to a fair trial over the free expressions interests  of\nthose affected  by  the  ban.   However,  in  the  context  of  post-Charter\nsituation, the Canadian Supreme Court  has  held  that  when  two  protected\nrights come  in  conflict,  Charter  principles  require  a  balance  to  be\nachieved that fully respects both the rights.   The  Canadian  Courts  have,\nthus, shortened the distance between the US legal experience and the common-\nlaw experiences in other countries.  It is important to  highlight  that  in\nDagenais, the publication ban was sought under common  law  jurisdiction  of\nthe Superior Court and the matter was decided  under  the  common  law  rule\nthat the Courts of Record have inherent power to defer the publication.   In\nR. v. Mentuck [2001] 3 SCR 442 that Dagenais principle was extended  to  the\npresumption of openness and to duty of court to balance the two rights.   In\nboth the above cases, <a href=\"/doc/654554/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 2(b)</a> of the Charter which deals  with  freedom\nof the press was  balanced  with  <a href=\"/doc/1801328/\" id=\"a_24\">Section  1</a>  of  the  Charter.   Under  the\nCanadian Constitution, the Courts of Record (superior courts) have  retained\nthe common law discretion to impose such bans provided that  the  discretion\nis exercised in accordance with  the  Charter  demands  in  each  individual\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">23.   The Australian Approach:  The  Australian  Courts  impose  publication\nbans through the exercise of their inherent jurisdiction to  regulate  their\nown proceedings.  In Australia, contempt laws deal with reporting  of  court\nproceedings which interfere with due administration  of  justice.   Contempt\nlaws in Australia embody the concept of “sub judice contempt” which  relates\nto the publication of the material that has a  tendency  to  interfere  with\nthe pending proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">24.   The New Zealand Approach: It recognizes the  Open  Justice  principle.\nHowever, the courts have taken the view  that  the  said  principle  is  not\nabsolute.  It must be balanced against the object of doing  justice.   That,\nthe right to freedom of expression must be  balanced  against  other  rights\nincluding the fundamental public interest in  preserving  the  integrity  of\njustice and the administration of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">Indian Approach to prior restraint\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">(i)   Judicial decisions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">25.   At the outset, it may be stated that the Supreme  Court  is  not  only\nthe sentinel of the fundamental rights but also a  balancing  wheel  between\nthe rights, subject to social control. Freedom of expression is one  of  the\nmost cherished values of a free democratic society.  It is indispensable  to\nthe operation of a democratic society whose  basic  postulate  is  that  the\ngovernment shall be based on the consent  of  the  governed.   But,  such  a\nconsent implies not only that the consent shall be free  but  also  that  it\nshall be grounded on adequate  information,  discussion  and  aided  by  the\nwidest possible dissemination of information and opinions from  diverse  and\nantagonistic sources.  Freedom of expression which includes freedom  of  the\npress has a capacious  content  and  is  not  restricted  to  expression  of\nthoughts and ideas which are accepted  and  acceptable  but  also  to  those\nwhich offend or shock any section of the population.  It also  includes  the\nright to receive information and ideas of all kinds from different  sources.\n In  essence,  the  freedom  of  expression  embodies  the  right  to  know.\nHowever, under our Constitution no right in Part III is  absolute.   Freedom\nof expression is not an absolute value under our Constitution.  It must  not\nbe forgotten that no single value, no matter  exalted,  can  bear  the  full\nburden of upholding a  democratic  system  of  government.   Underlying  our\nConstitutional system are a number of important values, all  of  which  help\nto guarantee our liberties, but in ways  which  sometimes  conflict.   Under\nour Constitution, probably, no values are absolute.  All  important  values,\ntherefore, must be qualified and  balanced  against,  other  important,  and\noften competing, values.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_3\">This  process  of  definition,  qualification  and\nbalancing is as much required with  respect  to  the  value  of  freedom  of\nexpression as it  is  for  other  values.   Consequently,  free  speech,  in\nappropriate cases, has got to correlate with fair trial.   It  also  follows\nthat in appropriate case one right [say freedom of expression] may  have  to\nyield to the other  right  like  right  to  a  fair  trial.   Further,  even\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_25\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">21</a> are subject to  the  test  of  reasonableness  after  the\njudgment of this Court in the case  of  <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_27\">Maneka  Gandhi  v.

At this stage, we wish to clarify  that  the  reliance  on  the  above\njudgments is only to show  that  “prior  restraint”  per  se  has  not  been\nrejected as constitutionally impermissible.  At this  stage,  we  may  point\nout that in the present IAs we  are  dealing  with  the  concept  of  “prior\nrestraint” per se and not with cases of misuse of powers  of  pre-censorship\nwhich were corrected by the Courts [see <a href=\"/doc/831263/\" id=\"a_33\">Binod Rao v.

The question of prior restraint arose before this Court  in  1988,  in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/1351834/\" id=\"a_34\">Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Proprietors  of  Indian  Express\nNewspapers Bombay (P) Ltd.</a> [AIR 1989 SC 190] in the context  of  publication\nin one of the national dailies of certain articles which  contained  adverse\ncomments on the proposed issue of debentures by a  public  limited  company.\nThe validity of the debenture was sub judice in this Court.  Initially,  the\ncourt granted  injunction  against  the  press  restraining  publication  of\narticles on the legality of the debenture issue.  The  test  formulated  was\nthat  any  preventive  injunction  against  the  press  must  be  “based  on\nreasonable grounds for keeping the  administration  of  justice  unimpaired”\nand that, there must  be  reasonable  ground  to  believe  that  the  danger\napprehended  is  real  and  imminent.   The  Court  went  by  the   doctrine\npropounded by Holmes J of “clear and present danger”.   This  Court  treated\nthe said doctrine as the basis of balance of convenience  test.   Later  on,\nthe injunction was lifted after subscription to debentures had closed.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">31.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1643138\" id=\"span_9\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1643138/\" id=\"a_35\">Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of  Maharashtra</a>  [AIR\n1967 SC 1], this Court dealt with the power of  a  court  to  conduct  court\nproceedings in camera under its inherent  powers and  also  to  incidentally\nprohibit publication of the court  proceedings  or  evidence  of  the  cases\noutside the court by the media.  It may be stated  that  “open  Justice”  is\nthe cornerstone of our judicial system.  It instills faith in  the  judicial\nand legal system.  However, the right to open justice is not  absolute.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131159751\" id=\"span_10\">It\ncan be restricted by the court in  its  inherent  jurisdiction  as  done  in\nMirajkar’s case if the necessities of administration of  justice  so  demand\n[see <a href=\"/doc/131159751/\" id=\"a_36\">Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi Administration</a>), AIR 1988 SC  1883].</span>   Even\nin US, the said principle of open justice yields to the said necessities  of\nadministration of justice [see: Globe Newspaper Co. v.

Thus, the principle of open justice is not  absolute.   There  can  be\nexceptions in the interest of administration of justice.  In  Mirajkar,  the\nHigh Court ordered that the deposition of the defence witness should not  be\nreported in the newspapers.  This order of the High Court was challenged  in\nthis Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 32.</a>  This Court held that apart  from  <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_39\">Section  151</a>\nof the Code of Civil Procedure, the High Court had  the  inherent  power  to\nrestrain the  press  from  reporting  where  administration  of  justice  so\ndemanded.  This Court held vide para 30 that evidence of  the  witness  need\nnot receive excessive publicity as fear of such publicity  may  prevent  the\nwitness from speaking the truth.  That, such orders prohibiting  publication\nfor a temporary period during the course of trial are permissible under  the\ninherent powers of the court whenever the court is satisfied  that  interest\nof justice so requires.  As to  whether  such  a  temporary  prohibition  of\npublication of court proceedings in the media under the inherent  powers  of\nthe court can be said to offend  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_40\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  rights  [which  includes\nfreedom of the press to make such publication],  this  Court  held  that  an\norder of a  court  passed  to  protect  the  interest  of  justice  and  the\nadministration of justice  could not be  treated  as  violative  of  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_41\">Article\n19(1)(a) [</a>see  para  12].   The  judgment  of  this  Court  in  Mirajkar  is\ndelivered by a Bench of 9-Judges and is binding on this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">33.   At this stage, it may be noted that the judgment of the Privy  Council\nin the case of Independent Publishing Co. Ltd. v. AG of Trinidad and  Tobago\n[2005 (1) AC 190] has been doubted by the Court of Appeal in New Zealand  in\nthe case of Vincent v. Solicitor General [(2012) NZCA 188 dated  11.5.2012].\n In any event, on the inherent powers of the Courts of Record we  are  bound\nby the judgment of this Court in Mirajkar.  Thus,  Courts  of  Record  under\nArticle 129/Article 215 have inherent  powers  to  prohibit  publication  of\ncourt proceedings  or  the  evidence  of  the  witness.   The  judgments  in\nReliance Petrochemicals Ltd. and Mirajkar were  delivered  in  civil  cases.\nHowever, in Mirajkar, this Court held that all Courts  which  have  inherent\npowers, i.e., the Supreme Court, the High Courts and Civil Courts can  issue\nprior restraint orders or proceedings,  prohibitory  orders  in  exceptional\ncircumstances temporarily prohibiting publications of Court  proceedings  to\nbe made in the media and that such powers do not violate  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_42\">Article  19(1)(a).</a>\nFurther, it is important to note, that, one of the Heads  on  which  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_43\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> rights can be restricted is in  relation  to  “contempt  of  court”\nunder <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 19(2).</a>  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19(2)</a> preserves common law of contempt  as  an\n“existing law”.  In fact, the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_46\">Contempt of  Courts  Act,  1971</a>  embodies  the\ncommon law of contempt.  At this stage, it is  suffice  to  state  that  the\nConstitution framers were fully aware of the Institution of  Contempt  under\nthe common law which they have preserved as  “existing  law”  under  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_47\">Article\n19(2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 129</a> and <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 215</a>  of  Constitution.   The  reason\nbeing that contempt is an offence sui  generis.   The  Constitution  framers\nwere aware that the law of contempt  is  only  one  of  the  ways  in  which\nadministration of justice is protected, preserved and furthered.   That,  it\nis an important adjunct to the criminal process  and  provides  a  sanction.\nOther civil courts have the  power  under  <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_50\">Section  151</a>  of  Code  of  Civil\nProcedure to pass orders prohibiting publication of court  proceedings.   In\nMirajkar, this Court referred to the principles governing Courts  of  Record\nunder <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 215 [</a>see para 60].  It was held  that  the  High  Court  is  a\nSuperior Court of Record and that under <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 215</a> it has  all  the  powers\nof such a court including the power to punish contempt of itself.   At  this\nstage, the word “including” in Article 129/Article 215 is to be  noted.   It\nmay be noted that each of the Articles is in  two  parts.   The  first  part\ndeclares that the Supreme Court or the High  Court  “shall  be  a  Court  of\nRecord and shall have all the powers of such  a  court”.   The  second  part\nsays “includes the powers to punish for contempt”.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1666530\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1496509\" id=\"span_13\">These Articles save  the\npre-existing powers of the Courts as courts of record  and  that  the  power\nincludes the power to  punish  for  contempt  [see  <a href=\"/doc/1496509/\" id=\"a_53\">Delhi  Judicial  Service\nAssociation v. State of Gujarat</a> [(1991) 4 SCC 406]  and  Supreme  Court  <a href=\"/doc/1666530/\" id=\"a_54\">Bar\nAssociation v. Union of India</a> [(1998) 4 SCC 409].   As  such  a  declaration\nhas been made in the Constitution that the said powers cannot be taken  away\nby any law made by the Parliament except to the limited extent mentioned  in\n<a href=\"/doc/614338/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 142(2)</a> in the matter of investigation or punishment of any  contempt\nof itself.  If one reads <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 19(2)</a> which refers to law  in  relation  to\nContempt of Court with the first part of <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 129</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_58\">Article  215</a>,  it\nbecomes clear that the power is conferred on the High Court and the  Supreme\nCourt  to  see  that  “the  administration  of  justice  is  not  perverted,\nprejudiced, obstructed or interfered with”.  To see that the  administration\nof justice is not prejudiced or perverted  clearly  includes  power  of  the\nSupreme Court/High Court to prohibit temporarily, statements being  made  in\nthe  media  which  would  prejudice  or  obstruct  or  interfere  with   the\nadministration of justice in a given case pending in the  Supreme  Court  or\nthe High Court or even in the subordinate courts.</span></span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"203322\" id=\"span_14\">In view of  the  judgment\nof this Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_59\">A.K.  Gopalan  v.

Arvind Shukla</a> [1995 Supp (2) SCC 130]  that\nthe law of contempt is a way to prevent the due process of law from  getting\nperverted.  That, the words “due course of justice”  in  <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_62\">Section  2  (c)</a>  or\n<a href=\"/doc/1478730/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 13</a> of the 1971 Act  are  wide  enough  and  are  not  limited  to  a\nparticular judicial proceedings.  That, the meaning of the  words  “contempt\nof court” in <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 129</a> and <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 215</a> is wider  than  the  definition  of\n“criminal contempt” in <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 2 (c)</a> of the 1971 Act.  Here, we  would  like\nto add a caveat.  The contempt of court is  a  special  jurisdiction  to  be\nexercised sparingly and with caution whenever an act adversely  affects  the\nadministration of  justice  [see  Nigel  Lowe  and  Brenda  Sufrin,  Law  of\nContempt (Third Edition)].  Trial by newspaper  comes  in  the  category  of\nacts which interferes with the course of justice or  due  administration  of\njustice [see Nigel Lowe and  Brenda  Sufrin,  page  5  of  Fourth  Edition].\nAccording to Nigel Lowe and  Brenda  Sufrin  [page  275]  and  also  in  the\ncontext of second part of <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 129</a> and <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 215</a>  of  the  Constitution\nthe object of the contempt law is not only to punish, it includes the  power\nof the Courts to prevent  such  acts  which  interfere,  impede  or  pervert\nadministration of justice.  Presumption of innocence is held to be  a  human\nright.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244079\" id=\"span_16\">[See : <a href=\"/doc/244079/\" id=\"a_69\">Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing  Sharma  v.  State  of  Maharashtra</a>\n(2005) 5  SCC  294].  If  in  a  given  case  the  appropriate  Court  finds\ninfringement of such presumption by excessive prejudicial publicity  by  the\nnewspapers (in general), then under inherent powers, the  Courts  of  Record\nsuo motu or on being approached or  on  report  being  filed  before  it  by\nsubordinate court can  under  its  inherent  powers  under  <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_70\">Article  129</a>  or\n<a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 215</a> pass orders of postponement of publication for a limited  period\nif the applicant is able to demonstrate substantial  risk  of  prejudice  to\nthe pending trial and provided he is able to  displace  the  presumption  of\nopen Justice and to that extent the burden will  be  on  the  applicant  who\nseeks such postponement of offending publication.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_17\">34.   The above discussion shows that in most jurisdictions there  is  power\nin the courts to postpone reporting of judicial proceedings in the  interest\nof administration of justice.   Under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_72\">Article  19(2)</a>  of  the  Constitution,\nlaw in relation to contempt of court, is a reasonable restriction.  It  also\nsatisfies the test <a href=\"/doc/244079/\" id=\"a_73\">laid down in</a> the judgment of this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_74\">R.  Rajagopal\nv. State of T.N.</a> [(1994)  6  SCC  632].   As  stated,  in  most  common  law\njurisdictions, discretion is given to  the  courts  to  evolve  neutralizing\ndevices under contempt jurisdiction such as postponement of the  trial,  re-\ntrials, change of venue and in appropriate cases even  to  grant  acquittals\nin cases of excessive media prejudicial publicity.  The very  object  behind\nempowering  the  courts  to  devise  such  methods  is  to  see   that   the\nadministration of  justice  is  not  perverted,  prejudiced,  obstructed  or\ninterfered with.  At the same time, there is a presumption of  Open  Justice\nunder the common law.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"244079\" id=\"span_18\">Therefore, courts have  evolved  mechanisms  such  as\npostponement of publicity to balance presumption of innocence, which is  now\nrecognized as a human right in <a href=\"/doc/244079/\" id=\"a_75\">Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma v. State  of\nMaharashtra</a> (supra) vis-à-vis presumption of Open Justice.   Such  an  order\nof postponement has to be passed only when other alternative  measures  such\nas change of venue or postponement of trial are not available.   In  passing\nsuch orders of postponement, courts have to keep in mind  the  principle  of\nproportionality and the test of necessity.  The applicant  who  seeks  order\nof postponement of publicity must displace the presumption of  Open  Justice\nand only  in  such  cases  the  higher  courts  shall  pass  the  orders  of\npostponement under  Article  129/Article  215  of  the  Constitution.   Such\norders of postponement of publicity shall be passed  for  a  limited  period\nand subject to the courts evaluating in each  case  the  necessity  to  pass\nsuch orders not only in the context of administration of  justice  but  also\nin the context of the  rights  of  the  individuals  to  be  protected  from\nprejudicial publicity or mis-information, in other words,  where  the  court\nis satisfied that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 21</a> rights of a person are offended.   There is  no\ngeneral law for courts to postpone publicity, either prior  to  adjudication\nor during adjudication as it would  depend  on  facts  of  each  case.   The\nnecessity for any such order  would  depend  on  extent  of  prejudice,  the\neffect on individuals involved in the case,  the  over-riding  necessity  to\ncurb the right to report judicial proceedings conferred on the  media  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the right of  the  media  to  challenge  the  order  of\npostponement.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">(ii)  <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_78\">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">35.    <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_79\">Section  2</a>  defines  “contempt”,  “civil  contempt”   and   “criminal\ncontempt”.  In the context of contempt on account of publications which  are\nnot fair  and  accurate  publication  of  court  proceedings,  the  relevant\nprovisions are contained in <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_80\">Sections  4</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/520823/\" id=\"a_81\">7</a>  whereas  <a href=\"/doc/1478730/\" id=\"a_82\">Section  13</a>  is  a\ngeneral provision which deals  with  defences.   It  will  be  noticed  that\n<a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 4</a> deals with “report of a judicial proceeding”.  A person is not  to\nbe treated as guilty of contempt if he has published such a report which  is\nfair and accurate. <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 4</a> is subject  to  the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/520823/\" id=\"a_85\">Section  7</a>\nwhich,  however,  deals  with  publication  of  “information”  relating   to\n“proceedings in chambers”. Here the emphasis is on “information” whereas  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_86\">Section  4</a>,  emphasis  is  on  “report  of  a  judicial  proceeding”.   This\ndistinction  between  a  “report  of  proceedings”  and   “information”   is\nnecessary because <a href=\"/doc/520823/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 7</a> deals with proceedings in camera where there  is\nno access to the media.  In this connection, the provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/1478730/\" id=\"a_88\">Section  13</a>\nhave to be borne in mind.  The inaccuracy of reporting of court  proceedings\nwill be contempt only if it can be said on the facts of a  particular  case,\nto amount to substantial interference with the  administration  of  justice.\nThe reason behind <a href=\"/doc/1222272/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 4</a> is to grant a privilege in favour of the  person\nwho makes the publication provided it is fair and accurate.  This  is  based\non the presumption of “open justice” in courts.  Open justice  permits  fair\nand accurate reports of court proceedings to be published. The media  has  a\nright  to  know  what  is  happening  in  courts  and  to  disseminate   the\ninformation to the public  which  enhances  the  public  confidence  in  the\ntransparency of court proceedings.  As stated  above,  sometimes,  fair  and\naccurate reporting of the trial (say a murder trial) would nonetheless  give\nrise to substantial risk of prejudice not in the pending trial  but  in  the\nlater or connected trials.  In such  cases,  there  is  no  other  practical\nmeans short of postponement orders that is capable of avoiding such risk  of\nprejudice to the later or connected trials.  Thus,  postponement  order  not\nonly safeguards fairness of the  later  or  connected  trials,  it  prevents\npossible contempt by the Media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">(iii) “Order of Postponement” of publication- its nature and Object\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">36.

Formerly, it was  regarded\n           as inherent in the powers of a court of record and  now  by  the\n           Constitution of India, it is a part of the powers of the Supreme\n           Court and the High Courts.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_21\">39.    The  question  before  us  is  whether  such  “postponement   orders”\nconstitute restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 19(2)</a> as read broadly  by  this  Court\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_104\">Cricket Association of Bengal</a> (supra)?</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">40.   As stated, right to freedom of expression under  the  First  Amendment\nin US is absolute which is not so under Indian Constitution in view of  such\nright getting restricted by the test of reasonableness and in  view  of  the\nHeads of Restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 19(2).</a>  Thus, the clash  model  is  more\nsuitable  to  American  Constitution  rather   than   Indian   or   Canadian\njurisprudence, since First Amendment has no equivalent of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_106\">Article  19(2)</a>  or\n<a href=\"/doc/1801328/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 1</a> of the Canadian Charter.  This has led  the  American  Courts,  in\ncertain cases, to evolve techniques or methods to be applied in cases  where\non account of  excessive  prejudicial  publicity,  there  is  usurpation  of\ncourt’s functions.  These are techniques such  as  retrials  being  ordered,\nchange of venue, ordering acquittals even at the Appellate stage,  etc.   In\nour view, orders of postponement of publications/ publicity  in  appropriate\ncases, as indicated above, keeping in mind the timing (the  stage  at  which\nit should be ordered), its duration and the right  of  appeal  to  challenge\nsuch orders is just a neutralizing device, when no  other  alternative  such\nas change of venue or postponement of trial is available, evolved by  courts\nas a preventive measure to protect the press  from  getting  prosecuted  for\ncontempt  and  also  to  prevent  administration  of  justice  from  getting\nperverted or prejudiced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">(iv)  Width of the postponement orders\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">41.   The question  is  -  whether  such  “postponement  orders”  constitute\nrestriction under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and whether  such  restriction  is  saved\nunder <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 19(2)?</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">42.   At the outset, we  must  understand  the  nature  of  such  orders  of\npostponement.  Publicity postponement orders should be seen, in the  context\nof <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> not being an absolute right. The US  clash  model  based\non collision between freedom of expression (including free  press)  and  the\nright to a fair trial will not apply to  Indian  Constitution.   In  certain\ncases, even accused  seeks  publicity  (not  in  the  pejorative  sense)  as\nopenness and transparency is the basis of a fair  trial  in  which  all  the\nstakeholders who are a party to a litigation including the judges are  under\nscrutiny and at the same time people get to know what  is  going  on  inside\nthe court rooms.  These aspects come within the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_111\">Article  19(1)</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 21.</a>  When rights of  equal  weight  clash,  Courts  have  to  evolve\nbalancing techniques or measures based on re-calibration  under  which  both\nthe rights are given equal space in the Constitutional Scheme  and  this  is\nwhat the “postponement order” does  subject  to  the  parameters,  mentioned\nhereinafter.   But,  what  happens  when  courts  are  required  to  balance\nimportant public interests placed side  by  side.   For  example,  in  cases\nwhere presumption of open justice has to be  balanced  with  presumption  of\ninnocence, which as stated above,  is  now  recognized  as  a  human  right.\nThese presumptions existed at the time  when  the  Constitution  was  framed\n[existing law under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 19(2)]</a> and they continue till date not  only  as\npart of rule of law under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 14</a> but also as an <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 21</a>  right.   The\nconstitutional protection in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 21</a> which protects  the  rights  of  the\nperson for a fair trial is, in law, a valid  restriction  operating  on  the\nright to free speech under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, by virtue of force of it  being\na constitutional provision.  Given that the postponement orders curtail  the\nfreedom of expression of third parties, such orders have to be  passed  only\nin cases in which there  is  real  and  substantial  risk  of  prejudice  to\nfairness of the trial or to the proper administration of  justice  which  in\nthe words of  Justice  Cardozo  is  “the  end  and  purpose  of  all  laws”.\nHowever, such orders  of  postponement  should  be  ordered  for  a  limited\nduration and without  disturbing  the  content  of  the  publication.   They\nshould be passed only when necessary to prevent real  and  substantial  risk\nto the fairness of the trial (court proceedings), if reasonable  alternative\nmethods or measures such as change of venue or postponement  of  trial  will\nnot prevent the said risk and when  the  salutary  effects  of  such  orders\noutweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression  of  those  affected\nby the prior restraint.  The order of postponement will only be  appropriate\nin cases where the balancing test otherwise favours  non-publication  for  a\nlimited period.  It is not possible for this Court to  enumerate  categories\nof publications amounting to contempt.  It would require the courts in  each\ncase to see the content  and  the  context  of  the  offending  publication.\nThere cannot be any straightjacket formula enumerating such categories.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_22\">In\nour view, keeping the above parameters, if the  High  Court/  Supreme  Court\n(being Courts of Record)  pass  postponement  orders  under  their  inherent\njurisdictions, such  orders  would  fall  within  “reasonable  restrictions”\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_118\">Article  19(2)</a>  and  which  would  be  in  conformity  with  societal\ninterests, as held in the case of <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_119\">Cricket  Association  of  Bengal</a>  (supra).\nIn this connection, we must also keep in mind the language of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_120\">Article  19(1)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 19(2).</a>  Freedom of press has been read  into  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_122\">Article  19(1)(a).</a></span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_23\">After the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_123\">Maneka Gandhi</a> (supra,  p.  248),  it  is\nnow well-settled that test of reasonableness applies  not  only  to  <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_124\">Article\n19(1)</a> but also to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 21.</a>  For example, right  to  access\ncourts under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_127\">Articles 32</a><a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_128\">, 226</a> or 136 seeking relief against infringement  of\nsay <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 21</a> rights has not been specifically  mentioned  in  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_130\">Article  14.</a>\nYet, this right has been deduced from the words “equality  before  the  law”\nin <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 14.</a>  Thus, the test of reasonableness which  applies  in  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_132\">Article\n14</a> context would equally apply to <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 19(1)</a>  rights.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"154958944\" id=\"span_24\">Similarly,  while\njudging reasonableness of an enactment even Directive Principles  have  been\ntaken into  consideration  by  this  Court  in  several  cases  [see  recent\njudgment of this Court in Society for <a href=\"/doc/154958944/\" id=\"a_134\">Un-aided Private Schools of  Rajasthan\nv.

Further, we must also keep in mind  the  words  of  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_144\">Article  19(2)</a>  “in\nrelation to contempt of court”.  At the outset, it may be stated  that  like\nother freedoms, clause 1(a) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 19</a> refers to the common law right  of\nfreedom of expression and does  not  apply  to  any  right  created  by  the\nstatute (see page 275 of Constitution of India by D.D. Basu, 14th  edition).\n The above words “in relation to” in  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_146\">Article  19(2)</a>  are  words  of  widest\namplitude.  When the said words are read in relation to contempt  of  court,\nit follows that the law of contempt is treated as reasonable restriction  as\nit seeks to prevent administration of  justice  from  getting  perverted  or\nprejudiced  or  interfered  with.   Secondly,  these  words  show  that  the\nexpression “contempt of court” in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 19(2)</a> indicates  that  the  object\nbehind putting these words in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_148\">Article  19(2)</a>  is  to  regulate  and  control\nadministration of justice.  Thirdly, if one reads  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_149\">Article  19(2)</a>  with  the\nsecond part of <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 129</a> or <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 215</a>, it is  clear  that  the  contempt\naction does not exhaust the powers of  the  Court  of  Record.   The  reason\nbeing that contempt is an offence sui generis.   Common law defines what  is\nthe scope of contempt or limits of contempt.  <a href=\"/doc/614338/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 142(2)</a>  operates  only\nin  a  limited  field.   It  permits  a  law  to  be  made   restricted   to\ninvestigations and punishment and does not touch the inherent powers of  the\nCourt of Record.  Fourthly, in case of criminal contempt, the offending  act\nmust constitute  interference  with  administration  of  justice.   Contempt\njurisdiction of courts of record forms part of their  inherent  jurisdiction\nunder Article 129/ <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 215.</a>  Superior Courts of Record have  inter  alia\ninherent  superintendent  jurisdiction  to  punish  contempt  committed   in\nconnection with proceedings before inferior courts.  The test  is  that  the\npublication (actual and not planned publication)  must  create  a  real  and\nsubstantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice or  to\nthe fairness of trial.  It is important to bear in mind that sometimes  even\nfair  and  accurate  reporting  of  the  trial  (say  murder  trial)   could\nnonetheless  give  rise  to  the  “real  and  substantial  risk  of  serious\nprejudice” to the connected trials.  In such cases, though  rare,  there  is\nno other practical means short of postponement orders  that  is  capable  of\navoiding the real  and  substantial  risk  of  prejudice  to  the  connected\ntrials.  Thus, postponement  orders  safeguard  fairness  of  the  connected\ntrials.  The principle underlying postponement orders is  that  it  prevents\npossible contempt.  Of course, before passing  postponement  orders,  Courts\nshould look at the content of the offending  publication  (as  alleged)  and\nits effect.  Such postponement orders operate on actual  publication.   Such\norders direct postponement of the publication for a limited  period.   Thus,\nif one reads <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 19(2)</a>, Article 129/ <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 215</a> and <a href=\"/doc/614338/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 142(2)</a>,  it\nis clear that Courts of Record “have  all  the  powers  including  power  to\npunish” which means that  Courts  of  Record  have  the  power  to  postpone\npublicity in appropriate cases as a preventive  measure  without  disturbing\nits content. Such measures protect the  Media  from  getting  prosecuted  or\npunished for committing contempt and at  the  same  time  such  neutralizing\ndevices or techniques evolved by the Courts  effectuate  a  balance  between\nconflicting public interests.  It is well settled that  precedents  of  this\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 141</a> and the Comparative Constitutional law helps  courts\nnot only to understand the provisions of the  Indian  Constitution  it  also\nhelps the Constitutional Courts to evolve  principles  which  as  stated  by\nRonald Dworkin are propositions describing rights [in terms of  its  content\nand contours] (See “Taking Rights Seriously” by Ronald Dworkin, 5th  Reprint\n2010).  The postponement orders is, as stated above, a  neutralizing  device\nevolved by the  courts  to  balance  interests  of  equal  weightage,  viz.,\nfreedom of expression vis-à-vis freedom of trial, in the context of the  law\nof contempt.  One aspect needs to be highlighted.  The shadow of the law  of\ncontempt hangs over our jurisprudence.   The  media,  in  several  cases  in\nIndia, is the only representative of the public to bring to  the  notice  of\nthe  court  issues  of  public  importance  including  governance   deficit,\ncorruption, drawbacks in the system.  Keeping in mind the important role  of\nthe media, Courts have evolved  several  neutralizing  techniques  including\npostponement  orders  subject  to  the   twin   tests   of   necessity   and\nproportionality to be applied in cases where there is real  and  substantial\nrisk of prejudice  to  the  proper  administration  of  justice  or  to  the\nfairness of trial. Such orders would also put  the  Media  to  notice  about\npossible contempt.  However, it would be open to  Media  to  challenge  such\norders in appropriate proceedings.  Contempt  is  an  offence  sui  generis.\nPurpose of Contempt Law is not only to punish.  Its object  is  to  preserve\nthe sanctity of administration of justice and the integrity of  the  pending\nproceeding.  Thus, the postponement order is not a punitive measure,  but  a\npreventive measure as explained hereinabove.  Therefore, in our  view,  such\norders of postponement, in the absence of  any  other  alternative  measures\nsuch as change of venue or postponement of trial,  satisfy  the  requirement\nof justification under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 19(2)</a>  and  they  also  help  the  Courts  to\nbalance conflicting societal interests of right to  know  vis-à-vis  another\nsocietal interest in fair administration of justice. One more  aspect  needs\nto be mentioned. Excessive prejudicial publicity leading  to  usurpation  of\nfunctions of the Court not only interferes with  administration  of  justice\nwhich is sought to be protected under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_159\">Article 19(2)</a>, it also  prejudices  or\ninterferes with a particular legal proceedings. In  such  case,  Courts  are\nduty bound under inherent jurisdiction,  subject  to  above  parameters,  to\nprotect the presumption of innocence which is now recognised by  this  Court\nas a human  right  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_160\">Article  21</a>,  subject  to  the  applicant  proving\ndisplacement of such a  presumption  in  appropriate  proceedings.   Lastly,\npostponement orders must be integrally  connected  to  the  outcome  of  the\nproceedings including guilt or innocence of the accused, which would  depend\non the facts of each case.  For aforestated reasons, we  hold  that  subject\nto above parameters, postponement orders fall under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 19(2)</a>  and  they\nsatisfy the test of reasonableness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">(v)   Right to approach the High Court/ Supreme Court\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">43.   In the light of the law  enunciated  hereinabove,  anyone,  be  he  an\naccused or an aggrieved person, who genuinely apprehends  on  the  basis  of\nthe content of the publication and its effect, an infringement of  his/  her\nrights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 21</a> to a fair trial and all that it  comprehends,  would\nbe entitled to approach an appropriate writ  court  and  seek  an  order  of\npostponement of the offending  publication/  broadcast  or  postponement  of\nreporting of certain phases of the trial (including identity of  the  victim\nor the witness or the complainant),  and  that  the  court  may  grant  such\npreventive relief, on a balancing of the right to a fair trial  and  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_163\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> rights, bearing in mind the abovementioned principles of  necessity\nand proportionality and keeping in mind that  such  orders  of  postponement\nshould be for short duration and should be applied only  in  cases  of  real\nand substantial risk of prejudice to the proper  administration  of  justice\nor to the fairness of trial.   Such  neutralizing  device  (balancing  test)\nwould not be an unreasonable restriction and  on  the  contrary  would  fall\nwithin the proper constitutional framework.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">Maintainability\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">44.   As stated above, in the present case, we heard various  stake  holders\nas an important question  of  public  importance  arose  for  determination.\nBroadly, on maintainability the following contentions were raised:  (i)  the\nproceedings were not maintainable as there is  no  lis;   (ii)  there  is  a\ndifference between law-making and framing of guidelines.  That, law  can  be\nmade only by Parliament.  That,  guidelines  to  be  framed  by  the  Court,\ntherefore, should be self-regulatory or at the most advisory.   (iii)  under\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 142</a>, this Court cannot invest courts or  any  other  authority  with\njurisdiction, adjudicatory or otherwise, which they do not possess.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">45.   <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 141</a> uses the phrase “law declared by the Supreme  Court.”   It\nmeans law made while interpreting the statutes or  the  Constitution.   Such\njudicial law-making is part of the judicial process.  Further under  <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_166\">Article\n141</a>, law-making through interpretation and  expansion  of  the  meanings  of\nopen-textured expressions such as “law in relation to contempt of court”  in\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_167\">Article  19(2)</a>,  “equal  protection  of  law”,  “freedom   of   speech   and\nexpression”  and  “administration  of  justice”  is  a  legitimate  judicial\nfunction.   According  to  Ronald  Dworkin,  “Arguments  of  principle   are\narguments  intended  to  establish  an  individual  right.   Principles  are\npropositions that describe  rights.”   [See  “Taking  Rights  Seriously”  by\nRonald Dworkin, 5th Reprint 2010, p. 90].  In this case, this Court is  only\ndeclaring under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_168\">Article 141</a>, the constitutional limitations on  free  speech\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_169\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>,  in  the  context  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_170\">Article  21.</a>  The  exercise\nundertaken by this Court is an  exercise  of  exposition  of  constitutional\nlimitations under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_171\">Article 141</a> read  with  Article  129/Article  215  in  the\nlight of the contentions and large number of authorities referred to by  the\ncounsel on <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 19(2)</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_174\">Article  21</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_175\">Article  129</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 215</a> as also the “law  of  contempt”  insofar  as  interference  with\nadministration of justice under the common law  as  well  as  under  <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_177\">Section\n2(c)</a> of 1971 Act is concerned.  What constitutes  an  offending  publication\nwould depend on the decision of the court on case  to  case  basis.   Hence,\nguidelines on reporting cannot be framed across the Board.   The  shadow  of\n“law of contempt” hangs over our jurisprudence.  This Court  is  duty  bound\nto clear that  shadow  under  <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_178\">Article  141.</a>   The  phrase  “in  relation  to\ncontempt of court” under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 19(2)</a> does not in the  least  describe  the\ntrue  nature  of  the   offence   which   consists   in   interfering   with\nadministration of  justice;  in  impending  and  perverting  the  course  of\njustice.  That is all which is done by this judgment.  We have  exhaustively\nreferred to the contents of the IAs filed by Sahara  and  SEBI.   As  stated\nabove, the right to negotiate and settle in  confidence  is  a  right  of  a\ncitizen and has been equated to a right of the accused to defend himself  in\na criminal trial.  In this case, Sahara has complained to this Court on  the\nbasis of breach of confidentiality by the Media.  In the  circumstances,  it\ncannot be contended that there was no  lis.   Sahara,  therefore,  contended\nthat this Court  should  frame  guidelines  or  give  directions  which  are\nadvisory   or   self-regulatory   whereas   SEBI    contended    that    the\nguidelines/directions should be given by this Court which do not have to  be\ncoercive.  In the circumstances, constitutional adjudication  on  the  above\npoints was required and it cannot be said that there was no lis between  the\nparties.  We reiterate that the  exposition  of  constitutional  limitations\nhas been done under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 141</a> read with  Article  129/Article  215.   When\nthe content of rights is considered by this Court, the  Court  has  also  to\nconsider the enforcement of the rights as well  as  the  remedies  available\nfor  such  enforcement.   In  the  circumstances,  we  have  expounded   the\nconstitutional limitations on  free speech under  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_181\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  in  the\ncontext of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 21</a> and under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 141</a> read  with  Article  129/Article\n215 which preserves the inherent jurisdiction of the  Courts  of  Record  in\nrelation to contempt law.   We  do  not  wish  to  enumerate  categories  of\npublication amounting to  contempt  as  the  Court(s)  has  to  examine  the\ncontent and the context on case to case basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\"> 46.
