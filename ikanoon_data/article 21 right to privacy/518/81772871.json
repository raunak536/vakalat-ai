Shorts facts leading to the filing of the writ petition are as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      Petitioner No.1 is a charitable society registered under the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/120307926/\" id=\"a_5\">Travancore-Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Registration Act,\n\n1955</a>, engaged in espousing social causes, particularly those relating to\n\nviolation of human rights and foeticide under the cover of Medical Termination\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                4</span>\n\n\n\nof Pregnancy. 2nd petitioner apart from being a member of the 1 st petitioner\n\nsociety, is also engaged in the promotion of pro-life activities and has worked\n\nextensively in the field, by providing and directing a documentary film on the\n\nvalue of life and agony of the unborn child in a abortion. 3 rd petitioner is a\n\nmember of the 1st petitioner society and a medical professional working\n\nagainst female foeticide. The petitioners are challenging the constitutionality\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3(2)(ii)</a> and the explanation thereof of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_7\">Medical Termination of\n\nPregnancy Act, 1971</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      According to the petitioners, when a spermatozoon enters the ovum,\n\nfertilization takes place, which marks the beginning of a biological life of an\n\nindividual.   Formation of a child       has to be considered from this stage\n\nwhereafter it obtains all rights of a human being and is entitled to protection\n\nafforded to every citizen of India, including right to life and property. The only\n\nexception is when it becomes a risk or threat to the life of the mother. Thus,\n\naccording to the petitioners, permitting abortion for the reason that the yet to\n\nbe born is handicapped or that the pregnancy caused as a result of failure of\n\ndevice or method used by any married women or her husband for the purpose\n\nof limiting the number of children can be presumed to constitute grave injury\n\nto the mental health of the women and hence, she can be permitted to\n\nundergo abortion, which violates the right to life. Hence, they seek to declare\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                5</span>\n\n\n\nthat the said section is bad in law and violates right to life guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      3. Petitioners have contended that abortion is a deliberate ending of\n\nlife. Every fertilized embryo has got a right of life and it should be protected\n\nas that of its mother. However, loose ends of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_9\">MTP Act</a> causes termination\n\nof large number of &quot;unwanted&quot; pregnancies especially, the tendency for\n\nfemale foeticide in the mother&#x27;s womb. According to the petitioners, in India,\n\na large number of abortions are carried out for getting rid of girl children.\n\nDespite the fact that unborn child, especially the girl child, is given a special\n\nprotection through <a href=\"/doc/13125684/\" id=\"a_10\">Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques\n\n(Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994</a>, it does not serve any purpose. Due\n\nto the enabling provisions contained in the Act, female foetus are identified\n\nand killed in large numbers, which is obvious from the decline in sex ratio in\n\nthe latest census report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">      4. The grounds raised are that,- an unborn child should be regarded as\n\none of the weakest, the most vulnerable and most defenseless forms of\n\nhumanity and should be protected accordingly and that the nature designs the\n\nchild at the stage of fertilization itself; that the laws regulating <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_11\">MTP Act</a> is\n\nprepared with a misconception that life begins only at the stage when the\n\nfoetus can survive outside the womb, which is totally incorrect, and there\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013               6</span>\n\n\n\ncannot be a standard age for that. Survival of foetus depends on the state of\n\nmedical science, available medical facilities in a particular location, and the\n\ncompetence or willingness of the mother/care giver; that the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_12\">MTP Act</a> permits\n\nkilling the child inside mother&#x27;s womb where there is substantial risk if the\n\nchild is born. It put forth the principle that death is better than suffering. As\n\nper the prevailing laws of India, Euthanasia - mercy killing of human being is\n\nnot sanctioned under any circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">      5. It is further contended that, according to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/685111/\" id=\"a_13\">Hindu\n\nSuccession Act</a>, the unborn child of a daughter in the uterus is also entitled to\n\na share in the property of the Hindu undivided family. There can be no right to\n\nproperty without an attached right, to life. Thus, our law since time\n\nimmemorial respects the rights of the unborn child. That apart, it is contended\n\nthat the right to life implies a correlative duty on all other persons not to take\n\nthe life of the unborn child except in two cases, namely, (i) if the child\n\ncommits aggression against the life of another person and (ii) if the continued\n\nlife of the child and continued life of another person are mutually incompatible\n\nbecause of the existential circumstances. These cases involve (i) Privilege of\n\nself defence, permitting a victim of aggression to defend his own life even if\n\nthat defense takes the aggressor&#x27;s life, and (ii) Privilege of self preservation,\n\nwhich permits an innocent individual to take the life of another innocent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                7</span>\n\n\n\nindividual in an emergency situation in which both cannot survive and the\n\nsurvival of one depends on the denial to the other of the means of survival. It\n\nis further stated that abortions do not get the privilege of self defense since\n\nthe unborn is not an aggressor. Secondly, aggression involves an act of will or\n\nan act of negligence. It can never arise from an act that is caused by\n\nexistential forces beyond the control of an individual. There cannot be\n\naggression if the human action does not involve a purposeful behavior or\n\naction. Creation of the fertilized egg and its attachment to the uterine wall are\n\nnot due to the act of unborn child. That is only a result of existential biological\n\nforces independent and beyond the control of the child which is brought to\n\nplay by the combined acts of&#x27; the father and mother. Since, the unborn child\n\ncannot rationally be held responsible for its own creation, it cannot rationally\n\nbe held to have committed aggression by coming into (being brought into)\n\nexistence. Aggression implies responsibility. No human being is responsible for\n\nits own creation. Since the unborn child is not an aggressor, the mother\n\ncannot invoke the privilege of self defense against its continued existence in\n\nthe place where its development as a human being is logically and biologically\n\nappropriate for it. Even in cases where the father is guilty of rape, his guilt\n\ncannot rationally be imputed to the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">      6. It is also contended that abortion cannot be taken as an exercise of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                8</span>\n\n\n\nprivilege of self preservation, since in the usual case, the mother&#x27;s life is not\n\nendangered by pregnancy. The privilege of self preservation can be exercised\n\nonly when the lives of two or more equally innocent persons are in jeopardy\n\nand not all of them can be saved. But in normal case, pregnancy is not such a\n\nsituation. In such extra ordinary cases, the mother would have a privilege to\n\ndefend her own life through abortion or to choose to give up her life to save\n\nthe child (if that is possible medically). In such situations, neither the State\n\nnor even the father of the child would have any right or privilege to interfere\n\nwith mother&#x27;s decision. Hence, abortion does not come within the recognized\n\nexception to the right to life. Abortion itself is a form of aggression against the\n\nchild. It can be said that rather than by law, abortion is supported for an\n\noverwhelming practical considerations even though there are differing views\n\ninternationally in this aspect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      7. It is pointed out that according to the Vienna Convention on the Law\n\nof Treaties, the rule regarding protection of life before birth could be\n\nconsidered as &#x27;jus cogens&#x27; (final norm of general international law). The right\n\nto life of all human beings has the nature of an intransgressible norm already\n\ncontained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, the\n\nInternational covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 and the Declaration of\n\nthe Rights of the Child 1959. Under International law, the unborn child is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013               9</span>\n\n\n\nprotected, and it was not permissible at this late stage to attempt to allow a\n\nliberal abortion agenda under the Convention for the Rights of the Child.\n\nExplicit protection is extended to the unborn child in the International\n\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966, and in the convention on the\n\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948. The text (of the\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights 1948) clearly states that everyone has\n\nthe right to life, and that what is meant by everyone is &#x27;every member of the\n\nhuman family&#x27; - that is all human beings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">      8. It is further contended that right of an unborn child is not spelled out\n\nanywhere in the laws. But, it is left to the medical profession to adjudicate\n\nbetween a woman&#x27;s right to an abortion and the child&#x27;s right to be born, which\n\nis illegal, and that it is illegal and inhuman to treat abortion as a casual form\n\nof birth control as it would cause danger to both mother and unborn child.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      9. Under Secretary, Ministry of Family and Welfare, New Delhi,\n\nrespondent No.2, has filed a counter affidavit contending that,- the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_14\">Medical\n\nTermination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act</a> in India came into existence in 1971 and\n\nbefore this, abortions were governed by <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1862 and <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_16\">Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure</a>, 1898. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_17\">The Act</a> recognizes importance of providing safe,\n\naffordable, accessible and acceptable abortion services to women, who need\n\nto terminate an unwanted pregnancy, and legalizes abortion on therapeutic,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                10</span>\n\n\n\neugenic, humanitarian or social grounds. It also aims to regulate and ensure\n\naccess to safe abortion care for women and also defines &#x27;when&#x27;, &#x27;where&#x27; and\n\n&#x27;by whom&#x27; abortion can be performed; that the overall aim of this Act is to\n\nprovide safe abortion services within a legal framework and enhance access\n\nand availability of these services, in order to prevent women from approaching\n\nunsafe, backstreet abortion providers and protect them from the attendant\n\nrisks, including that to life; that the objectives of the Act and define situations\n\n&amp; circumstances in which safe abortion can be legally performed; empowers\n\nmedical practitioners &amp; institutions delivering these services. Furthermore, the\n\nMTP Act recognises certain conditions for abortions, incorporated in <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n\n3(2)</a> and permitted, if continuation of pregnancy:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">             •   Can cause injury to mental/ physical health of woman.\n             •   Results in birth of child with physical/ mental deformity.\n             •   Pregnancy due to Rape, Incest or Contraceptive Failure among\n                  married women.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">      10. It is also stated that rights of an unborn foetus have been a matter\n\nof intense debate with differing opinions on the subject and as such the 2 nd\n\nrespondent has no definite opinion on this. However, in all the countries where\n\nthere is a legislative framework for providing MTPs, these issues have been\n\ntaken into account before framing laws on abortions. The current MTP law in\n\nIndia was framed and passed by Parliament and involved the consensus of a\n\nbroad range of stakeholders who also took into account the legislation on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                11</span>\n\n\n\nabortion framed by other countries including countries like the United Kingdom\n\nwhere there is considerable regard for human rights and rights of women as\n\nsuch and further that the petitioners have adopted a biased one-sided view\n\nand have not taken into account the issues surrounding women&#x27;s rights with\n\nregard to their own health and to life. On the above grounds, the 2 nd\n\nrespondent sought for dismissal of the writ petition with costs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">      11. The President, Kerala Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\nMedical College, Kottayam, respondent No.3, has filed a counter affidavit\n\nbasically contending that,- the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_19\">Medical Termination of\n\nPregnancy Act</a> do not confer or recognize any right on any person to cause an\n\nabortion or termination of pregnancy. Even a pregnant woman cannot\n\nterminate pregnancy except under the circumstances set out in the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">MTP Act</a>.\n\nThe provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_21\">MTP Act</a> are invoked by responsible registered medical\n\npractitioners strictly following the conditions laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 3</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_23\">5</a> of the\n\nAct. Medical Termination of Pregnancy Regulation, 2003, ensure that all the\n\ncases of medical termination of pregnancy are properly documented and the\n\nChief Medical Officer of each State also oversee the implementation of the Act;\n\nthat the   refusal on the part of a registered medical practitioner to give\n\nassistance in medical termination of pregnancy when there is medical\n\nindication on religious ground alone is &#x27;misconduct&#x27; under clause 7.15 Chapter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013               12</span>\n\n\n\n7 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics)\n\nRegulation 2002. Clause 7.6 of the said Regulation prohibits sex determination\n\ntest with intention to terminate the life of a female foetus. Any such act is\n\nconsidered as a professional misconduct, for which the said registered medical\n\npractitioner will be liable to criminal proceedings and penal actions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      12. Further, the legal basis of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_24\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,\n\n1971</a> is the concern for maternal health i.e., to reduce maternal death due to\n\nabortion done by quacks or persons without professional medical training.\n\nStatistics show that great number of women lose their lives, while undergoing\n\nillegal abortions either under coercion or volition. After the introduction of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_25\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act</a>, maternal deaths due to septic abortion\n\nhave come down significantly. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act contemplates four\n\nsituations, wherein a woman can exercise her right to terminate pregnancy not\n\nexceeding 20 weeks, provided two registered medical practitioners shall certify\n\nthe given conditions. The 1st condition is when pregnancy threatens the life of\n\nthe mother. Even though a woman may normally be safe during pregnancy,\n\ncertain patients develop symptoms like high blood pressure, cardiac distress\n\netc., which can not only threaten the foetal health, but also the maternal\n\nhealth. The 2nd condition is when there is substantial risk of the child being\n\nborn with serious physical and mental abnormalities as to be seriously\n\nhandicapped: with the development of pre-natal diagnostic methods like ultra\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013              13</span>\n\n\n\nsound scan, Chorion Villus Sampling (CVS) amniocentesis etc., it is possible to\n\ndiagnose serious physical and mental abnormalities at very early stage of\n\npregnancy. In the prevailing conditions in India, as there is no mechanism by\n\nwhich the safety and welfare of persons with serious physical and mental\n\nabnormalities are ensured, such children are very often abandoned at birth\n\nand live a life of uncertainties and exploitation. The third condition is, when\n\nthe pregnancy is a result of rape: rape by itself exposes the woman concerned\n\nto great physical and mental trauma. In most cases, woman&#x27;s mental health is\n\ndisturbed by the act of rape and pregnancy that results from it can cause\n\nserious mental distress to her.

We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned\n\ncounsel on either side. On a deeper analysis of the provisions discussed above,\n\nit is clear and evident that all pregnancies are not allowed to be terminated.\n\nWhat are permitted for termination are exceptional circumstances that are\n\nrecited to in <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 3(2)</a> of the MTP Act, 1971. The circumstances made for\n\ntermination of pregnancy make it clear that there is an object sought to be\n\nachieved by termination of pregnancy, that is to save and protect the life of\n\npregnant women. Therefore, it is clear that the legislation is brought out to\n\nsatisfy the requirements of certain category of pregnancies and said provisions\n\nof law have an object sought to be achieved. The provisions are also brought\n\nout with the intention of preventing termination of pregnancies illegally by the\n\nunqualified persons and in an unscientific manner, thus eliminating the threat\n\nto life of the woman. The provisions will also have to be considered\n\ndispassionately and without any predilection, and the attempt of the court\n\nshould be to find out the purpose and purport of the legislation and any\n\nparticular provisions of law. Therefore, looking at any angle, the impugned\n\nprovisions cannot be said in any manner drastic, unethical, discriminatory,\n\nunreasonable or arbitrary, justifying interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">      18. A woman also has the choice to terminate pregnancy, however, in\n\naccordance with the procedure established by law, which is a right recognized\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013               18</span>\n\n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court as well\n\nas the High Courts. The privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution entitles a woman to decide as to whether she should continue\n\nwith an unwanted pregnancy. The exceptions carved out for termination of\n\npregnancy would show that it is on account of adverse consequences to the\n\nlife of a women, such a course of action is permitted and, therefore, the\n\nparliament in its wisdom, has introduced such provisions under <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_39\">MTP Act, 1971</a>,\n\nand amended from time-to-time with good intention. So much so, the wisdom\n\nof the parliament on account of such intentions and object sought to be\n\nachieved by introducing such a provision cannot be said to be a thoughtless\n\nand insignificant one. True the constitutional courts can entrench upon the\n\nlegislation, but such power should be exercised with utmost circumspection,\n\nsince the framers of law have brought out the legislation with a real purpose\n\nto be achieved after taking into consideration various factual and other\n\ncircumstances. But, at the same time, if any illegal circumstances like forcible\n\ntermination etc., comes to the notice of the authorities, they are at liberty to\n\nproceed in accordance with law. That apart, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 3</a> of the\n\nMTP Act, 1971 make it clear that it only permits a voluntary action at the Will\n\nof a pregnant woman and in the case of pregnancy of a woman who has not\n\nattained the age of 18 or who has attained majority is a mentally ill person\n\nwith the consent in writing of her guardian. Hence, it is clear that it is taking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013              19</span>\n\n\n\ninto account the choice of the woman or the guardian in any adverse\n\ncircumstances that can occur on delivery and on being fully satisfied in\n\naccordance with the Rules, 2003 by a qualified medical practitioner, the\n\nmedical termination of pregnancy is possible to be done. Considering all these\n\naspects, we could safely come to a conclusion that the provisions so made for\n\nthe medical termination of pregnancy is proportionate to the object sought to\n\nbe achieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">      19.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_17\">In   <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_41\">Suchita    Srivastava    and    Another     v.   Chandigarh\n\nAdministration</a> reported in (2009) 9 SCC 1, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court had\n\nconsidered the question of a pregnant woman&#x27;s consent for termination of her\n\npregnancy with mild mental retardation and held that her consent is also\n\nnecessary for reasons that <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> excludes consent of mentally ill\n\nwoman, but not mentally retarded woman. The <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_43\">Court further held</a> that\n\nconsent is necessary even when pregnancy is to be terminated in the\n\ncircumstances mentioned in Section 3(2)(i) and 3(2)(ii) of the MPT Act, 1971,\n\nand that the only exception to the said rule is contained under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 3(4)(a)</a>\n\nwhich prescribes for guardian&#x27;s consent (instead of woman&#x27;s consent) where\n\nthe woman is a minor or mentally ill. In the above said decision, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court has also considered the right of a woman to make reproductive\n\nchoices and held that reproductive choices is a dimension of personal liberty\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                20</span>\n\n\n\nas understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Paragraph 22 of\n\nthe judgment is relevant to this context, which reads thus:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          &quot;There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive\n          choices is also a dimension of `personal liberty&#x27; as understood\n          under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is important to\n          recognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate\n          as well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is\n          that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should\n          be respected. This means that there should be no restriction\n          whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such as a\n          woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\n          alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive methods.\n          Furthermore, women are also free to choose birth-control\n          methods such as undergoing sterilization procedures. Taken to\n          their logical conclusion, reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s\n          entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and\n          to subsequently raise children. However, in the case of pregnant\n          women there is also a &quot;compelling state interest&quot; in protecting the\n          life of the prospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\n          pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions specified in the\n          applicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the\n          <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_47\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that\n          have been placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">      20. In Suchita Srivastava (cited supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has\n\nfurther held that the provisions make it clear that ordinarily, a pregnancy can\n\nbe terminated only when a medical practitioner is satisfied that continuance of\n\npregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                21</span>\n\n\n\ninjury to her physical or mental health, or when there is substantial risk that if\n\nthe child was born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities,\n\nhas to be seriously handicapped. The other provision of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 3</a> was also\n\ntaken note of by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and held that it is under specified\n\ncircumstances, in order to protect the interest of the pregnant woman and to\n\navoid substantial risk on the birth of the child that it would suffer from physical\n\nor mental abnormalities, and to be seriously handicapped, the medical\n\ntermination of pregnancy can be undertaken by the medical practitioner.\n\nTaking into account the factual and legal circumstances involved in the case, it\n\nwas finally held that the language of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_49\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,\n\n1971</a> clearly respects the personal autonomy of mentally retarded persons\n\nwho are above the age of majority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">      21. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172163761\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/172163761/\" id=\"a_50\">Z v.

Thus, it means that, the reasonableness and importance\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 3(2)</a> of the MTP Act, 1971 were considered by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt and the same found to be incorporated in the Act, with a clear objective\n\nof protecting the life of a pregnant woman, and to control the birth of a child\n\nhaving severe mental ailments with a remote chance of survival. To put it\n\notherwise, the validity of <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 3(2)</a> of the Act is upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt in its letter and spirit.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">      27. As discussed above, there is a laudable object to be achieved by\n\nterminating the pregnancy under certain specified circumstances. Moreover, it\n\nis the choice of the woman to have privacy and to protect her bodily integrity,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013              27</span>\n\n\n\nwhich are all facets conferred on her under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia to decide as to whether continuance of pregnancy would be in the best\n\ninterest of her life. So also, whereever there is an abuse of process of law,\n\nany person aggrieved can avail legal remedy. Hence, medical termination of\n\npregnancy is possible only under the circumstances contained in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 3</a> of\n\nthe MTP Act, 1971. Therefore, it cannot be said that everyone, who is not\n\ninterested to continue with the pregnancy, is entitled as of right, to seek\n\nmedical termination of pregnancy on any grounds other than the one\n\nmentioned under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 3</a> of the Act. Furthermore, it is clear and evident\n\nfrom the provisions of Prohibition of Sex Selection Act, 1994, that any medical\n\ntermination of pregnancy, which is sought on the basis of sex, selection and\n\ndetermination, is punishable as per the provisions of the said Act. Therefore,\n\nsufficient and more safety measures and precautions are undertaken by the\n\nparliament, in order to ensure that unnecessary termination of pregnancies are\n\nnot insisted upon or carried out by a pregnant woman or a medical\n\npractitioner respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">      28. Taking into account all these aspects, we are of the considered view\n\nthat the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 3(2)</a> of the MTP Act, 1971 are in accordance\n\nwith law and it has no manner of illegality, arbitrariness or any other legal\n\ninfirmity, which is liable to be interfered with by this Court, in exercise of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> W.P.(C).No.10130/2013                28</span>\n\n\n\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Ultimately, the issue\n\nwith respect to safety of the woman and condition of the foetus are all to be\n\ndecided by the medical practitioners, in accordance with the provisions of the\n\nMedical Termination of Pregnancy, 1971 and the provisions of other laws, by\n\nwhich the medical practitioners are carrying out their duty and obligations\n\nconferred under the Act, 1971.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">      In view of the above, petitioners are not entitled to get any reliefs as\n\nsought for in the instant writ petition.
