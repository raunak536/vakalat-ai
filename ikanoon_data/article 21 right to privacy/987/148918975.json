DESHPANDE, J.) :</pre>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\">1.           In all the three writ petitions the employer of the petitioners is Air\n\nIndia Limited, but the facts as well as reliefs claimed by them are distinct from\n\none another. Hence, considering that the employer is common and\n\nmaintainability of writ petition itself is under issue, the writ petitions are\n\nbeing heard together. When the Writ Petition No. 1876 of 2001and Writ\n\nPetition No. 809 of 2002 were listed before this Court on 21 June 2024, this\n\nCourt has observed that &quot;the petitioners are the employees of the respondent-\n\nAir India Limited (hereinafter referred to as &quot; AIL&quot;). During the pendency of\n\nwrit petitions the status of respondent employer, has undergone a change, as\n\nsuch the respondent-AIL is not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt. The learned counsel for the petitioner states that, even in the changed\n\ncircumstances the petition can still be prosecuted and seeks time to prepare\n\ncompilation of decisions and address this Court. The matter was thereafter\n\ndirected to be listed on 15 July 2024. Hence the matters are listed before this\n\nCourt and in view of the aforementioned order passed by this Court the writ\n\npetitions are heard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">2.           In the first Writ Petition No. 1876 of 2001, the prayer of the petitioner\n\nis to declare that his dismissal order is passed without jurisdiction and is non-\n\nest, by granting all the consequential benefits. In Writ Petition No. 809 of\n\n\n     Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">        ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                      ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                               4                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\n2002, the prayer is to stay the effect, operation and implementation of the\n\norders/decisions dated 06.08.2001 and 21.02.2002 issued by the respondent\n\nno. 1. In Writ Petition No. 1333 of 2002, the prayer is for the extension of\n\nthe benefit of the pension scheme, which is made applicable to the employees\n\nretiring after 01.04.1994, claiming that it should be also made applicable to\n\nthe employees, who retired prior to 01.04.1994. In all the writ petitions the\n\nfacts as well as the prayers made by the petitioners are totally distinct from\n\none another. However, the common thread in all the three writ petitions is the\n\nemployer of the petitioners i.e., Air India Limited, which was the company\n\nowned by the Government, registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_1\">Companies Act, 1956</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.       While deciding the maintainability of the writ petitions the facts giving\n\nrise to the respective petitions and prayers made by petitioners will have to be\n\ntaken into consideration. All the writ petitions have been filed by the\n\nEmployees of the Air India Limited (AIL) claiming various reliefs against the\n\nrespondent Employer. The facts in writ petition No. 1876 of 2001 shorn of\n\nunnecessary details can be summarized as under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               &quot;WRIT PETITION NO. 1876 of 2001\n\n               Mr. M. Yogeshwar Raj. vs. M/s. Air India Ltd.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.       The petitioner joined service of the Air India Limited in 1976 as Traffic\n\nAssistant, on a post reserved for scheduled tribe. This services were confirmed\n\nin 1977, after being promoted as an Assistant Flight Purser in 1977, he was\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">     ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                              5                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nfurther promoted to the post of Flight Purser in 1994, and continued to serve\n\nas Flight Purser till his dismissal from service with effect from 14 June 2000\n\nvide order dated 19.06.2000. According to the petitioner, he had received a\n\ncommunication dated 18.12.1997, from H.R.D. Department Special Cell for\n\nSC/ST, Santa Cruz, requiring him to submit his caste certificate in prescribed\n\nformat after a lapse of 21 years of his service, even though he had already\n\nsubmitted a caste certificate available with him at the time of joining of\n\nservice. Due to his nature of work, he could not personally visit Hyderabad\n\nfor obtaining a fresh caste certificate, therefore he asked his wife who was then\n\npresent at Hyderabad to take necessary steps. He also addressed a\n\ncommunication to the Mandal Revenue Officer, for issuance of caste\n\ncertificate in prescribed format on 26.12.1997. Since his wife was looking after\n\nher ailing sister, she further authorized one Mr. Narayana Murthy to obtain\n\nthe caste certificate. They received the caste certificate through post from Shri.\n\nNarayana Murthy, which was submitted to the respondent-employer.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">5.       All of a sudden, the petitioner received a chargesheet dated 29.12.1998,\n\nissued by the respondent-employer. The allegations against him were that, his\n\nprevious caste certificate, which was submitted by him at the time of joining\n\nservice in the year 1976, was issued by the Tutor of Pathology Department of\n\nOsmania Medical College, which did not bear the signature of the Tahsildar\n\nand it was not in a prescribed format, issued by the competent authority. The\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">     ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                              6                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nfresh caste certificate dated 04.02.1998, in the prescribed format submitted by\n\nthe petitioner, on its verification it was found to be bogus and not genuine. In\n\nview of the fact that the certificates submitted by the petitioner were not\n\ngenuine and not issued by the competent authority, the petitioner was\n\ncharged under the &#x27;Clause 19(2)(xi)&#x27; of the Certified Standing Orders of\n\nrespondent, alleging &quot;commission of an act which amounts to a criminal\n\noffence involving moral turpitude&quot;. Initially the petitioner filed a complaint\n\nagainst Mr. Narayan Murthy, thereafter FIR No. 6/1999 was lodged against\n\nthe petitioner on 12.01.1999. He then replied to the chargesheet on\n\n08.02.1998. However, ignoring his reply, the respondent-company without\n\ntaking into account his explanation, has constituted an Enquiry Committee\n\nby the office order dated 05.02.1999. During the enquiry no witnesses were\n\nexamined of either side. His categorical defence was that, according to the\n\ncircular issued by the Employment and Social Welfare Department, of\n\nAndhra Pradesh dated 17.10.1976, Gazetted Officers serving under the State\n\nGovernment were competent to issue community certificates to members of\n\nthe Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribe and Backward Classes. Therefore the\n\ncertificate that was issued to him, which was submitted by him while joining\n\nthe service was a valid certificate. It was his stand that, the chargesheet as well\n\nas the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings against him are by way of\n\nvictimization with the sole purpose of harassing him.\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">     ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                                   7                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">6.           According to the petitioner he submitted a verification certificate dated\n\n11.03.1999 issued by the Collector, Hyderabad certifying that he belongs to\n\nScheduled Tribe &quot;KOLAM&quot;. The Collector Hyderabad who was the\n\ncompetent authority has also certified that, the caste certificate issued in\n\nfavour of the petitioner in the year 1976 is genuine. He submitted his final\n\nstatement on 07.04.1999, after the conclusion of enquiry proceedings.\n\nAccording to him the management is responsible for the delay caused in\n\ngetting his caste certificate verified. It is the contention of the petitioner that,\n\nthe respondent should have taken timely steps for getting the verification of\n\nhis caste certificate confirmed from the competent authority, hence the delay\n\noccurred in taking the appropriate steps cannot be attributed to him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">7.           The petitioner received the report of the Enquiry Committee dated\n\n29.04.1999, the Enquiry Committee has recorded that, the petitioner was not\n\nguilty of the charges levelled against him, with further recommendation that\n\nthe competent authority should review the career record of the petitioner and\n\ntake appropriate measures. In spite of receiving clean chit by the Enquiry\n\nCommittee, the competent authority of the respondent-company, did not\n\nagree with the findings of the Enquiry Committee, and proposed to impose\n\npunishment of dismissal from service, and accordingly issued Show Cause\n\nNotice dated 30.08.1999. Upon receiving show cause notice dated\n\n30.08.1999, calling upon him to show cause as to why the punishment of\n\n     Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">        ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                      ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                            8                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\ndismissal should not be imposed upon him, the petitioner filed Writ Petition\n\nNo. 2293 of 1999 in this Court. This Court granted stay to the show cause\n\nnotice dated 30 August 1999.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">8.       Being aggrieved by the order of stay granted by this Court dated 18\n\nSeptember 1999, the respondent-company filed SLP No. 1477 of 2000,\n\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has set aside\n\nthe order dated 18 September 1999, passed by this Court granting stay to the\n\noperation of show cause notice issued against the petitioner. The respondent-\n\ncompany thereafter directed the petitioner to submit his say to the show cause\n\nnotice, accordingly the petitioner gave his reply to the show cause notice on 6\n\nJune 2000. The respondent-company informed the petitioner vide\n\ncommunication dated 14 June 2000, that the disciplinary authority has\n\nimposed punishment of removing him from service with effect from 14 June\n\n2000.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">9.       It is the contention of the petitioner that though the stay to the\n\noperation of the show cause notice was vacated by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt. Significantly while passing order dated 2 May 2000, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court, had not set aside the part of the order dated 18 May 1999,\n\nwhereby this Court had issued &#x27;Rule&#x27; in the petition and directed to continue\n\nthe petitioner in service. Hence, after issuance of the impugned order,\n\ndirecting his removal from service, the petitioner brought to the notice of the\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">     ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                  ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                                   9                 943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nrespondent authorities that, High Court had in fact directed to continue him\n\nin service. He therefore, addressed a communication to the respondent, to\n\ncontinue him in service, further apprising respondent-employer that failure to\n\ndo so would amount to contempt of the order passed by this Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">10.      The petitioner thereafter filed the Chamber Summons No. 81 of 2000\n\nfor amendment of Writ Petition No. 2293 of 1999, meanwhile the petitioner\n\nhas filed present writ petition. The petitioner has carried out amendment to\n\nthe memo of writ petition bringing on record the details about his earlier writ\n\npetition and subsequent withdrawal of writ petition along with certain other\n\npleadings and prayer clauses. In the present writ petition, the petitioner has\n\nmade following prayers\n\n          &quot;A) to quash and set aside the order dated 9 June 2000 and letter dated\n          14 June 2000 passed by the Deputy Manager presently dismissing the\n          petitioner from service with effect from 14 June 2000.\n          B) Direction to the respondent to reinstate the petitioner in service\n          and allot him work and pay full back wages and consequential\n          benefits.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">11.      By way of amendment-Rider C and D have been added in the prayer\n\nclause, in both riders the incidental prayer clauses have been added. In sum\n\nand substance, the relief claimed by the petitioner is that it should be declared\n\nthat the order of dismissal dated 09.06.2000 is without jurisdiction and non-\n\nest and to declare that his caste certificate dated 30.05.1996 is valid and\n\nwithholding of his increment and other incidental benefits such as of time\n\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                         ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                             10                 943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nbound promotion etc. is illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">12.      In the reply affidavit, the respondent contends that, the petitioner was\n\nappointed as an Assistant Flight Pursuer against a vacancy reserved for\n\nScheduled Tribe candidates. The petitioner has produced caste certificate\n\nissued by the Tutor of Pathology Department of Osmania Medical College,\n\nHyderabad. Since the Employer had a doubt regarding the caste certificate\n\nproduced by the petitioner and also considering the various complaints\n\nregarding improper caste certificates submitted by the various employees, for\n\nobtaining benefit of reservation, the Air India Limited by letter dated 8\n\nAugust 1994, forwarded the caste certificate submitted by the petitioner for\n\nverification, to the competent authority at Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh for\n\nverification of social status of the petitioner. On scrutiny of the caste\n\ncertificate, it transpired that it was neither in prescribed format nor issued by\n\nthe competent authority. Therefore, in order to expedite the caste certificate\n\nverification process, the respondent authorities requested the petitioner to\n\nsubmit caste certificate in the prescribed format. In response to which they\n\nreceived the caste certificate dated 4 February 1990, issued by the Mandal\n\nOfficer, Pargi.

In this writ petition the grievance of the petitioner is regarding the cut\n\noff date prescribed for implementation of the pension scheme by the\n\nrespondent no. 1 only to the employees who retired after 01.04.1994. The\n\npetitioners are the employees of Air India Limited (&quot; AIL&quot;) who retired from\n\nservice prior to 01.04.1994. According to the petitioner, there is no logic for\n\nthe cut off date of 01.04.1994, for implementation of the pension scheme and\n\nthereby creating an artificial discrimination between two set of employees.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">15.      On 01.08.1953 the Parliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/979883/\" id=\"a_2\">Air Corporations Act, 1953</a>,\n\npursuant to which two corporations came into existence.

Simultaneously the Air India Corporation Employees Guild,\n\nchallenged the settlement before the National Industrial Tribunal. The\n\nNational Industrial Tribunal, approved the Memorandum of Settlement\n\ndated 02.02.1979, between the Air India Corporation Employees Union and\n\nthe management of Air India Corporation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">16.      According to the petitioners, the intention of the respondent no. 1 to\n\ncreate a pension scheme can be gathered from the fact that, it had earmarked a\n\nsum of Rs. 5.12 Crores for that purpose as early as in the year 1979, which\n\ncontinued up to 1997-98. After making an initial provision, it was not\n\nsupported by investing further amount. Had there been an investment of the\n\namount so earmarked, it would have fetched at least Rs. 20-25 crores\n\nincluding interest thereon, when such scheme came to be introduced\n\nsubsequently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">17.      In the year 1998-99 the fund which was separately kept aside was\n\ntransferred back to the profit and loss account.

In the interregnum, during the pendency of the Writ Petition No. 3316\n\nof 1988. The respondent management entered into an agreement in 1996,\n\nwith Air India Employees Guild, making contributory pension scheme\n\napplicable to those employees who retired after 01.04.1994. According to the\n\npetitioner, in view of the fact that Writ Petition No. 3316 of 1988, was still\n\npending before this Court, the Air India could not have entered into the\n\nagreement with Air India Employees Guild. The respondents ought not to\n\nhave entered into an agreement relating to pension scheme with any union,\n\nwhen one of the union had already filed a writ petition which was pending\n\nconsideration before this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">19.      As a result of the agreement between the Air India Limited and the Air\n\nIndia Employees Guild, artificial discrimination is created between the\n\nindividuals belonging to the same group. As a result of agreement entered by\n\nthe Air India Limited, the Writ Petition No. 3316 of 1988, was dismissed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">20.      The petitioners who retired before 1st April 1994 are excluded from\n\nthe scheme, thus, by providing a cut off date without any logic has amounted\n\nto creating an artificial discrimination between the employees who were\n\nretired before 1st April 1994 and those who retired after 1st April 1994.\n\nConsidering the service rendered by them in the Air India Limited from the\n\ndays of its infancy, the pension scheme ought to have been made applicable to\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                  ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                              15                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nthe petitioners as well.

There cannot be two methods of computing pension for retired\n\nemployees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">21.      The respondent no. 1 has filed affidavit opposing the petition.\n\nAccording to the respondent, there is no discrimination whatsoever against\n\nthe employees who retired prior to 1994. According to the respondent, it is a\n\nself-contributory pension scheme established, controlled and funded entirely\n\nby the employees themselves and the said Trust is neither a &quot;State&quot; nor does it\n\nfall within the definition of &#x27;any other authorities&#x27;, within the meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India. It is categorically stated that the Air\n\nIndia Limited neither funded any pension scheme, nor it has any control over\n\nthe internal management and affairs of the &#x27;Air India Employees contributory\n\nSuperannuation Pension Scheme&#x27;. It is a scheme completely guided and\n\ncontrolled by provision of trust deed. At the most they have contributed\n\nmaximum of Rs. 100 per year for all the employees taken together. However,\n\nit is admitted that, in the interest of the employees themselves, the power to\n\nreview and vary the scheme was reserved by the employer, i.e., Air India\n\nLimited, upon recognition of the union. The respondent no. 1 as an employer\n\nhas participated in assisting its employees to establish the said pension\n\nscheme, which was done in accordance with the Memorandum of\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                                16                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nUnderstanding with the recognized Union. Mere participation and settling of\n\nthe scheme, does not change the nature of scheme, nor does it make amenable\n\nto the writ jurisdiction of this Court. The scheme was approved by the Central\n\nGovernment in April 1994, followed by clearance from the Ministry of Civil\n\nAviation dated 30 March 1995, with a rider that the scheme was totally self-\n\ncontributory and Air India would not contribute anything in excess of Rs.\n\n100 per annum for its all the employees. There is no contribution from the\n\nAir India Limited, as the scheme is self-contributory, hence no discrimination\n\ncan be attributed to the respondent no. 1. On this background the respondent\n\nhas opposed the writ petition and prayed that the writ petition deserves to be\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                         &quot;WRIT PETITION NO. 809 of 2002\n\n                          Mrs. Shobha Girish Bagwe vs. M/s.

The respondent no. 2 who belongs to Scheduled\n\nTribe category joined service on 06.09.1979 and was promoted as a senior\n\nclerk subject to his seniority on 01.01.1987. He was promoted to the post of\n\nOffice Assistant from 01.01.1990, in accordance with the time bound\n\npromotion policy adopted by the department. While doing so, he was\n\nadjusted against point no. 8 reserved for Scheduled Caste category, though,\n\nthere was backlog of one post for Scheduled Tribe. According to the rule of\n\nreservation interchangeability of vacancies between Scheduled Castes and\n\nScheduled Tribes is allowed to be carried forward, provided, it can be effected\n\nonly if it is applied in the third year of such promotion. Though, the\n\nrespondent no. 2 was at Serial No. 9 in the seniority list and not within the\n\nzone of consideration yet, he made representation to the respondent no. 2 for\n\npromotion. The general Manager (HRD) of respondent no. 1 has\n\ncategorically expressed his opinion that, his request cannot be considered,\n\nsince it was contrary to the rules. In spite of clear opinion given by the\n\nGeneral Manager, respondent no. 2 continued to represent respondent no. 1.\n\nAs a result, the committee was appointed by the respondent no. 1 under\n\nchairmanship of one Shri. Narayan Murthy, to look into the grievance of\n\nrespondent no. 2. The committee under the chairmanship of Shri. Narayan\n\nMurthy submitted report dated 01.02.1999.

The Managing Director of the respondent no. 1, acting contrary to\n\ntheir own rules and policies, granted his approval for promotion of\n\nrespondent no. 2. As a result of the retrospective promotion granted to\n\nrespondent no. 2, to the post of Office Assistant effective from 01.10.1983,\n\nand even subsequent promotion orders based on retrospective promotion\n\nwere issued and the respondent no. 2 was promoted to the post of Deputy\n\nManager with effect from 01.01.1999, illegally superseding seven officers, by\n\norder dated 06.08.2001.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">25.      It is the contention of the petitioner that, according to the rules of\n\nreservation applicable to the respondent no. 1, the carry forward point can be\n\nexchanged between Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe, only in third\n\npromotion year. As far as promotion in the category of Assistant Manager is\n\nconcerned one Mr. V.R. Shirke, a candidate from Scheduled Caste Category\n\nwas promoted at point no. 4, reserved for Scheduled Tribe category out of\n\nturn and adjusted against the backlog of Scheduled Caste at point no. 1.\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                  ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                            19                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nThus, Scheduled Tribe point was carried forward being a single vacancy. The\n\nyear 1990 was the first year of carry forward vacancy, one Mr. E. Coutinho\n\nwas promoted as roster point no. 5. In second year of carry forward, the\n\npetitioner was promoted against point no. 6. Since the exchange is permitted\n\nonly in the third year of promotion, adjusting respondent no. 2 against point\n\nno. 5 was illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">26.       Being aggrieved by the promotion of respondent no. 2 against the\n\nvacancy which was carried forward, to be filled by persons belonging to\n\nScheduled Tribe category, the petitioner and other officers made\n\nrepresentation, since it caused them grave prejudice. However, their\n\nrepresentations dated 31.10.2001, 18.01.2002 and 08.02.2002 did not receive\n\nany response. Only with a view to favour the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled\n\nTribe Association as well as the petitioner, the Secretary and Director for\n\nCorporate Affairs, recommended the promotion of respondent no. 2 with\n\neffect from 01.10.1983 as Assistant Manager, as Deputy Manager from 1 st May\n\n1996 and Manager with effect from 01.01.1999.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">27.

It would cause serious prejudice\n\nand hardship as well as monetary loss to the petitioner as well as the other\n\nofficers. On aforementioned background, the petitioner has assailed the\n\norders passed by respondent no. 1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">28.      The averments made in the writ petition have been controverted by\n\nrespondent no. 1, by filing a reply affidavit. It is the defence of the respondent\n\nthat, the writ petition is founded on disputed questions of fact and that the\n\nallegations made therein are baseless, since no promotions have yet been\n\neffected. Consequently, the writ petition being devoid of merits does not\n\ndeserve consideration. It is submitted that the proposed promotion contained\n\nin the communication dated 6 August 2001, has not been given effect to, till\n\nthe date of filing of affidavit. The comparative promotional chart of petitioner\n\nand respondent is produced on page no. 3 of the reply affidavit. According to\n\nthe respondent no. 1, though the respondent no. 2 joined in 1979, as\n\ncompared to petitioner who joined in the year 1980, his last promotion order\n\nto the post of Assistant Manager was issued in the year 1999, whereas\n\npetitioner was promoted to the post of Assistant Manager on 01.05.1991\n\nitself. It is demonstrated that, the case of the respondent no. 2, could not be\n\nconsidered for promotion on various occasions by adhering to the policy of\n\nreservation. It is the defence of the respondent no. 1 that, respondent no. 2 in\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                             21                943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nthe corporate seniority list was at serial no. 4 in his category. However, he was\n\nshown at serial no. 7, therefore he could not be considered for promotion on\n\nthe assumption that he did not fall within the zone of consideration. Hence,\n\nin order to rectify the error, respondent no. 2 was promoted to the post of\n\nOffice Assistant with effect from 01.10.1983. Accordingly, subsequent\n\npromotion orders were also issued, treating him as promoted to the post of\n\nOffice Assistant on 01.10.1983. His further career progression was thus\n\nconsidered admissible from the date of his promotion. The Liason officer of\n\nthe Association of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe, strongly\n\nrecommended retrospective promotion of respondent no. 2, without any\n\nmonetary benefit for the previous period i.e., only grant of notional benefits,\n\nwhich was accepted and matter was treated as closed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1929465\" id=\"span_19\">29.

Though the respondent no. 2 belongs to Scheduled Caste category,\n\ninterchangeability was permissible, since no other candidates belonging to the\n\nScheduled Tribe category was available within the zone of consideration, the\n\nrespondent no. 2 could have been selected in the year 1983 itself. Due to the\n\nfailure of the respondent no. 1 to promote three persons who were due for\n\npromotion in the year 1983 itself, the respondent no. 2 was continued to be\n\nshown at serial no. 8, and was ousted from the zone of consideration. No\n\nprejudice is caused to the petitioner, as a result of his promotion. As has been\n\ndemonstrated by the respondent no. 1 in his affidavit by relying on the\n\ncomparative chart of promotions of both the petitioner as well as respondent\n\nno.2.

B.V.\n\nNagarathna that, she agrees with reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by\n\nHis Lordship Justice V.

Particularly, while answering question no. 2, the majority view\n\nwas that the fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19</a> and 21of the Constitution of\n\nIndia can be enforced even against persons other than the &quot;State&quot; or its\n\ninstrumentalities. While expressing her views on the question no. 2, it is held\n\nby Justice. B.V. Nagarathna that, fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India cannot be enforced against private persons i.e.,\n\nthose who are not the &quot;State&quot; or its instrumentalities under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 12</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. However, a remedy in the form of writ of Habeas\n\nCorpus against private individuals would be maintainable, before a\n\nConstitutional Court i.e., by way of writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, before the High Court or under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 32</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court,\n\nonly when such relief is claimed on the basis of a violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. With regard to non-State entities those do not fall\n\nwithin the scope of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, it is held that a\n\nwrit petition for enforcement of fundamental rights would not be\n\nmaintainable against them. It is further observed that, such cases may involve\n\ndisputed questions of fact, which may impact the maintainability of writ\n\npetitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">39.      In the same table, question no. 3 formulated is whether the &quot;State&quot; is\n\n Mayur\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">      ::: Uploaded on - 26/08/2025                  ::: Downloaded on - 26/08/2025 21:22:16 :::</span>\n                                              29                 943-WP-1876-2001.doc\n\n\nunder a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India, even against threat to the liberty posed by actions\n\nor initiatives of another citizen or private agency. The majority view on this\n\nquestion is that the &quot;State&quot; does indeed has a duty to affirmatively protect a\n\nperson&#x27;s rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a>, whenever there is a threat to personal liberty,\n\neven if such a threat arises from a private actor. According to the views\n\nexpressed by Justice Nagarathna, failure by the State to carry out its\n\nconstitutional and statutory duties to protect the rights of a citizen could\n\nresult in the deprivation of that citizen&#x27;s right to life and personal liberty.\n\nWhen a citizen is so deprived of his right to life or personal liberty, the &quot;State&quot;\n\nwould have breached the negative duty cast upon it under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. Hence the State has an affirmative duty to carry out\n\nobligations cast upon it under the constitutional and statutory law. Such\n\nobligations require the State to intervene, when acts committed by private\n\nparties may threaten the life or liberty of another individual.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"134673895\" id=\"span_36\">40.

Accordingly, we do not propose to uphold the\n           decision of the High Court because, it seems to us that it is wrong in\n           principle and cannot be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions.\n           A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in\n           ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a\n           statute.

Here again\n         the English courts and jurists have carved out an exception to the rule\n         of precedents.

The law relating to mandamus has made the most\n              spectacular advance. It may be recalled that the remedy by\n              prerogative writs in England started with very limited scope and\n              suffered from many procedural disadvantages. To overcome the\n              difficulties, Lord Gardiner (the Lord Chancellor) in pursuance\n              of section 3(1)(e) of the Law Commission Act, 1965, requested\n              the Law Commission &quot;to review the existing remedies for the\n              judicial control of administrative acts and omissions with a view\n              to evolving a simpler and more effective procedure&quot;. The Law\n              Commission made their report in March, 1976 (Law\n              Commission Report No. 73). It was implemented by Rules of\n              Court (Order 53) in 1977 and given statutory force in 1981 by\n              section 31 of the Supreme Court Act, 1981. It combined all the\n              former remedies into one proceeding called Judicial Review.\n              Lord Denning explains the scope of this &quot;judicial review&quot; :\n              &quot;At one stroke the Courts could grant whatever relief was\n              appropriate. Not only certiorari and mandamus, but also\n              declaration and injunction. Even damages. The procedure was\n              much more simple and expeditious. Just a summons instead of a\n              writ. No formal pleadings. The evidence was given by affidavit.\n              As a rule no cross-examination, no discovery, and so forth. But\n              there were important safeguards. In particular, in order to\n              qualify, the applicant had to get the leave of a judge. The statute\n              is phrased in flexible terms. It gives scope for development. It\n              uses the words &quot;having regard to&quot;. Those words are very\n              indefinite. The result is that the Courts are not bound hand and\n              foot by the previous law. They are to &quot;have regard to&quot; it. So the\n              previous law as to who are -- and who are not -- public\n              authorities, is not absolutely binding. Nor is the previous law as\n              to the matters in respect of which relief may be granted. This\n              means that the judges can develop the public law as they think\n              best. That they have done and are doing.&quot; (See the Closing\n              Chapter by Rt. Hon. Lord Denning, p. 122]\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              17. There, however, the prerogative writ of mandamus is\n              confined only to public authorities to compel performance of\n              public duty. The &quot;public authority&quot; for them means everybody\n              which is created by statute -- and whose powers and duties are\n              defined by statute. So government departments, local\n              authorities, police authorities, and statutory undertakings and\n              corporations, are all &quot;public authorities&quot;.

There is no constitutional or statutory prescription in the\n        matter, and the point is governed entirely by the practice in India of the\n        Courts sanctified by repeated affirmation over a century of time. It\n        cannot be doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in\n        the law <a href=\"/doc/751831/\" id=\"a_116\">laid down by</a> a superior Court, the ideal condition would be that\n        the entire court should sit in all cases to decide questions of law, and for\n        that reason the Supreme Court of the United States does so.\n        But having regard to the volume of work demanding the attention of the\n        Court, it has been found necessary in India as a general rule of practice\n        and convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each Division\n        being constituted of Judges whose number may be determined by the\n        exigencies of judicial need, by the nature of the case including any\n        statutory mandate relative thereto, and by such other considerations\n        which the Chief Justice, in whom such authority devolves by\n        convention,may find most appropriate. It is in order to&#x27; guard against\n        the possibility of inconsistent decisions on points of law by different\n        Division Benches that the rule has been evolved, in order to promote\n        consistency and certainty in the development of the law and its\n        contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a Division Bench\n        is considered binding on a Division Bench of the same or lesser number\n        of Judges.

The relevant paragraphs of the\n\njudgment are reproduced hereunder, which read thus :-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">          7. Applying the above test, the respondent herein cannot be called a\n          public body. It has no duty towards the public. It&#x27;s duty is towards its\n          account holders, which may include the borrowers having availed of the\n          loan facility. It has no power to take any action, or pass any order\n          affecting the rights of the members of the public. The binding nature of\n          its orders and actions is confined to its account holders and borrowers\n          and to its employees. Its functions are also not akin to Governmental\n          functions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">          8. A body, public or private, should not be categorized as\n          &quot;amenable&quot; or &quot;not amenable&quot; to writ jurisdiction. The most important\n          and vital consideration should be the &quot;function&quot; test as regards the\n          maintainability of a writ application.

We may sum up thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">        (1) For issuing writ against a legal entity, it would have to be an\n        instrumentality or agency of a State or should have been entrusted with\n        such functions as are Governmental or closely associated therewith by\n        being of public importance or being fundamental to the life of the\n        people and hence Governmental.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">        (2) A writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India may\n        be maintainable against (i) the State Government; (ii) Authority: (iii) a\n        statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a\n        company which is financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body\n        run substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging\n        public duty or positive obligation of public nature; and (viii) a person or\n        a body under liability to discharge any function under any Statute, to\n        compel       it   to     perform      such     a    statutory     function.\n        (3) Although a non-banking finance company like the Muthoot\n        Finance Ltd, with which we are concerned is duty bound to follow and\n        abide by the guidelines provided by the Reserve Bank of India for\n        smooth conduct of its affairs in carrying on its business, yet those are of\n        regulatory measures to keep a check and provide guideline and not a\n        participatory dominance or control over the affairs of the company.\n        (4) A private company carrying on banking business as a Scheduled\n        bank cannot be termed as a company carrying on any public function or\n        public duty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">        (5) Normally, mandamus is issued to a public body or authority to\n        compel it to perform some public duty cast upon it by some statute or\n        statutorv rule. In exceptional cases a writ of mandamus or a writ in the\n        nature of mandamus may issue to a private body, but only where a\n        public duty is cast upon such private body by a statute or statutory rule\n        and only to compel such body to perform its public duty.\n        (6) Merely because a statue or a rule having the force of a statute\n        requires a company or some other body to do a particular thing, it does\n        not possess the attribute of a statutory body.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">        (7) If a private body is discharging a public function and the denial of\n        any rights is in connection with the public duty imposed on such body,\n        the public law remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on the public\n        body may be either statutory or otherwise and the source of such power\n        is immaterial but, nevertheless, there must be the public law element in\n        such action.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">        (8) According to Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, 3rd Ed.

On perusal of the findings recorded by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court,\n\napplying the functionality test, we do not find that the respondent -AIL, is\n\ndischarging any public function. Its status is that of a private company,\n\nestablished with sole commercial object of making profit. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/134673895/\" id=\"a_145\">R.S. Maddireddy</a> (supra) has taken a view that,\n\ndue to change in the status of AIL, after its privatization it is a private entity,\n\nand not performing any public functions, therefore it would not be amenable\n\nto writ jurisdiction, and no writ can be issued against it. The judgment in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/132336158/\" id=\"a_146\">Kaushal Kishore</a> (supra) was pointed out by both the parties before the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and the expression &quot;for any other purpose&quot; has been\n\ndealt with in paragraph no. 21, as under:-</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">          &quot;21.

Hence following the same view, we hold that all the three writ\n\npetitions, although maintainable on the dates on which they were instituted,\n\nhave ceased to be maintainable, due to privatization of AIL, which is not\n\ndischarging any public duty. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, the writ\n\npetitions along with pending Interim Applications, if any, stand disposed of\n\nwith liberty to the petitioner to avail remedy in accordance with law.
