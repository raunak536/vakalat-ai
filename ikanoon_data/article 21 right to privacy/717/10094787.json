It   cannot   be   lost   sight   of   in   this   case   that   the   relation \n\n between   the   person   seeking   information   of   the   lady,   who   is \n\n employed in a private company, is that of a husband and wife. \n\n On   account   of   a   marital   discord,   the   wife   has   dragged   the \n\n husband   before   the   District   Court.   For   the   purposes   of   his \n\n litigation, the husband requires the information about the salary \n\n and provident fund accumulations of the wife.  Such information \n\n could also be acquired by the husband by making an application \n\n before the District Court.  Rather than perpetuating the hardships \n\n of the husband, the CIC has found it fit to direct the petitioner to \n\n disclose the said information.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\"> 19.      In this backdrop, it is imperative that the petitioner must \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">::: Uploaded on - 12/09/2017                                   ::: Downloaded on - 14/09/2017 01:03:57 :::</span>\n                                                                       WP/10690/2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                            9</span>\n\n first come to a conclusion, either under sub-clauses (e) or (j) of \n\n <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8(1)</a> that the information is confidential and cannot be \n\n disclosed.   It is only when the competent authority justifies the \n\n non-disclosure under the first part of sub-clauses (e) or (j) that \n\n that the second  part in the said  sub-clauses would have to be \n\n considered to the extent of whether the information is required \n\n to   be   disclosed   in   larger   public   interest.     In   my   view,   the \n\n petitioner   has   failed   in   the   first   place   to   justify   it&#x27;s   refusal   to \n\n disclose   the   information.     The   husband   seeking   information \n\n cannot be said to be a stranger or a third party. The information \n\n sought by him also cannot be said to be confidential. \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"> 20.      In my view, if matrimonial matters are being prosecuted \n\n by the parties, there should not be any embargo on divulging the \n\n PF accumulations of the wife since the said information is sought \n\n by   the  husband   to   be  placed   before  the  District  Court.  It  also \n\n cannot be ignored that the wife is not before this Court and has \n\n not challenged the impugned order. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\"> 21.
