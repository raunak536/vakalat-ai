The Petitioner was a member of the National Technical\n\nAdvisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and was advising\n\nthe Government of India on vaccines.            He has filed this Writ\n\nPetition in public interest seeking the following reliefs:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     “(a) Direct the respondents to release the entire\n     segregated trial data for each of the phases of trials\n     that have been undertaken with respect to the vaccines\n     being administered in India; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (b) Direct the respondent No 2 to disclose the detailed\n     minutes    of   the   meetings      of   the    Subject   Expert\n     Committee and the NTGAI with regard to the vaccines\n     as   directed   by    the    59th    Parliamentary    Standing\n     Committee Report and the members who constituted\n\n\n\n                                                                        1 | Page\n\f     the committee for the purpose of each approval\n     meeting; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (c) Direct the respondent No.2 to disclose the reasoned\n     decision of the DCGI granting approval or rejecting an\n     application for emergency use authorization of vaccines\n     and the documents and reports submitted to the DCGI\n     in support of such application; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (d)     Direct   the   respondents   to   disclose   the   post\n     vaccination data regarding adverse events, vaccinees\n     who got infected with Covid, those who needed\n     hospitalization and those who died after such infection\n     post vaccination and direct the respondents to widely\n     publicize the data collection of such adverse event\n     through the advertisement of toll free telephone\n     numbers where such complaints can be registered; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (e) Declare that vaccine mandates, in any manner\n     whatsoever, even by way of making it a precondition for\n     accessing any benefits or services, is a violation of\n     rights of citizens and unconstitutional; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     (f) Pass any other orders as this Hon&#x27;ble Court deems\n     fit.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">2.

Notice was issued in the Writ Petition on 09.08.2021. An\n\nadditional affidavit was filed by the Petitioner on 03.09.2021\n\nraising additional grounds. It was averred in the additional\n\naffidavit that natural immunity is long-lasting and robust in\n\ncomparison to vaccine immunity and that vaccines do not\n\nprevent infection or transmission of COVID-19. The Petitioner\n\nfurther stated that vaccines are not effective in preventing\n\nagainst infection from new variants of COVID-19.              The\n\nPetitioner relied on news articles on the fourth nationwide\n\nserological survey conducted by Indian Council of Medical\n\nResearch (ICMR) in June and July, 2021, according to which\n\nup to two-thirds of the Indian population above the age of 6\n\nyears had already been infected with COVID-19 and had\n\nantibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.        The Petitioner\n\nrelied     upon other    news   articles   and   research studies\n\nconducted to state that there had been breakthrough\n\ninfections even amongst vaccinated people.            Urging that\n\n\n\n                                                              3 | Page\n\fresearch has shown that vaccinated people also transmit the\n\nvirus, the Petitioner contended that vaccine mandates are\n\nmeaningless.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.   The Petitioner filed an Interlocutory Application seeking\n\na direction to restrain all authorities and institutions, public\n\nand private, from mandating the vaccine in any manner\n\nwhatsoever, on a precondition of accessing any service or on\n\npain of any penalty. The Petitioner has drawn the attention\n\nof this Court to various restrictions that were placed by State\n\nGovernments, other employers and educational institutions\n\non unvaccinated individuals. The Petitioner contended that\n\nmandating vaccination for access to resources, public places\n\nand means of earning livelihood would be in violation of their\n\nfundamental rights, especially so, when scientific studies\n\nhave shown that unvaccinated persons do not pose more\n\ndanger of transmission of the virus when compared to\n\nvaccinated persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.   Respondent No. 1, the Union of India, has raised a\n\npreliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the\n\nWrit Petition.   The Union of India has further contended that\n\nthe serious threat posed by the unprecedented pandemic\n\nwhich had devastating effects on the entire world called for\n\nemergency measures.          It is accepted world over that\n\n\n\n\n                                                            4 | Page\n\fvaccination for COVID-19 is necessary to avoid infection.\n\nIndia was one of the few countries in the world which\n\nsucceeded in manufacturing vaccines for protection from\n\nCOVID-19, one of which was COVAXIN, India’s indigenous\n\nvaccine and the other being COVISHIELD, which was\n\nmanufactured by Serum Institute of India with technology\n\ntransfer from AstraZeneca / Oxford University. The country\n\nstarted one of the largest inoculation programmes in the\n\nworld in larger public interest, while tackling challenges of\n\nvaccine hesitancy, effect of the second wave of the\n\npandemic and other such adverse circumstances. The Union\n\nof India expressed serious doubts about the intention of the\n\nPetitioner in filing this Writ Petition. As we have not seen the\n\nend of the pandemic caused due to the COVID-19 virus, any\n\ninterference with the steps taken by the Union on the basis of\n\nthe advice given by the NTAGI and other expert bodies would\n\nprovide impetus to the already prevailing vaccine hesitancy\n\nin certain sections of the society. In their counter-affidavit,\n\nthe Union of India reminded us that decisions of domain\n\nexperts should not normally be interfered with in judicial\n\nreview and that this Court should not sit in appeal over a\n\nscientific process undertaken by domain experts on a subject\n\nwhich is not the expertise of any judicial forum. The long-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">                                                            5 | Page\n\fdrawn procedure for making applications for issuance of\n\nlicenses for manufacturing vaccines and the statutory regime\n\ngoverning the same have been referred to in the counter-\n\naffidavit to emphasize that the Union of India has not been\n\nremiss in grant of emergency licences. There is a detailed\n\nprocedure for approval with checks at every stage which has\n\nbeen followed for grant of emergency approval.             In so far as\n\ndisclosure of clinical trial data is concerned, the Union of\n\nIndia    referred   to    the   National    Ethical    Guidelines   for\n\nBiomedical       and      Health     Research      involving   Human\n\nParticipants published by the ICMR, which require privacy\n\nand confidentiality of human participants to be maintained.\n\nAccordingly, the Union of India contended that such details\n\npertaining to identity and records of the participants in the\n\nclinical trial data cannot be disclosed to the public as per the\n\nprevailing statutory regime. It was asserted by the Union of\n\nIndia that the remaining data has already been made\n\navailable in the public domain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.      On the subject of monitoring of AEFIs, the Union of India\n\nbrought     to   our     attention   established      procedures    and\n\nprotocols in place for surveillance of AEFIs established under\n\nthe     National    Adverse        Event   Following     Immunisation\n\nSurveillance Guideline.            Further, the multi-tier structure\n\n\n                                                                    6 | Page\n\fcomprising AEFI Committees at the state and national levels,\n\nproviding guidance, carrying out investigation and causality\n\nassessment was elaborated upon.         Details of the procedures\n\nfollowed in accordance with globally accepted practices were\n\nhighlighted in the counter-affidavit.    According to the Union\n\nof India, all cases of serious and severe AEFI, including\n\nreported deaths, are subjected to scientific and technical\n\nreview process with causality assessments done at the state\n\nand national levels by trained experts to ascertain whether a\n\nparticular AEFI can be attributed to the vaccine.          In the\n\ncounter-affidavit, it was also made clear that COVID-19\n\nvaccination is voluntary and that the Government of India\n\nencourages all individuals to take vaccination in the interest\n\nof public health, as the individual’s ill health has a direct\n\neffect on the society. It was also made clear that COVID-19\n\nvaccination is not linked to any benefits or services.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.   Counter-affidavits    have     been      filed   by    other\n\nRespondents as well.       The vaccine manufacturers, i.e.,\n\nRespondents Nos. 4 and 5, have brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt that approval to their vaccines was granted after strict\n\ncompliance of the procedure prescribed. The States of Tamil\n\nNadu, Maharashtra, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have also\n\nfiled counter-affidavits, justifying the restrictions that were\n\n\n\n                                                              7 | Page\n\fplaced on unvaccinated persons in public interest.

Maintainability\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">9.    The learned Solicitor General raised a preliminary\n\nobjection as to the maintainability of the Writ Petition which\n\nis filed in public interest. He stated that this Writ Petition, if\n\nentertained, would harm public interest, as any observation\n\nmade by this Court against vaccination would result in\n\npotential threat of vaccine hesitancy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">10.     The Petitioner is a paediatrician, who was a member\n\nof the NTAGI earlier.   It has been stated in the Writ Petition\n\nthat he has a number of publications in internationally peer-\n\nreviewed medical journals to his credit.          The Petitioner\n\n\n                                                              8 | Page\n\fstrongly believes that there cannot be coercive vaccination,\n\nespecially of inadequately tested vaccines, which amounts to\n\nan intrusion into the individual’s personal autonomy. He is\n\nalso of the firm opinion that an individual is deprived of the\n\nopportunity to give informed consent in the absence of\n\navailability of segregated data of clinical trials of the\n\nvaccines. He has also aired further grievances pertaining to\n\npoor evaluation and reporting of AEFIs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">11. This Court is entitled to entertain a public interest\n\nlitigation moved by a person having knowledge in the\n\nsubject-matter of the lis and, thus, having an interest therein,\n\nas contradistinguished from a busybody, in the welfare of\n\npeople1.       The     Union    of    India   has     objected     to   the\n\nmaintainability of the Writ Petition on the ground that the\n\nquestions raised by the Petitioner may result in raising\n\ndoubts in the minds of the citizenry about the vaccination,\n\nadding to the already existing vaccine hesitancy in the\n\ncountry.    The consequence would be a debilitating effect on\n\npublic health and therefore, the petition cannot be said to be\n\nin public interest.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1916813\" id=\"span_1\">In other words, the maintainability of the\n\nWrit Petition is raised on the ground that the sensitive issue\n\nof vaccination should not be dealt with by this Court, as it\n\n\n1 <a href=\"/doc/1916813/\" id=\"a_2\">Indian Banks’ Association, Bombay v. Devkala Consultancy Service</a> (2004) 11 SCC 1\n\n\n\n                                                                        9 | Page\n\fhas the propensity of fuelling doubts about the efficacy of the\n\nvaccines.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">12. From the rejoinder affidavit submitted by the Petitioner,\n\nwe note that a petition had been filed by the Petitioner\n\nearlier, during his tenure as a member of the NTAGI, with\n\nrespect to the Rotavac vaccine claiming that adequate data\n\nfrom the clinical trials had not been provided to the NTAGI.\n\nThe rejoinder affidavit further states that the petition was\n\ndismissed by this Court, on the ground that the Petitioner\n\ncould not have filed the said petition while being a member\n\nof   the   NTAGI.    The   enthusiasm    of   the    Petitioner   in\n\napproaching this Court has not gone unobserved.          However,\n\nas the issues raised by the Petitioner have a bearing on\n\npublic health and pertain to the fundamental rights of the\n\ncountry’s populace, we are of the opinion that they warrant\n\ndue consideration by this Court.        Therefore, we are not\n\ninclined to entertain the challenge mounted by the Union of\n\nIndia to the maintainability of the Writ Petition.\nII.

Yet another ground taken by the Union of India is that\n\nthis Court has to yield to executive decision and action in the\n\nmatter of administration of drugs / vaccines. The existence\n\n\n\n\n                                                              10 | P a g e\n\fof any other possible view cannot enable this Court to\n\ninterfere in matters relating to opinion of domain experts by\n\nsitting in appeal over such decisions, while adjudicating a\n\nwrit petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. The\n\nlearned Solicitor General supported the stand of the Union of\n\nIndia with reference to the law <a href=\"/doc/1916813/\" id=\"a_4\">laid down by</a> this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/665756/\" id=\"a_5\">Academy of Nutrition Improvement v.

Union of India</a> 4.</span></span></span>          Further, the\n\nlearned Solicitor General relied upon the judgments of the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States (hereinafter, the “US\n\nSupreme          Court”)   in   Henning      Jacobson      v.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">Commonwealth of Massachusetts5, Zucht v.

Hazzard 7 to bolster his\n\nsubmissions that courts should not lightly interfere with\n\nmatters of policy concerning the safety and health of the\n\npeople and it is not the court’s function to determine the\n\n2   (2011) 8 SCC 274\n3   (2013) 6 SCC 620\n4   (1990) 3 SCC 223\n5   197 US 11 (1905)\n6   260 US 174 (1922)\n7   [2021] NSWSC 1320\n\n\n\n                                                        11 | P a g e\n\fmerits of the exercise of power by the executive.            The\n\nlearned Solicitor General was joined by Mr. Amit Anand\n\nTiwari, learned Additional Advocate General for the State of\n\nTamil Nadu, in emphasising the limited scope of judicial\n\nreview in matters of policy framed on the basis of expert\n\nopinion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">14. In opposition, the Petitioner argued that matters of\n\npublic importance involving invasion of fundamental rights of\n\nindividuals cannot be brushed aside by this Court on the\n\nground that they are beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nThis Court has a duty to safeguard the fundamental rights of\n\nindividuals   and   issues   raised   herein   are   of   seminal\n\nimportance which ought to be decided after assessing the\n\nrelevant material placed before this Court by both sides. Mr.\n\nBhushan referred to the judgement of the High Court of New\n\nZealand in Ryan Yardley v. Minister for Workplace\n\nRelations and Safety8 in support of his submission that the\n\nscientific data and evidence that was produced before the\n\nHigh Court of New Zealand was assessed to adjudge the\n\nefficacy of vaccines in preventing transmission of the COVID-\n\n19 virus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n\n8 [2022] NZHC 291\n\n\n\n                                                             12 | P a g e\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1014138\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1921640\" id=\"span_6\">15. It was further argued by Mr. Bhushan that the\n\njudgments relied upon by the Union of India are not\n\napplicable to the facts of this case.     He relied upon the\n\njudgments of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1921640/\" id=\"a_8\">Delhi Development Authority\n\nv. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats</a> 9,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1014138/\" id=\"a_9\">Directorate of Film Festivals v.

Before examining the parameters of judicial review in\n\nthis case, it is profitable to refer to judgments from beyond\n\nour borders which have dealt with the scope of judicial\n\nreview in matters relating to public health and vaccinations,\n\nin particular. Compulsory vaccination against small pox was\n\nthe subject-matter of Jacobson (supra) decided in 1905. The\n\nUS Supreme Court was of the opinion that the mandate of\n\nthe local government for compulsory vaccination was binding\n\non every individual. The safety and health of the people has\n\nto be protected by the government and the judiciary is not\n\n\n9 (2008) 2 SCC 672\n10 (2007) 4 SCC 737\n11 (2021) 7 SCC 772\n\n\n\n                                                          13 | P a g e\n\fcompetent to interfere with decisions taken in the interest of\n\npublic health.       The Court can interfere by way of judicial\n\nreview of legislative action in matters of public health only\n\nwhen there is no real or substantial relation to the object of\n\nthe legislation or when there is plain, palpable invasion of\n\nrights secured by fundamental law and thereby, give effect\n\nto the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">17. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on\n\nattendance at religious services in areas classified as ‘red’ or\n\n‘orange’ zones were imposed by an executive order issued\n\nby the Governor of New York.         The said restrictions were\n\nchallenged on the ground that they violate the free exercise\n\nclause of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States. By a majority of 6:3, the US Supreme Court in\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo12 granted injunctive\n\nrelief on being satisfied that the executive order struck at the\n\nvery heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious\n\nliberty.   While doing so, the US Supreme Court observed that\n\nthe members of the Court are not public health experts and\n\nthey should respect the judgment of those with special\n\nexpertise and responsibility in this area.       However, the\n\nConstitution cannot be put away and forgotten even in a\n\n12 141 S. Ct. 63 (2020)\n\n\n\n                                                           14 | P a g e\n\fpandemic.       Gorsuch, J., who wrote a concurring opinion,\n\nobserved that Jacobson (supra) hardly supports cutting the\n\nConstitution loose during a pandemic.        Jacobson (supra)\n\nwas distinguished by Gorsuch, J., who held that the Court did\n\nnot interfere with the challenged law in Jacobson (supra)\n\nonly because it did not “ contravene the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States” or “infringe any right granted or secured by ”\n\nit. A word of caution sounded by Gorsuch, J. is to the effect\n\nthat the Court cannot stay out of the way in times of crisis,\n\nwhen the Constitution is under attack.         In his dissent,\n\nRoberts, C.J. held that the injunction sought would not be in\n\npublic interest, especially when it concerns public health and\n\nsafety needs which calls for swift government action in\n\neverchanging circumstances.      He relied upon the earlier\n\norder passed by the US Supreme Court in South Bay\n\nUnited Pentecostal Church v. Newsom 13 wherein it was\n\nrecognised that courts must grant elected representatives\n\nbroad discretion when they undertake to act in areas fraught\n\nwith medical and scientific uncertainties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">18.

The said rule was challenged and the US District\n\nCourts for the Western District of Louisiana and the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Missouri each entered preliminary injunctions\n\nagainst its enforcement. The appeals filed against the said\n\ninjunction were rejected by the Fifth Circuit in Louisiana and\n\nthe Eighth Circuit in Missouri.        Aggrieved thereby, the\n\nGovernment moved the US Supreme Court seeking for a stay\n\non the preliminary injunctions passed by the US District\n\nCourts.   While granting stay of the preliminary injunctions,\n\nby its plural opinion the US Supreme Court held that the role\n\nof courts in reviewing decisions taken by the executive\n\nshould be to ensure that the executive “ has acted within a\n\nzone of reasonableness”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">19. Having been aggrieved by certain orders of the Minister\n\nfor Health and Medical Research that required people\n\nworking in the construction, aged care and education sectors\n\nto be compulsorily vaccinated, Al-Munir Kassam and three\n\nothers,   along     with   Natasha   Henry   and   five   others,\n\napproached    the     NSW    Supreme   Court   challenging    the\n\n\n\n\n                                                             16 | P a g e\n\fconstitutional validity of the decision. While considering the\n\ngrounds of challenge, the NSW Supreme Court in Kassam v.\n\nHazzard (supra) was of the view that “it is not the Court’s\n\nfunction to determine the merits of the exercise of the power\n\nby the Minister to make the impugned orders, much less for\n\nthe court to choose between plausible responses to the risks\n\nto the public health posed by the Delta variant ”. The NSW\n\nSupreme Court further observed that it is not the court’s\n\nfunction to conclusively determine the effectiveness of some\n\nof   the    alleged     treatments   for   those   infected     or    the\n\neffectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, especially their capacity\n\nto inhibit the spread of the disease, which are all matters of\n\nmerits, policy and fact for the decision maker and not the\n\ncourt.     The NSW Supreme Court emphasised that its only\n\nfunction is to determine the legal validity of the impugned\n\norders.

Three police and defence force workers\n\nwho did not wish to be vaccinated sought judicial review of\n\nthe said order before the High Court of New Zealand\n\n(hereinafter, the “NZ High Court”).         While adjudicating the\n\ndispute, the NZ High Court in Ryan Yardley (supra)\n\nexpressed its opinion that the choices made by governments\n\non their response to COVID-19 involve wide policy questions,\n\nincluding decisions on the use of border closures, lockdowns,\n\nisolation requirements, vaccine mandates and many other\n\nmeasures,      which     are    decisions     for   the   elected\n\nrepresentatives to make.       The NZ High Court made it clear\n\nthat the Court addresses narrower legal questions and the\n\nCourt’s function is not to address the wider policy questions.\n\nWhile referring to the evidence of experts, the NZ High Court\n\nstressed on the institutional limitations on the Court’s ability\n\nto reach definitive conclusions but clarified that the Court\n\nmust exercise its constitutional responsibility to ensure that\n\ndecisions are made lawfully.

We shall now proceed to analyse the precedents of this\n\nCourt on the ambit of judicial review of public policies\n\nrelating to health.        It is well settled that the Courts, in\n\nexercise of their power of judicial review, do not ordinarily\n\ninterfere with the policy decisions of the executive unless the\n\npolicy    can     be     faulted     on    grounds       of    mala     fide,\n\nunreasonableness, arbitrariness or unfairness etc. Indeed,\n\narbitrariness, irrationality, perversity and mala fide will\n\nrender the policy unconstitutional16.            It is neither within the\n\ndomain of the courts nor the scope of judicial review to\n\nembark upon an enquiry as to whether a particular public\n\npolicy is wise or whether better public policy can be evolved.\n\nNor are the courts inclined to strike down a policy at the\n\nbehest of a petitioner merely because it has been urged that\n\na different policy would have been fairer or wiser or more\n\nscientific or more logical17.

The scope of judicial review when\n\nexamining a policy of the Government is to check whether it\n\nviolates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed\n\nto the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any\n\nstatutory provision or manifestly arbitrary 18.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665756\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1014138\" id=\"span_10\">22. This Court in a series of decisions has reiterated that\n\ncourts should not rush in where even scientists and medical\n\nexperts are careful to tread.           The rule of prudence is that\n\ncourts will be reluctant to interfere with policy decisions\n\ntaken by the Government, in matters of public health, after\n\ncollecting and analysing inputs from surveys and research.\n\nNor will courts attempt to substitute their own views as to\n\nwhat is wise, safe, prudent or proper, in relation to technical\n\nissues relating to public health in preference to those\n\nformulated by persons said to possess technical expertise\n\nand rich experience19.

While doing so, this\n\nCourt held that policy-making continues to be the sole\n\ndomain of the executive and the judiciary does not possess\n\nthe authority or competence to assume the role of the\n\nexecutive.    It was made clear that the Court cannot second\n\nguess the wisdom of the executive when it chooses between\n\ntwo competing and efficacious policy measures. However, it\n\ncontinues to exercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen\n\npolicy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness,\n\nmilitates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right\n\nto life of all persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">25. There can be no ambiguity in the principles of law\n\nrelating to judicial review laid down by this Court.

Studies also indicate that vaccines do not prevent\n\ninfection from the virus or transmission amongst people.\n\nVaccines are also ineffective in preventing infection from new\n\nvariants. According to serological studies, 75 per cent of the\n\nIndian     population   has     already   been   infected   and    is\n\nseropositive and, therefore, they have better immunity to\n\ninfection than what is provided by the vaccines.                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235821\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_16\">The\n\nvaccines which are being administered in this country are\n\nonly authorised for emergency use and the procedure for\n\nclinical trials of such vaccines has not been fully complied\n\nwith.

As the threat\n\nof infections from the virus loomed large, an unprecedented\n\nnational lockdown was announced on 24.03.2020, which\n\nextended for a few months, with restrictions being removed\n\nthereafter in a phased manner.     India was not alone in this;\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">                                                            36 | P a g e\n\fseveral countries imposed lockdowns to arrest the spread of\n\nthe deadly disease, which has led to a drastic loss of human\n\nlife worldwide and presented a threat of extraordinary\n\nproportions to public health, food systems, economic and\n\nsocial conditions.        Scientific studies and research for\n\nmanufacture of vaccines to prevent severe infections were\n\nundertaken on an emergency basis.          Towards the end of\n\n2020, emergency vaccines came to be administered in the\n\nwestern part of the world. However, by then, the spread of\n\nCOVID-19 around the globe was considerable.        Around the\n\nsame period, a variant called B.1.1.7 was found in the United\n\nKingdom. The said variant was renamed as Alpha, as per the\n\nnaming    scheme     recommended      by   the   expert   group\n\nconvened by the WHO, which also includes scientists from\n\nthe WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-\n\nVE).   Another variant, called B.1.351 and later renamed as\n\nBeta, was found to be linked to a second wave of infections\n\nin South Africa.     Both these variants were identified as\n\nVariants of Concern (VOC) by the WHO on 18.12.2020,\n\nmeaning that they were variants with genetic changes that\n\nwould affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility,\n\ndisease   severity   or   immune    escape   and   through    a\n\ncomparative assessment, are found to be associated with an\n\n\n                                                           37 | P a g e\n\fincrease of transmission or increase in virulence or decrease\n\nin effectiveness of public health measures such as vaccines,\n\ntherapeutics etc.        Soon thereafter, the highly transmissible\n\nvariant called Gamma was found in Brazil and was identified\n\nas a VOC by the WHO on 11.01.2021.28\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">36.

Another variant, Omicron, surfaced in November,\n\n2021, whose spread was much more accelerated than earlier\n\nvariants, including that of Delta.                 On the basis of the\n\nevidence available as on 21.01.2022, the WHO was of the\n\nopinion that the Omicron has a significant growth advantage\n\nover Delta, leading to rapid spread in the community with\n\nhigher levels of incidence than previously seen in the\n\npandemic. It was further observed that despite a lower risk\n\nof severe disease and death following infection, the very high\n\nlevels    of   transmission        nevertheless       have      resulted     in\n\nsignificant increases in hospitalisation and continue to pose\n\noverwhelming demands on health care systems in most\n\n28 Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants, World Health Organization, available at\nhttps://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/ (last accessed on\n01.05.2022)\n\n\n\n                                                                          38 | P a g e\n\fcountries.

Strong reliance was placed by the Petitioner on the\n\njudgment of the High Court of New Zealand in Ryan Yardley\n\n(supra).     The principal contention of the applicants therein\n\nwas that the impugned order, requiring police and defence\n\nforce     personnel    to   be   vaccinated,     placed   unjustified\n\nlimitation on the rights protected by the New Zealand Bill of\n\nRights Act 1990 (hereinafter, the “NZ Bill of Rights”),\n\nparticularly the right to refuse to undergo medical treatment,\n\nthe right to manifest religion, the right to be free from\n\ndiscrimination and other rights under <a href=\"/doc/141249/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 28</a> of the said\n\nAct (including the right to work, and of minority groups to\n\nenjoy their culture and practice their religion).

Considering the submissions of the applicants therein\n\nthat the order placed unjustified limitations on fundamental\n\nrights protected by the NZ Bill of Rights, the NZ High Court\n\nheld that the impugned order limits the right of affected\n\nworkers to refuse to undergo a medical treatment as well as\n\nthe right (or significant interest) to retain employment. While\n\nexamining the question of whether the limitation of the said\n\nrights was justified, the NZ High Court noted that the order\n\nmandating vaccinations for the police and defence personnel\n\nwas imposed to ensure the continuity of services that are\n\nessential for public safety, national defence, or crisis\n\nresponse, and to promote public confidence in those\n\nservices, rather than to stop the spread of COVID-19.           The\n\nNZ High Court further took note of the fact that by October,\n\n2021, 83.1 per cent of police personnel had received at least\n\none or more doses of the vaccination, and 70.1 per cent had\n\nreceived both doses.     By the time the order took effect on\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                                                                47 | P a g e\n\f17.01.2022,      there   were   only     164    unvaccinated    staff\n\nmembers in an overall workforce of 15,682 staff.               It was\n\nfound that the position within the New Zealand Defence\n\nForces (NZDF) was similar.        From a total of 15,480 NZDF\n\npersonnel, 3,048 are civil staff.      As on 01.02.2022, 99.2 per\n\ncent of the regular forces were fully vaccinated, leaving aside\n\n75 members and 98.7 per cent of the civil staff were fully\n\nvaccinated, leaving 40 who were not.            The NZ High Court\n\nwas   of   the   view    that   the    relatively   low   number   of\n\nunvaccinated police and NZDF personnel impacted by the\n\norder may not, by itself, mean that the order was not a\n\nreasonable limit on rights that can be demonstrably justified,\n\nif there was evidence to establish that the presence of\n\nunvaccinated personnel, even in small numbers, created a\n\nmaterially higher risk to the remaining workforce.             While\n\nobserving that the evidence on this issue is sparse, the NZ\n\nHigh Court referred to the evidence of Dr. Petrovsky, who\n\ndeposed that vaccination has potential benefit in reducing\n\nthe severity of disease, even with the Omicron variant.\n\nHowever, in his view, mandatory vaccination did not assist in\n\npreventing workers in affected roles from contracting COVID-\n\n19, or transmitting it to others.       The NZ High Court further\n\nconsidered the evidence of Dr. Town, the Ministry’s Chief\n\n\n                                                                 48 | P a g e\n\fScience Adviser, who, according to the NZ High Court, did not\n\ndirectly    respond    to   Dr.     Petrovsky’s    analysis   of    the\n\neffectiveness of the vaccine to inhibit the spread of COVID-19\n\nin a workforce, but instead provided his more generalised\n\nopinions.     In his evidence, Dr. Town stated that vaccines\n\nshow reduced effectiveness compared with Delta in terms of\n\nbecoming infected with and transmitting Omicron.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">46. After weighing the evidence, the NZ High Court was of\n\nthe view that vaccination may still be effective in limiting\n\ninfection and transmission, but at a significantly lower level\n\nthan was the case with the earlier variants.           It was further\n\nconcluded     that    vaccination    does   not     prevent   persons\n\ncontracting and spreading COVID-19, particularly with the\n\nOmicron variant.       The NZ High Court referred to an earlier\n\njudgment in Four Aviation Security Service Employees\n\nv.   Minister     of    COVID-19        Response 38,     where      the\n\nprecautionary principle had been applied, to make the point\n\nthat even a modest vaccination protection on a modest\n\nnumber of personnel needs to be considered in the context\n\nof potential effects of a pandemic.               The NZ High Court\n\nreferred to a judgment of the Federal Court of Ontario in\n\n\n\n38 [2021] NZHC 3012\n\n\n\n                                                                   49 | P a g e\n\fSpencer v. Attorney General of Canada 39 to elaborate on\n\nthe precautionary principle, as “a foundational approach to\n\ndecision-making under uncertainty, that points to the\n\nimportance of acting on the best available information to\n\nprotect the health of” the citizens.       In Four Aviation\n\nSecurity Service Employees (supra), which dealt with\n\nrestrictions placed on aviation security workers, the NZ High\n\nCourt held that even though the applicants therein were not\n\nbeing forcibly treated, they were required to be vaccinated\n\nas a condition of their employment, refusal of which led to\n\ntermination.       Observing that a right does not need to be\n\ntaken away in its entirety before it is regarded as having\n\nbeen limited, the NZ High Court opined that the level of\n\npressure in that case was significant and amounted to\n\ncoercion, and therefore, the applicants’ right to refuse to\n\nundergo medical treatment was limited.      However, the said\n\nlimitation was held to be justified.      From the evidence\n\nadduced before the NZ High Court, it concluded that the\n\nvaccine was effective at reducing the transmission of the\n\nearlier variants of the virus and that it was also effective at\n\nreducing symptomatic infection and detrimental effects of\n\nthe Delta variant.      As the applicants were border workers\n\n39 [2021] FC 361\n\n\n\n                                                          50 | P a g e\n\finteracting with international travellers who may be carrying\n\nthe virus and given the likelihood of vaccines contributing to\n\npreventing the risk of transmission, the NZ High Court held\n\nthat a precautionary approach, in doing everything that can\n\nbe reasonably done to minimise risk of the outbreak or\n\nspread in strong public interest, is justified.    Further, the\n\ncurtailment of the right to refuse to undergo medical\n\ntreatment was found to be proportionate to the objective, as\n\nthe applicants, who worked as aviation workers, were\n\nsituated in a key location where COVID-19 might enter New\n\nZealand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">47. In Ryan Yardley (supra), the NZ High Court held that\n\nthe   principle   in   Four    Aviation    Security   Service\n\nEmployees (supra) is not directly applicable as the order\n\nwas not promulgated to contain the spread of the virus but\n\nfor the purpose of ensuring continuity of, and confidence in,\n\nessential services.    Additionally, there was no evidence of a\n\nthreat to the continuity of the police and NZDF services,\n\nwhich would enable the NZ High Court to give the benefit of\n\nthe doubt to the New Zealand Crown in imposing measures\n\nto address that risk.       Placing reliance on the evidence\n\nadduced as well as the public health advice which was to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                          51 | P a g e\n\feffect that vaccine mandates were not considered necessary\n\nfor addressing the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-\n\n19, the High Court made it clear that while vaccination\n\nsignificantly improved the prospects of avoiding illness and\n\ndeath even with the Omicron variant, given the variant’s\n\npropensity    to     break    through    vaccination     barriers,    it\n\nconcluded that there was no real threat to the continuity of\n\nthese essential services that the impugned order sought to\n\naddress.           Further,   finding   that    suspension    of     the\n\nunvaccinated would address any potential problems, the\n\nterminations arising from the order in light of the temporary,\n\nalbeit significant, period of peak impact of the infection, were\n\nfound to be disproportionate and unjustified.              While the\n\nPetitioner   has    sought    support    from    this   judgment      to\n\ndemonstrate how courts in other jurisdictions have struck\n\ndown vaccine mandates taking into account Omicron’s\n\nimpact on the effectiveness of vaccines in addressing spread,\n\nwe believe that this judgment may not be of much assistance\n\nto us for determining the issue at hand for two reasons. First,\n\nthe judgment expressly recognised that the impugned\n\nvaccine mandate was not brought about to suppress the\n\nspread of the virus but to ensure continuity of, and\n\nconfidence in, essential services, such as the police and the\n\n\n                                                                   52 | P a g e\n\fdefence personnel, which we are not concerned with in the\n\npresent case.       Second, while the NZ High Court looked into\n\ndepositions    of       expert    witnesses    to   come    to   its   own\n\nconclusion on efficacy of vaccines vis-à-vis the Omicron\n\nvariant, the scope of our review does not entail assessment\n\nof competing scientific opinions, as the judiciary is not\n\nequipped      to    decide       issues   of   medical   expertise      and\n\nepidemiology.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_26\">48. The crucial point that requires to be considered by us is\n\nwhether limitations placed by the Government on personal\n\nautonomy of an individual can be justified in the interest of\n\npublic health in the wake of the devastating COVID-19\n\npandemic.          As    stated,    personal     autonomy    has       been\n\nrecognized as a critical facet of the right to life and right to\n\nself-determination under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, by\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_43\">Common Cause</a> (supra).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_27\">In <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_44\">K.S. Puttaswamy</a>\n\n(supra), this Court laid down three requirements to be\n\nfulfilled by the State while placing restraints on the right to\n\nprivacy to protect legitimate State interests. It was held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">     “310. … The first requirement that there must be a law\n     in existence to justify an encroachment on privacy is an\n     express requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21.</a> For, no person can be\n     deprived of his life or personal liberty except in\n     accordance with the procedure established by law. The\n\n\n\n                                                                       53 | P a g e\n\f     existence of law is an essential requirement. Second, the\n     requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate State\n     aim, ensures that the nature and content of the law\n     which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of\n     reasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 14</a>, which is a\n     guarantee against arbitrary State action. The pursuit of a\n     legitimate State aim ensures that the law does not suffer\n     from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate,\n     involves a value judgment. Judicial review does not\n     reappreciate or second guess the value judgment of the\n     legislature but is for deciding whether the aim which is\n     sought to be pursued suffers from palpable or manifest\n     arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the\n     means which are adopted by the legislature are\n     proportional to the object and needs sought to be\n     fulfilled by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of\n     the guarantee against arbitrary State action because it\n     ensures that the nature and quality of the encroachment\n     on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the\n     law. Hence, the threefold requirement for a valid law\n     arises out of the mutual interdependence between the\n     fundamental guarantees against arbitrariness on the one\n     hand and the protection of life and personal liberty, on\n     the other. The right to privacy, which is an intrinsic part\n     of the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms\n     embodied in Part III is subject to the same restraints\n     which apply to those freedoms.”\n\nWhile the judgment is in context of the right to privacy, the\n\nanalysis with respect to the threefold requirement for\n\ncurtailment of such right is on the anvil of the protection\n\nguaranteed to fundamental freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a>, and\n\n\n                                                                 <a href=\"/doc/887242/\" id=\"a_48\">54 |</a> P a g e\n\ftherefore, would also be the litmus test for invasion of an\n\nindividual’s bodily autonomy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">49.

The submission made on behalf of the Petitioner is that\n\nthe Delta and Omicron variants have shown breakthrough\n\ninfections and it is clear from the scientific data that, an\n\nunvaccinated person does not pose a greater risk than a\n\nvaccinated person in terms of transmission of the infection.\n\nWhile this submission has been dealt with subsequently, we\n\nbelieve that as long as there is a risk of spreading the\n\ndisease, there can be restrictions placed on individuals’\n\nrights in larger public interest.      Further, extensive material\n\nfrom experts has been placed before this Court, which extol\n\nthe benefits of vaccination in tackling the severe and life-\n\nthreatening impact of the infection, specifically in terms of\n\nreduction     in   oxygen   requirement,     hospitalisation,    ICU\n\nadmissions         and    mortality,     thereby    easing       the\n\ndisproportionate burden from the upsurge of severe cases on\n\nthe health infrastructure, which has already been witnessed\n\nby the country during the second wave of the pandemic\n\nwhere resources were woefully inadequate to stem the\n\nimpact of the Delta variant on a then scarcely vaccinated\n\npopulation.        We hasten to add that restrictions that are\n\n\n\n                                                                56 | P a g e\n\fplaced by the Government should not be unreasonable and\n\nare open to scrutiny by constitutional courts. It is difficult for\n\nus to envisage the myriad situations in dealing with the\n\nevolving pandemic that may call for restraint on individual\n\nrights in larger public interest and therefore, as and when\n\nsuch limitations are challenged, they can be assessed by\n\nconstitutional courts to see whether they meet the threefold\n\nrequirement <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_51\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_52\">K.S.

Surely, the Union of India is justified in centering its\n\nvaccination policy around the health of the population at\n\nlarge, with emphasis on insulating the weaker and more\n\nvulnerable sections from the risk of severe infection and its\n\nconsequences, as opposed to basing its decision keeping in\n\nmind the interests of a healthy few.

We now come to the crux of the challenge against\n\ncoercive vaccine mandates, with respect to which the\n\nPetitioner has argued that they amount to restrictions on the\n\nfundamental rights of unvaccinated individuals and cannot\n\nbe said to be proportionate, as according to the Petitioner,\n\nwith the prevalence of the Omicron variant, unvaccinated\n\npeople pose no greater danger to the transmission of the\n\nvirus in comparison to vaccinated persons.          It was claimed\n\nby the Petitioner that even if the vaccines reduced the\n\nseverity of the disease, it was up to the individual to decide\n\nwhether they wanted to be the beneficiary of vaccines.          The\n\nState’s lookout was the protection of larger public health and\n\nwith both the vaccinated and unvaccinated posing nearly\n\nequal risks in transmission of the infection to others around\n\nthem, the State cannot impose restrictions targeting only the\n\nunvaccinated and impeding their right to access public\n\nresources.     The Petitioner has thus, alleged discrimination\n\nagainst the unvaccinated, who in the present situation, are\n\nplaced more or less on the same footing as vaccinated\n\nindividuals with respect to the transmission of the virus. In\n\n\n\n                                                                64 | P a g e\n\fsupport of his submissions, the Petitioner has relied on\n\nscientific studies and reports, some of which are listed below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(a) A letter published in the Lancet, Regional Health45, which\n\n     states: “In the UK it was described that secondary attack\n\n     rates among household contacts exposed to fully\n\n     vaccinated      index     cases     was    similar    to    household\n\n     contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (25% for\n\n     vaccinated vs 23% for unvaccinated). 12 of 31 infections\n\n     in fully vaccinated household contacts (39%) arose from\n\n     fully vaccinated epidemiologically linked index cases.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">     Peak viral load did not differ by vaccination status or\n\n     variant type….The US Centres for Disease Control and\n\n     Prevention (CDC) identifies four of the top five counties\n\n     with    the    highest      percentage       of   fully    vaccinated\n\n     population       (99.9–84.3%)         as     “high”       transmission\n\n     counties.

No doubt that when COVID-19 vaccines\n\ncame into the picture, they were expected to address, and\n\nwere indeed found to be successful in dealing with, the risk\n\nof infection from the variants in circulation at the time.\n\nHowever, with the virus mutating, we have seen more potent\n\nvariants surface which have broken through the vaccination\n\nbarrier to some extent.

Given the rapidly-\n\nchanging nature of the virus and the clear purpose served by\n\nthe approved vaccines in terms of restoration and protection\n\nof public health, our suggestions with respect to review of\n\nvaccine mandates are limited to the present situation alone.\n\nThis judgment is not to be construed as impeding, in any\n\nmanner, the lawful exercise of power by the executive to\n\ntake suitable measures for prevention of infection and\n\ntransmission of the virus in public interest, which may also\n\ntake the form of restrictions on unvaccinated people in the\n\n\n\n                                                               70 | P a g e\n\ffuture, if the situation so warrants.

It is the complaint of the Petitioner that the COVID-19\n\nvaccines, manufactured by Respondent Nos. 4 and 5, have\n\nbeen given restricted emergency approval by the Drugs\n\nController General of India (DCGI) in a hurried and opaque\n\nmanner. Mr. Bhushan argued that clinical trials in respect of\n\nthe vaccines had not been completed and at present, the\n\nvaccines are only authorised for emergency use. According\n\nto the Petitioner, while clinical trials are scheduled to be\n\ncompleted in the year 2023, even the full dataset from the\n\ninterim analysis conducted has not been made public.         The\n\ndisclosure of segregated data of clinical trials is essential to\n\ndetermine the adverse effects, if any, across various age\n\ngroups and diverse populations and accordingly, enable\n\nindividuals to make more informed decisions on whether to\n\nbe vaccinated.

The\n\nfurther grievance of the Petitioner pertained to lack of\n\ntransparency in regulatory approvals, minutes of meetings\n\nand constitution of expert bodies.    The Petitioner has sought\n\nfor clear detailing of the information furnished before, and\n\nevidence relied on by, the expert bodies such as the NTAGI\n\n\n                                                             72 | P a g e\n\fand the Subject Expert Committee (SEC), the body which\n\nsends recommendations to the Central Drugs Standard\n\nControl Organisation, while deliberating on the applications\n\nand data of the vaccine manufacturers, and the names and\n\ninstitutional relationships of the experts who participated in\n\neach of these meetings.

In response, the Union of India submitted that the\n\nprocedure   prescribed   under     the   statutory   regime   was\n\nscrupulously followed before granting emergency approval of\n\nthe vaccines manufactured by Respondent Nos. 4 and 5.           As\n\nper the extant statutory regime, permission to import or\n\nmanufacture new drugs including vaccines or to undertake\n\nclinical trials is granted by the Central Drugs Standard\n\nControl Organisation (CDSCO).       The CDSCO, in consultation\n\nwith the SEC, evaluates the applications for grant of such\n\npermission, which are to be accompanied with data as\n\nrequired under the Second Schedule to the New Drugs and\n\nClinical Trials Rules, 2019 (hereinafter, the “2019 Rules”)\n\nframed under the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_62\">Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940</a>.

According to the Union of\n\nIndia, the SEC looks into the details of trials and results\n\npresented before it and examines them, interacts with the\n\ndevelopers of the vaccines and gives them appropriate\n\ndirections and eventually makes recommendations in writing,\n\nby way of a resolution, reflecting the collective opinion of all\n\nthe domain experts.     We were informed that the trials have\n\nbeen registered on the database of the Clinical Trials Registry\n\n– India, which is hosted at the ICMR’s National Institute of\n\nMedical Statistics. The provisions in relation to ‘Accelerated\n\nApproval Process’ under the Second Schedule to the 2019\n\nRules were pointed out to this Court, which stipulate that\n\n“accelerated approval process may be allowed to a new drug\n\nfor a disease or condition taking into account its severity,\n\nrarity, or prevalence and the availability or lack of alternative\n\ntreatments, provided that there is a prima facie case of the\n\nproduct being of meaningful therapeutic benefit over the\n\nexisting treatment”.   It is further stated that “ After granting\n\naccelerated approval for such drug, the post marketing trials\n\nshall be required to validate the anticipated clinical benefit .”\n\nIt   was   submitted   that   applying   these   provisions     on\n\n\n                                                              74 | P a g e\n\fAccelerated    Approval Process,       the    CDSCO,     in   detailed\n\nconsultation with the SEC and after examining the efficacy of\n\nthe vaccine and its effects, granted permission for restricted\n\nemergency       use    of    COVAXIN        and   COVISHIELD,      as\n\nmanufactured by Respondent Nos. 4 and 5, respectively.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">64. As regards COVAXIN (Whole Virion Inactivated Corona\n\nVirus Vaccine), the Union of India stated that application for\n\npermission to manufacture the vaccine was made by Bharat\n\nBiotech on 23.04.2020.       The CDSCO, in consultation with the\n\nSEC, granted permission to Bharat Biotech for conducting\n\nPhase I/II clinical trials on 29.06.2020 and Phase III clinical\n\ntrials on 23.10.2020.       Respondent No. 4 submitted interim\n\nsafety and immunogenicity data of Phase I and Phase II\n\nclinical trials carried out in the country, along with safety\n\ndata, including Serious Adverse Events data, of the ongoing\n\nPhase III clinical trial in the country.     The data provided by\n\nRespondent No.4 from the various phases were evaluated\n\nand analysed by the SEC, which consisted of eminent experts\n\nfrom   the    fields   of   microbiology,    medicine,    pulmonary\n\nmedicine, paediatrics and immunology and immunogenetics.\n\nThe resolutions of the various meetings of the SEC, which\n\nalso required the presence of the developer / manufacturer\n\nwith the necessary information, have been put up on the\n\n\n\n                                                                 75 | P a g e\n\fwebsite of the MoHFW at every stage.

Approval\n\nfor restricted use in emergency situation in clinical trial mode\n\nwith various conditions / restrictions was granted by the\n\nCDSCO to Respondent No. 4 to manufacture COVAXIN on\n\n03.01.2021.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">65. Thereafter, Respondent No. 4 submitted the interim\n\nsafety and efficacy data of Phase III clinical trial, which was\n\nreviewed by the SEC in meetings held periodically.        In its\n\nmeeting conducted on 10.03.2021, the SEC, after detailed\n\ndeliberation on the updated interim safety and efficacy data\n\nof the phase III clinical trial, recommended omission of the\n\ncondition of the use of the vaccine in clinical trial mode.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">                                                           76 | P a g e\n\fHowever, it was recommended that the vaccine be continued\n\nto be used under restricted use in emergency situation\n\ncondition.        Following expansion of the Government’s\n\nvaccination drive to include individuals in the age group of\n\n18-45 years, in its meeting held on 23.04.2021, the SEC\n\nconsidered Bharat Biotech’s proposal to unblind the trial\n\nparticipants in the said age group.                  After detailed\n\ndeliberations, the SEC recommended the unblinding of the\n\nparticipants in the said age group, upon the request of the\n\nparticipants or the principal investigator after completion of\n\ntwo months from the second dose.                     Eventually, on\n\nconsideration of relevant data of Phase I and Phase II clinical\n\ntrials along with safety data of 6 months’ Phase III clinical\n\ntrial, including data of serious adverse events till the date,\n\nthe SEC in its meeting dated 19.01.2022 noted that there\n\nhad been no safety issues and the vaccine maintained its\n\nefficacy,    specially   to    avoid   hospitalisation   and   severe\n\ninfections in the existing situation as well.       Accordingly, the\n\nSEC recommended that the status of approval of COVAXIN\n\nfrom the restricted use in emergency situation to the New\n\nDrug permission be updated, along with the condition that\n\nthe firm shall continue to submit data of ongoing clinical trial\n\nand monitor AEFIs.            The Union of India pointed out that\n\n\n                                                                 77 | P a g e\n\fPhase I and Phase II clinical trial reports were published in\n\nthe Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal, which was publicly\n\navailable.

COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Corona Virus Vaccine\n\n(Recombinant)) manufactured by Respondent No. 5 was\n\ndeveloped by the Serum Institute of India in collaboration\n\nwith Oxford University and AstraZeneca under technology\n\ntransfer.   As the clinical development of the said vaccine,\n\nincluding Phase I clinical trial, was conducted in other\n\ncountries, Phase II / III clinical trials were conducted by\n\nRespondent No. 5 in the country.       Application for permission\n\nto manufacture COVISHIELD for test, examination and\n\nanalysis was first made by Respondent No. 5 on 03.05.2020.\n\nThe safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of Phase II / III\n\nclinical trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine carried out in the\n\nUnited Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa were submitted to\n\nthe SEC, along with the safety and immunogenicity data from\n\nthe ongoing Phase II / III clinical trials in India.   On reviewing\n\nthis data as well as the approval dated 30.12.2020 granted\n\nby the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products\n\n\n                                                               78 | P a g e\n\fRegulatory Authority (hereinafter, the “UK-MHRA”) for the\n\nAstraZeneca vaccine along with its conditions / restrictions,\n\nthe SEC, in its meeting dated 01.01.2021, noted that the\n\nsafety and immunogenicity data from the Indian study was\n\ncomparable with that of the overseas clinical trial data.\n\nAfter detailed deliberation and taking into account the\n\nemerging    situation,   the   SEC   recommended      grant   of\n\npermission for restricted emergency use of the vaccine,\n\nsubject to various regulatory provisions and conditions,\n\nincluding requirement to submit relevant data from the\n\nongoing clinical trials nationally and internationally at its\n\nearliest.   Eventually, in its meeting dated 19.01.2022, the\n\nSEC considered the request of Respondent No. 5 to grant\n\npermission to manufacture the vaccine, excluding the\n\nconditions for restricted use in emergency situation and\n\nother conditions, on the lines of Marketing Authorisation by\n\nthe UK-MHRA for the parent vaccine.

We were directed to Rule 25 of the 2019 Rules, framed\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_63\">Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940</a>, which provides\n\nthat the clinical trial shall be conducted in accordance with\n\napproved clinical trial protocol and other related documents\n\nas per the requirements of Good Clinical Practices (GCP)\n\nguidelines and the other rules. The expert committee set up\n\nby the CDSCO under Rule 25(vi) in consultation with clinical\n\nexperts formulated the GCP guidelines for generation of data\n\non drugs.   The ‘Ethical Principles’, which are part of the said\n\nguidelines, protect principles of privacy and confidentiality of\n\nhuman subjects of research.      The learned Solicitor General\n\nalso relied upon para 2.4.4 of the GCP guidelines, which\n\nrequire safeguarding of the confidentiality of research data\n\nthat might lead to identification of individual subjects.     He\n\nfurther referred to the important role played by the Ethics\n\nCommittee under Rule 11 of the 2019 Rules, which includes\n\nsafeguarding the rights, safety and well-being of trial\n\nsubjects in accordance with the said rules.     The 2019 Rules\n\nalso empower the Ethics Committee to discontinue or\n\nsuspend the clinical trial in case it concludes that the trial is\n\nlikely to compromise the right, safety or well-being of the\n\ntrial subject.   As per the ICMR’s National Ethical Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n                                                            80 | P a g e\n\ffor   Biomedical   and   Health   Research    involving   Human\n\nParticipants, the four basic ethical principles for conducting\n\nbiomedical and health research are (i) respect for persons\n\n(autonomy), (ii) beneficence, (iii) non-malfeasance and (iv)\n\njustice. These four basic principles have been expanded into\n\n12 general principles, including the ‘principle of ensuring\n\nprivacy and confidentiality’ which requires maintaining the\n\nprivacy of potential participants, her / his identity and\n\nrecords, with access given to only those authorised.           As\n\nregards transparency of functioning of expert bodies, it was\n\nsubmitted by the Union of India that recommendations of the\n\nSEC in all its meetings are uploaded on the website of the\n\nCDSCO.       Additionally, the detailed minutes of NTAGI\n\nmeetings were already available in public domain, which can\n\nbe downloaded from both the ICMR and the MoHFW websites.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_102\">68. The contention of Respondent No. 4 is that COVAXIN\n\nhas undergone all clinical trials. In Phase III, trials revealed a\n\n77.8% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 disease. The\n\nfindings of the clinical trials have been published in reputed\n\npeer-reviewed journals and are readily available on the\n\nwebsite of Respondent No.4.         A reference was made by\n\nRespondent No. 4 to the WHO Statement on Clinical Trials, to\n\nsubmit that it is only the key outcomes and findings which\n\n\n\n                                                             81 | P a g e\n\fare required to be made publicly available.

On behalf of Respondent No. 5, it was submitted\n\nthat the clinical data generated during the trials had been\n\nsubmitted   to   the     regulatory   authorities   for   obtaining\n\npermissions / licences etc. Further, the peer-reviewed study\n\nof the partial clinical data of Phase II / III trials had already\n\nbeen published in reputed scientific journals, which included\n\nall the information necessary for safeguarding the public as\n\nwell as informing them of the credibility and efficacy of the\n\nvaccine. According to Respondent No. 5, the raw data of the\n\nclinical trials served no greater public purpose than the data\n\nwhich was already available in the public domain.               All\n\napplicable medico-legal, scientific and ethical requirements\n\nhad been strictly adhered to by Respondent No. 5.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_103\">69. In rejoinder, the learned counsel for the Petitioner\n\nargued that there is no transparency in the process of\n\napprovals of vaccines and relevant data is not always placed\n\nbefore the NTAGI.      He referred to a news article in The Wire,\n\naccording to which Jayaprakash Muliyil, a member of the\n\nNTAGI had stated that the NTAGI had not recommended\n\n\n                                                              82 | P a g e\n\fvaccination of children in the age group of 12-14 years.         He\n\nalso drew the attention of this Court to non-supply of relevant\n\ndata to the NTAGI at the time of approval of the Rotavac\n\nvaccine against rotavirus. The Petitioner further complained\n\nof the haste shown in grant of emergency approval to\n\nRespondent No. 4.          The Petitioner has sought support of a\n\ndecision of the United States District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict of Texas dated 06.01.2022 in Public Health and\n\nMedical Professionals for Transparency v. Food and\n\nDrug Administration, which highlighted the need for\n\ntransparency in disclosure of clinical trial data.            It was\n\nreiterated by the Petitioner that privacy of individuals would\n\nnot be at risk as their personal identification data can be\n\nredacted before disclosing segregated data of clinical trials.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">70. It is settled law that courts cannot take judicial notice of\n\nfacts stated in a news item published in a newspaper.

We are also of the opinion that the evidence\n\nrelating to the approval process of the Rotavac vaccine has\n\nno relevance to the dispute in this case.      On the basis of the\n\nsaid   two   incidents,   it   cannot   be   concluded   that    the\n\nemergency use approval to COVISHIELD and COVAXIN\n\nrecommended by the SEC are not in accordance with the\n\nstatutory regime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\">71. At this stage, it is worthwhile to refer to the statutory\n\nregime in place.

The GCP guidelines are being scrupulously followed,\n\naccording to the Union of India.            The principles of “public\n\ndomain”      in    the   GCP   guidelines     provide   for   research,\n\nexperimentation or evaluation in response to the research to\n\nbe brought into the public domain. The results of the clinical\n\ntrials are generally to be made known through scientific and\n\nother publications. The requirement of publication, according\n\nto the WHO, also relates to the main findings of clinical trials\n\nto be published in a peer-reviewed journal and the key\n\noutcomes to be made publicly available, within 12 months of\n\nstudy completion. The Petitioner complains of opaqueness in\n\nclinical trials as the general public do not have access to, and\n\nthe opportunity to be aware of, all the necessary details by\n\nsegregated clinical trial data (primary datasets) not being\n\navailable.    There is no challenge by the Petitioner to the GCP\n\nguidelines.       As required by the WHO Statement on Clinical\n\nTrials and the GCP guidelines, findings of the clinical trials\n\nand the key outcomes of the trials have been published.              In\n\nlight of the existing statutory regime, we do not see it fit to\n\n\n\n                                                                  89 | P a g e\n\fmandate the disclosure of primary clinical trial data, when\n\nthe results and key findings of such clinical trials have\n\nalready been published.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">75. After examining the judgment of the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas (hereinafter,\n\nthe “US District Court”), we are afraid that the said\n\ndecision cannot be said to be relevant for adjudication of the\n\ndispute in the present case.    The grievance of the plaintiff in\n\nthe said case pertained to all data and information for the\n\nPfizer vaccine, enumerated under the relevant provisions of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_64\">Freedom of Information Act</a>, not being provided by the\n\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration. The US District\n\nCourt referred to the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_65\">Freedom of Information Act</a> to hold that\n\nthe citizenry has a right to be provided with the relevant\n\ninformation pertaining to the Pfizer vaccine and that such\n\n‘information is often useful only if it is timely’.      The US\n\nDistrict   Court   directed   expeditious   completion   of     the\n\nplaintiff’s request after concluding that the request under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_66\">Freedom of Information Act</a> was of paramount importance.\n\nWe note that with respect to COVAXIN and COVISHIELD,\n\nresults of clinical trials have been published in accordance\n\nwith our statutory regime in place. Reliance placed by the\n\nPetitioner   on    European    Medicines    Agency    policy     on\n\n\n\n                                                               90 | P a g e\n\fpublication of clinical data for medicinal products for human\n\nuse is also not relevant as the GCP guidelines relating to the\n\ndisclosure of clinical trial data, framed under the 2019 Rules,\n\ncurrently govern the field of disclosure of clinical trial data in\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">76. An analysis of the submissions made by the learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the parties and a close scrutiny of the\n\nmaterial placed on record would show that there is a strict\n\nstatutory regime in force for grant of approvals to vaccines.\n\nSpecialist bodies established under the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_67\">Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940</a> and the rules framed\n\nthereunder comprise of domain experts in the relevant field,\n\nwho conduct a thorough scrutiny of the material produced by\n\nthe manufacturers before granting approval. The information\n\nprovided on behalf of the Union of India substantiates that\n\nthe data provided by the vaccine manufacturers was\n\nconsidered by the SEC over a period of time and several\n\nconditions were imposed at the time of recommending\n\napprovals, which have been modified or lifted subsequently\n\non availability of further data arising from the clinical trials\n\nbefore the SEC, as can be seen from the minutes of the\n\nmeetings of the SEC, available on the website of the MoHFW.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">                                                             91 | P a g e\n\fWe do not agree with the submission on behalf of the\n\nPetitioner that emergency approvals to the vaccines were\n\ngiven in haste, without properly reviewing the data from\n\nclinical trials.     We are also of the opinion that the\n\nParliamentary Standing Committee report relied upon by Mr.\n\nBhushan is not relevant and the lapses pointed out therein\n\npertain to the year 2011, which have no obvious connection\n\nto the grant of approval to Respondent Nos. 4 and 5 for the\n\nrestricted emergency use of their respective vaccines.     As\n\nlong as the relevant information relating to the minutes of\n\nthe meetings of the regulatory bodies and the key outcomes\n\nand findings of the trials are available in public domain, the\n\nPetitioner cannot contend that every minute detail relating to\n\nclinical trials be placed in public domain to enable an\n\nindividual to take an informed, conscious decision to be\n\nvaccinated or not.    Given the widespread affliction caused\n\nby the virus, there was an imminent need of manufacturing\n\nvaccines which would keep the infection at bay. We would\n\nlike to highlight that both the vaccines have been approved\n\nby the WHO as well.     A perusal of the material placed on\n\nrecord would show that there is material compliance with the\n\nprocedure prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_68\">Drugs and Cosmetics Act,\n\n1940</a> and the 2019 Rules, before grant of approval for the\n\n\n                                                         92 | P a g e\n\femergency use of the two vaccines.             However, it is made\n\nclear that subject to the protection of privacy of individual\n\nsubjects and to the extent permissible by the 2019 Rules, the\n\nrelevant data which is required to be published under the\n\nstatutory regime and the WHO Statement on Clinical Trials\n\nshall be made available to the public without undue delay,\n\nwith respect to the ongoing post-marketing trials of COVAXIN\n\nand COVISHIELD as well as ongoing clinical trials or trials that\n\nmay be conducted subsequently for approval of other COVID-\n\n19 vaccines / vaccine candidates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">III. Improper collection and reporting of AEFIs\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">77. The contention of the Petitioner is that there have been\n\nseveral adverse effects from vaccines, including deaths.\n\nThe   Petitioner   has   sought   to   fault    the   Government’s\n\nmechanisms in place for handling of the adverse events.\n\nAccording to the Petitioner, during Phase III trials, where\n\nsmall controlled trials of a limited number of participants are\n\nconducted, a significant increase in adverse events may not\n\nbe seen.      But after licensure, when the vaccines are\n\nadministered to the masses, rare reactions show up, which is\n\nwhy Phase IV post-marketing trials are legally mandated.         It\n\nwas pointed out by the Petitioner that there has been a\n\n\n\n\n                                                              93 | P a g e\n\frevision of the rules by the WHO for classifying AEFIs in 2018.\n\nAs per the revised mechanism, only reactions that are\n\npreviously acknowledged to be caused by the vaccine are\n\nclassified as vaccine-related reactions.    Reactions observed\n\nduring post-marketing surveillance are not considered as\n\n‘consistent with causal association with vaccine’, if a\n\nsignificant increase in such reactions during Phase III trials\n\nhad not been recorded.       According to the Petitioner, this\n\nacquires significance in the context of trials conducted in this\n\ncountry, as the control trial in Phase III did not go on in the\n\nmanner intended, with several members of the original\n\ncontrol group prematurely unblinded and offered the vaccine.\n\nThe Petitioner contends that owing to ‘dilution of Phase III\n\ncontrol trials prematurely’, there are no controls to compare\n\nagainst, making it difficult to ascertain which adverse events\n\nare caused by the vaccine.      Therefore, reactions which are\n\nnot “known reactions” to the vaccine are not considered\n\nAEFIs.   In light of this, it is necessary for the authorities to\n\ncarefully monitor all vaccine recipients and publicly record all\n\nadverse events.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_117\">78. Taking this argument further, the Petitioner contended\n\nthat the adverse events reporting system in India is not\n\ntransparent, with obscure investigation and follow-up of\n\n\n\n                                                            94 | P a g e\n\fdeaths and other serious adverse events after COVID-19\n\nvaccination.     The Petitioner relied on a letter published in\n\nThe Hindu on 17.03.2021, written by a group of experts in\n\npublic health, ethics, medicine, law, and journalism to the\n\nMinister for Health &amp; Family Welfare and the DCGI, appealing\n\nfor “time-bound and transparent investigation” following\n\ndeaths   and      serious   adverse   effects    after    COVID-19\n\nvaccination.     A presentation made by the National AEFI\n\nCommittee in a meeting held on 31.03.2021 was referred to\n\nby the Petitioner to claim that complete documentation was\n\nnot available for all the severe and serious adverse events\n\n(including     deaths)   that   had   occurred    till   the   time.\n\nAdditionally, it was contended that no data pertaining to the\n\nAEFIs already classified nor any analysis of the same had\n\nbeen published publicly till date.     The Petitioner also drew\n\nthe attention of this Court to the Vaccine Adverse Event\n\nReporting System (VAERS) in place in the United States,\n\nwhich published all vaccine injury reports every Friday,\n\nreceived till about a week prior to the release date. It was\n\nbrought to the notice of this Court that 77,314 adverse\n\nevents have been reported in India as on 12.03.2022,\n\namounting to 0.004% of the total vaccination. The Petitioner\n\nhas pointed out that the percentage of adverse events\n\n\n                                                               95 | P a g e\n\freported in Europe is much larger than the percentage\n\nidentified in India, which would show that correct figures are\n\nnot being published by the Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">79. On behalf of the Union of India, the procedures and\n\nprotocols     for   monitoring    of     adverse     event   following\n\nimmunisation under the National Adverse Event Following\n\nImmunisation Surveillance Guideline were elaborated upon.\n\nThe      National   Adverse      Event    Following      Immunisation\n\nSurveillance Secretariat, established in the Immunisation\n\nTechnical Support Unit in 2012, had staff dedicated for\n\nmanaging        Adverse       Event      Following       Immunisation\n\nsurveillance system.       It was further strengthened by the\n\nNational Adverse Event Following Immunisation Surveillance\n\nTechnical Collaborating Centre, comprising of experts from\n\nLady Hardinge Medical College and Allied Hospitals in New\n\nDelhi.    Adverse Event Following Immunisation Committees\n\nwere formed at the national and state levels to provide\n\nguidance to the National AEFI Surveillance and carry out\n\ndocumentation,      investigation      and   causality    assessment,\n\nbesides training and orientation of health care workers and\n\nothers involved in AEFI. According to the Union of India, a\n\nfoolproof protocol for reporting and causality assessment for\n\nany AEFI with Universal Immunisation Program (UIP) and\n\n\n\n                                                                 96 | P a g e\n\fNon-UIP vaccines has been established.          The National AEFI\n\nCommittee gets periodical reports regarding ‘minor AEFIs’,\n\n‘severe AEFIs’ and ‘serious AEFIs’.         Online reporting of all\n\nserious and severe AEFIs at the district level to be\n\ncommunicated to relevant authorities at the state / national\n\nlevel is done on a web-based portal, SAFEVAC (Surveillance\n\nand Action for Events Following Vaccination).       All serious and\n\nsevere adverse events following vaccination even at district\n\nlevel are uploaded online on SAFEVAC.         It was submitted on\n\nbehalf of the Union of India that case details, scanned copies\n\nof reports are uploaded on SAFEVAC, which also has facilities\n\nfor generating dashboards and line-lists at different levels.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">80. Further, a similar feature of reporting of all AEFIs\n\n(including minor) by the vaccinator was made available on\n\nthe Co-WIN portal.         District Immunisation Officers (DIOs)\n\nwere given the facility to report AEFI cases about which they\n\nhave information from such individuals who do not have\n\naccess to Co-WIN.           Departmental orders and standard\n\noperating     procedures     have    been    issued     for   further\n\ninvestigations and sharing of hospital records by the DIOs\n\nthrough Co-WIN.       The Union of India has brought to the\n\nnotice   of   this   Court    that   an     alignment     with    the\n\nPharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) under Indian\n\n\n\n                                                                 97 | P a g e\n\fPharmacopoeia Commission has been developed for receipt\n\nof information regarding AEFI cases from around 300 Adverse\n\nDrug Reaction Monitoring Centers in medical colleges and\n\nlarge hospitals.      The Union of India has highlighted that\n\ninformation from the PvPI and the CDSCO are collated and\n\nstudied, in case of any new, previously unknown events\n\nidentified through AEFI surveillance.     A press release of the\n\nMoHFW dated 17.02.2017 titled ‘Maximum Possible Marks to\n\nIndian NRA in WHO Assessment’ has been placed before this\n\nCourt to state that the AEFI Surveillance System in India\n\n(which is in use for COVID-19 vaccination) has been approved\n\nby global experts in an assessment conducted by the WHO in\n\n2017.      Given the novel nature of the virus, membership of\n\nthe National AEFI Committee has been expanded to include\n\nneurologists, cardiologists, respiratory medicine specialists\n\nand medical specialists, with even States / Union Territories\n\nrequested to expand their AEFI Committees on a similar scale\n\nto strengthen AEFI surveillance for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nCausality assessment of AEFI cases is conducted at the state\n\nand the national levels by experts trained as per the\n\ncausality assessment checklist, based on the definition and\n\nalgorithm developed by the WHO. Once approved by experts\n\nof   the   National   AEFI   Committee,   results   of   causality\n\n\n                                                             98 | P a g e\n\fassessment of AEFI cases are made available in the public\n\ndomain and are shared with the CDSCO, amongst other\n\nauthorities, for appropriate regulatory action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">81. As regards the present status of AEFI surveillance for\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination, it was submitted that as the causality\n\nassessment of reported AEFI cases is a time-consuming\n\nprocess, a method of rapid review and assessment had been\n\ninitiated at the national level to quickly review available\n\ninformation in each case and look for trends in reporting of\n\nspecific events or unusual cases requiring further early\n\ninvestigation and assessment.       All cases of serious and\n\nsevere AEFIs, including reported deaths, are subjected to\n\nrapid reviews, analysis and causality assessment done by a\n\nteam of trained subject experts.     It was clarified that mere\n\nreporting of AEFI case should not be attributed to the vaccine\n\nunless proved by the causality assessment analysis.        The\n\nNational Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-\n\n19 (NEGVAC), an additional body of experts, is also involved\n\nin providing guidance on vaccine safety and surveillance,\n\nthus, aiding in the prompt identification of AEFIs for the\n\npurpose of identifying and understanding evolving trends in\n\nthe disease and taking prompt action.       2,116 serious and\n\nsevere AEFIs have been reported from 1,19,38,44,741 doses\n\n\n\n                                                          99 | P a g e\n\fof COVID-19 vaccine administered till 24.11.2021.         While a\n\nreport of rapid review and analysis completed for 495 cases\n\nhad been submitted, a further report of 1,356 serious and\n\nsevere AEFI cases had been presented to the NEGVAC and\n\nthe rapid review and analysis of balance cases was\n\nunderway.     Press releases around a report on bleeding and\n\nclotting    events   following   COVID-19   vaccination    being\n\nsubmitted to the MoHFW by the National AEFI Committee and\n\non clarification on deaths following vaccination and process\n\nof causality assessment were placed before this Court.\n\nTherefore, the Union of India submitted that there was\n\ncontinuous monitoring and examination of AEFI cases in India\n\nand there is no basis for the allegations around AEFIs not\n\nbeing properly collected and lack of transparency in their\n\ninvestigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">82. From the material placed before us, we note that the\n\nNational AEFI Surveillance Secretariat has been functioning\n\nfor 10 years and as has been pointed out, there is a well-\n\nestablished protocol in place for identification and monitoring\n\nof AEFIs.    The website of the MoHFW carries the results of\n\ncausality assessment of AEFI cases, from which the public\n\ncan obtain relevant information pertaining to AEFIs. We have\n\nbeen informed that a thorough causality assessment analysis\n\n\n\n                                                            100 | P a g e\n\fof AEFIs is carried out by experts and not every severe\n\ndisease   and   death     can   be   attributed     to    vaccination.\n\nReactions are examined by experts specifically trained to\n\nundertake causality analysis before notifying such reactions\n\nas adverse events arising from vaccination.         There is a well-\n\ndefined mechanism for collection of data relating to adverse\n\nevents that occur due to COVID-19 vaccines and the\n\nGovernment of India has taken steps to direct all concerned\n\nmedical professionals at the ground level to report adverse\n\nevents. Even medical practitioners at private hospitals are\n\nassociated with reporting of adverse events.             Therefore, we\n\nare not inclined to accept the broad-strokes challenge\n\nmounted by the Petitioner that the surveillance system of\n\nAEFIs in this country is faulty and the correct figures of those\n\nwho have suffered any side effects, severe reactions or\n\ndeaths post-inoculation have not been disclosed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">83. As    regards   the    contention    of   the    Petitioner    on\n\nabandoning of Phase III trials, we note that unblinding of\n\nparticipants during the Phase III trial was done on the\n\nrecommendation of the SEC.            The Union of India has\n\nemphasized that at every stage, the deliberations of domain\n\nexperts, which involved discussions with the manufacturers,\n\nfocused on safety and immunogenicity of the vaccines and it\n\n\n                                                                101 | P a g e\n\fwas only when there was consensus among domain experts\n\nthat it was safe to extend the immunisation drive beyond the\n\ncategory of ‘healthcare workers / frontline workers’, the\n\nappropriate decisions were taken. In doing so, the available\n\ntrial data, trajectory of the pandemic, evidence, future\n\ncontingencies and several other factors have always been\n\nheeded.     There is no challenge to the decision of the SEC, a\n\nbody of domain experts, as being unreasonable or arbitrary,\n\nnor have we been called upon to determine whether\n\nadequate time was devoted to recognise all relevant\n\nreactions    as   vaccine-related   reactions   prior     to   such\n\nunblinding. What the Petitioner seeks is the monitoring of all\n\nadverse     events   and   publication   of     the     results    of\n\ninvestigation. The Union of India has painstakingly taken this\n\nCourt through the details of the procedure followed to closely\n\nmonitor, review and escalate the incidence of AEFIs to\n\nappropriate authorities.    As regards previously unknown /\n\nunidentified reactions seen during the monitoring of AEFIs at\n\nthe time of vaccine administration, the Union of India has\n\nelaborated on the role of the PvPI and the CDSCO, which\n\ncollate and study such reactions. We believe this adequately\n\naddresses the Petitioner’s concerns, as this Court has been\n\ninformed that previously unidentified events are also being\n\n\n                                                               102 | P a g e\n\ftaken into consideration and investigated.       We trust the\n\nUnion of India to have the appropriate authorities ensure that\n\nthis leg of the AEFI surveillance system is not compromised\n\nwith while meeting the requirements of the rapid review and\n\nassessment system followed at the national level.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">84. The Petitioner had taken issue with the present system\n\nto the extent it allows only DIOs or the vaccinators to report\n\nAEFIs.     According to the Petitioner, the repository of AEFIs\n\nshould be as detailed as the VAERS in the United State of\n\nAmerica.     The Petitioner further submitted that individuals\n\nand doctors must be able to report adverse events, with the\n\nreporter being given a unique identification number and the\n\nreports being openly accessible.    The response of the Union\n\nof India on this issue is that the DIOs have been instructed to\n\nset up a network with private hospitals to report AEFIs.\n\nTraining has been provided to state officers, medical officers,\n\nprivate practitioners and frontline health workers on their\n\nrole in AEFI surveillance.     Even auxiliary nurse midwives\n\nhave been instructed to notify all AEFIs.   However, we are in\n\nagreement with the suggestion made by the Petitioner that\n\nthere should be a mechanism by which individuals and\n\nprivate doctors should be permitted to report suspected\n\n\n\n\n                                                         103 | P a g e\n\fadverse events.      Information relating to adverse effects\n\nfollowing   immunisation   is    crucial   for   the   purpose   of\n\nunderstanding the safety of the vaccines that are being\n\nadministered, apart from being instrumental in further\n\nscientific studies around the pandemic. There is an imminent\n\nneed for collection of requisite data of adverse events and\n\nwider participation of people in reporting the adverse events\n\nis necessary for the purpose of gathering correct information.\n\nThus, the Union of India is directed to facilitate the reporting\n\nof suspected adverse events by individuals and private\n\ndoctors on a virtual platform and the reports so made shall\n\nbe publicly accessible after being given unique identification\n\nnumbers, without listing any personal or confidential data of\n\nthe persons reporting.          All necessary steps to create\n\nawareness of, and to navigate, this platform for self-reporting\n\nshall be effectuated by the Government, roping in and\n\ntraining relevant participants right from the ground level of\n\nvaccine administration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">IV. Vaccination of Children\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\">85. The opinion of the Petitioner is that children are at\n\nalmost no risk from COVID-19 and instances of previously\n\nhealthy children requiring hospitalisation due to COVID-19\n\nare exceedingly rare. While referring to articles in the Nature\n\n\n\n                                                            104 | P a g e\n\fand the Lancet, the Petitioner contended that scientific\n\nevidence shows that risk of administering vaccines to\n\nchildren outweigh the benefits offered by the vaccine in\n\nchildren.   The Petitioner further submitted that serological\n\nstudies would show that a large number of children have\n\nalready acquired antibodies to COVID-19. The Petitioner has\n\nhighlighted the risk of myocarditis associated with the mRNA\n\nvaccines, on the basis of which, several European countries\n\nhave recently stopped the use of Moderna vaccines for those\n\nunder the age of 30. He has also pointed out that these risks\n\nhad not been identified in the initial vaccine trials as the trial\n\nsize was too small to uncover rare risks, which were\n\ndiscovered after mass vaccination. The Petitioner has sought\n\nfor results as well as the primary data of clinical trials\n\nconducted on the paediatric population to be made public.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">86. In response thereto, the Union of India contended that\n\npaediatric vaccination is advised by global agencies such as\n\nthe WHO, the UNICEF and the CDC.         Expert opinion in India\n\nis in tune with global consensus in favour of vaccination of\n\nchildren.    We are informed that 8,91,39,455 doses of\n\nCOVAXIN have been administered to individuals in the age\n\ngroup of 15 to 18 years as on 12.03.2022.             The AEFIs\n\n\n\n\n                                                            105 | P a g e\n\freported are 1,739 minor complaints, 81 serious complaints\n\nand 6 severe. According to the Union of India, the said data\n\nwould show that the vaccine does not pose threat to the\n\nsafety of children.   As regards the clinical trials, para 2.4.6.2\n\nof the GCP guidelines were relied on to show that children\n\nare not required to be involved in research that could be\n\ncarried out equally well with adults and further that, for the\n\nclinical evaluation of a new drug, study in children should be\n\ncarried out after the Phase III clinical trials in adults. It has\n\nbeen stated that paediatric vaccination was considered at a\n\nstage where more than substantial data on safety and\n\nimmunogenicity of COVAXIN in adults was available. To avoid\n\nany risks, clinical trials were also conducted on a limited\n\nnumber of children as per the protocol approved by domain\n\nexperts.   Having found no serious adverse event in the said\n\ntrials, paediatric vaccination was initiated in a phased\n\nmanner, starting from the eldest paediatric age group of 15\n\nto   18    years.     On    12.05.2021,    on    the   basis    of\n\nrecommendations of the SEC, the CDSCO granted permission\n\nto Respondent No. 4 to conduct Phase II / Phase III clinical\n\ntrials of COVAXIN for the age group of 2 to 18 years.\n\nThereafter, Respondent No. 4 had submitted an application\n\nfor grant of permission to manufacture COVAXIN paediatric\n\n\n                                                            106 | P a g e\n\fvaccines   for   emergency use,    which   was   subsequently\n\ngranted by the CDSCO.     It was argued on behalf of the Union\n\nof India that expert opinion is to the effect that paediatric\n\nvaccinations are always preventive in nature and are\n\nadministered to avoid any risk of infection and of prolonged\n\nclinical symptoms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">87. This Court cannot sit in judgment of leading scientific\n\nanalysis relating to the safety of paediatric vaccination.\n\nExperts in science may themselves differ in their opinions\n\nwhile taking decisions on matters related to safety and allied\n\naspects, but that does not entitle the Court to second-guess\n\nexpert opinion, on the basis of which the Government has\n\ndrawn up its policies.    The decision taken by the Union of\n\nIndia to vaccinate paediatric population in this country is in\n\ntune with global scientific consensus and expert bodies like\n\nthe WHO, the UNICEF and the CDC have also advised\n\npaediatric vaccination.    It would not only be beyond our\n\njurisdiction but also hazardous if this Court were to examine\n\nthe accuracy of such expert opinion, based on competing\n\nmedical opinions.    As already stated, the scope of judicial\n\nreview does not entail the Court embarking upon such\n\nmisadventures.      Therefore, we reject the contention of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        107 | P a g e\n\fPetitioner that this Court has to intervene in paediatric\n\nvaccination on the ground that it is unscientific.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">88. With respect to results of clinical trials, we note that the\n\nUnion of India has stated that the results of clinical trials of\n\nCOVAXIN     for   paediatric   population   have   already   been\n\npublished. We also note that for the age group of 12 to 14\n\nyears, Biological E’s Corbevax is being administered. Keeping\n\nin line with the WHO Statement on Clinical Trials, the\n\nDeclaration of Helsinki and the GCP guidelines, we direct the\n\nUnion of India to ensure that key findings and results of the\n\nclinical trials of Corbevax be published at the earliest, if not\n\nalready done.     Neither vaccine is an mRNA vaccine and to\n\nthis extent, the apprehensions of the Petitioner with respect\n\nto the associated risks of mRNA vaccines are unfounded in\n\nthe present situation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">89.

However, this does not bar\n\n       the Court from scrutinising whether the policy in\n\n       question can be held to be beyond the pale of\n\n       unreasonableness and manifest arbitrariness and to be\n\n       in furtherance of the right to life of all persons, bearing\n\n       in mind the material on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_32\">(iii) With respect to the infringement of bodily integrity and\n\n       personal autonomy of an individual considered in the\n\n       light of vaccines and other public health measures\n\n       introduced to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are\n\n       of the opinion that bodily integrity is protected under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and no individual can be\n\n       forced to be vaccinated.

In light of this, restrictions on unvaccinated\n\n      individuals imposed through various vaccine mandates\n\n      by State Governments / Union Territories cannot be said\n\n      to be proportionate.      Till the infection rate remains low\n\n      and any new development or research finding emerges\n\n      which provides due justification to impose reasonable\n\n      and    proportionate      restrictions   on    the   rights   of\n\n      unvaccinated individuals, we suggest that all authorities\n\n      in this country, including private organisations and\n\n      educational institutions, review the relevant orders and\n\n      instructions   imposing      restrictions     on   unvaccinated\n\n      individuals in terms of access to public places, services\n\n      and resources, if not already recalled.
